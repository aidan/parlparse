However, if he made the comparison not with 1997 but with last year, would he not feel some concern that there is a drop-off, particularly in the key subjects of mathematics, ICT and modern languages? Does he accept that possibly some of his Government&#146;s policies&#151;surrounding teachers with bureaucracy, testing and naming and shaming&#151;have made teaching a less attractive career for young people today?</p>

However, I certainly do not accept any of the rest of what the noble Baroness said. Let us take mathematics. In 1997, the then Government filled 1,460 places for trainees in mathematics; last year, the figure was 2,000. That is thanks to all the changes that we have brought about, including significantly increased recruitment incentives and much higher pay, which is up by nearly one-fifth in real terms. As for what she said about burdens on teachers, real-terms education spending has nearly doubled under this Government since 1997. A significant proportion of that has gone into paying teachers better and ensuring that we have 40,000 more teachers. I do not think that the comparison with 1997 does any credit at all to the Conservative Party.</p>

Do the Government feel that they can respond to that?</p>

The recruitment for primary school teacher training places has risen from 11,790 in 1997 to 18,320 last year, which is an increase of 55 per cent. As the noble Lord rightly says, with the changes in the pupil cohort we will need more in due course. However, on the basis of our success in recruiting in recent years, I believe that we will be able to meet the additional numbers.</p>

Does he therefore consider that, particularly in primary schools, specialists are needed&#151;not only maths specialists, on which the Government have made an announcement today after their own report, but also specialists in science and reading&#151;to assist the generalist teachers so that they have the confidence to teach the subject well, not simply by using pre-prepared packages?</p>

As the noble Baroness rightly said, we have taken a significant step forward today by announcing that every primary school will either have, or have access to, a lead specialist in mathematics so that we can raise standards in that subject. We need to look at the implications for other subjects over time. That will not necessarily be by recruiting more dedicated specialist teachers, because of course most primary school teachers do a BEd and so have a more generalist training; it may well be by providing more incentives for professional development in particular disciplines so that we have a more specialist capacity in primary schools.</p>

As the noble Lord says, there are not enough male teachers, in primary schools in particular. When we last debated the issue in the House, the noble Baroness, Lady Bottomley, urged on me the virtues of all-male shortlists for primary school teachers. I did not think that we could accede to that, but we have recruitment campaigns targeted at getting more men to come forward for teacher training places, which seem to be yielding some dividends.</p>

Given reports of increasing difficulty in recruiting teachers with a suitable background, particularly at senior management level, is the Minister satisfied that there is adequate provision in our HE institutions

As such, trainees in RE qualify for the &#163;9,000 higher-level bursary and for a &#163;2,500 golden hello. We are putting significant resources behind the recruitment of more RE teachers. Although, as the right reverend Prelate says, we need more, the numbers have gone up. The number recruited into secondary training places increased from 640 in 1997 to 790 last year. The trend is in the right direction, but we fully accept that we need to do more to encourage good candidates to come forward.</p>

We have new support for trainees in the induction year before they reach qualified teacher status precisely to ensure, as the noble Lord says, that we have a lower wastage rate than in the past.</p>

How does that encourage able people?</p>

That figure of 638 compares with the figure of 1,610 in 1997, so there has been a huge reduction in the past 10 years. Our message to the schools is that, with the benefit of the &#163;400 million investment that we are making to support schools at the lower-attaining end of the spectrum, we believe that it is possible to eradicate that figure of 638 once and for all. That will make the education system much more attractive to potential teachers, as well as to parents and pupils.</p>

This is backed up by the World Bank and other international and UK think tank analysis. Recent price rises have significantly increased the cost of food, hurting the poorest most in urban and rural areas.

At the G8 summit in Japan next month, will the Government, in their attempts to co-ordinate an international response to this crisis, not look again at issues such as the reassessment of subsidies for biofuels, the distortion of trade policies, the bolstering of food production and emergency assistance to help the poorest farmers through this immediate crisis?</p>

They believe that they are making their biggest impact by encouraging the UN-World Bank taskforce, which is developing a comprehensive framework for action, in setting out how donors, agencies, developing countries&#146; governments and NGOs can work together to respond. Elements that they will consider include increasing humanitarian assistance, boosting small-farm production, reducing trade restrictions and export bans, addressing macroeconomic imbalances, improving monitoring and social protection, improving international markets, and developing a consensus on the use of biofuels.</p>

We recognise that genetically modified technology could contribute to world hunger, but that will not solve the problem on its own. Technologies, including genetic modification, have risks.

Certainly the price stimulus is helping to focus attention on barriers. The CAP modifications that will come about if the Doha round is successfully concluded will reduce barriers. It is strongly the view of Her Majesty&#146;s Government that that will contribute. In fact, food prices are starting to moderate. The Food and Agriculture Organisation expects next year to have a 3.8 per cent increase in cereal output. This news, together with some major removal of various protectionist decisions, has led to wheat being about $280 a tonne, down from $430 in March. Rice, which was $1,200 in May, is now less than $800, and the only crop that is staying stable is maize, at about $200 a tonne.</p>

It is going through the process and I shall be responding soon. We have a good tale to tell. We are firm but fair, and the number of people applying to get into the country is reduced to a quarter. We returned 63,000 people last year, 4,200 of whom came out of our prisons, including 20 killers, 200 sex offenders and 1,100 drug offenders. All were returned. This is a very good story and I am proud of it. Notwithstanding what some people might say, this is still a splendid country and masses of people want to get here, so we must have firm rules for returning people.</p>

We have learnt a lot of lessons there. It was going to be built as an accommodation centre&#151;the situation was different at that time. There were, understandably, a lot of local objections. There were issues over planning, and then the number of people trying to get into the country reduced dramatically, as I have mentioned. Yes, it was a badly run project; we have accepted that and we have accepted the PAC&#146;s report. We have learnt a great deal, and the new buildings that we are constructing have benefited from that.</p>

The average detention time for an illegal immigrant is 28 days. For a family it is normally less than 72 hours, because clearly we want to look at those cases carefully. For prisoners it is longer, because it is difficult to get them back to countries. Sometimes it takes up to six months, but we keep them for as short a time as possible. We review these things. Each person has a case officer. We work on a careful case-by-case basis. I am very proud of the efforts that we put in to make sure that people are handled in a firm but fair way.</p>

The situation is that the worst prisoners are kept in prison until they go, because they are seen as a great risk. The incident at Campsfield House at the weekend was remarkably well handled. A couple of people suffered from smoke inhalation and there was some damage to the education centre. However, apart from that, little damage was done. As a result, we are reviewing whether we should be harder on some other prisoners, some of them drug abusers. I agree that we have to be careful not to indirectly harm normal asylum seekers. We are trying to achieve this; I think that generally we do. We put those who are at the greatest risk in areas where they are not going to interact with normal asylum seekers.</p>

I take this opportunity to thank him for his obvious concern for Zimbabwe and, indeed, for his regular briefings. Mugabe has said that he would rather go to war than allow Morgan Tsvangirai to take office, so the future is likely to get even uglier. Does the Minister agree that now is the time for the UN to call some kind of summit of the leaders of neighbouring countries and donor nations, and possibly also of Commonwealth countries, to pre-empt a civil war in that country?</p>

We still hope that democracy will prevail on 27 June and that the likely very large lead that the Opposition enjoy in the polls will be enough to overcome whatever intimidation and violence is put their way. However, the noble Baroness is correct: we cannot count on that. We are therefore pressing heavily for not just the UN but the AU and SADC to be active. Just yesterday, the AU, which has often been criticised in this House for not being sufficiently forthcoming on Zimbabwe, put out a statement calling for free and fair elections and announced that it was sending 70 observers. Therefore, by the end of this week, we expect there to be 350 international observers in the country, with more arriving next week.</p>

He will return to New York and we are pressing for him to give a Security Council briefing in public so that his views of the situation will be disseminated as widely as possible. Secondly, as I pointed out, the AU is sending in a delegation and has backed it with a strong statement. It will be led by a former president, whose party stepped down in Sierra Leone after it lost an election, and therefore he knows, and can convey the reality of, that situation. Equally, we should understand that, even now, there are only just sufficient votes in the UN Security Council to ensure a debate on the issue. Several powerful countries are still resisting action in the council. We must press for it through all available means but not assume that we yet have a united international community on this point.</p>

However, on the other side, South African public opinion has been inflamed by reports of the violence coming out of Zimbabwe and the country has faced its own difficulties in relation to Zimbabwean immigrants. Increasingly, we are seeing politicians and civil society take the lead in South Africa in an attempt to block arms shipments, to protest against what is happening and possibly to send trade union and civil society observers directly to oversee the elections. Therefore, I think that the people of South Africa are on the right side.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08061778000067"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 1 stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Noakes. It is some time since the House has been asked to consider a Bill as complicated as this. I expect that the Minister has spent as many hours as have my noble friend and I getting to grips with exactly what it means and understanding what it says. By the size of the file in front of him, I feel confident in making that comment; I must say that my file is modest in comparison with his. Partly because of discussions in another place and partly because of their own volition, we already have a raft of government amendments even before your Lordships have had the opportunity to discuss the details of the Bill. It almost goes without saying that we would not have the first 86 clauses&#151;that is, Part 1 of this Bill&#151;if the Government had not decided that this was the year to enact the proposals of the Pension Commission of the noble Lord, Lord Turner, and we would not have had the Bill at all if the arrangements for stakeholder pensions had included an employer contribution and/or automatic enrolment by law. However, we are where we are and we on this side of the Chamber will make the best fist of it that it is possible to make. I therefore start with this amendment.</p>

I noticed the Minister glaring at me and I have taken note of what the Minister said to me at Second Reading. He said that the Bill had been drafted in this way because:</p>
<ul><a name="08061778000242"></a>&#147;The absolute cornerstone of the Bill is auto-enrolment, not only for personal tax, but for a whole range of provision&#148;. [<I>Official Report</I>, 3/6/08; col. 121.]</ul>
<a name="80617-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08061778000069"></a>None the less, I question whether we would have Part 1 at all if we were not to have personal accounts. We will not attempt to completely redraft the Bill&#151;that is way beyond the competence of the opposition party, even with the pensions experience, both in and out of government, of many of my noble friends. We have chosen to ask the Committee to agree that we should have a statement at the beginning of the Bill that encompasses what it is all about. In recent years this has almost invariably been stated in the Long Title. This Bill, however, has both the snappiest and the vaguest Long Title that I can recall of any Bill I can recall for years.</p>

<a name="80617-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08061778000070"></a>The Long Title, as your Lordships will see, merely says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08061778000228"></a>&#147;A Bill to make provision and for connecting purposes&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061778000217"></a>This is true as far as it goes, but can hardly be described as explicit. Noble Lords may remember an old song which contains the line:</p>
<ul><a name="08061778000243"></a>&#147;What's it all about, Alfie?&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061778000218"></a>Despite the blandishments of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis&#151;who I am glad to see is in her place&#151;during the passage of a previous Bill when I quoted from another song, I shall not sing it, either now or in private. Since there is nothing in the Long Title that gets to grips with the purposes of the Bill, a general statement of what it does is necessary. This amendment covers only the rationale of Part 1; that is, the first 86 clauses. The Committee may feel that purpose clauses should cover the whole of a Bill, but this is not so. The 2008 edition of the renowned <I>Bennion on Statutory Interpretation</I> tells us that a purpose clause is,</p>
<ul><a name="08061778000244"></a>&#147;An express statement of the legislative intention&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061778000219"></a>It goes on to say:</p>
<ul><a name="08061778000245"></a>&#147;It may apply to the whole or part of an Act&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80617-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08061778000071"></a>I am strongly suggesting that this new clause, Amendment No. 1, be included at the beginning of the Bill. The wording is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08061778000229"></a>&#147;The general objective of Part 1 of this Act is the wider availability of pensions saving opportunities and their take up by making provision for new or better ways of providing such, whilst proving for the efficient administration thereof&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80617-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08061778000072"></a>We have chosen these words carefully to cover, not only what is currently in Part 1 of the Bill, but what we would expect to see before it completes its passage and arrives on the statute book. The basic premise is that Part 1 of this Bill follows as closely as possible the scheme set out in the second report of the Pensions Commission, which believed, as I do, that it is necessary to:</p>
<ul><a name="08061778000246"></a>&#147;Overcome the barriers of inertia and high cost, which deter voluntary private pension provision.&#148;</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08061778000076"></a>As this is the first amendment, I want to say a word following the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, having pointed out how extremely complicated the Bill is. The more I looked through the amendments last night and thought about what we would say today, the more I thought that the Floor of the House was not the right place to hold this Committee stage. We on these Benches do not see why one party with 201 Peers out of 733&#151;28 per cent&#151;seems to have a complete veto on where Committee takes place. That same party has under 40 per cent of the non-government Peers. Operationally and practically, we would make better progress, have an interactive discussion with the Minister&#146;s officials&#151;they would be better able to deal with points as they arose&#151;and make better law quicker if Committee on the Bill, like that for some of its predecessors, had been held in Grand Committee.

In spite of what the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, said, perhaps we should look at the newspapers. One leading newspaper has a wonderful headline saying, today of all days: &#147;If the old refuse to die, let them work longer&#148;. I do not know whether that referred to our deliberations on the Bill, but one aspect of the article came to mind. Doubtless my noble friends will be able to cover it in considerable detail, and I suspect that even the Minister may be able to use his accountancy qualifications and experience on it. The article states that:</p>

The statistic gives some idea of the importance of the Bill, even though we take into consideration the wise words of my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale on the Front Bench. A massive task is in front of us, but we have to set about it. I am interested in and supportive of what my noble friend proposes in his amendment.</p>

For that reason I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, will not press it in its current form.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08061778000080"></a>Together, this Bill and last year&#146;s Pensions Act provide an integrated package of reforms that build on and carry forward the analysis and recommendations of the Pensions Committee. I place on record, again, our gratitude to the three Pensions Commissioners, the noble Lord, Lord Turner, Jeannie Drake and Professor John Hills for all that they have done to help us face up to the challenges, and legislate for solutions that are affordable and sustainable in the long term. Last year&#146;s Pensions Act provided a simpler, more generous and widely available state pension. It addressed and corrected the historical inequalities in women&#146;s state pension entitlement, provided for gradual increases in state pension age, and ensured sustainability in the long term. Taken together, these reforms set out a solid foundation upon which people can plan for retirement.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08061778000081"></a>This Bill, as the noble Lord recognised, makes changes primarily to the private pension system. As the amendment sets out, the Bill ensures wider availability of pension savings opportunities, but I suggest that it does more than this. In establishing a personal accounts scheme, it specifically targets a market that has been poorly served by existing pension providers. Those on low to moderate incomes will&#151;many for the first time&#151;have an opportunity to save for retirement in a simple, low-cost scheme. In encouraging people to take personal responsibility for their financial security in retirement, our policy on auto-enrolment will help individuals to overcome such barriers to saving as inertia. The Bill provides safeguards on auto-enrolment, such as the right to opt out, the definition of a jobholder, and enforcement and compliance provisions to ensure that the policy is not undermined. The core policy principle is to make inertia work to the benefit of individuals, not against them.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08061778000082"></a>Another key feature is to give people an incentive to save for their retirement, requiring the state, the employer and the individual to contribute towards pension savings. Finally, and importantly, in protecting and maintaining the existing market, we propose a number of measures that ensure that the personal accounts system stays focused on the unserved target market. These measures will minimise the burdens on employers in complying with the duty to register qualifying schemes and to contribute 3 per cent; roll back some of the regulatory burden on existing schemes to simplify their administration; and foster compliance by providers, employers and individuals in a light-touch but effective way.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08061778000083"></a>I acknowledge&#151;and we will surely debate&#151;the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, about levelling down, savings incentives, auto-enrolment, to which I have referred, and issues of low cost. The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, suggested that they would be better debated in Grand Committee than in this Chamber, which is a fair point. I would have preferred to debate them in Grand Committee, but the decision is not ours and we are happy to debate them wherever the powers that be determine.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08061778000084"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, specifically raised the issue of increasing longevity. One of the issues at the heart of Turner commission&#146;s report, on which this Bill and last year&#146;s Act are built, is the need to make sure that this is addressed and we have a system that is sustainable in the long term. I quote some statistics, which I have quoted once before. DWP statisticians have worked out that somebody alive today, aged 59, most likely a woman, will live to be 120. That means that next year, halfway through her life, she would get her state pension. That encapsulates the challenges of pension provision.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08061778000085"></a>We will debate the detail in the coming weeks, but the broad objectives of the package, which go further than the noble Lord&#146;s amendments, are built on lengthy discussions in Parliament, with interested external organisations and with the general public. The commitment and effort, shown on all sides in the other place, to raising awareness, deepening understanding and widening the circle of consensus is exemplary. It is a key consideration if we are to give people confidence and certainty for the long term. I applaud and warmly welcome that effort and commitment and I do not think we disagree about the general objectives of these reforms in terms of what they are or should be, but I do fear that the amendment is not an entirely full reflection of those objectives. On that basis, I would ask the noble Lord not to press it.</p>

I would call it more of a rudder for the whole Bill, putting it into context and giving it coherence. Surely the fact that not everything is in the objectives should not mean that we should not have any kind of statement on the front of the Bill. I believe that the expression is, &#147;The best is the enemy of the good&#148;, so I feel strongly that it should be there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08061778000092"></a>I am sorry that what I said has given rise to something that I tried desperately hard to avoid; namely, a Second Reading speech. I agree that the Minister was tempted by my noble friend Lord Lyell, who of course reminded us of why we are here and what last year&#146;s pensions Act and this Bill, taken together, are for. I am well aware that the danger inherent in purpose clauses, especially at the beginning of our proceedings, is that not all the amendments may be incorporated in a Bill; indeed, it is just possible that not all the clauses currently in the Bill will, as the Minister would like to have us believe, be incorporated. When we send it back to another place, they will all be encapsulated in it.</p>

The words in the amendment were not chosen at random; they are to be found in Section 1 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. If they were good enough for Treasury counsel then, they are certainly good enough for me now, and I hope the Committee will think so too. I wish to test the opinion of the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08061778000099"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group. The group of amendments is designed to clarify the coverage of the Bill in terms of the employer duty by removing unnecessary references to &#147;employee&#148;. In employment legislation, all employees are also workers. The term &#147;employee&#148; is a subset of &#147;worker&#148;. For the purposes of the Bill, it is not necessary to refer both to  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_928"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 928</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;employee&#148; and &#147;worker&#148;. The amendments therefore simply remove the unnecessary references to &#147;employee&#148; and insert other terms such as &#147;worker&#148; and related expressions. This simplification eases the burden on employers, as they will not have to consider whether an individual has been engaged as an employee or a worker before complying with the employer duty. It will also mean that the provisions are in broad alignment with employment legislation such as the working time regulations and the National Minimum Wage Act.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08061778000100"></a>By using &#147;worker&#148; and capturing agency workers in the coverage of these reforms, we are ensuring that parts of the employment market are not inappropriately favoured. It is important that such individuals who are not being served by the existing pensions market should have the opportunity to start or continue saving towards their retirement, with the benefit of a minimum employer contribution. I beg to move.</p>

As the Committee will know, one of my interests is drafting, so I have looked at these with particular care. The Minister need not look so shocked. When I first read the Bill, I noticed that it was littered with references to &#147;jobholder&#148;, &#147;employee&#148; and &#147;worker&#148;. I found in Clause 1, for example, that I simply could not distinguish between &#147;employee&#148; and &#147;worker&#148;. I am glad that, on reflection, the draftsman could not either. There are still references to &#147;employee&#148; in Clause 55, but no longer to &#147;worker&#148; in Clause 77. And what about Clauses 78 to 85?</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08061778000102"></a>Rather than make a meal of it and put down endless amendments, I ask the Minister to have the rest of the Bill looked at again, now that a &#147;jobholder&#148; is purely a worker for the purposes of Part 1, to see if other simplifications can be made elsewhere to tidy up any confusion that may remain.</p>

I have received a briefing from the TUC, which is also very supportive of this. It believes that otherwise some unscrupulous employers might try to avoid having a contract of employment with their staff so that their workers would enjoy fewer rights and less security. I am pleased that the amendment, by emphasising the title &#147;Jobholders&#148;, will restrict that from happening. I think it was at Second Reading that we introduced the further point that agency workers will not be debarred from belonging to schemes under the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="08061778000110"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 43 and 122. These are probing amendments designed to ascertain the Government&#146;s position in relation to non-executive directors. I declare an interest as a non-executive director in what passes for my spare time.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="08061778000111"></a>I know that the Minister is aware that it is not normal practice for non-executive directors to take part in any pension schemes that are available for staff and for executive directors. Nor do they receive any uplift to their remuneration to reflect the non-availability of pension benefits. For the vast majority of non-executive directors, what you see in terms of directors fees is what you get, there being no hidden extras.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="08061778000112"></a>The same is very largely true for chairmen, who are generally also non-executive. Pension benefits are not a normal part of the remuneration of non-executive chairmen. It is not unknown for chairmen to be executive or semi-executive, especially in the non-listed space and to be paid accordingly, but for non-executive chairmen, pension accrual is unusual.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08061778000113"></a>The position, as I understand it, is almost exactly the same in the public sector. We discussed these issues during the passage of the previous Pensions Bill, now the Pensions Act 2007, when we debated the creation of the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority. The Minister will recall that some very odd provisions about pensions for non-executives were in the Bill, but he accepted that they were out of line with policy guidance and produced government amendments to put the position back to where it should have been; namely, that the non-executives did not get pensions.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08061778000114"></a>In this group of amendments, I have offered two possible ways of excluding non-executives from auto-enrolment. The first, in Amendment No. 4, would remove non-executive directors from the definition of a &#147;jobholder&#148; by adding another paragraph to Clause 1. The second way, in Amendment No. 43, would remove non-executive fees from the definition of &#147;qualifying earnings&#148; in Clause 12 by adding a new subsection after subsection (3). To support either or both of those amendments, Amendment No. 122 would add to the definitions in Clause 86 that of &#147;non-executive director&#148;. The Minister will note that this covers both companies and other corporate bodies and hence should deal with the quangos that litter the public sector.</p>

<a name="80617-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08061778000115"></a>This definition may not catch absolutely everyone in the public sector&#151;I am thinking about, for example, the various non-executive members of departmental boards. The status of those individuals is somewhat ambiguous. They are not boards of a corporate body but pretend boards, aping what happens in corporate life or quangos. When we considered the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Bill in 2005, we raised this  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_930"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 930</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>point in Grand Committee in connection with the non-executives on that board. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, then the Attorney-General, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08061778000234"></a>&#147;In line with the recommended practice for central government departments, the non-executive directors of the predecessor departments&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="08061778000223"></a>The two non-executives on the board of the Treasury, for example, are not employees, but I assume that they are &#147;jobholders&#148; within the Bill. How do government departments intend to treat their non-executive directors under the Bill?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80617-0004.htm"/>


<a name="80617-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08061778000116"></a>I return to my main theme. It is quite simply not market practice in either the public or private sectors for non-executives to be treated as receiving pensionable earnings. But without amendment, the Bill would change that practice. It would not be legal for companies or the public sector to advertise for non-executives on a basis which excluded pensions, so the Bill really will change the practice. Do the Government really need to do this?</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08061778000117"></a>I am sure companies do not want to enrol their non-executives. Most, though I concede not all, non-executives do not expect or want to accrue pension rights in respect of those positions, and it is very clear that non-executives are certainly not in the target group at whom this Bill is aimed.</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08061778000118"></a>The Minister may well say that it is up to the non-executive to opt out but they may not do so, whether by accident or design. Indeed, signing on as a non-executive does not involve turning up to the personnel department and getting lots of bits of paper to sign. Business life at board level is just not like that.</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08061778000119"></a>I hope therefore that the Minister will agree that we need to find a way of reflecting the fact that this group of employees, jobholders or whatever, as non-executives should not be dragged into auto-enrolment and all that that entails. I beg to move.</p>

Almost by definition, non-executives are in office for only a few years. It would be quite messy, from the point of view of personal accounts, to include them. If we think of high-profile boards non-executives have recently been on&#151;for example, Northern Rock&#151;we realise that the last thing we would want would be that they should accrue pension rights. Indeed, it would not be normal practice. This seem, therefore, to be a perfectly sensible amendment and I do not see why personal accounts should make a major change in established practice. As the noble Baroness said, non-executive directors are not part of the target market.</p>

This group of amendments seeks to exclude non-executive directors from the scope of these reforms.

Instead, non-executive directors are appointed as office-holders and therefore fall outside the scope of these reforms. Office-holders are excluded unless specific provision is made to include them. We have no plans to take such steps for the purpose of these reforms. Amendment No. 43 would exclude non-executive directors&#146; fees from qualifying earnings. This is similarly not required as such fees would not fall within the scope of these reforms.</p>

The reason why I tabled it in the first place had nothing to do with the Minister&#146;s Amendment No. 6, although it is grouped with it; it is purely and simply a probing amendment to explore the burdens that auto-enrolment will place on employers.</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08061778000137"></a>As I understand it, Clause 2(1) prevents the employer of a worker in a qualifying scheme from taking any action to dissuade him to leave the scheme while he remains in that employment, presumably with or without the employee&#146;s approval. That is all well and good; I have no trouble with that at all.</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08061778000138"></a>My amendment would remove the words, &#147;or make any omission&#148;, for two reasons. The first is to ask the Minister to give us an example of the sort of omission that the Government are thinking of. I know that there is a small reference in the notes on clauses, but I do not think that it is as complete as the Minister could make it, if he wished to.</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08061778000139"></a>The second reason is to highlight the additional work that auto-enrolment will inevitably place on the shoulders of employers. I have no doubt that large employers, with their HR departments, will not have too much difficulty with those extra burdens, but what about small and medium-sized enterprises? Have the Government made any estimate of the number of these that are likely to have schemes that will qualify? What demands does the Minister expect to be placed on them? How much paperwork and other administrative burdens will those employers have to deal with? Does he really believe that, even though it will be illegal for them not to make any act or omission, some will not try it on?</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08061778000140"></a>In my research this morning, I came across an article that was prompted by the National Association of Pension Funds, which suggested that many thousands of pounds might be necessary to alter the schemes to make them qualify. Both my noble friend and I will bring up that point on later amendments, but for now will the Minister provide answers to my questions? I beg to move.</p>

Breaches of the duty may, where necessary, result in the Pensions Regulator taking enforcement action in the form of compliance and penalty notices.</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08061778000143"></a>Government Amendment No. 6 extends this prohibition to actions, or failed actions, of the employer that would result in a jobholder scheme losing its status as a qualifying scheme. This will provide additional security for the jobholders and help to ensure that continuity of good-quality pension saving is protected. For example, some employers like to be able to retain an ability to control their costs, by varying either contribution rates or the definition of pay on which contributions are calculated. Such employers who offer money purchase arrangements could use that ability to reduce the amount that they are otherwise required to contribute to meet the duty, thereby subverting the duty without terminating active membership.</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08061778000144"></a>Opposition Amendment No. 5 would remove the element of the clause relating to employer omissions. We are clear that it is inappropriate to allow employers to benefit by failing to do what they are required to do, either deliberately or accidentally. Employers should be held responsible if they terminate scheme membership, even if that is by accident. Some pension providers may require an employer to keep their employee details up to date. We do not want a failure by an employer to provide such details to result in the termination of the active membership for any of their jobholders. This amendment, however, would undermine the duty on employers to maintain active membership of a scheme and could increase the number of jobholders who come out of pension saving without having made the decision themselves. That would undermine the central objective of these reforms.</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08061778000145"></a>The Government recognise that some employers voluntarily pay higher contributions or offer schemes with high benefits significantly above the default. We recognise that, in the longer term, this is to the advantage of their workers and we want to support these employers to continue to do this. Clause 4 therefore enables an employer offering higher-quality pension provision under the employer duty to be able to defer automatic enrolment for any or all of their jobholders for a limited period, the details of which will be set out in regulations&#151;for example, the length of the period.</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08061778000146"></a>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 ensure that an employer who takes advantage of the facility to defer automatic enrolment must guarantee membership of the higher-quality scheme for a minimum period. If an employer is unable to maintain membership of the higher-quality scheme, through no fault of their own or of jobholders, regulations made under a new clause to be introduced by Amendment No. 21 will require the re-enrolment of a jobholder into alternative higher-quality provision within a set timeframe. Therefore, I urge the noble Lord either to withdraw Amendment No. 5 or ask for it to be rejected.</p>

We are not at a stage to be precise about what the process will be and quite how it will proceed. We will be looking in part to PADA and its work to advise and help us to develop these arrangements. However, the noble Lord makes a good point: we need to ensure that we do not impose undue burdens on employers by this process. There is no reason to assume that the process necessarily would, but those details have yet to be worked out and the matter will be developed in the coming months. We are absolutely convinced on the essence of the Bill, which is that auto-enrolment is the route by which we deal with the current inertia whereby so many people are prevented from saving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08061778000157"></a>We have been debating the main thrust of Clause 2, which is to ensure that employers do not force jobholders out of qualifying schemes. A number of exemptions in the clause appear to cover cases where a jobholder becomes an active member of another qualifying scheme or asks the employer to remove him from the scheme. However, the clause does not appear to cover the situation in which an employer reorganises his pension arrangements and the jobholder, when offered the opportunity to join another qualifying scheme, decides to opt out of membership. Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply, because the jobholder is not remaining or becoming an active member. Subsection (4) does not apply, because the jobholder has not requested the employer to do anything or to omit to do anything in relation to the existing scheme. The jobholder simply declines to sign up to the new successor scheme. Why should this result in the employer getting into trouble with the Pensions Regulator and bringing himself within the enforcement provisions of the Bill? I beg to move.</p>

After jobholders have been enrolled, they have a right to remain in qualifying workplace pension saving. Clause 2 is designed to protect this right by prohibiting employers from acting or failing to act in any way that results in the loss of active membership for a jobholder. The compliance regime in Chapter 2 will apply in respect of the employer duty in Clause 2. However, employers will not be in breach of Clause 2 if they make arrangements for the jobholder to become an active member of another qualifying scheme within a prescribed period.</p>

<a name="80617-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08061778000160"></a>The thrust of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would allow employers simply to offer membership of another scheme rather than enrol jobholders into one. If a jobholder declined membership of the replacement scheme, the employer would still be considered to have met the duty. That would undermine the core principle that jobholders have a right to participate in workplace pension saving without interference, unless they make the choice that they want to opt out or terminate membership later. Under this amendment, if a scheme closed, the jobholder could be forced to make a decision on whether to continue saving and might suffer detriment simply because they had not had access to the wider information associated with any decision to opt out under Clause 7, which provides a process for opting out. There is nothing to prevent a jobholder who wishes to terminate their membership of a scheme from doing so. However, we want any such choice to be free and informed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08061778000163"></a>Let us take this case. The Minister is saying that if, for perfectly good reasons, the employer decides to shut one scheme and start another, he must positively enrol all employees even if one says, &#147;I have done pension saving. I am now 55 and don&#146;t want to save&#148;. Does the employer have to enrol that employee, who then has to opt out? Is the Minister really saying this because of the shadowy fear that there might be the odd unscrupulous employer who could not be caught by some other compliance mechanism?</p>

Quite when that is is the subject of a later amendment. However, from the age of 16 to the day before his 22nd birthday, the employee can self-enrol in personal accounts or in his employer&#146;s pension scheme, as long as the employer is permitted&#151;&#147;qualified&#148; is the technical word&#151;although he does not have to. In that situation&#151;in other words, before the employee&#146;s 22nd birthday&#151;the employer has the option to contribute under personal accounts. It is also an option, presumably, under personal and occupational pensions&#151;it depends how the scheme is set up.</p>

<a name="80617-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08061778000171"></a>I tabled Amendment No. 7 to explore what will happen when a young person who is already enrolled in a scheme hits the lower age limit of 22 and becomes eligible for auto-enrolment. It is not simple, but it seems to me that, if we are talking about personal accounts, that is the trigger for the employer to contribute, if he has not already been doing so. If we are talking about occupational or personal pensions, it is a different matter. The employee is already in the scheme and suddenly gets a notice saying, &#147;You need to auto-enrol&#148;. Is that a sensible way of proceeding? I do not understand. In particular, I am interested in how auto-enrolment will be handled if, as I said, the young person is already participating in a qualifying pension scheme.</p>

<a name="80617-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08061778000172"></a>We have listened over the past few weeks to numerous contributions from various outside bodies that offer high-quality pensions to their employees, many of whom are under 22 years old. I refer to one in particular. Tesco sponsors a pension involving auto-enrolment from the age of 21 and fully intends to make the necessary tweaks for it to qualify. It already targets literature explaining the advantages of its pension scheme at its younger employees, and has several members younger even than 21. How will the auto-enrolment plans that the Minister has described as being at the heart of the Bill work in this situation? I beg to move.</p>

<a name="08061778000173"></a><a name="80617-0005.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80617-0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08061778000636"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I support the amendment and only wish that the noble Lord had gone further. I would like to see personal accounts, as structured for those over 22 and with auto-enrolment, being available for people at the age of 16. Let me explain why. I read the House of Commons debates and, as far as I could see, the Government&#146;s main concern, which I can understand, is that there is a lot of job movement at that age; therefore there is a significant hassle factor and it is possibly not worth doing. I am not sure that I accept that, because the whole point of personal accounts is to produce the pot that you take with you. Therefore, after the initial hassle of setting it up, you should be able to port it with you.</p>

<a name="80617-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08061778000174"></a>There are two, possibly three arguments that I ask my noble friend to consider. I understand that you can voluntarily enrol but I should like to go beyond that. The first point is to instil as early as possible the habit of saving. If you are in a job at the age of 18 or 21 and are not contributing to a pension, and then suddenly at the age of 22 auto-enrolment arises and you experience a drop in income, there may well be an increased psychological willingness to opt out. However, if the  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_938"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 938</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>habit of saving has been instilled in you and you pay your pension contribution along with your tax and national insurance from the first day that you are in work, and you are above the LEL, the sums involved will be quite modest. Often, they will be only &#163;3 or &#163;5 a week for the employer or the employee on, say, half-median earnings. We are talking about quite modest sums, but the habit of saving will be in place and there will be less risk of dropping out from the option of auto-enrolment at the age of 22.</p>

<a name="80617-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08061778000175"></a>The second point is that it really is worth making those contributions. I am not confident about my statistics, as I have been trying to work them out myself, and I defer to PENSIP or any other model. For example, you would normally save on half-median earnings&#151;which for a woman is about &#163;11,000 a year&#151;for 30 years in a personal account. However, I calculate that if you started six years before that, you would add 50 per cent to your total pot or possibly more because you would have started at a young age and would have a much longer investment return. That is particularly salient for women because their peak earning age is 29, as opposed to 42 for men, because they are most likely to earn before they have children. When they have children, half of them stop contributing to a pension. Therefore, for young women, in particular, who may be training to become a hairdresser, for example, it is key that we increase the number of years in which they are likely to contribute to a pension before they settle with a family, which almost always adversely affects their pension contributions.</p>

<a name="80617-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08061778000176"></a>For those reasons, I am not sure that the hassle factor is a substantial argument. It is desirable to inculcate the habit of saving, rather than risk people failing to auto-enrol at the age of 22 because they are not used to making payments. That is the case, above all, because those six years of early return can increase the value of a 30-year pot by something like 50 per cent. That is particularly important for low-paid women who may be part-time workers. I hope that my noble friend will reconsider this matter, and I shall be bringing forward something similar in a later amendment. Obviously, the scheme is discretionary and a young person can contribute if they wish, but what I should like to see is that where that young person &#147;does&#148;, the employer &#147;must&#148;. In that way, the scheme would be made worth while.</p>

<a name="80617-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08061778000177"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, will accept a wider interpretation than he may have originally intended with his amendment. I also hope that my noble friend can take this matter away and think again about the outcome that we want, which is to ensure that low-paid people who work part time&#151;women in particular&#151;retire with the best possible pension. We should do everything we can to ensure that they start paying in as early as possible and as easily and continuously as possible, and this amendment could be a means of achieving that.</p>

However, the amendment seeks to remove the lower age limit to allow jobholders to be automatically enrolled between the ages of 16 and 22. That would undo the balance that we have struck between maximising saving through automatic enrolment and minimising employer burdens by limiting automatic enrolment to between the age of 22 and state pension age. In addition, requiring employers automatically to enrol jobholders aged between 16 and 22 would increase the burden on them.</p>

<a name="80617-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08061778000180"></a>We believe that selecting the age of 22 strikes the right balance between the age when job tenure becomes more stable and encouraging workers to start workplace pension saving at an early age. Starting automatic enrolment at age 22 will also minimise costs associated with frequent job turnover among the young, especially students, which might reduce the incentive to hire younger workers.</p>

<a name="80617-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08061778000181"></a>As has been recognised, we are not excluding young people from saving in a workplace pension as jobholders between the age of 16 and 75, because they can opt in to workplace pension saving and receive an employer contribution. I think that both my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, assumed that there would be no automatic employer contribution if a 16 year-old opted in.</p>

Does he have any statistics to help us further? Although one&#146;s instinct is obviously that job turnover is much higher and that there would be a lot of administrative cost from including later teenagers and 20 and 21 year-olds&#151;one is conscious of the administrative cost for employers and possible extra costs for the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority of having a lot of small and very mobile accounts&#151;that would help us decide. The point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, about instilling the savings habit is valid, although I think her figures are a little optimistic when it comes to how much difference it makes. I should not have thought that 16, 17 and 18 year-olds are earning anything like as much as average female earnings. Even accepting her point that female earnings peak earlier than those of men, I should not have thought that we were talking about very large amounts of money. I would be interested to hear further statistics on job turnover in that group.</p>

I am not sure that they cover precisely what the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, wanted. If we assume that those aged 16 to 21 opt out at the same rate as 22 to 24 year olds, there would be a &#163;77 million or 10 per cent increase in employer contribution costs. Removing the lower age threshold of 22 would increase the number of people eligible for automatic enrolment by some 2 million&#151;assuming working age starts at 16&#151;notwithstanding plans to encourage people to stay in education or training. This group of 2 million young people earn, on average, less than half as much as those aged 22-plus. One of the ramifications of that would be that if the group do not opt out, this amendment is likely to lead to many more small pots which are expensive to administer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08061778000191"></a>We have had an interesting discussion of this issue and we certainly want to have another look at it. To confirm what I said earlier, in terms of someone who is aged 16 or 17 or under 22 opting in, Clause 1 defines a jobholder and all jobholders are entitled to an employer contribution on their qualifying earnings. If they do not have qualifying earnings, they would not get an employer contribution. If they opt in, whether they are above state pension age or between 16 and 22, they would get an employer contribution on their qualifying earnings.</p>

It would be extremely helpful if the noble Lord could point to where in the Bill it says that if a youngster&#151;in other words, someone between the ages of 16 and 22&#151;is enrolled in a personal account, the employer is duty-bound to contribute at personal account rates. While the Minister was speaking I was trying to have a quick gander at the beginning of the Bill but failed to find any reference one way or the other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08061778000193"></a>I do not understand how the amendment works for 16 to 22 year-olds, whether or not they are enrolled in a personal account, or indeed any other sort of pension scheme. I am not sure that it is right to pursue it just at this moment, unless the Minister has extra information that he can give us. I should be most grateful for one of his very explicit letters in due course, if he feels like writing one, as I am sure will the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on this occasion.</p>

On the issue of the employer contribution, you have to go right to the start of the Bill, to Clause 1(1), which defines a jobholder as an employee&#151;or now, a worker&#151;who works or ordinarily works in Great Britain and who is aged at least 16 and under 75. That is the key to the employer contribution. You then have to look at Clause 6(3). If people are active members of an automatic enrolment scheme, then you get the requirements for the employer contribution for that scheme if it is going to be an automatic enrolment scheme to satisfy the quality tests and the qualifying scheme test. That is the route into it for someone aged between 16 and 75. It is different for someone who does not have qualifying earnings. Someone who does not have qualifying earnings is not, within that definition, a jobholder.</p>

<a name="80617-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08061778000195"></a>I shall have one more go about how it works for someone who opts to be enrolled under the age of 22 and then becomes 22. He or she is enrolled in a qualifying scheme and therefore when it comes to issues of automatic enrolment the employer is relieved of the obligation to take further action by Clause 3(3). Subsection (2) is the provision that makes the employer undertake prescribed arrangements by which the jobholder becomes an active member, because subsection (2) does not apply if the jobholder was an active member of a qualifying scheme on the automatic enrolment date. Therefore, there is no need to do anything if they are already in the scheme. I hope that has clarified matters. However, if it has not, I am very happy to write to the noble Lord to make sure that it is very clearly understood.</p>

I find &#147;pensionable age&#148; rather confusing, which is hardly surprising as the Explanatory Notes on the clause talk about &#147;state pension age&#148; as the upper automatic enrolment age limit. By referring merely to pension age, the Bill could mean that it is still talking about any auto-enrolment scheme, which could include permitted schemes that have a retirement age lower

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08061778000210"></a>There is an even more fundamental question. We will discuss the parameters of qualifying schemes when we come to Clause 15, but I should be grateful if the Minister could answer the question now. Could a scheme that allowed a jobholder to start drawing his pension at an age below state pension age qualify for auto-enrolment? This is important. I should also like to know whether someone drawing a pension from a previous place of work, which allowed early retirement, and subsequently working somewhere else until state pension age, is eligible for auto-enrolment. I suspect that he is still eligible, but starts the whole process again with his new employer. I find the drafting of Clause 3 confusing. I hope the Minister will be able to set my mind at rest.

At the same time, there may be types of work where it is desirable that people do not have to work to state pension age before they get their pension. It depends on the kind of employment.

I had assumed&#151;this may be an error on my part&#151;that a qualifying scheme would, nonetheless, not be disqualified by virtue of the fact that one could retire earlier than state pension age. If I am wrong in that assumption, what then happens to the tax-free lump sum, which at the moment one can draw aged 50? It is going up to 55 in 2010. If the noble Lord&#146;s fears are valid&#151;which I hope they are not&#151;does that suggest that different rules must therefore apply to the tax-free lump sum and when one may draw it?</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="08061778000241"></a>&#147;&#145;pensionable age&#146; has the meaning given by the rules in paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 to the Pensions Act 1995&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061778000214"></a>I know that that is familiar to the noble Lord. It links the state pension age and makes the proposed amendment unnecessary. It also picks up on the point made by my noble friend, because the definition includes the equalisation of women&#146;s state pension age when it increases from 60 to 65 between 2010 and 2020. It covers the subsequent increases introduced by the Pensions Act 2007&#151;for both men and women&#151;from 65 to 68 between 2024 and 2046. It locks into that definition.</p>

The noble Lord also asked whether, when someone is already drawing a pension from a scheme, there would be a requirement to auto-enrol. To avoid the auto-enrolment requirement, a person would have to be an active member of a qualifying scheme. If they were not, the auto-enrolment procedures would apply. It might be that the decision would be to opt out, but it applies only if someone is not an active member of a qualifying scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08061778000216"></a>I hope that that deals with the point.

However, I think he would agree that the answer to his noble friend Lady Turner of Camden is that when the phrase &#147;state pension age&#148; is mentioned, it means the state pension age at the time and therefore so far as women are concerned, it is rising to 65, while in due course everyone will go up to 68. In the previous Pensions Bill, we tried to make this open-ended, but the Government were adamant that enough was enough for the time being, in other words up to 2050. Governments have a reputation, sometimes deserved and sometimes not, for short-termism, but I do not think that this decision fits into that category.</p>

The Minister, using the broadest of brushes, said that individuals who are auto-enrolled would need accurate information, but will not &#147;routinely need extensive advice&#148; because of the employer contribution. This amendment is not designed for the majority of employees who will be auto-enrolled, but for those aged 50 and over for whom auto-enrolment might not be suitable because of the interactions with means-tested benefits. The amendment calls for the sort of advice that could be provided by CABs. Interestingly, Citizens Advice is

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08061788000007"></a>I gather from the Minister&#146;s office that the Government&#146;s proposals on a national money guidance service, which he mentioned in his winding-up speech at Second Reading, are due to be published in a month or two, presumably based on the Thoresen review. I would be glad to hear whether they are likely to give us any comfort. The Pensions Policy Institute, whose research is invaluable, does not appear to agree with the Government that advice is not necessary. Its analysis of auto-enrolment implies that,</p>
<ul><a name="08061788000195"></a>&#147;people will need very clear information and generic advice to help them make informed decisions about whether they should stay in or opt out of personal accounts&#148;.</ul>

I welcome the amendment. Whether its precise wording will finally be reflected in legislation is a different matter, but it is right that the noble Baroness should raise the issue of advice early in the Committee stage.</p>

<a name="80617-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08061788000010"></a>Why? We all accept that conventional DC schemes carry a much greater risk for the employee than DB schemes in regard to investment returns, longevity and life styling, disinvestment returns, annuity rates&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, has been campaigning about open markets and so on&#151;inflation, assessment of household needs and, of course, over and beyond the investment and disinvestment risks, there is no PPF. All of this risk is laid on the employee. So it is not surprising that currently a great deal of interesting discussion is going on about hybrids, risk-sharing, career average and the later amendments on conditional indexation being run by the actuaries.</p>

<a name="80617-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08061788000011"></a>But if the conventional occupational pension DC schemes are riskier than DB&#151;which they are by far&#151;personal accounts might be riskier still than the conventional DC scheme. There are a number of reasons for this. First, with personal accounts you are dealing with people with very low incomes. For those people&#151; mostly women&#151;the opportunity cost of saving is very high and issues of debt or divorce can devastate financial situations. Secondly, personal accounts are much more likely to deal with small pots because they will be used by low earners, often part time, and of course&#151;an  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_946"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 946</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issue to which I shall return&#151;the first &#163;5,000 of income is exempt. This may mean that half of a median earning is not even covered by a pension contribution, leaving a small pot with all the risks, as the noble Baroness highlighted, of interaction with income-related benefits.</p>

<a name="80617-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08061788000012"></a>Thirdly&#151;this should be said in capital letters&#151;there is the question of the small contribution of employers, at the de minimis level, to a personal account. The employee will pay in as much as in a conventional DC account at around 4 per cent; the employer, however, will pay in only half, at 3 per cent, compared to the DC average at the moment of 6.8 per cent, and even then, for someone on half-median earnings, on only half the income. So the employer will be contributing nearly 7 per cent on average into a DC pot on all earnings, as compared to an average of 3 per cent on only half earnings into a personal account. So the employee is taking all the risks, as in a DC scheme, but with very little of the financial cushion offered within existing DC schemes of virtually a two-to-one match by the employer of the employee&#146;s contribution, thus making the pay-to-save worth while. That equation is very much altered in personal accounts.</p>

<a name="80617-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08061788000013"></a>So we will see women workers, especially older women, who are not sure whether they should opt out; and we may see, I fear, as with the reduced married woman&#146;s stamp in the past, more unscrupulous employers encouraging them to opt out. It is interesting that TPAS, the organisation in which I have declared an interest, was running a helpline earlier in the year for women seeking information about their pensions. Of its first 9,000 calls, 95 per cent were from women over 45. Over half wanted to buy extra contributions on the spot&#151;a point to which I shall return&#151;but their lack of knowledge about the basic state pension more than vindicated the noble Baroness&#146;s concern about this.</p>

<a name="80617-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08061788000014"></a>I fear we may also see the media hyping up the risk that women should be encouraged to opt out along the lines of Mr Cazalet&#146;s remarks in the <I>FT</I> a few days ago, which asserted that for very many women it was better to keep their money in a teapot. That seems to me deeply implausible but as his report costs &#163;1,600 a time, it was clearly not designed to be available to the women he claimed he was seeking to help or influence.</p>

<a name="80617-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08061788000015"></a>Why do we need this amendment or a version of it? The noble Baroness rightly identified fears that older women will opt in when perhaps they would be well advised, if they had that tailored advice, to opt out. I have the opposite fear that they will opt out when they should not. The latest longitudinal research on ageing by the DWP, that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and I were privileged to hear recently, shows that even for low-paid older women it can be, and usually is, worth saving. The DWP&#146;s own slides gave the example of a woman of 54 on half median earnings. For a contribution of perhaps &#163;5 a week she could get, even with a very brief contribution record, a pot for trivial commutation of over &#163;5,000, and might therefore have a little capital on which to retire. I emphasise the words &#147;could&#148; and &#147;might&#148; rather than &#147;will&#148;. Both for those who may opt in when they should opt out and for those who may opt out when they should be opting in, because the trivial commutation pot is

They may also need advice at the disinvestment end that the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, highlighted.</p>

<a name="80617-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="08061788000016"></a>We cannot build out all the risks. We cannot necessarily foresee for individuals&#146; earnings, health and caring responsibilities. Who knows whether the benefits system 15 years down the line in terms of pension credits will remain as it currently is? But we know where the problems may occur for older people, particularly those who may be claiming housing benefit in retirement. For some, it might be right to opt out; for others, it may be sensible to hang on. However, the latest DWP research shows and the TPAS helpline suggest that people are in a very poor position to be able to make that judgment for themselves. Information may be enough for most, but it will not be enough for some. One at-risk group is older women and the Government must do more to ensure that they get the advice they need.</p>

There is a much broader debate to be had about generic advice and the Thoresen report, and the consultation and work that has been done will inform that process later in the year, but what is so attractive about this amendment is that it is saying that there are groups of people who are very clearly at risk. The two main policy levers and drivers behind this reform are getting auto-enrolment and the contingent employer contribution behind that. Auto-enrolment must succeed for this policy to make progress in the longer term. The Government sensibly are already indicating that come 2017 the whole thing can be looked at again and some in-flight adjustments can be made, and I welcome that. But there are at-risk groups which are identifiable right now. For people over 50 who are in social rented housing and on a low income, all the odds stack up. This group is easily identifiable from departmental records. We know where they live and we know the risks are likely to be greater. If they go inadvertently into auto-enrolment without thinking about it carefully, they could pop up in 2017 as a group whom we have collectively failed. It is not for the want of knowing in advance that they comprise a group that can be collectively failed. It would not be good for the continuation of a policy that, it is hoped, has a lifespan of 50 years or more, in order to address some of the points that the Turner commission drew to our attention as policymakers. It is not in our or anyone else&#146;s interests, be that a future Government or whoever, for the policy to fail. This is an understandable, measurable and identifiable group of people. We may hear from the Government that, &#147;Face to face for everyone is too big a task&#148;, which I understand, but they cannot argue that in terms of the specific group of people who are identified in this amendment. Like the noble Baroness who has just spoken, I think the wording may not be perfect, but my noble friend has identified an important issue.</p>

<a name="80617-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08061788000019"></a>The Thoresen work, as deployed and advised by the work that is being done by the FSA, is very good. A perfect model is available to the Government in the form of the positive and constructive bits of Thoresen, along with the valuable work done by the FSA under my old friend Mr Chris Pond, who has had a distinguished track record over all these areas over many years. His work demonstrates to me&#151;I have talked to him at some length&#151;that the FSA is willing to play a major part in dealing with some of these issues and is capable of doing so.</p>

<a name="80617-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08061788000020"></a>The FSA is also working with Citizens Advice. My noble friend is right to refer to that, because that body would be perfectly willing to take on contracts. It works in these areas and gives detailed advice on financial and other matters, which demonstrates that it has the skills, background and ability to deliver the policy.</p>

<a name="80617-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08061788000021"></a>The department must know the overall figures that we are dealing with for the 50 year-old age group. That group will not be a huge number out of the 7 million target audience. If we identify them, with the advice available to the Government that I have just described, then the work that Chris Pond and the FSA are doing around Thoresen, combined with the capabilities that are clearly available in the 430 citizens advice bureaux and the 16,000 volunteers who are available to us, is unquestionably something that policy-makers in this House at this stage should be asking the Government actively to consider. It should not be for everyone; let us start with this group. Let us identify them, give them all face-to-face interviews if they need them and see what we can do for them. I am sure that that would have a beneficial impact on the whole of this reform and at least enable us to say in 2017, &#147;Well, we did what we could and we gave the best advice possible&#148;. If the result in 2017 is failure, it will not be for the want of trying.</p>

It is essential that we get the right advice and help to this vulnerable group of people. After all, the whole initiative is designed to get the low-income and medium-income people, who are in most need of advice and help, to save for an adequate pension. We have identified the groups that need this sort of advice. I particularly support what the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, has just said. I say that as president of the Pensions Policy Institute and a trustee of the Resolution Foundation. The foundation did the initial work that led to the Thoresen review and identified the groups that are most at risk. We must get the right advice and help to the people who are the least likely to manage without it, which is the group that has been identified here. I strongly support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08061788000155"></a>I know from my diocese people such as those whom we are talking about. They are unlikely to be able instantly to latch on to the technical stuff that will be talked about. Specifying an hour seems extremely arbitrary, so I wonder whether instead there might be some way of listing the specific topics to be covered, recognising that some people may take a little longer to catch up with some of them and that by the time that even those who are moderately financially literate get to the age of 50 the pensions legislation may have advanced so far that it may be quite difficult to understand. I do not know how many topics would be covered under &#147;generic financial advice&#148;, but I wonder whether they could be listed, as opposed to the arbitrary period of a single hour being specified.</p>

For some of your Lordships who have just spoken, it is clear that it means pensions advice, whereas to me it means advice on savings. After all, it is total savings that will affect one&#146;s benefits and pension credit and so on when one comes to claim them.</p>

Of course, I take note of the Thoresen review and report, but who will be responsible for this advice in individual cases? Will it be the global organisation that is set up, or will it be the individuals within that organisation? We live, alas, in an increasingly litigious society. If people feel that they have had the wrong advice, they may go to a pro bono lawyer and ask whether they can get recompense as a result. Nobody wants that. It is not good for auto-enrolment; it is not good for personal pensions; it is not good for savings generally. I worry about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08061788000026"></a>The other nail that the right reverend Prelate hit firmly on the head was the prescriptive nature of a part of the amendment. It states that the advice must be both face to face and, more important, last at least one hour. We all know that the general level of financial literacy in this country is abysmal. For many people, one hour might be scarcely enough; for others, it may be a fraction&#151;but probably only a fraction&#151;too long. I do not know how many noble Lords have been to the retirement conference hosted by one of the big insurance firms that takes place&#151;I think, annually&#151;in Westminster. That takes three to three and a half hours to explain retirement income and allied matters such as capital gains tax and capital transfer tax to people who are at least financially educated enough to go along and try to understand this advice and, one hopes, in many cases to act on it. However, I am afraid that I do not regard them as representative of the general mass of the population. I do not mean to be patronising in the least. I am sure that many people up and down the country would understand the advice and act on it, even if it is being given for, say, half an hour or 45 minutes. However,

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08061788000027"></a>Having said all that, I believe that there is clearly a need for financial advice of a general nature. The real problem is how you can safely provide it without brickbats falling either on the Government of the day or on the organisation or individual members of the organisation that is set up to give it. I am glad that we have had this short debate, which I hope will colour our thoughts on later amendments. For now, however, that is my opinion on generic advice.</p>

I thank noble Lords who have spoken for their general support. We should clarify that we are not saying that everybody has to have had advice in this category; they just have to have been offered it and to have the chance to have it. If they want only a quarter of an hour or half an hour, that is fine. We stress the &#147;at least&#148; element.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08061788000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, can say that advice is a problem, but are we seriously saying that it would be satisfactory for the millions of people in this at-risk group just to be told to ring a number and press one, two or three? Are we telling them to go on to the world wide web, which seems to be the thrust of the Government&#146;s thinking, when many of them may not want to go on to the world wide web? They may not be comfortable with it; poorer people may not even be linked to it. We think that this is a sensible and balanced way of making sure that advice is available to those members of a high-risk group&#151;anyone who has done any work on this admits that it is a high-risk group&#151;if they want it. It is not prescriptive; it just says that an amount of generic advice&#151;I stress that&#151;would be available.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08061788000030"></a>The answer to the fair points made by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, about whether people will be sued and what sort of advice there will be is that, no, they will not be sued because the advice is of a generic nature. The typical thing that we will want to say&#151;this is why I believe that the Government are being much too complacent about the risks&#151;is, &#147;Are you paying 17 per cent interest on your credit card bill each month, which you have not paid off? Are you having a choice between paying that, paying your mortgage and contributing to a pension?&#148;. Those sorts of questions are the ones that will focus people&#146;s minds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08061788000031"></a>The work done by the DWP and the most recent projections of entitlement to income-related benefits still show a high number of people on pension credit, even under the present system: 40 per cent of people will still be on that means-tested pension credit in 2020, with 30 per cent in 2050. These projections show people who are at risk even if they have no debts at all&#151;even if they are not paying high rates of interest on debt. Many people in the poorer target groups are badly stuck in debt. There are about 2 million people irreversibly stuck in debt in this country and that figure is going up rapidly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08061788000032"></a>We do not propose to press this amendment to a vote today, but I look forward&#151;particularly after we have heard the Minister&#146;s reply&#151;to constructive discussions and to seeing whether we can bring forward an amendment that works at Report.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08061788000033"></a>We believe that there should be a national network. We would probably prefer to have it based on the citizens advice bureaux, but we are not prescribing that. We are saying that the network needs to be a trusted brand and that it needs to be financed by the Government. There is such an enormous expansion of the many millions of people who are the least sophisticated financially in our society that it is unthinkable that we should pass this Bill while leaving this issue on a wing and a prayer, hoping that Thoresen&#146;s work, or other things, may emerge later. There will be web-based or telephone services with no guarantee of face-to-face advice for the people who need it the most. I very much welcome the support from many parts of the Committee and hope that we can get to a more workable and generally agreeable amendment at Report.</p>

I am pleased that the noble Baroness is not going to press the amendment and that it is only by way of getting that discussion under way, because we could not accept it in the form that it comes before us.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08061788000035"></a>The amendment would prevent the automatic enrolment of jobholders who have reached the age of 50, unless they had been offered the provision of face-to-face pensions and debt advice. It is very specific and prescriptive. Employers will be required automatically to enrol jobholders between the age of 22 and state pension age. Clearly, it is important that jobholders of all ages, including the over-50s, are properly informed about the impact of workplace pension saving. We shall be working with stakeholders to ensure that suitable information is available at the right time.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08061788000036"></a>I do not agree that one-to-one advice will inevitably be needed by such jobholders&#151;or, indeed, by every jobholder. The decision to remain enrolled will be straightforward for most people, including older groups. The matching contribution through the employer contribution and tax relief provides a good incentive to save. My noble friend Lady Hollis referred to the English longitudinal study of ageing and two of the examples that flowed from it. I shall not repeat them, but they are two examples of people over 50 for whom there was a clear benefit in enrolment and saving. But we are clear that good information is important and Clause 9 recognises that individuals will need access to relevant and accurate information about auto-enrolment.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08061788000037"></a>The DWP and other organisations, such as Citizens Advice and the Pensions Advisory Service, which we have heard about, and the Financial Services Authority, already provide information about pensions. A number of agencies and other organisations already provide access to debt advice, and Government already give grants to the National Debtline. We will ensure that every automatically enrolled individual has access to the range of information they need to understand the process of automatic enrolment, the pension scheme

There may well be people who should be saving, but does he accept that there are a number of people for whom that will be the only way in which to give them satisfactory advice&#151;yes or no?</p>

The challenge is to see the extent to which they can be identified. One problem with the amendment before us is that it assumes a broad category of people who are, en masse, in need of a certain service. I do not believe that the evidence supports that, which is why we are proceeding with the work programme, which I shall come to in a moment.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08061788000040"></a>The distinction between information and advice is an important one. As noble Lords will be aware, there is no legal requirement for individuals to receive one-to-one advice before they are automatically enrolled into an occupational pension scheme now. That is the current position. So giving those reaching age 50, or any jobholders, a new legal entitlement to one-to-one advice could give them a misleading impression that automatic enrolment is a risky and complex process. That could cause unnecessary worry and lead to opt-out by the very people who stand to gain from the employer contribution. Our reforms aim to overcome the inertia experienced by those who do not want to make what they consider complex decisions about saving. So we should avoid this at all costs.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08061788000041"></a>Of course, some individuals may have further questions and wish to seek guidance. That is the case for any financial decision. There are already free-of-charge, publicly funded services for pensions and debt guidance, locally and nationally&#151;again, for example, through the Pensions Advisory Service, the CAB and the National Debtline. These services will continue to be part of the landscape in 2012, should people wish to seek guidance about whether a personal account, or indeed any pension, is right for them, and for those considering, say, paying off large, high-interest debts first.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08061788000042"></a>We are particularly pleased that Thoresen&#146;s proposed money guidance service will build on such existing provision. Thoresen has stated, and we agree with him, that auto-enrolment and personal accounts do not create a new need for a different kind of information and guidance for any groups.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08061788000043"></a>I do not agree that there is a need to supplement all this with additional one-to-one guidance services, potentially at great cost to the taxpayer. We simply run the risk of establishing new guidance services that will be used only by a minority of individuals. Therefore, rather than inserting inappropriate requirements into primary legislation, the Government will work with a

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08061788000044"></a>I pick up on a couple of specific points. There were issues around Thoresen&#146;s proposals. I believe that the proposals are an intelligent response to the need that he was asked to address; that is, the gap in general financial capability. However, it would be wrong for us to rely on the Thoresen pathfinders to deliver the information that people will need when they are auto-enrolled. The service is deliberately non-specific. It will aim to answer a wide range of basic financial inquiries, but will then pass people on to specialist organisations, such as the Pensions Advisory Service, for more complex queries.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08061788000045"></a>Given that we already know that a large number of people will need information to help them at the point of auto-enrolment, it would make no sense for us to wait until they contact a general financial inquiry service. We can and should anticipate most of the questions they will have and make sure that that information is available upfront. Many bodies are already providing this kind of information. We want to use their expertise to plan the provision of this information and to deliver it. We expect the final offer to be provided through a wide range of organisations and a variety of channels, including interactive bodies.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08061788000046"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, asked about the number of pensioners projected to be on benefits in the future. We should be very cautious about equating somebody who is destined to arrive on an income-related benefit as somebody who cannot benefit from saving though a pension arrangement. That is simply not the case. It may be the case for those who would have 100 per cent withdrawal for extra income. The majority of people heading for means-tested benefits would not be in that position. Of course, the pension reforms that we introduced last year, and which we are building on in this Bill, will restrict the impact of means-tested benefits in the future. But, as we discussed at Second Reading, if you want to eliminate means-tested benefits in total, you would have to more than double the state pension. I think the statistic is that if you double the state pension in 2012, by 2050, 25 per cent of pensioners will still be on at least one income-related benefit. So it is an environment in which we operate. To equate the two is, I believe, fundamentally wrong.</p>

The fact is that on the figures recently published by his department the proportion of pensioner households entitled to income-related benefit will be 55 per cent in 2020 and 40 per cent in 2050. The point is that a significant number of people in this group will be at risk and need advice. It does this Committee and this House no credit to pretend otherwise.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08061788000049"></a>I stand to be corrected, but my recollection is that there will be two pathfinders, both in the north, which will cover some 750,000 people, of whom 500,000 will be interactive and 250,000 face-to-face and telephone advice; but this will not go out until January 2009, it will take 12 months to collect the information and, I suspect, another six or nine months to analyse it. So we will reach 2012 before we have the proper loop back from the pathfinder proposals. I am relying on memory and I could be mistaken.</p>

<a name="80617-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08061788000050"></a>First, can my noble friend confirm that those broad contours are correct and, secondly, if 250,000 of the 750,000 in the two northern pilots will have either face-to-face or telephone advice, what limits will he put on this? Will he target it, as the noble Baroness suggests? Will it be comprehensive? That is a huge enterprise and may be larger than the total population about which the noble Baroness is concerned.</p>

The pathfinders will offer no guidance on the operation of auto-enrolment post-2012. Thoresen himself said that what is being done following his report will not provide the kind of evidence needed; it might provide a generic framework, but it will provide no evidence on how successful that mode of delivering information and advice will be in the context of auto-enrolment.</p>

A range of work is going on, including the workshop set in train by the department, which the noble Lord attended. It is an interesting process to try better to understand issues around savings incentives. It is hoped that there will be a report on that at the end of the year. Other work is going on; part of PADA&#146;s role will be to focus on the sort of information that job holders who will potentially be auto-enrolled will need. That is part of the process.

However, we will no doubt return to these arguments in the future. The Minister does not seem to accept that there are any at-risk groups; that is the message that he is sending to me.

The proposition is about trying to describe a group with broad characteristics about which you could say, &#147;That group in aggregate is unlikely to benefit from saving with our pension scheme&#148;. However, we cannot have a broad-brush approach that people who reach the age of 50 are potentially in a group that may not benefit from saving, as there is no evidence for that. We need to do further work. The proposition that we must target this group with this particular service and that members of the group cannot be auto-enrolled before they have been offered it is not the right way to go.</p>

No one is saying that everyone is in this high-risk group, but the Pensions Policy Institute, which is easily the most respected body in the field, has identified people over 50 who are renting in old age as likely to be high risk. We are focusing on this group because there may be a significant number of people in the group for whom this may not pay, which is why they need advice. Some will and some will not need advice, but can the Minister not see that it pays to focus on the groups that are most at risk?

We would need evidence for that. Clearly, there must be good-quality information to all jobholders, not just those who are aged 50 or over. The issue is what further needs to be provided. We believe that the right approach is to ensure that broader advice is available, covering debt, pensions and financial issues generally. Part of the information flows might signpost people to that extra provision of advice, but we do not think that making that broader provision around financial capability and specific groups a precursor to being able to auto-enrol is the right way to go. Of course there must be good-quality, relevant information for everyone, to inform them and help them to understand

They are what the noble Lord&#146;s department called the hardest-to-reach groups. We think that the Bill gives us a duty&#151;not just a chance&#151;to include this provision. Everyone should have generic financial advice if they need it and it is good that many people now provide it. However, we have a chance in the Bill to do something; we cannot do anything about it just out of the blue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08061788000067"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to the other amendments in the group. Workplace personal pensions are an important and growing part of the pensions market. Membership of workplace personal pensions is around 47 per cent of current private sector pension membership, which represents about 3.3 million employees, involving total contributions of &#163;6.7 billion a year. There are 2.1 million members of WPPs with an employer contribution of 3 per cent or more.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08061788000068"></a>We have always intended to include workplace personal pensions within the scope of this legislation but we were concerned that these schemes could fall under the scope of the directives on distance marketing and unfair commercial practices. We are now content that, under the specific provisions of the employer duty, automatic enrolment into workplace personal pensions is not within the scope of these directives. The European Commission has confirmed that it shares our view. This group of amendments reflects that positive outcome.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08061788000069"></a>Amendment No. 10 to Clause 3 will permit qualifying workplace personal pensions to be used for automatic enrolment. That is achieved by enabling the deeming of an agreement for scheme membership between the jobholder and the provider. This agreement will be based on the provision of information to the jobholder as to the terms and conditions of the scheme that they are joining. The details of the information to be provided will be laid out in regulations. The amendment also takes a new power to ensure that, to support the automatic enrolment process, information relating to the scheme that a jobholder is being enrolled into is provided to any relevant persons.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08061788000070"></a>Of course, we no longer need the power to exempt workplace personal pensions from the requirement to automatically enrol. Amendment No. 10, therefore, also removes the power for an exemption. Amendment No. 12 to Clause 4 is a consequential amendment, removing a further reference to the power for an exemption. Together with stakeholders, we have worked hard over the past 12 months to consider how workplace personal pensions are treated under these reforms. This decision ensures both that the integrity of the reforms is maintained and that the insurance industry can continue to operate on a level playing field.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08061788000071"></a>Amendments Nos. 18 and 23 to Clauses 5 and 6 respectively mirror the new provision in Clause 3 for the cases of automatic re-enrolment and the jobholder&#146;s right to opt in. Alongside these changes, Amendment No. 54 is a crucial amendment that extends the remit of Clause 16 to allow qualifying workplace personal pensions to be used as automatic enrolment schemes. Amendment No. 55 to Clause 16 is a minor technical amendment to tidy up the drafting of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para7"></a>

I shall explain each briefly. Amendment No. 37 to Clause 8 makes a cosmetic adjustment to the Bill so that there is no longer a distinction between occupational and personal pension schemes for workers without qualifying earnings. Amendment No. 86 extends the remit of the power in Clause 29 to personal pension schemes, to enable employers to deduct pension contributions from the pay of an individual who has been automatically enrolled into a personal pension. Amendment No. 87 makes it clear that this power is not necessary for workers without qualifying earnings who request to be enrolled into a personal pension scheme, as direct payment arrangements for this situation are covered under Section 111A of the Pension Schemes Act 1993, as described in Clause 8(7)(c). Clause 29 also contains the consequential Amendment No. 88, which makes it explicit that, following on from Amendment No. 86, contributions can be paid to the provider of a personal pension scheme as well as the trustees or manager of an occupational pension scheme.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08061788000073"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 105 removes from Clause 49 further references to the power to regulate for an exemption from automatic enrolment for personal pensions. This clause will therefore apply to employers equally, irrespective of whether the qualifying scheme that they provide for their workers is an occupational or personal pension scheme. I beg to move.</p>

Being of a suspicious nature, I wonder what the Government wanted the result to be. Is it the result that we have here, which ensures that workplace pensions can be used to discharge the duty on employers to operate an automatic enrolment scheme? In his speech, the Minister referred to &#147;enabling&#148; them so to do. Alternatively, did the Government in their heart of hearts hope that they would get approval for compulsion? It is important that we know this, because I have been asked the question in several letters from employers and occupational pension schemes. I would like to know the answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08061788000078"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, asked what this means more generally. We should be clear that what has been accepted is driven by the fact that there is an employment nexus to these arrangements. It is the employer duty that has enabled this to happen. If you consider how the directives might have operated otherwise, you see that it would be a business-consumer issue, which is why the directives are there. The employment nexus is important. It will operate from 2012, when the employer duty and its consequences take effect. I am grateful for the support of noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08061788000082"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 11 introduces a new clause after Clause 3. This is a probing amendment designed to allow the Minister to explain how the tax contribution to automatic enrolment schemes will work. The Minister will be aware that I trailed at Second Reading the fact that I had had initial discussions with his officials and that I would use our Committee stage to explore this further.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08061788000083"></a>I believe that the tax aspects of the Government's pension proposals have received little attention, but they are potentially important. My amendment refers to automatic enrolment, which will cover all jobholders. My concerns arose initially from personal accounts, but it is illogical to focus on personal accounts when automatic enrolment into workplace pensions may be at least as important an aspect of the provision of pensions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08061788000084"></a>I take the Committee back to the Government's White Paper in May 2006, <I>Security in Retirement: </I><I>T</I><I>owards a </I><I>N</I><I>ew </I><I>P</I><I>ensions </I><I>S</I><I>ystem</I>. In paragraph 36 of the executive summary, under the heading <I>A </I><I>N</I><I>ew </I><I>P</I><I>ensions </I><I>S</I><I>ettlement: </I><I>O</I><I>ur </I><I>P</I><I>roposals for </I><I>R</I><I>eform</I><I>,</I> the Government's proposals were described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08061788000172"></a>&#147;The scheme will have the following key features:</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08061788000173"></a>Employees will contribute 4 per cent ... Employers will make minimum matching contributions of 3 per cent ... A further 1 per cent will be contributed in the form of normal tax relief&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061788000156"></a>A footnote said that this 1 per cent,</p>
<ul><a name="08061788000198"></a>&#147;represents basic rate tax relief on individuals' contributions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061788000157"></a>I think that we all bought the arithmetic of personal accounts as four plus three plus one.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08061788000085"></a>The December 2006 White Paper, <I>Personal </I><I>A</I><I>ccounts: </I><I>A</I><I></I><I>N</I><I>ew </I><I>W</I><I>ay to </I><I>S</I><I>ave</I>, said, in paragraph 63, that,</p>
<ul><a name="08061788000199"></a>&#147;employees will pay contributions of around 4 per cent ... the employee contribution will be matched by 3 per cent from the employer together with around 1 per cent in the form of normal tax relief from the State&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08061788000158"></a>When we come to the Bill, the 1 per cent contribution has disappeared. Instead, Clause 19, which deals with money purchase schemes, and Clause 25, which concerns personal pension schemes, refer to a total of 8 per cent, with the employer&#146;s portion being at least 3 per cent. There is no mention of tax and so the employee&#146;s portion is 5 per cent.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08061788000086"></a>Tax can be an important element of the economics of pensions saving, and it is particularly important at the lower end of the income spectrum, where the advantages of saving may be less pronounced due to the impact on, inter alia, means-tested benefits, which we discussed earlier. In some cases, the tax element can produce virtually the whole benefit of saving.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08061788000087"></a>It seems that the Government expect the tax element to be delivered not to the personal accounts scheme or other automatic enrolment scheme but to the individual via the PAYE system. That may be fine for a lot of people but it will not work for all. The threshold for the start of automatic enrolment is set at &#163;5,035 in the Bill and we expect it to be uprated to match the primary threshold for national insurance purposes, which, in turn, is normally expected to be the same as the personal allowance for tax purposes. However, we have recently found that the Government&#151;for political reasons, which I need not rehearse today&#151;have chosen to increase the personal allowance this year by &#163;600.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08061788000088"></a>Let us assume that the bottom level is set for the purposes of auto-enrolment at this year&#146;s primary threshold of &#163;5,435. However, once the Finance Bill is enacted, the personal allowance for tax purposes for this year will be &#163;6,035. If I earn &#163;6,000 a year&#151;which is approximately 21 hours a week at the minimum wage&#151;auto-enrolment will take &#163;48 from me but, being below the basic rate threshold, I will get no tax relief; I will pay the whole 5 per cent on the relevant portion of my earnings. There will be similar results if I have tax reliefs in excess of the basic rate, the obvious ones here being the blind person&#146;s allowance, which is &#163;1,800, or one of the age allowances, which are worth more than &#163;3,500.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08061788000089"></a>Another problem area would be people working for part of the tax year. Tax allowances are available for the whole year and not for the parts of the year that

If I earned at an annual rate of, say, &#163;12,000 and started work half way through the tax year, or stopped working half way through the year, my earnings for the year would be &#163;6,000 and, if it were this year, I would pay no tax. However, under the auto-enrolment pay reference period rules, I would expect to pay pension contributions based on a little under &#163;3,500 because I would get a proportion of the first threshold knocked off before triggering auto-enrolment contributions. Therefore, I would probably have to pay something in the region of &#163;174 in pension contributions but would get no tax relief because I would not be paying any tax.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08061788000090"></a>Similarly, if I earned at an annual rate of &#163;24,000 a year and worked for only three months in the year, I would pay no tax and would therefore get no tax relief, but a little under &#163;240 would be taken from me in contributions or through the auto-enrolment method, for which I would get no relief. I do not know how many people would be affected by this but they would be mainly those who earn around the thresholds, and that inevitably means those who earn the least, which probably involves women.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08061788000091"></a>The Turner report, or Pensions Commission report, recommended in section 9(i) of its executive summary that,</p>
<ul><a name="08061788000200"></a>&#147;the option of creating a scheme specific tax relief regime ... based on a single rate of tax relief and a matching up-front contribution approach, should be considered in detail. And we believe that, whether or not a scheme specific regime is created, the tax treatment of NPSS&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08061788000159"></a>that is, personal accounts in today&#146;s language&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08061788000201"></a>&#147;contributions should mirror the attractive features which currently apply to saving via a Stakeholder Pension, i.e. the fact that starting-rate and non-taxpayers, many of whom will be part-time employees, can receive tax relief at the basic rate&#148;."</ul>
<p><a name="08061788000160"></a>I could not find any reference in the Government&#146;s White Papers to the detailed consideration recommended by the Turner report, and there is certainly no mention of the stakeholder method of delivering relief directly to personal accounts or to the pension scheme. My amendment seeks to ensure either that the employee gets basic rate tax relief on his contributions or that an equivalent amount is paid to the pension scheme. The latter is meant to mirror the stakeholder arrangement.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08061788000092"></a>I do not pretend that the amendment is perfect, and I have already said that it is probing for the purposes of today&#146;s debate, but I hope that it will enable the Minister to respond to the issues in a positive way. I beg to move.</p>

Indeed, my noble friend said that it depends on how long people work for during a year. Further on in the legislation, we shall find reference to share fishermen and people working on trawlers and so on. They have somewhat irregular periods of work during the year, let alone the tax year, so if the Minister could look at that, I should be very grateful. I am certainly immensely grateful to my noble friend for giving me a free two-minute lesson.

It has prompted us to reflect on where we are. As she said, tax relief on pension savings adds to, and plays an important part in, the overall incentive to save. Individuals who save at the new minimum level will see contributions worth 8 per cent of banded earnings going into pension saving. Of these, 3 per cent will come from the employer, 4 per cent from the jobholder and 1 per cent from the state for basic rate tax payers. That is absolutely right.</p>

<a name="80617-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08061788000097"></a>All UK qualifying schemes will be required to be tax-registered to ensure that their members receive tax relief on their contributions and investment returns. Even non-taxpayers can get tax relief on pension contributions. Individuals may save up to &#163;2,880 in any one tax year and the Government will top that up with another &#163;720, giving total pension savings with tax relief of &#163;3,600 per year. Coincidentally, that is the same as the cap on personal accounts, but it is just a coincidence.</p>

That is &#163;9,030 minus the &#163;5,035, so it is 8 per cent on &#163;4,000. Of that &#163;320, around &#163;40 would be provided by the state in the form of tax relief, which is well within the annual savings limit for non-taxpayers.</p>

A registered pension scheme would not be able both to operate relief at source and to accept contributions under net pay for worker members.</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08061788000101"></a>I say to the noble Baroness that we do not need to take a decision at this point about the method the personal accounts scheme will use to deliver tax relief to its members. More analysis and thinking time is needed. It would be helpful to see the shape of the underlying tax landscape closer to 2012, as that may influence the decision. In addition, the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority will want to work with its employers&#146; and members&#146; panels to help establish the most appropriate arrangement for its target group of members, and for the employers who contract with the scheme.</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08061788000102"></a>To reiterate, for those employers who operate the relief at source approach, there should be no difficulties for anyone, even if they are not subject to income tax in any particular year, because the &#163;3,600 limit should enable them to get their relief.</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08061788000103"></a>A couple of other points were raised. The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, asked about share fishermen. They are not jobholders for the purpose of the legislation, so they do not fall within the arrangements. The noble Baroness said that she presumed that the bands would increase by prices.</p>

I was just going to emphasise that the objective is that they should increase by earnings. On the starting point of &#163;5,035 and where the personal allowance currently sits, we are some way away from 2012 and the &#163;5,035 threshold will be operated by earnings. The personal allowance depends, as ever, on what the Chancellor determines; we will know in due course; but historically, under Rooker-Wise, it has been increased by prices, so there will be some convergence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08061788000106"></a>I hope that that has given the noble Baroness a degree of comfort on the valid and important point that she raised. There is more work to do to see which is the best route to achieve tax relief. I understand that it is a probing amendment, but we want to avoid a heavy additional mechanism that HMRC would have to engage in, because that could be costly and difficult. It would almost require year-end reconciliations to deliver on it rather than rely on the current arrangements through the relief-at-source mechanisms or the net pay arrangements. That is an ongoing issue on which we need to do further work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08061788000110"></a>I will consider carefully what the Minister has said when I have read it in <I>Hansard</I>, but it seems to me that there is still ambiguity about whether and to what extent tax relief will be delivered for those who contribute and that that is therefore not an entirely satisfactory response. That is my initial response. It is important to be able to button this down because, as I said earlier and as I think that the Minister accepts, for some people who will be contributing to personal accounts by auto-enrolment, the tax relief element of the four plus three plus one is critical to whether it pays to save. That is how the whole scheme was sold and that is why it is important to have clarity about it. I will consider what the Minister has said today and, if necessary, will return to this again on Report. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="08061788000116"></a><a name="80617-0009.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80617-0009.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08061788000245"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Despite the debate in Commons Committee on 22 January, reporter at cols. 174-9, where Members of that Committee were told that companies such as Tesco needed time to adjust their existing schemes to qualifying requirements, I simply do not understand the need for Clause 4. It depends totally on the timing. The Bill allows the Secretary of State to delay regulations in all sorts of areas. On many occasions, we know, because the Minister has as good as confirmed it several times, that the Government are waiting for PADA to, if I am putting it nicely, advise them; if I am putting it nastily, tell them what to do.</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08061788000117"></a>What we do not know is how quick off the mark these regulations will be. If they are announced, say, a year in advance, that will be plenty of time for organisations such as Tesco to change their scheme into a qualifying scheme. However, if the regulations are to be laid at the last minute, I suppose that there is a need for a clause such as this. After all, the clause permits the Secretary of State to lay an order postponing auto-enrolment, because the normal arrangement is that a worker is to be in the scheme from his first day at work. In the event of a comparatively early laying of the regulations, I cannot envisage any circumstances when the clause may be used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08061788000118"></a>Secondly, subsection (2), which describes the minimum period in which a jobholder may not leave a scheme, is also very curious. The Explanatory Notes state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="08061788000178"></a>&#147;Employers that are permitted to delay automatic enrolment may be required to ensure that members remain in such a scheme for a prescribed period of time, unless the jobholder leaves that employment or chooses to leave the scheme&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061788000161"></a>I do not understand the word &#147;ensure&#148;. Does that really mean that a jobholder will be forced to remain in a scheme that may not be a qualifying scheme at the end of the day? Given that Clause 4 is entitled &#147;Postponement of automatic enrolment&#148;, why cannot the employee choose to leave the scheme, as he can under normal auto-enrolment rules? Yet again, I am confused, and it would be helpful to hear the Minister's explanation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="08061788000119"></a><a name="80617-0009.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80617-0009.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08061788000246"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank the noble Lord for the opportunity to put clearly on the record what the clause is about. It provides a regulation-making power to delay automatic enrolment for any or all employers, schemes or jobholders. We intend to use the regulations to establish a deferral of automatic enrolment for a short period&#151;most likely, for three months&#151;for employers who offer high-quality provision. To minimise risks of discrimination, we plan to require employers to keep the jobholder in a higher level scheme for a minimum period so that they can make up for any savings foregone during the delay.</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08061788000120"></a>Three technical government amendments to Clause 4 have been made, which are grouped with amendments to other clauses that have been discussed&#151;Clauses 2 and 3. The Committee will be aware that those amendments work in conjunction with Clauses 2, 3 and 5. However, I am happy to discuss the policy intention behind Clause 4 more generally at this point.</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08061788000121"></a>Our general approach is for immediate enrolment so that people who change jobs frequently, together with casual and seasonal workers, have the best possible access to pension saving and the prospect of building a sufficient pension pot. However, we recognise that some employers voluntarily pay higher contributions, or provide defined benefit schemes and that in the longer term this benefits their workers. In order to encourage such employers to maintain their generous offers, once automatic enrolment is introduced, we intend to allow them to defer automatic enrolment by a short period. That is why it is crucial to have the power to permit this under the legislation.</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08061788000122"></a>It would not be appropriate to allow all employers to delay automatic enrolment. Analysis suggests that people, on average, change jobs eight times during their working life. Enabling all employers to delay automatic enrolment for three months, for example, could reduce the fund of an individual in a minimum-level qualifying scheme who moved jobs eight times in their working life by as much as 5 per cent. This clause will enable us to set out arrangements for employers to make use of a deferral period, including the length of any period and the level of contributions required. The deferral period is a measure to support employers in maintaining higher-value provision. Using regulations will enable us to review arrangements to ensure that the approach is succeeding in supporting higher-level pension provision for both employers and workers.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_966"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 966</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80617-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08061788000123"></a>The clause also stipulates that, in order to ensure that members who are automatically enrolled later benefit from generous provision, employers must maintain membership in the scheme for a minimum period. This protection is crucial because people need to catch up foregone savings that they would have received if they had been automatically enrolled into a scheme with minimum contributions from the outset. Our intention is that the minimum level of employer contribution to allow employers to postpone will be 6 per cent of qualifying earnings, that is double the minimum. On that basis, we expect that employers offering these higher contributions or qualifying defined benefit schemes would be able to postpone automatic enrolment for about three months. However, we propose that the level of contributions, the length of the postponement period and the length of the catch-up period is agreed in secondary legislation, as this gives us the opportunity to continue to consult ahead of laying regulations.</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08061788000124"></a>There is a relationship between the length of the postponement period&#151;the catch-up period&#151;and the level of contributions required. If we were to fix some conditions for postponing automatic enrolment in the Bill we would restrict the flexibility to tailor the arrangements to meet the dual needs of both jobholders and employers in the future. I hope that has clarified matters for the noble Lord. It is a way of supporting existing good quality provision. That is the purpose of the clause.</p>

I will have to look extremely carefully at what he has said to see that I have understood him correctly. In the mean time, I do not propose to pursue this objection tonight.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="08061788000179"></a> Clause 5, page 3, line 21, after &#147;jobholder&#148; insert &#147;&#151;</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08061788000129"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to the other amendments in this group. Clause 5 provides a power to require employers periodically to re-enrol jobholders who are not currently participating in qualifying workplace pension saving. To a large extent, re-enrolment will mirror the auto-enrolment process set out in Clause 3. Automatic enrolment is widely recognised as one of the best ways to overcome the decision-making inertia which continues to deter many people from saving for a pension. Nevertheless, some people will still opt out of workplace pension saving. Others will stop saving after a period of participation. In many cases, this will be an informed decision and perfectly reasonable in the light of that jobholder&#146;s circumstances. However, circumstances can change. We consider re-enrolment to be an important provision because we do not want job changes to be the only event that prompts a jobholder to consider whether to start or re-start pension saving.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_967"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 967</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80617-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08061788000130"></a>A timely reminder through re-enrolment would make all the difference to the standard of living a jobholder is eventually able to afford in retirement. Government Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 clarify that re-enrolment will not apply if a jobholder has stopped saving or opted out under Clause 7 within a prescribed period before re-enrolment is due. We do not want employers to have to enrol workers who have recently decided to opt out and neither will those workers want to have to opt out again. It is also with employer burdens in mind that we decided re-enrolment should not happen more than once every three years. While the details of the timing of re-enrolment will be laid out in regulations, Amendment No. 21 specifies that these regulations must ensure that there is not more than one re-enrolment date within 3 years, whether the date is linked to a jobholder event or an employer event.</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08061788000131"></a>There are, however, circumstances where this blanket three-year exclusion will not be appropriate and where we do not think it will be sufficient to depend on a jobholder proactively opting in. Amendment No. 21 provides a short list of special circumstances where it will be necessary for employers to re-enrol jobholders more frequently than the stipulation of three years. The actual timing of re-enrolment in these circumstances will also be set out in regulations. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, seeks to remove the power to make regulations relating to the timing of re-enrolment. I fully understand that the process of re-enrolment is a subject of much interest. This is an important matter and we need to strike the right balance between the benefits for jobholders and the impact on employers.</p>

<a name="80617-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08061788000132"></a>We intend to discuss with stakeholders how best to introduce this policy, so that it minimises the burden on employers and schemes while ensuring individuals are prompted to reconsider workplace pension saving from time to time. As part of our continued stakeholder engagement, we aim to set out our plans in the autumn before going on to publish draft regulations in spring 2009. I hope that I have given noble Lords reassurance on this issue and I beg to move.</p>

That amendment was originally intended to be a probing amendment to confirm that the Government intended automatic re-enrolment to occur only every three years and to get this period onto the Bill in due course. I am, therefore, very glad that the Government has more or less done this job for me in their Amendment No. 21. Their new clause, &#147;Timing of automatic re-enrolment&#148;, clarifies this by doing just that. I also note that this group of amendments, as the Minister said, clarifies the re-enrolment process in Clause 5&#151;but why three years in the first place? It would obviously be too expensive and might even encourage workers to opt out if it was to take place in a period of less than three years, but why three years and not, say, five years. There must be a perfectly good reason, but what is it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08061788000134"></a>There are yet other questions around the information that must be provided. Government Amendment No. 18 refers here to automatic re-enrolment, which I hope the Minister will answer. I am beginning to understand  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_968"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 968</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>what information will need to be provided to jobholders on their original auto-enrolment, whether into a qualifying scheme or into personal accounts. However, what sort of information are the Government thinking of? If the information is too much, it must have the danger of encouraging opt-out, which is against everybody&#146;s interests. If on the other hand it is not very much, what value will it have? After all, we are talking not entirely but mostly about people who have already been in the scheme for at least one period of three years, then opted out and are considering rejoining. I hope that most of them will have been perfectly happy with the way in which it went for them when they were auto-enrolled. The last thing we want is for them to be put off in any way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08061788000135"></a>How much information will the Government require to be sent out? Furthermore, I see from Amendment No. 18 that it is the employer who is responsible for making sure that the information reaches his employee. The latter, then, is a postbox. It is clear that the information originates with the trustee, manager or provider responsible for the scheme in question when it is a qualifying scheme. However, when it is a personal accounts scheme, will the trustees send the information to the employer for onward transmission to the employee? If not, who will?</p>

I want to do everything within reason to get people enrolled, re-enrolled and re-enrolled again if necessary. Obviously there is a balance to be struck, with the employer&#151;not the trustee, although the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, raised a good question in that direction&#151;active from day one in enrolling and re-enrolling people. It should get the support of the Government to make that a consistent part of the policy as it unfolds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08061788000137"></a>We have seen the worrying experience in New Zealand. Of course the policies are not in parallel exactly because the rules and the scale are different, but we now learn that the KiwiSaver scheme is approaching a 30 per cent opt-out level, after some years. That is a real worry. A lot of effort is necessary on the part of all the stakeholders, the Government and the employers to make sure that everyone who can be captured sensibly in the personal accounts should be so captured. Therefore, there is a role for the Government to support employers as much as they can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08061788000138"></a>I do not know why three years is the given figure either. It is a good question. I want as short a period as possible, to ensure that the vast majority of people for whom the arrangements are appropriate are captured in the scheme. If not, we will go the way of New Zealand and haemorrhage participants. That would not be in the long-term interests of the policy.</p>

However, three years is only the minimum. It will be a matter for regulations in due course, but that is where we are and it cannot be more frequently than three years.

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08061788000140"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked me about the provision of information. Amendment No. 10, to Clause 3, will permit qualifying workplace personal pensions to be used for automatic enrolment. Sorry&#151;that does not deal with his point. He asked generally about what sort of information needed to be provided. Clause 9 talks about the information to be provided to jobholders, and clearly there are existing provisions relating to the requirements on pension providers to provide members of the schemes with routine information. The amendment&#151;it mirrors earlier ones&#151;recognises that information will have to flow to various people. It will have to flow from the employer to the employee in terms of the scheme with which the individual is involved. There will have to be some communication about the deductions process from earnings, and there will need to be communication from the employer and the scheme about who has been enrolled. It is on those sorts of issues that we are talking about an information flow; I do not think that there is anything more profound or sinister about it, but I might recap on my briefings and write to him if there is anything further with which I can reassure him on that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08061791000003"></a>The noble Lord said: This is one occasion on which I have managed to pre-empt the Government, by accident rather than design, because with the amendment are grouped government Amendments Nos. 137 to 139. Also in the group are three other of our amendments, Amendments Nos. 36, 51 and 52. The Government have accepted many of the recommendations of the Deregulated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of your Lordships&#146; House. The intention of our Amendments Nos. 22, 36 and 52 has been fulfilled by the government amendments in the group. However, our Amendment No. 51 is not matched by a government amendment.</p>

<a name="80617-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08061791000004"></a>There is, once again, a certain vagueness about Clause 12(2). It seems that the Government cannot make up their mind. Your Lordships&#146; Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended in paragraph 19 of its report that either prescribed features should be more closely defined to the Government intention of dealing with schemes that fail to revalue accrued savings or that the power should come under affirmative approval. The Government response was:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="08061791000039"></a>&#147;In their report the Committee signalled concerns over the regulation-making power at 15(2)(c) citing that the power conferred was too wide ranging and risked an average salary scheme to be removed from the definition of &#145;qualifying scheme&#146; on any ground&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061791000005"></a>I emphasise &#147;any ground&#148;. They go on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="08061791000040"></a>&#147;The Committee recommended that the delegation at Clause 15(2)(c) should be more closely confined to the purpose which the delegated powers memorandum states that it is being conferred. We are currently exploring with stakeholders, whether the power allowing the Secretary of State to exclude average salary schemes with prescribed features is required. Following these discussions we will either remove this power or table an amendment to make this power affirmative rather than negative&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061791000006"></a>I am extremely grateful to the Minister for inviting me to some of these stakeholder meetings, one or two of which I have been able to attend. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, and I went to one only last week but not, alas, on this subject. With whom is the department holding discussions and which option looks more likely?

We accept its recommendations. Amendments Nos. 137, 138 and 139 will make the powers subject to affirmative procedures. These amendments also address the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s recommendation on the powers of Clause 15 and Clause 85. It will be helpful if I explain briefly what each of these powers does.</p>

<a name="80617-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08061791000010"></a>The power in Clause 15(2)(c), which relates to average salary schemes, is there to safeguard members&#146; private pension savings. It is a precautionary reserve power that could be used if there are schemes that do not revalue appropriately the earnings on which benefits are calculated, meaning that benefits do not, therefore, maintain their value in retirement. Amendment No. 51 would remove the power to disqualify such average salary schemes. I emphasise that we believe the number of schemes operating in this way to be negligible. The power is a precautionary measure to prevent members saving in schemes where the value of their benefits may be eroded over time. It is our intention to consult our stakeholders before the power is exercised.</p>

<a name="80617-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08061791000011"></a>Turning to Clause 85, the majority of the workforce is already within the scope of the Bill. However, Clause 85 provides the Government with the flexibility to extend the scope of employer duty to individuals who do not fall within the &#147;worker&#148; definition. It will also enable to Government to bring a new group within its scope, should one be created that does not automatically fall within the core definitions in this Bill. We recognise that, as drafted, the powers of Clause 52(2)(c) and Clause 84 are wide-ranging and that it is appropriate that they be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and exercised by the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="80617-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08061791000012"></a>Finally, for the same reason, these amendments also make the new power in Clause 16(1)(c), which allows for additional criteria to be prescribed for automatic enrolment schemes, subject to the affirmative procedure. I reassure the Committee that the Government will share their plans for the process and notices to be regulated under Chapters 1 and 2 of the Bill. We aim to share these plans in the autumn before going on to publish draft regulations in spring 2009, which will then be followed by a technical consultation in the usual way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08061791000013"></a>I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, will not be pressing Amendments Nos. 22, 36 and 52. However, I hope that the noble Lord is reassured by our intention of modifying the Bill to meet these recommendations. I reiterate that we will be addressing all the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee&#146;s recommendations, and amendments have been&#151;or will be&#151;tabled to that effect. I therefore urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment and beg to move government Amendments Nos. 137, 138 and 139. I am sorry; I will speak to them, and move them in their place.</p>

I generally support what the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has just said. It is offensive to have in parliamentary procedures affirmative orders on first use. In my view, orders should either be affirmative or negative. Governments now, as a matter of course, hybridise statutory instruments and go for a halfway house of &#147;on first use&#148;. It confuses the picture. Can the Minister explain why they are restricted in this way and whether they are not simply affirmative orders&#151;with a capital &#147;A&#148;&#151;from start to finish?</p>

Time and again, there will be concerns raised in the House about the use of a statutory instrument or order that the Ministerial Bench may feel is misplaced. Ministers might, nonetheless, wish to help the Opposition, so when that order first comes up there is a commitment to proper parliamentary review. After that, it is assumed that those concerns and fears have been addressed and we do not need to continue. Should the Opposition feel that issues remain, they can raise them through the negative procedure. We should not litter dinner hour business or Moses Room procedures with unnecessary affirmative orders about which there is no concern, around which there has been consensus and, where&#151;after the original parliamentary debate&#151;there has been at least one debate on the Floor of the House or in Committee. That is a sensible way of ensuring initial parliamentary scrutiny but then clearing the decks so that it does not become permanent graffiti on the shoulders of opposition spokesmen at ungodly hours in this Chamber.</p>

In 2006 some 2 million members in average salary schemes were revalued with the prices index. There are no statistical data for those that revalue in line with earnings, but we believe that is because the numbers are insignificant. Indeed, there are no statistical data on such schemes because we do not believe that there are any being run in that way. We will lay regulations only if it emerges that workers are at risk of seeing their savings being kept at below the reform minima. Therefore we have decided to go for the affirmative option.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08061791000030"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 24, I shall speak to the other government amendment and respond to the further amendments in the group. Automatic enrolment creates a new presumption to save, but workplace pension saving will not become compulsory. Individuals will still be able to choose whether to participate in pension saving, and our aim is to ensure that any decision not to participate is an active one, not the default. Clause 7 provides jobholders with the right to opt out of workplace pension saving. Amendment No. 24 will ensure that the Government will be able to prescribe the process by which a jobholder opts out, including when and to whom they give notice. The drafting of the clause has also been simplified to aid understanding. Amendment No. 33 clarifies that an opt-out notice may be authorised as well as signed. This is to ensure that we do not inadvertently rule out the possibility of electronic communication. However, we will ensure that any use of electronic media to authorise and process opt-outs cannot be misused by employers in any way that undermines participation when we come to prescribe the opt-out process in regulations.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08061791000031"></a>Amendment No. 28 would mandate that an opt-out notice would have effect only if it was given direct to the scheme administrator, thereby ruling out any other arrangements. We need to ensure that employers do not coerce their jobholders to opt out. An employer should play no part in the jobholder&#146;s decision-making process. However, when a jobholder does opt out, the deductions from their wages will need to be stopped, so the employer will need to know, perhaps quite quickly. At this stage, we think it is important to retain flexibility to assess all options, taking into account the needs of jobholders, their employers and pension schemes. We shall set out our proposals for the detailed process when we come to make the regulations under this clause.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08061791000032"></a>The opposition amendments seek to do a number of things, the first of which would be to ensure that jobholders may retain any enhanced protection from tax charges on existing pension pots that exceed the lifetime allowance introduced by the 2006 A-Day reforms if they opt out. Jobholders who opt out under Clause 7 will statutorily be treated for all purposes as not  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_976"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 976</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>having become a member of the scheme into which they were automatically enrolled. The key words are &#147;for all purposes&#148; as these ensure that any enhanced protection due to a jobholder remains intact if they opt out.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08061791000033"></a>These amendments also remove the right to a refund, which is an important part of the process of unwinding membership. Our intention is that any contributions paid by jobholders who opt out under Clause 7 will be refunded to the jobholder. Similarly, any contributions paid by the employer will be refunded to the employer. However, it is too soon to say how the refund of contributions will operate or, for example, to assess the full implications for tax purposes. The first destination of a refund of jobholder contributions may need to be the jobholder&#146;s employer to enable income tax to be deducted from earnings, which is now payable because it is not a pension contribution and therefore no longer eligible for tax relief on pension savings.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08061791000034"></a>We may also need to maintain some flexibility around the handling of refunds of employer contributions. For example, some employers choose to leave their contributions at the disposal of the scheme trustees when a worker opts out either as a contribution to administration costs or to be used by the trustees for the benefit of the members. This is a highly technical area, and procedures for handling the return of contributions will be a matter for further detailed consultation with stakeholders as we develop the regulations. However, I want to make it clear that whatever the regulations prescribe for the process, the refund due to a jobholder will find its way back to that worker, while the employer&#146;s contribution will go to the employer.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08061791000035"></a>Getting the length of the opt-out period right is extremely important, and the Government have a balance to strike in this regard. Some jobholders may find it helpful if the period were long enough for them to experience the impact of pension saving on their pay while they still have time to opt out. However, the central thrust of these reforms is to facilitate and support participation in workplace pension saving, so we do not want an unnecessarily long opt-out period to result in jobholders who might otherwise have participated to waver and opt out after, say, three months. In addition, employers and schemes should not be kept waiting too long to discover who is in and who is out. Either way, there is nothing in the Bill which limits the length of the opt-out period in any way or stipulates that it must be same for all jobholders. I suggest that we return to this issue when the time comes to set the period through regulations.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08061791000036"></a>We want to make sure that people who are considering whether to opt out fully understand the implications of such a decision. This is why the opt-out notice should include information about the effect of opting out, which may also provide jobholders with an element of protection against employer coercion. While we want to ensure that an opt-out notice may be authorised as well as signed, we will ensure that any use of electronic media to authorise and process opt outs cannot be misused by employers in any way that undermines participation. I beg to move.</p>

The purpose of retabling our original amendments, which would have been pre-empted by his amendment, as is clearly marked on the Marshalled List, was to enable me to argue the points that I wished him to answer before he answered them. The Minister might think that I ought to sit down because he has anticipated everything that I want to say. Perhaps his officials will look more carefully at the Marshalled List before they produce his speaking notes in future.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08061792000004"></a>We were obliged to table the amendments in this way because we had prepared for this debate before seeing the Minister&#146;s virtual rewriting of Clause 7. I will be speaking to Amendments Nos. 25 and 27, which are amendments to Amendment No. 24, and my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale has prepared to speak to Amendments Nos. 26 and 32. As has been noted, Amendments Nos. 29, 30 and 31, which they replace, will be pre-empted. They should not still be on the Marshalled List, because they have been replaced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08061792000005"></a>Amendment No. 25, as an amendment to Amendment No. 24, simply seeks to get on record&#151;the Minister has done it&#151;that the words &#147;for all purposes&#148; would encompass the specific example that I raised in connection with effectively avoiding relevant pension accrual in the terms of the Finance Act 2004 for enhanced protection purposes under pension simplification. &#147;Pension simplification&#148; is anything but pension simplification, but there we are. This is crucial because it has huge financial significance for those few people who are affected by opportunities for enhanced protection&#151;I declare an interest in that. However, the Minister has put on record the fact that the words can encompass that particular avoidance of relevant benefit accrual.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08061792000006"></a>I should like to go a little further in relation to Amendment No. 27, which states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63"></a><a name="08061792000037"></a>&#147;The regulations may make different provisions for different categories of jobholder&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061792000035"></a>The Minister&#146;s response was that the period should not be too long, but perhaps I may explain why the regulations should allow for different periods. Most employees are on a weekly or monthly payroll and will see fairly quickly whether they have been auto-enrolled into something that they do not understand; they can then query why money is being taken from them. However, it is not always the case that payment is made on a weekly or monthly basis. I raised earlier the question of non-executive directors&#151;I will leave that as open business between us at this stage&#151;some of whom are paid quarterly. I imagine that other part-time employments pay quarterly as well. It could be three months or more before such people get their first

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08061792000007"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to point out that there are many circumstances when it would be right and appropriate for a longer period to be specified by the Government. The Minister pushed back and said, &#147;We can do longer, but we should not give people a long time because, basically, we want to keep their options to opt out restricted&#148;. He should consider that it is perfectly reasonable to have periods longer than three months&#151;I think that that has been referred to as the time period&#151;for certain categories of employee. That is the point that I have been seeking to make with my amendments. I shall formally move my amendment in order to keep the debate going. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08061792000010"></a>Unlike the situation in which my noble friend Lady Noakes found herself a few minutes ago, in this case the Minister has not quite shot my fox. Indeed, it is not even wounded. I said on Second Reading that I assumed that when an employee opted out of automatic enrolment within the permitted period the money would have been put into some kind of escrow account. The Minister did not correct me then; he has not done so since in one of his now famous letters; and he did not just now when he succeeded in pre-empting my noble friend. I can only assume that I was right.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08061792000011"></a>The Minister said that it is too soon to state how this will operate in terms of who will control the money and take responsibility for repayment and how it will be refunded. I certainly accept that. However, it is not too early to say to whom it will be refunded: in other words, who will get the money. There must be a policy on this somewhere; without one, you can hardly start discussions with stakeholders. Will the employee get only his input back and the employer get his whack, or will the employee get the lot? I said on Second Reading that I doubted that interest would be paid to anyone and I assume that this is still the Government&#146;s intention.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08061792000012"></a>I have already expressed my concern about the amount of information flying around with regard to Clause 5 and automatic re-enrolment. Clause 7 concerns the jobholder&#146;s right to opt out. Subsection (7) tries to specify the content, or at least some of it, that must be sent to the jobholder. We know that the jobholder must give notice of his intention to opt out in a prescribed form as specified in subsection (6), which Amendment No. 24 will not amend. That subsection, together with subsection (7), remains as it is printed in the Bill. They both, however, will refer to new subsections (4) and (5), inserted by Amendment No. 24. I am sorry

The purpose of my amendment is to establish just how much information the notice in subsections (4) and (5) in government Amendment No. 24 will consist of and to find out how the jobholder is expected to know what the Bill calls &#147;the effect&#148; that the notice will have on him and his further actions. Obviously, one effect is that he will lose the pension savings that he would have had had he remained in the scheme; the other is that he will get his money back. Will the information in the notice be as basic as that, or does the Secretary of State intend to prescribe something more complicated?</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, raised some issues about circumstances in which a longer opt-out period might be appropriate. An interesting issue is the extent to which jobholders seeing a wages or salary slip with the deduction is an important component of this. I do not say that it is not, but let me reiterate that the Bill does not place a limit on the opt-out period in any way, nor does it stipulate that it must be the same for all jobholders. The point that the noble Baroness has raised ought to be taken into consideration in our deliberations on that. I hope that that deals with that point.</p>

I thought that it was clear that the employer&#146;s contribution would go back to the employer and the employee&#146;s contribution would go back to the employee, subject to whether the employee has had a tax deduction in the first instance, in which case we go back to how that relief is to be generated. It would likely follow&#151;again, this is still the subject of detailed consideration&#151;that the contribution coming back would have to be taxed. If you deduct it from what is taxed in the first instance and it comes back, that would somehow need to be put into reverse. However, the principle is clear. The employer&#146;s contribution comes back to the employer and the employee&#146;s contribution comes back to the employee.</p>

Again, that depends a little on the timing and mechanics of the opt-out. This is still under consideration. Whether we opt out at a point in time when the payment has been made into the scheme or while it is still in transit into the scheme is a detail that we need to work through as we develop this policy, but I would hang on to the point that the employer&#146;s contribution goes back to the employer and the employee&#146;s to the employee. I hope that that has addressed the issue.</p>

It does not matter whether it is in transit or not. If the employee opts out within the prescribed period&#151;Ministers were, I know, thinking of a month for that, but we will see what transpires&#151;there will be an amount of money floating around that is going back, as the noble Lord has now said to me but which I did not understand before, to the employee or the employer as appropriate.

Even in the arrangements for personal accounts, they will turn out to be deferred wages. Wages are owed to the employee, surely. I leave the noble Lord to chew that over because it is a slightly extreme thought.</p>

In terms of where the money is, it depends on the arrangements by which payments are made from the employer into the scheme and at what point in that process the opt-out is exercised. If the money has reached the scheme, there will need to be a process for the money to come back out of the scheme. If the money has not yet reached the scheme, it will be somewhere with the employer or in transit, in escrow or not, but probably not. Those processes need to be worked through. As to who the direct recipient should be, it depends in part on the process by which tax relief is obtained, because it may well be that the employer has to tax that refund. It depends a little on what arrangements are entered into. We cannot be prescriptive until we have worked through some of that detail.</p>

Unfortunately I cannot say that. However, I do not think that even if we had had a lengthy discussion we would have covered the one point that I wish to make with this amendment, which is to add an extra two subsections to Clause 7, the first to say that a jobholder may give notice under this clause within a prescribed period before the automatic enrolment or re-enrolment date and the second to say that, if a jobholder gives such notice, no contributions  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_981"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 981</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>may be taken from the jobholder or the employer on behalf of the jobholder, notwithstanding any prescribed conditions for their repayment. The amendment seeks to ensure that a jobholder is not prevented from opting out before the automatic enrolment date, thus stopping the process before any contributions are taken either from his pay packet or the employer&#146;s account.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08061792000028"></a>We are not talking about inconsiderable sums that are going into what I call an escrow account and what the Minister sometimes calls an escrow account. Even if the qualifying scheme takes only the minimum contribution of 3 per cent from the jobholder, at the top end we are potentially talking about more than &#163;80 disappearing with little warning for several weeks from the jobholder&#146;s pay packet. I hope that my maths is correct. The figure is 3 per cent of &#163;2,795, which is one-12th of &#163;33,540&#151;in other words, the UEL. For someone earning at the bottom end, the figure that I calculate is &#163;12.58. That is likely to represent a significant loss of income to a low earner.</p>

<a name="80617-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08061792000029"></a>Not only would giving a jobholder the possibility of opting out before the automatic enrolment or re-enrolment date allow him to preserve the whole of his pay packet if he considered it necessary, but it would save an awful lot of time and money that would otherwise be wasted on the collection and repayment of all those contributions mentioned in the previous group of amendments. My amendment would do nothing to weaken the advantages of auto-enrolment. There will be just as much inertia about opting out before the first contribution has been taken as after that point; indeed, there is probably much more, as the jobholder will not just have experienced a sudden 3 per cent drop in his take-home pay. I beg to move.</p>

We are keen to ensure that jobholders are aware of the effect of opting out before they take such a step. An individual cannot opt out of pension saving until they are in pension saving in the first place. People&#146;s circumstances change. The opt-out decision must be a considered one. We do not want people to rush for the exit just because pension saving might be new for them or because they have at some time in the past made a decision not to save for a pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08061792000031"></a>I am concerned that the amendment would subvert the reforms. It would encourage premature and hasty decisions and increase the risk of employer coercion. It would allow a jobholder effectively to halt any attempts to enrol them into pension saving, and they would thereby lose the benefit of an employer contribution. We recognise that individuals will need access to relevant and accurate information when they are auto-enrolled, as in any other circumstances when they are making decisions about their retirement, and Clause 9 reflects that. However, we must avoid subverting the central objective of the reforms. I hope that the noble Lord understands why I am unable to accept the amendment. I urge him to withdraw it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08061795000003"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment would insert a new clause after Clause 7. Clause 7 allows opting out of auto-enrolment during a period after joining that is yet to be specified, as we have just been debating. My new clause would allow an employee to opt out at any time, but only from a future date; that is, it would not involve going back and refunding contributions, as an early opt-out under Clause 7 provides. Obviously people&#146;s circumstances change; they may not be able to afford to continue their contributions or they may analyse that they will not receive enough back from future contributions, due to means-tested benefits or otherwise.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08061795000004"></a>The Explanatory Notes for Clause 7 say that active members of a scheme are free to cancel membership at any time, but there is nothing in the Bill to allow that. It may well be an intrinsic legal right within an occupational pension scheme, but in the context of the Bill it would be better to provide specifically for later opting-out. That would include the ability of the Secretary of State to prescribe the content of a notice and would deal with all the other matters that Clause 7 deals with in respect of early opt-outs. For example, it must surely be important that an individual is informed of the effect of his or her decision, in the same way as an early opt-out under Clause 7 will be. Presumably, it will be important to inform the individual of their rights to opt back in and the effect of automatic re-enrolment.</p>

I suspect she has probably anticipated my response. Clause 7 completely undoes scheme membership and guarantees a refund to those jobholders who opt out. Active members of a workplace pension scheme may stop contributing at any time. I assure the Committee that Section 160 of the Pension Schemes Act 1993 will remain in force and that, when these reforms are in place, individuals will still be able to cancel active membership after the opt-out period ends. The noble Baroness&#146;s proposition to put a separate process in the Bill is therefore unnecessary. It also adds to administration, which her noble friend is keen to avoid. There will be the ongoing right, embedded in existing pension scheme legislation, for people to withdraw from a pension scheme in accordance with that legislation and the rules of the scheme.</p>

The Government seem quite prepared to heap unnecessary burdens on employers, whom they view largely as &#147;coercive&#148; and &#147;abusive&#148;, words that have recurred today. Here I am trying to impose a small burden on employers&#151;not my normal wont&#151;in order that employees are reminded of their rights and obligations in relation to pensions. I urge the Minister to think again on this. While I accept that an employee can opt out under existing pension legislation in the context of the Bill, which is trying to draw people back in all the time to ensure that they understand what their rights and obligations are, it is right to specify the terms on which they can opt out, to remind them of the consequences of opting out and to remind them of the automatic re-enrolment process that will come and hit them within three years in any event. It is not enough just to say that they can opt out at any time and good luck to them; that is not the tenor of the approach to employees throughout the rest of the Bill, which is to try to keep them drawn into the scheme and to make it difficult for them to stop saving. For today, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08061795000019"></a>I declare an interest as chairman of BACEE for the past 10 years. Others have an equally strong interest. The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, who is on the opposition Front Bench, has been on the governing body for a number of years&#151;I cannot quite remember how long, but she will no doubt tell us. The noble Lord, Lord Roper, was chairman of our organisation in the 1980s&#151;it had a slightly different name at the time, but I shall come on to that. I welcome the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, to our debate, and we all want to hear what the Minister says when he winds up.</p>

Sadly, BACEE, which has been widely acknowledged by successive Foreign Secretaries as a notably successful FCO non-departmental public body&#151;that is an appalling mouthful, but I think that we all know what we mean by it&#151;has had to close. This is the direct result of the FCO&#146;s decision in August 2005 under a previous Foreign Secretary&#151;I do not blame the present incumbents&#151;to withdraw the grant in aid. I and my colleagues on the governing body have made it clear that we regard this decision as short-sighted and prejudicial to British interests in the area. It was not a wise decision, but an economy made by the Foreign Office under pressure from the Treasury, and it will come to regret it in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08061795000021"></a>BACEE has had a proud history. Under its then title of the British East-West Centre, when the noble Lord, Lord Roper, was its chair, it kept channels open to the countries of the eastern bloc, as it was then, by organising conferences and seminars, to which some of us went. It was very important that we reached out to a number of independent people in those countries. We were an independent organisation, which was very important because it meant that we acted as a valuable counterweight to the propaganda of communist-front organisations.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08061795000022"></a>Then, after the collapse of Soviet rule in eastern and central Europe in 1989 and 1990, we did valuable work in promoting the values of civil society and helped prepare those newly independent countries for membership of the European Union through seminars, round tables and conferences targeted specifically at the political, judicial, civil service and media leaderships. Since 1991, there have been more than 5,500 participants in BACEE programmes, including more than 60 current and former Ministers from the area as well as four Heads of Government and 10 Foreign Ministers. That is a pretty impressive list.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08061795000023"></a>Then, just to show that we were moving on again, as the EU moved towards enlargement, we did not rest on our laurels but, with the active encouragement of the then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, turned our focus to neighbouring countries outside the EU. We continued our work in the west Balkans, which is a vital area for Europe, and expanded our activities to include Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus and Turkey.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08061795000024"></a>Our programmes have been centred traditionally on well prepared conferences, seminars and study visits, but the key note of our work throughout the period has been the building-up of an extraordinary network of contacts, which with the help of our embassies in the region we developed and proved extraordinarily useful to our foreign policy. I mention as an example the New Serbia Forum, which BACEE organised in the late 1990s to prepare for a democratic, post-Milosevic Yugoslavia. It was supported not only by the British but also by the Hungarian and Swiss Governments, and proved to be one of BACEE&#146;s greatest successes. It is perhaps significant that many of the participants in the New Serbia Forum continue to play a role today in ensuring the survival of the democratic system in Serbia, which is vital to the whole European Union.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08061795000025"></a>Central and eastern Europe remains an area of key importance to the United Kingdom. Almost half the member states of the European Union, including a key heavyweight in Poland, come from the region. EU decisions on key issues, including trade, the environment, organised crime and terrorism, and energy, will require their support, to say nothing of relations with Russia. It is vital that the Foreign Office continues to focus its attention on this area and does not think that, just because those countries are in the EU, we need not worry about them any more. BACEE&#146;s governing body will want to be certain that the FO continues its work and continues to be interested in the area. I hope that the Minister will satisfy us in that regard.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08061795000026"></a>BACEE has made its own contribution to keeping our values alive and retaining interest in the area by setting up in conjunction with the School of Slavonic and East European Studies a series of public lectures or conferences, which one hopes will be held for a long time to come. Our first public lecture will be held in the autumn. The Foreign Office has assured us that it will be in the Locarno or &#147;another fine room&#148; there&#151;it is apparently a technical term. I hope that the present Foreign Secretary will be our first lecturer&#151;he certainly ought to be&#151;and I think that he would do a very good job.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08061795000027"></a>I conclude, because we are allowed only 10 minutes and there are other speakers. On behalf of the governing body, which has included parliamentarians of all parties&#151;I mention from the present governing body not only the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, but David Curry MP and Gisela Stuart MP&#151;I would like to thank parliamentarians of all parties and representatives of the media, the judiciary, business and universities who have helped us in our work. We could not have carried it out without the support of all those people who have given their activities entirely free. I thank successive chairmen of BACEE&#151;I think that the noble Lord, Lord Roper, will say a few words about them. I

I mention also his predecessor, Sir John Birch. Last but not least, I thank the governing body which worked so hard to make the work of BACEE a success.</p>

I was for 12 years a member of the governing body of what was then the Great Britain-East Europe Centre and chairman from 1987 to 1990. Like the noble Lord, Lord Radice, I should like on this occasion to congratulate those who have done so much over the 40 years&#146; life of the two bodies&#151;the body which transformed its name in 1991 to the British Association for Central and Eastern Europe&#151;on what has been an extraordinary service and an extremely important part of our country&#146;s external relations at very little cost.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="080617102000003"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Radice, said, we celebrate and we regret. I congratulate him on his period of 10 years as chairman of the governing body, a period which has not been an easy one but one in which, as he said&#151;and I shall return to it&#151;the organisation has moved particularly towards the west Balkans and into other areas, including Ukraine, and involving even people from Belarus, discussing questions and reporting human rights. These informal approaches are extremely important in those countries.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="080617102000004"></a>The 40 years of BACEE&#146;s existence can be divided into three periods. The first 20 years was the period of the Cold War. During that period only four countries were involved&#151;Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania. Then there was the period of transition at the end of the 1980s and into the 1990s, with the addition of Poland in 1986, the Baltic states and Albania and more recently the concentration on the successor states of former Yugoslavia, together with Turkey, Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="080617102000005"></a>I first heard of the plans for the creation of the Great Britain-East Europe Centre when I was visiting Romania in 1966. It was in the flat of John Birch, who was first secretary in the British Embassy. Doreen Berry, who had been a senior official in the external services of the BBC and who was to be deputy director of the centre, was also visiting Bucharest and over dinner I heard what was planned to create this centre. When the centre went public in the following year, it was my noble friend Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank who was the Minister responsible for the launch of the Great Britain-East Europe Centre.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="080617102000006"></a>The governing body was then under the very distinguished chairmanship of Sir Gilbert Longden, a Conservative, with John Mackintosh, then a Labour Member of Parliament, as the vice-chairman. The centre and BACEE have had chairmen from both Houses throughout their existence. Sir Gilbert Longden was followed by the late Lord Walston and then myself. I was followed by Nigel Forman, at that time a Conservative MP, and then the late Lord Kelvedon, who was succeeded by the noble Lord, Lord Radice.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="080617102000007"></a>It has also benefited from a remarkable series of retired diplomats who have been directors. The first two were Sir William Harpham and Sir Donald Logan,  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_987"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 987</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>followed by Alan Brooke Turner and then, as the noble Lord, Lord Radice, said, Sir John Birch and, most recently, Nicholas Jarrold. As well as bringing together members of both Houses, the governing body has also been able to draw on a remarkable number of academics, journalists, lawyers and businessmen who gave their time not only in participating in the work of the governing body but also in round tables, study tours, giving advice to visitors and providing talks to visitors when they came to this country. We made an estimate that if you were to value the time that was given by the members of the governing body in various ways it was equivalent to the funds provided each year by the Foreign Office.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="080617102000008"></a>The early period of the Cold War was not always easy. Some countries were more prepared for serious exchanges than others. The first round table I attended as a very new Member of Parliament in 1970 was an Anglo-Hungarian round table held in Brasenose College, Oxford. It was a success and the Hungarians seemed interested to be exposed to the range of free ideas coming from the British participants. Indeed, my impression looking back over that period was that the Hungarians were always more open than most of their partners in the exchanges. Finding effective partners was not always easy at that time. Inevitably they were official and, although there was a range of people, there were some who were closer to the centre of power in their countries than others. We thought it was useful that we were able to expose them to the sorts of ideas and societies which we represented.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="080617102000009"></a>After the Hungarians, we had very good relations with the Bulgarians, perhaps because the first two directors had previously served as ambassadors in Bulgaria and therefore had very good contacts in that country. With Hungary and Bulgaria the round tables were able to cover a wide range of issues, including political ones. With Czechoslovakia and Romania the situation was rather more difficult, particularly in Czechoslovakia after the events of 1968, the time of the inception of the centre. Indeed we had to limit ourselves to having rather technical exchanges. I remember the ultimate one being discussions about hill farming in Bohemia related to hill farming in Wales. Similarly, with the gradual hardening of the situation in Romania under Ceausescu, the ground was not particularly fertile.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="080617102000010"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Radice, said, however, the most interesting period in many ways was the extraordinary work which, after 1991, BACEE was able to do at the end of the Cold War with the departure of the Soviet forces. About 5,500 politicians, civil servants, judges, journalists and businessmen, who would form civil society as potential governors and potential governments, came not to be lectured but to see how democracy worked under the rule of law in a market society. The discussions and exchanges have proved very useful. They have left us with a very useful network of friends, not only of BACEE but of this country, in the countries concerned.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="080617102000011"></a>The third phase was towards the beginning of this century when attention moved from the countries that were well on their way to joining NATO and the European Union to the countries of former Yugoslavia

As has been mentioned, probably the most interesting thing here&#151;very much the inspiration of Sir John Birch&#151;was the creation of the New Serbia Forum which provided a framework for the people who were going to provide the post-Milosevic government in Belgrade to get to know each other, to work together and to draw up the plans for a democratic and free Serbia.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="080617102000012"></a>I believe that the successor states of Yugoslavia&#151;states such as Bosnia, Macedonia and, though not a successor state, Albania&#151;still need the sort of assistance which has been provided by BACEE over the years. This informal, second-track form of co-operation is able to do things in a particularly helpful way. In the same way Moldova and the Ukraine, which are developing democracies, need continued assistance.</p>

<a name="80617-0012.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="080617102000013"></a>BACEE&#146;s methods will continue to be invaluable and that is why, like the noble Lord, Lord Radice, I hope that the Minister can say that, although the organisation is no longer in existence, the work which it has been doing can be continued by new methods.</p>

I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Roper, for his account of the earlier years. It is a great story of British achievement and also the achievement of those who attended the seminars and meetings of what might be described as an international roving Chatham House, an entity that was here, there and everywhere. Other countries have similar organisations of all kinds, but the focus on eastern Europe of this organisation and its predecessor was really of crucial importance.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="080617102000015"></a>One of the great things, to which the noble Lord, Lord Roper, alluded, was the lack of condescension in the approach that BACEE made to people. One can imagine the sensitivity needed in those approaches, particularly in the grimmer days of the Cold War, when contacts were much more limited. The turbulent history of eastern Europe was a complicated matrix, which people needed to absorb to work for BACEE, as volunteers and members of staff, in order to avoid the intense irritation that the recipients of their words of advice would feel if it was handled in the wrong way. In fact, it was handled with great sensitivity.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="080617102000016"></a>We remember the old Foreign Office enthusiasm for BACEE in the old days&#151;and we come on to that theme now. We need to hear from the Minister about what has happened, and so on, and just to remind us again about what I think is a sad story. I speak only personally, although I also represent these Benches, but I think that there was an argument for keeping BACEE going, even after the huge changes in the political economy of the principal countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="080617102000017"></a>The only one of these countries that, sadly, I know at all well&#151;and this is a terrible confession on my part&#151;is Moldova, which is just about the smallest of them. Moldova would not resent people saying in the  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_989"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 989</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>westernmost part of western Europe that that country needs urgent help of all kinds. It is a country of great poverty, but it has a sophisticated political leadership of all the parties and is trying to find its way forward. It is next door to much bigger countries&#151;Romania, with all its problems, and Ukraine. That is one country to which particular attention needs to be given. The All-Party Moldova Group is trying to focus on those themes as well, particularly after a very successful visit several years ago. The other countries, regrettably, I know only from brief visits, so I am not an expert, as are the noble Lord, Lord Radice, the outgoing chairman&#151;I say, sadly, now that BACEE has closed&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Roper, one of the previous distinguished chairmen, with their detailed knowledge of these matters.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="080617102000018"></a>A lot of good was done. Various reports were issued over the period and many references were made to the successes with those countries. Of course, BACEE was even more important in the sense that too many members of the public in western European countries, because of how the press writes its stories, thought that everything was much more wonderful in our countries than in the single-party state, Communist countries. On the other hand, the propaganda in the single-party state, Communist countries said that everything was much worse in Dickensian terms for people living in western European democracies. The Soviet Union used to focus on lots of stories about Dickensian England in the 1950s and 1960s. There were many such examples; people forgot about the obvious complications of all those sophisticated eastern European societies, some of which had been flourishing democracies or putative quasi-democracies before the Second World War, but did not have a chance to complete that process.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="080617102000019"></a>Obviously, BACEE&#146;s was a small effort in terms of the amount of political and other activity put in to change the nature of those countries, but 5,000 people is not a bad tally, as the noble Lord, Lord Roper, suggested. It must have had some considerable effect, as people saw the huge changes coming from the fall of the Wall, which was very abrupt&#151;and thank goodness it was done in peaceful conditions. We should pay tribute sometimes to these things&#151;for example, when we recall how the Red Army in East Germany recognised the reality of those fundamental changes, when it would have been so easy for senior military personnel in that army to make a different decision, fatally different and terribly tragic, to try to keep the status quo going. They knew what was happening because of how people voted with their feet and the Trabants poured into Czechoslovakia and elsewhere. It has now since become fashionable to have a convertible Trabant in eastern Germany; it is regarded as a very glamorous car. Things change in all societies.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="080617102000020"></a>The efforts that were made then and the way in which people reacted to them presaged very substantial changes. Those countries could easily have had their own alliances locally or regionally or become democracies of one kind or another more gradually; but they did not, and we now see the amazing difference. One might sum up the history of BACEE, and the observations of its members and staff over the years, as the three

Franco-German reconciliation in western Europe was an amazing story, to which the British press do not give enough attention; indeed, some newspapers in Britain do not like the idea much, for some bizarre reason. The second story was how the Soviet Union came to and end, in remarkably peaceful circumstances. Russia had its own internal coups, but they did not affect anyone outside. We should pay credit to the quality of the leadership in Russia and the Soviet Union for achieving those things, although President Gorbachev was very disappointed with how they did not keep the Supreme Soviet and some of the other structures.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080617102000021"></a>The final story must be the gradual approach and culmination of becoming EU members for quite a few of those countries&#151;eight of them, originally, and then Bulgaria and Romania following and making it 10. It is an amazing story of an achievement. Bumpy rides are still to come, which is why an organisation such as BACEE should still exist&#151;but, sadly, it does not. Other countries will be joining the European Union. Heaven forfend that I mention the subject of tomorrow&#146;s debate&#151;the Third Reading of the European Union (Amendment) Bill&#151;but if the Lisbon treaty somehow revives in due course, with the consent of the Irish people and in whatever form, with adjustments, that, too, will help those new countries. Their enthusiasm for the institutional arrangements to ensure that the community of 27 countries worked properly has been very marked, often much more so than that of the long-standing member states. There was a common feeling about the necessity of all those things.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="080617102000022"></a>In August 2005, BACEE was closed down, under the then Foreign Secretary. The outstanding Foreign Secretary now, David Miliband, might have made a different decision, but you never know. In those days, in the summer of 2005, the morale in the Foreign Office was very low, with the various budget cuts scything through the building and the embassies. Personally, I think that it was overdone, but Governments will always say that they have to make cuts in the modern world. Far too many missions have been closed down. In the mean time, the Minister, who is widely respected for many different reasons and not only because of his UN past, can give us an explanation and perhaps also try to defend that closure, because I personally regret it and feel that it was a mistake.</p>

It is right and proper to call for the Government&#146;s assessment of the work of the British Association for Central and Eastern Europe. I declare an interest at this stage, having been a member since 1994, when it was chaired enthusiastically by my late noble friend Lord Kelvedon. Yet I cannot help but think that, had a more thorough assessment taken place before it was closed, we might not be depending solely on hindsight to appreciate its work. It is a platitude that in many parts of life we do not know what we have until it has gone, but I know, and noble Lords will agree, that that is not how Governments should operate.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="080617102000024"></a>It was particularly interesting to hear BACEE&#146;s history from the noble Lord, Lord Roper. The budget of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was supposed to be bolstered by efficiencies arising from restructuring, cutting administrative costs and changing the emphasis of resources. Instead, it seems to have atrophied. It has been mentioned before in this Chamber that, since May 1997, the Government have closed eight British embassies, eight high commissions and 18 British consulates, making a total of 34 closures in 10 years. This was intended to create a diplomatic surge, with diplomats reassigned to Middle Eastern posts, but it has dampened morale and led many to leave the service. While unfortunate, however, that is not the primary subject of our debate today. Any department or company faced with similar cuts might expect some of these effects, although I would argue that, if they were better managed, they would not have been so pronounced.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="080617102000025"></a>I mention all this because I think that it reveals a trend that finds its most glaring example in the closure of BACEE. Instead of pruning administrative inefficiencies, the FCO seems to have gone for some of the things that are doing substantial amounts of good for relatively minor amounts of money. BACEE cost the Foreign Office about &#163;260,000. Now we shall have to rely perhaps more and more on the British Council and all its good work. I am pleased to see the noble Lord, Lord Kinnock, in his place for the debate.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="080617102000026"></a>Perhaps in a new bureaucratic age of governance, a perverse cost-benefit analysis would not give BACEE good marks, but I find that hard to believe. Since 1991, more than 5,000 politicians, civil servants, judges, journalists and businessmen from countries in central and eastern Europe have participated in BACEE&#146;s courses, seminars and conferences, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Radice. It was undeniably popular. Many of the leaders in power today had experiences with BACEE. They remain still grateful and good friends. The evidence for this, and perhaps even the cause of this popularity, was the long-standing approach of responding to requests for help instead of imposing an unwelcome paternalism.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="080617102000027"></a>BACEE&#146;s efforts were directed at improving civil society. Out of the ashes of authoritarian rule, many central and eastern European countries continue to struggle to transform into participative democracies. These are states in transition and this period of transition could not be a more important one. It is not enough to throw off the yoke of one-party rule. Education and assistance in young democracies strengthen the fabric of civil society and provide the foundation for its long-term success.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para12"></a>

Is he satisfied that BACEE&#146;s aims of promoting democracy, human rights and the rule of law have been achieved in central and eastern Europe? I suspect that it would be hard to persuade your Lordships&#146; House that there is no longer a pressing need for democracy, human rights and the rule of law in this part of Europe. Indeed, BACEE organised visits for Croatian and Kosovan delegations right up to its final week. Croatian membership of the EU is pending. Kosovo remains an issue of serious importance on the

How can the Minister feel that the British Government can afford to decrease our resources and influence in this area at such a crucial time?</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="080617102000029"></a>What must be mentioned is the kind of help that BACEE provided under the brilliant guidance of the former ambassador, Nicholas Jarrold, whom the noble Lord, Lord Radice, mentioned, his staff and all the distinguished members. The work of BACEE was project-based. It was resolutely not for profit. What it did, however, was to foster dialogue. This seems to me one of the most important ways of assisting countries eager to establish themselves on a firmer democratic footing and to empower their citizenry.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="080617102000030"></a>We believe in the importance of the European Union and enlargement of the European Union, especially in this part of the world, including Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro and others. We also believe that the EU should function properly, without too much red tape or centralisation. BACEE was exactly one of the right bodies helping to do this. Perhaps it will take hindsight for the Minister to appreciate the work of BACEE and the work that is still to be done. I hope that the contacts and good will that it worked hard to establish will continue in some form. Thus, I hope that the Minister will include in his assessment his thoughts on how progress will be made in BACEE&#146;s absence. Perhaps then he will understand what has been lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="080617102000032"></a>Of the many important things that I learnt tonight, the least consequential was that my colleagues in the Foreign Office misled me about the pronunciation of BACEE. I was told it was said like Bassey in Shirley Bassey. I now realise that one consequence of Foreign Office cuts is that clearly it does not follow the American entertainment scene closely enough&#151;it meant Count Basie. More seriously, and with great humility, I concur with all noble Lords who have spoken that the British Association for Central and Eastern Europe has clearly done extraordinary work during the past 40 years in central and eastern Europe.</p>

It has been closed not only because others can now take on the task that is left but principally because the core of the task has been fulfilled. These countries, barren of civil society and democratic tradition when the association began its work 40 years ago, are now, for the most part, thriving, prosperous and democratic members of the European Union. The Foreign Secretary recognised this when he wrote recently to my noble friend Lord Radice. He thanked all who had worked for BACEE for their dedication and highlighted the invaluable contribution

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="080617102000034"></a>My noble friend Lord Radice, the noble Lord, Lord Roper, and the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, laid out at considerable length the many successes of the British Association for Central and Eastern Europe since its birth in 1967. It was born when relations were difficult between us and countries in eastern Europe, when traditional diplomacy was constrained by the stand-offs of the Cold War and the Iron Curtain and when we had to find unconventional means to reach into those societies to build friendships and to open eyes to liberty and freedom. Against the backdrop of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the association during those dark and difficult years kept links and was able to work in countries where government organisations such as the Foreign Office found it difficult to operate.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="080617102000035"></a>BACEE worked hard in that period to promote a closer understanding between the British people and the countries of central and eastern Europe. It pursued its aim of promoting democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Europe through conferences, seminars, round tables and study visits in the UK and abroad. We face a very different context because of dramatic changes during the short life of the organisation. The Berlin Wall has fallen, the Soviet Union has collapsed and many countries have emerged that are keen to join the European Union or that have closer ties with the EU than they did before. Throughout the political turbulence, BACEE focused its efforts on building democratic institutions and market economies, freedom of expression, the effective administration of justice and respect for human rights. It added to its study tours and worked in new countries, focusing on Ukraine, Belarus and others where it did not initially work. Nevertheless, in many regards, much of that mission has been accomplished.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="080617102000036"></a>In particular, since 1991, as has been mentioned, 5,500 people from those countries have participated in BACEE programmes. These include more than 60 former or current Ministers, four heads of government and 10 Foreign Ministers. BACEE&#146;s founders, whom we have honoured tonight, never faltered in their belief that both halves of a then divided Europe shared a common destiny. They have been proved right: 10 of the central and eastern European countries where they worked are now members of the European Union; Croatia, Macedonia and Turkey have candidate status; and others are keen to join the EU in time. We remain committed to promoting the enlargement of the European Union, as we see enlargement as one of the most successful policy tools of achieving democracy, market reform and the rule of law. All of us who watched the efforts of candidate countries to adjust to meet the test of addressing their democracy deficits&#151;corruption, lack of rule of law and issues of market liberalisation&#151;know that the lever of membership of the Union in its own ways built on the BACEE concept and moved that agenda dramatically forward.</p>

He noted that its project work had helped to underpin the remarkable reforms that we have seen in the region in recent years. While we can celebrate what has been achieved, I agree with the noble Baroness that we should not complacently believe that the work is done and that democracy, human rights and the rule of law are cemented and set in stone throughout the region. There are important tasks ahead of us. I assure the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, that we continue to invest in this area. The Foreign Office still spends &#163;8 million a year on promoting stability, good governance and market reforms in the pre-accession and neighbourhood countries.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="080617102000038"></a>While the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, was brave enough to mention the Lisbon treaty and the European Union, let me make a debating point. The European Union spends &#163;3 billion a year on the same group of countries to support their efforts to prepare for membership, in the promotion of democracy and the rule of law and the building of market economies. The good Count&#146;s work, by which I mean BACEE, remains very much a subject of priority attention here and in the European Union as a whole.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="080617102000039"></a>I am delighted that BACEE does not end here tonight or that it ended when it closed its doors as an active organisation. The association has decided to perpetuate its name and its valuable work through an annual lecture on a theme related to that work. My noble friend said that he hoped that the first lecture would be this autumn, under the auspices of the School of Slavonic and East European Studies, in a fine room in the Foreign Office. Like him, I was glad to hear that things other than wine came in fine forms. We hope that the Foreign Secretary will be able to give that first lecture, but my noble friend informed me of this hope only this afternoon and I have not had an opportunity to confirm whether the Foreign Secretary will be able to take up that invitation.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="080617102000040"></a>In closing, I add my thanks and congratulations to the thanks and praise that have been advanced in this debate for all who were directors of BACEE, those who were members of its board and those who chaired it during the past 40 years. If ever there has been an historic achievement that has changed the direction of our world in the past 40 years, it is the securing of freedom for the countries of the former Soviet Union. BACEE has played an honoured and honourable role, which history will remember proudly, in the liberation of that region.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="080617102000046"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment standing in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Dean is a probing amendment. I am confident that it is virtuous; I am equally confident that it is technically deficient, but as it is probing, the second problem may matter less than the first.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="080617102000047"></a>This amendment is about the &#163;5,000 range of earnings that is not taken into account in personal accounts, which have been mentioned several times today. They will raise 8 per cent&#151; that is, 4 per cent from the employee, 3 per cent from the employer and 1 per cent from tax relief&#151;on all earnings, broadly speaking, within the income bands of the lower earnings limit&#151;LEL&#151;at just over &#163;5,000, and an upper earnings limit, which was originally judged to be aligned with UEL, although that has now become more complicated.</p>

<a name="80617-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="080617102000048"></a>That has the advantage of aligning personal accounts with basic state pension, unlike the standard defined contribution schemes&#151;money purchase schemes&#151;that, as far as I am aware, cover all earnings from the first pound onwards, although they may cap in some cases at the top. We can understand why that de minimis of the LEL was introduced for personal accounts because the main beneficiaries are likely to be low-paid, part-time women often in several micro jobs. It did not make sense for them to contribute to a personal account while being disqualified from access to a basic state pension, which would then have meant that their BSP was incomplete, and they could have lost their personal account pound for pound under some scenarios.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80617-0014.htm"/>


<a name="80617-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="080617102000049"></a>With the help of your Lordships on Report, I hope to persuade the Government, if they are not already persuaded, that we must reverse that situation on buying back missing years of BSP. Because of the alignment with BSP, the first &#163;5,000 of earnings in personal accounts are not covered for pension purposes. It makes sense, given BSP rules, for some women where all of their jobs are below the LEL, even though they may find themselves in a hard-luck position. I understand the administrative complexity. Given the 30-year rule, after April 2010 and, I hope with the support of the House, a change in buy-back rules, this would matter less as more women will have a full basic state pension.</p>

<a name="80617-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="080617102000050"></a>Of course, it seldom matters for men, who will have a basic state pension of 30 years, because most of them expect to work for 40 or even 44 years and beyond. That is why the Government sensibly permitted people&#151;particularly women&#151;to make voluntary contributions into personal accounts to cover the first &#163;5,000 of earnings. This is particularly useful for women who have built up a decent pot through working full-time, but who then, because of their caring responsibilities, need to cut their hours and their pay, while wishing, perfectly sensibly, to protect their pension. However, no employers are required to match those voluntary contributions on the first &#163;5,000. Again, this makes sense if a woman has several microjobs, none of which takes her above the LEL. How employers would sort that out, I do not know. This amendment  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_996"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 996</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>does not seek to help those employees, but applies only to those whose job or jobs take them above the LEL.</p>

<a name="80617-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="080617102000051"></a>When a woman is on half median earnings&#151;&#163;11,000 a year&#151;only half her pay qualifies for pension contributions as of right. Effectively, her employer is not contributing at 3 per cent, but pro rata at 1.5 per cent&#151;unlike the average 7 per cent in a conventional DC workplace pension. Even worse is the situation of a woman with multiple jobs. I gather that 350,000 people have multiple jobs over the LEL and are not in pensions. Who are they? They are highly likely to be women putting together a portfolio around childcare or elder care, with two modest jobs, one of them while the children are at school, the other perhaps later in the evenings or at weekends when their partner is around to help with the children. Equally, they may be younger people&#151;writers, musicians, actors&#151;fitting in shorter-hour jobs around their primary passion. If one of those young people, or a woman with childcare or elder care responsibilities, had two &#163;6,000 jobs, she would get a pension contribution of only &#163;1,000 on each of those jobs&#151;&#163;2,000 in total contributing to her pension fund. If she had one job at &#163;12,000, the employer and she would be contributing on &#163;7,000 in a personal account; or, if she was in a DC scheme, they would both be contributing on &#163;12,000 in a personal account. So, it is &#163;2,000 if you are in two &#163;6,000 jobs; &#163;7,000 if you are in one &#163;12,000 job with a personal account; &#163;12,000 if you are in a DC workplace scheme. This amendment says that where an employee with a personal account over the LEL wishes to contribute a percentage of her pay to cover the first &#163;5,000, the employer must likewise contribute his 3 per cent. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was exceedingly helpful earlier when he reminded the House that pensions are deferred pay. However, women on half median income with personal accounts are only going to get half their deferred pay reflected in pension contributions.</p>

<a name="80617-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="080617102000052"></a>Why do I hope that your Lordships will support the principle of this amendment? First, we already accept the principle that the employer, if he has a scheme, must contribute to a pension if the employee is aged between 16 and 22. We have teased that out already. The principle that an employee&#146;s voluntary contribution must be matched by the employer is not new. That is in the Bill and we discussed it earlier. Secondly, the employer already does this in his own DC scheme. He expects to cover the full range of earnings; from &#163;1, not from &#163;5,036. The amendment would establish a more level playing field between the two and might even discourage him from levelling down. After all, in his own workplace pension scheme, he not only covers the full &#163;12,000, but also puts in a higher contribution of 7 per cent on the whole of that &#163;12,000, rather than the 3 per cent on half of that &#163;12,000.</p>

<a name="80617-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="080617102000053"></a>Thirdly, no one is talking about large sums. They will not represent a burden on business or bankrupt small employers. I calculate that it would cost up to &#163;150 a year extra for employers&#151;&#163;3 a week&#151;and &#163;200 a year extra for employees. However, it could make all the difference in terms of outcomes, because it would effectively double the pension pot. For example, with 10 years&#146; savings in a personal account at 8 per cent and on half median earnings of &#163;11,000, the  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_997"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 997</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>woman&#146;s pot would be &#163;10,000 and not &#163;5,000 after 10 years. After 20 years, she would have a pot of &#163;27,000 instead of &#163;14,000. After 30 years, she would have a pot of &#163;53,000 and not &#163;27,000. After 40 years, she would have a pot of &#163;93,000 and not &#163;48,000. Even 10 years&#146; worth of savings produces capital of &#163;10,000 to take into retirement and, at 30 years, an additional weekly income of nearly &#163;80 to add to a full state pension and S2P would mean that someone on half median earnings would go into retirement with a replacement income of 100 per cent of their working life income. Therefore, there would be no problems with IRBs or means-tested benefits, and probably without the pressure of children and possibly with the mortgage sorted, she would be more comfortably off than ever before.</p>

<a name="80617-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="080617102000054"></a>I think that the proposal is a price worth paying. We have established the principle; the cost would be modest; and the long-term investment roll-up for employees, particularly for women in poorer paid jobs, would be immense. It would not be onerous to employers; they already expect to do that in their own DC schemes at double the contribution rate for the full range of earnings. Therefore, I hope that my noble friend will think seriously about what we are saying to women. One of the biggest risks to women of taking on personal accounts is the fact that very little of their earnings may be covered by pension contributions and, as a result, they will have false expectations of safety and security in retirement. That could be avoided if my noble friend were minded to follow through on the principle of the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

We look forward very much to hearing from the Minister, but clearly the question is whether this will lead to considerable extra costs and administrative burdens for PADA or for employers. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some detail and figures on that if he resists the amendment, and in particular I hope that he will not just say, &#147;This is the bargain we struck&#148;, or, &#147;It was a deal&#148;.

No one can doubt that. The Government have said that they estimate that around 350,000 individuals have multiple jobs, earn a total annual income of over &#163;5,000 and do not currently contribute to a private pension. Like the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, I urge the Government to firm up on those figures because, as I said, they are an estimate. However, it is clear that a significant minority of these people&#151;however many there are&#151;will be women, for exactly the reasons that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, has just given us.</p>

<a name="80617-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="080617102000058"></a>It has been put to us that amending the use of the lower earnings limit so that it is retained for auto-enrolment but removed for contributions, will solve both the insubstantial contributions problem and the multiple jobs problem. The lower earnings limit of &#163;5,035, combined with auto-enrolment, will create a scenario, we are told, where inappropriately small amounts will be contributed to personal accounts. Trivial contributions will be of limited use to savers and will be disproportionately expensive to administer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="080617102000059"></a>Secondly, the Bill rightly requires a separate application for each employment. However, the use of the lower earnings limit means that people holding multiple jobs will not receive employer contributions on the first &#163;5,035 of their earnings in each separate employment, even if they were to enrol into a scheme with each employer. That clearly disadvantages those with multiple low-paid jobs. It is suggested to us that the lower earnings limit will remain as the point at which employees become auto-enrolled. However, there will also be the option to opt in to the scheme on earnings less than that and receive employer contributions. That is the whole point of the noble Baroness's amendment. All savers would receive employer contributions from zero, rather than from &#163;5,035. That reduces the potential for inappropriately small balances to arise. The minimum contribution at 8 per cent for auto-enrolled scheme members would, I understand, be about &#163;8 per participant per week.</p>

<a name="80617-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="080617102000060"></a>I mentioned earlier in our discussion my worries about costs of auto-enrolment to small and medium-sized enterprises. I understand that small business groups are beginning to come round to support the proposal, as the small contribution cost would be compensated by the significant reduction in administrative complexity. However, the important thing is that they are not there yet, so I am glad that this is a probing amendment at this stage&#151;especially as small employers who do not currently have schemes are the ones who may very well object, because it will cost them quite a lot of money to create schemes.</p>

<a name="80617-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="080617102000061"></a>There is another problem that the noble Baroness did not mention with those ladies&#151;usually ladies anyway&#151;employed as housekeepers, daily cleaners and what have you, who would fall under the amendment. I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I think that that would mean that those employers would have to contribute to the personal accounts scheme at the 4 per cent level. I repeat what I said&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, approved of

Honestly, I believe that the jury is out on the amendment and we will see whether there is general agreement among small and medium-sized enterprises, especially those that do not currently have schemes, that they could come on board. If not, I rather think that this will be a no-no.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="080617104000002"></a>This is a probing amendment. It is not ideally worded. The difficulty that both my noble friend and I are working under is that the Minister does not appear to accept that this is an issue and that we should work jointly to find a way through it.

That is to be applauded. But the Bill would not be doing its job if it just left 400,000 people without any pension protection. I will be interested to hear what the Minister says. I will listen in particular for an acknowledgement that this problem is difficult to work through and that the Government are prepared to discuss and work through it to a solution which, while it may not be ideal, is a step in the right direction. At the moment, 400,000 people have nothing to hope for while they work in one or more jobs that pay an income of less than &#163;5,000 a year. I support this amendment.</p>

I say to my noble friend Lady Dean that the Government see this as an issue about how people on low pay, particularly women, can be best supported and how the pension system might be made most relevant to them. Let me also deal upfront with this issue of multiple jobs. Sometimes we conflate a number of issues. Somebody can have multiple jobs because of seasonal work where the jobs are consecutive; you can have jobs that are concurrent or overlapping. They do not necessarily lead to the same result. Somebody who had a job for six months on &#163;4,000 a year and a second job in a second part of the year for &#163;4,000 would have, in broad terms, the same outcome as a person with a job paying &#163;8,000 a year. It depends on pay reference periods; it depends on fluctuating earnings; it depends on whether there are waiting times for any of the schemes involved. We need to unpick that issue as well.</p>

<a name="80617-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="080617104000006"></a>Similarly, somebody might be on low but bunched earnings&#151;they would earn &#163;3,000 a year but would do so over a three or four-month period. Depending

We need to unpick that. My noble friend gave me a particular challenge. My briefing is based on the assumption that those people who opted in, because they did not have qualified earnings, would bring with them an employer contribution. The proposition that I believe is being advanced is that those who have qualifying earnings are in, but choose to pay contributions on the first &#163;5,000 and not just on the band of earnings. That should attract an employer contribution. Will my noble friend clarify that for me? Obviously, different issues arise from that. Is my noble friend saying that those people who do not reach the qualifying earnings threshold, but who have a right to opt in, can also, when they opt in, have a right to bring with them an employer contribution; or is my noble friend saying that if you have qualifying earnings above the threshold, contributions should be payable by the employer, not only in respect of that excess but from &#163;0?</p>

I was trying to exclude people whose earnings in a particular job were below the LEL. For all sorts of reasons, this could end up with someone having half a dozen microjobs as a cleaner. You could not start adding them all up and then try to divvy up an employer contribution between five or six employers. Where somebody has a job that gives them qualifying earnings above &#163;5,035, if they choose to make voluntary contributions on that first &#163;5,000, just like 16 to 22 year-olds, that should automatically attract an employer contribution as well, so that the whole sum of the earnings can be taken into account for pension purposes. Therefore, there is potentially an equal playing field between a person on a job of &#163;12,000 a year and somebody with two jobs of &#163;6,000 a year.</p>

In that sense, there is a different issue to think through, which would look at somebody in a qualifying scheme where the contribution of the employer was based on a more traditional definition of earnings&#151;basic pay&#151;with that employer contributing from &#163;0. The proposition in respect of personal accounts and auto-enrolment generally is that the earnings figure should be a different definition&#151;a broader band.

The Pensions Commission looked at&#151;we have done so too&#151;all the issues about who would contribute what and who would have responsibility for paying into the scheme, particularly when you have two or more employers with different schemes, different pay reference periods and fluctuating earnings. It would be an administrative nightmare and is not something that has been accomplished. I would like to take away and think through the different issues that my noble friend Lady Hollis has raised tonight&#151;without any commitment, of course&#151;as we need to explore some of them.</p>

He made a point about housekeepers, which went back to the point made by my noble friend about complexity. The amendment increases simplicity. The proposal would apply only if you had earnings that took you above the LEL. You could make voluntary contributions below it, and only that would trigger the employer contribution. If the housekeeper earned less than &#163;5,000, the situation is as now. If the employee was earning &#163;8,000, the employer would have to make pension arrangements that, currently, bring the &#163;5,000 to &#163;8,000 under personal accounts, and for the extra &#163;150 per year, would do it

In that sense, it is very simple. Employer and employee pay a pension contribution in the same way that tax and national insurance are calculated. Pension contributions are calculated on earnings from &#163;0, even though there may be exemption bands, as there are for taxation or national insurance purposes. There will be simplicity of alignment between what now happens in DC schemes and what happens in personal accounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="080617104000015"></a>My noble friend rightly made the point that DC schemes have a different basis. They operate according to basic pay, rather than qualifying earnings. Some helpful statistics have come from Standard Life. I have not been able to verify them but have no reason to think that they are incorrect. Only 3 per cent of women&#146;s earnings, and 8 per cent of men&#146;s, are not basic. For most women, particularly, the gap between basic earnings, on which DC schemes are calculated, and qualifying earnings, on which personal accounts are calculated, is minimal, if there is a difference at all. This comes into to the debate on qualifying earnings, which we may have later. Qualifying earnings will obviously include the occasional hour or two of overtime in retail, but most women are not in the commission-heavy territory of, say, car salesmen, as some men are and where a bigger problem arises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="080617104000016"></a>I was heartened by my noble friend&#146;s recognition that this is an issue where we could, with consent&#151;I hope&#151;take the industry forward with us. We are not dealing with big sums, but it could transform outcomes for lower-paid women. This will make a significant difference to the ability, as a result of personal accounts, to float women off the means-testing advice conundrum, which we are all rightly concerned about. I am cheered by my noble friend&#146;s words. I am sorry that my drafting was correct. Next time I will make sure&#151;intentionally, as well as unintentionally&#151;that it is incorrect; that way we will have a level playing field.

Who does the Minister believe is the employer in that situation? Is it the agency or the temporary employer?

Regulations made under Clause 9 will set out what information must be given, under what circumstances, how and when it should be given, and by whom. We recognise, for instance, that individuals will need to know whether they are eligible for automatic enrolment, the name of the scheme they have been enrolled into, and their right to opt out and how that can be done.

At least I am asking the same question on different points, but his answers are almost identical. I am beginning to come to the conclusion that much of this Bill is being enacted a year too early. Of course it is quite right to bring forward all the PADA stuff, but no Minister in DWP is able to give answers to many of our questions for the simple reason, which I accept, that they do not know. I have commented on why they do not know several times today.</p>

Where in the existing legislation? I think&#151;I certainly hope&#151;that the Government see the policy behind the Bill as a see-saw. On one end of the see-saw you have business and its interests; on the other end, you have savers, pension savers particularly, and up until now the see-saw has balanced exactly. I remember when I was first married my wife and I went to St James&#146;s Park and sat on a see-saw&#151;and it did not move, much to my embarrassment and that of my new wife.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="080617110000010"></a>I am intrigued by his answer to my question about agency workers. He said that it depends on who does the paying, but very often two payments are made. For example, in the agricultural industry, one payment is made to the agency providing the workers, and the other is paid&#151;on a daily or weekly rate&#151;to the workers employed by the farmer or nurseryman or whoever it happens to be. I shall have to look into that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="080617110000011"></a>The Minister said there was provision in the Bill. Does he mean the agency workers Act&#151;if that is what it is called&#151;which we debated a year or two ago, or does he mean the Bill? He indicates that he means the Bill.

He has described the policy as a see-saw. It has been very important to construct consensus and balance around this. I would describe it as being an equilibrium, and that is where we are. In our deliberations we need to be mindful of the consensus, which has been hard fought for and hard won, and I am sure it will be uppermost in our minds.</p>

I understand they are in the disclosure of information regulations of 1996. Specifically on agency workers, I was referring to Clause 78 of the Bill, where, for the avoidance of doubt, there is a provision to identify who the relevant person is. That person is clearly specified as the person who is responsible for paying the agency worker in respect of the work. It is to avoid some of the confusion that arises in these arrangements that these specific provisions are there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="080617110000019"></a>The CBI&#146;s submission to your Lordships&#146; House said quite clearly that employers must not be responsible for providing advice on savings. This has been echoed by other organisations; for example, the Association of Certified Accountants. The CBI says that it is the responsibility of the Government and the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority to provide advice. I am not sure that it is absolutely right since we do not expect PADA to be in existence much beyond the inception of personal accounts, but the Government certainly need to bear the primary responsibility.</p>

<a name="80617-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="080617110000020"></a>The Liberal Democrat Benches led an interesting debate earlier today in connection with Amendment No. 9 relating to the over-50s, a group which may need advice, but the problem is much wider than that. Employers are aware of the risks of being auto-enrolled into schemes from which their employees will gain no or insufficient benefit, but what employers are clear about is that it is not reasonable that they should be in the firing line to bear any risk related to that.</p>

<a name="80617-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="080617110000021"></a>My new clause has two subsections. The first says that employers are not required to give advice to jobholders or workers. They may choose to do so, that is entirely up to them, but they must not be required to. That is a declaratory thing that employers may find helpful. The second subsection says that employers do not incur any liability in respect of information given in accordance with Clause 9. We have just been discussing that clause. It gives the Secretary of State a wide power in relation to the giving of information. The only thing we have established so far is that the Government do not know what that will involve, which raises a lot of concerns for those who might end up on the receiving end of what these regulations may have in store.</p>

<a name="80617-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="080617110000022"></a>The boundary between information and advice is quite a fine one. One of the concerns is that the regulations, in setting information, may stray over that line into advice. Subsection (2) of my amendment effectively provides employers with a safe harbour if they comply with the Clause 9 regulations. The Minister has outlined that the Government will be taking advice from PADA. Generally there is a lack of clarity about what these information requirements will involve, in particular for employers. It is that lack of clarity that raises concerns in the minds of those acting on behalf of the business community. I hope that the Minister will see that my new clause provides needed reassurance to the business community, which will almost certainly have to bear the lion&#146;s share of the burden of implementing personal accounts on auto-enrolment. What they do not want to bear is any of the liability that might go with people ending up inappropriately in automatic enrolment. I beg to move.</p>

We are very much in favour of clarity where advice is concerned and it is clearly not the role of employers to give advice. We will obviously be even more sympathetic if, over the course of our discussions between now and Report, the Conservatives feel able to support us so we can work something out, making it quite clear that the responsibility for advice does not rest with employers but outside in a proper nationwide generic free service.

It was interesting in our previous debate that the Minister was quite reluctant to cross the line between information and advice. We need to be very clear on that so we support this amendment.</p>

The Government intend only that employers will be a conduit for information, not providers of it. That is a useful distinction to draw.</p>

<a name="80617-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="080617110000025"></a>I have not worked the implications through, but we were quite glad to have the &#147;in good faith&#148; clause in at various points of the 2004 Bill. I wonder whether that could apply to an employer who provides information in good faith in compliance with any regulations issued. I say that because one thinks about some of the problems we have had of alleged misunderstanding or leaflets allegedly going astray. &#147;In good faith&#148; then becomes a reasonable defence. I was told on one occasion that it would be a reasonable defence even though it is not in the Bill, but it might give appropriate additional comfort if it were there.</p>

We agree with the proposition.</p>

<a name="80617-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="080617110000027"></a>I can confirm that employers will not be required to give advice. The distinction between advice and information is important. I was not aware that I was reluctant to accept that distinction earlier; we think it is clear. However, there is no requirement now that people who join a pension scheme should receive advice, and that will not change with the introduction of automatic enrolment. Indeed, I go further: on the whole we do not believe that regulated advice will be necessary. The employer contribution will make the decision to save simple for most people.</p>

<a name="80617-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="080617110000028"></a>Some individuals may wish to seek guidance&#151;for example, those considering paying off large, high-interest debt first&#151;and that is the case for any financial decision. As I have said in response to a previous amendment, we may require employers to provide basic information to workers, such as which scheme they have been enrolled in, but not to provide advice.</p>

<a name="80617-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="080617110000029"></a>On the issue of liability, the proposed new clause aims to protect from any legal claims employers who provide information to jobholders. The employer will only ever be required to provide information of a type that we will prescribe in regulations. They will not be required to comment on the information provided. It is therefore difficult to envisage how an employer could be held liable for an individual&#146;s decision to remain in pension saving, given that the actions they take relate simply to fulfilling a statutory duty. Furthermore, holding an employer liable is particularly unlikely as the individual will receive information from the scheme on an ongoing basis about their savings and will be in a position to opt out at any time.</p>

I am disappointed that the Minister, while professing to be in the same place in respect of the substance of the amendment, did not find it appropriate to say that the Government welcomed the idea of an amendment. The first of the subsections, which is about not requiring advice, was meant to be declaratory so that there could be no misunderstanding of the role of employers and I can see that it might be regarded as otiose.</p>

<a name="80617-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="080617110000032"></a>I am much less clear about the issue of providing information in connection with Clause 9. Subsection (2) of my proposed new clause was designed to give a safe harbour to employers so that they would willingly, without reservations and caveats, take part in their obligations under Clause 9 when the regulations are laid. The Minister said that it was unlikely that they would have liability, but &#147;unlikely&#148; is not quite good enough for employers. I entirely take the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, raised about qualifying &#147;in good faith&#148;, or words of that nature. It goes without saying that you do not take safe harbour without having those kinds of sentiments that are associated with it, which may or may not be imported as a matter of law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="080617110000033"></a>This is an important issue for employers. Employers have been painted today as being on the whole rather a bad lot.

I therefore ask the Minister why the power in Clause 4 is not enough. Why cannot the two clauses&#151;to use a phrase that he has just used&#151;be conflated?

Clause 4 deals with a matter that is quite different from that in Clause 11, which relates to a power to stage the introduction of employer duties. It allows the Secretary of State to set regulations that stagger the commencement of the employer duties, including those relating to automatic enrolment. The regulation-making power will enable us to require different groups of employers to start to discharge the duties at different times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="080617110000040"></a>Staging the rollout of the employer duty will facilitate a smooth take-on of employers by the Pensions Regulator and pension schemes, including the personal accounts scheme. Staging will also allow a gradual increase in the volume of employers undertaking the duties, which will in turn assist delivery bodies and schemes in refining business processes in the light of operational experience. These processes will have been carefully considered and pre-tested ahead of launch, but, as with any project of this size, it is only sensible to build in opportunities for ongoing improvement in the rollout plans.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="080617110000041"></a>It is crucial that the personal accounts scheme is able to cope with the take-on of potentially large numbers of members in the early days. Latest analysis estimates that 1.3 million employers will be affected by the reforms. The leading option for staging is by business size. The clause also gives the Secretary of State the flexibility to choose staging by reference to one criterion or a combination of different criteria. While business size is our preferred option, we would be able to use the regulation-making power flexibly to ensure that the staged introduction of the duty was done in the most sensible way. We will work closely with key stakeholders to help us to determine the best option.</p>

That was not the case. It was quite natural that he wanted to be assured that the plans that he inherited were deliverable by carrying out a review.

<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="080617110000048"></a>The noble Lord said: We have already had reference to the lower earnings limit at &#163;5,035. By setting the start contribution facility of personal accounts, as it were, the Government are excluding those jobholders who have several part-time jobs, to whom the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, just referred. This group is largely composed of those workers whose saving habits the Government claim to be most concerned about: women, low earners and those with a lack of job stability.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="080617110000049"></a>In spite of the Minister&#146;s answers to the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, who is no longer in her place, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, I fail to understand why the Government have decided to exclude this group. I also do not understand why the lower earnings limit was the appropriate level at which to start paying pensions contributions. How many people whose total earning is above &#163;5,035 do they estimate will be excluded? We have had some figures, but I am not sure that they are appropriate on this occasion.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="080617110000050"></a>The other point is about administrative complexity. By calculating only qualifying earnings from &#163;5,035, the Government are imposing a great deal of administrative complexity on employers who already provide a pension but currently count all the earnings. I shall not repeat what we said on the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. I beg to move.</p>

Qualifying earnings will be calculated on earnings between &#163;5,035 and &#163;33,540, in 2006-07 earnings terms. The limits of the earnings band will be up-rated from its 2006-07 base, in line with changes in average earnings, to ensure the value of pension contributions keeps pace with individuals&#146; earnings. We shall have the opportunity to discuss that under a later amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="080617110000053"></a>The qualifying earnings band has two functions: first, the lower limit determines whether a worker qualifies to be automatically enrolled; and secondly, to

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="080617110000054"></a>The issue of pension saving for those on very low earnings is clearly a difficult and complex area. Our decision to use an earnings band is based on research done by the Pensions Commission. In designing the reforms, the commission focused on the importance of replacement rates. For those on low earnings, the state system is designed to provide them with high replacement rates, which calls into question the appropriateness of workplace pension savings for this group. This is why, in designing this reform, we have ensured that those on very low incomes will not be automatically enrolled into a pension and are not incentivised to save by the presence of an employer contribution.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="080617110000055"></a>In 2006-07, &#163;5,035 was the threshold at which most workers became liable for statutory deductions&#151;that is, national insurance contributions and so on. Removing the lower earnings limit would have the effect of making the employer contribution payable on earnings from pound one. This has an estimated cost of around &#163;1.9 billion a year, increasing total employer contributions from &#163;2.9 billion to &#163;4.8 billion a year, a cost which I would hope that the noble Lord recognises makes such a proposal prohibitive. The earnings band for both employer and worker contributions is a key plank of the Pensions Commission&#146;s recommendations. Removing the lower limit would unpick the core policy and the consensus on which we touched earlier, on which the reform is predicated. This, combined with the additional employer burden, leads me to ask the noble Lord not to press this amendment.</p>

I would love to have run with an amendment that covered as of right all earnings from pound one, irrespective of whether in each individual employment it was capped above or below the LEL. In other words, somebody who has five jobs of, say &#163;2,000 or &#163;3,000 each, which together bring in an income of &#163;15,000 would nonetheless have a pension contribution by an array of employers matched by the employee.

So I went for the administrative simplicity and what I thought was the feasibility of that amendment rather than the more generous amendment moved by the noble Lord.

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="080617110000063"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 41, for the avoidance of doubt, is a probing amendment. It is the first of a couple of amendments which seek to find out what the Government's policy is in relation to the band for qualifying earnings. The curious amounts in the Bill are the 2006-07 primary threshold and upper earnings limit for national insurance contributions purposes. We understand those are to be uprated in line with earnings.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="080617110000064"></a>The Pensions Commission originally proposed using the national insurance top and bottom limits for the band of earnings, and the Government in their first White Paper said that they agreed with the Pensions Commission that the band proposal was about right. In the December 2006 White Paper, the one which set out more detail about personal accounts, they said&#151;and this is in a footnote to paragraph 6.3:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_92"></a><a name="080617110000081"></a>&#147;When launched, the limits for the personal accounts earnings band will be aligned with the Primary Threshold and Upper Earnings Limit for National Insurance contributions&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080617110000073"></a>That implies that in 2012 this scheme would be picking up the then primary threshold and upper earnings limit. Since December 2006 we have had the now infamous 2007 Budget&#151;infamous largely because of the ill-judged attempted abolition of the 10 pence tax rate. One way of paying for that particular package is to raise the upper earnings limit of national insurance&#151;as the Minister well knows because we are debating that in the context of another Bill&#151;to the higher rate threshold for income tax purposes. So the upper earnings limit is rising quite a lot.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="080617110000065"></a>I ask in these amendments whether the Minister will set out for the House what policy now drives the setting of the qualifying earnings band. At the bottom end will it be linked with a primary threshold? If it is going to be the primary threshold in 2012, that is  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1013"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column 1013</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unlikely to be the same thing as setting the 2006 level uprated in line with earnings, because if the primary threshold remains in line with the personal allowance for income tax purposes the two will have diverged. Similarly at the upper earnings limit level it is likely to be raised to beyond the level that would be achieved by indexing 2006-07. So this is a probing amendment to invite the Minister to set out their policy, if indeed they have one for this. I beg to move.</p>

As we have already discussed, these reforms have been structured to set a median earner on course to achieve an income in retirement of around 45 per cent of their working-life earnings, in line with the Pensions Commission&#146;s recommendation.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="080617110000067"></a>The qualifying earnings band establishes a link between working-life earnings and pension saving. We selected the primary threshold and upper earnings limit for national insurance contributions in 2006-07 as the starting limits for the qualifying earnings band. These limits avoid automatically enrolling people on very low earnings, for whom state pensions already provide high income-replacement rates, cap compulsory employer contributions at the upper end and help focus these reforms at job holders on moderate to low earnings.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="080617110000068"></a>Having made this important link between earnings and pension savings, we need to maintain it. That is the key driver. We recognise the administrative simplification that sticking with the national insurance thresholds would provide. However, as we know, not all earnings bands are uprated by changes in average earnings. The upper earnings limit was increased in the 2008 Budget as part of a programme of tax simplification. This change would have widened the qualifying earnings band for pension saving had we at that point retained a link to the national insurance limits and significantly increased the costs to employers.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="080617110000069"></a>As the noble Baroness acknowledged in our discussions on the National Insurance Contributions Bill, we have confirmed our aspiration to relink the primary threshold with personal allowances and the upper earnings limit with the point at which higher rate tax is payable. Once aligned, the working assumption is that these are more likely to be uprated by prices than earnings. Indeed, the noble Baroness pressed an amendment on us to that effect in Committee. That would mean there would be a divergence of the increase in those bands by prices and the increase in these bands by earnings; therefore, we would have broken the link with earnings relationship, which is the important component of this measure, to ensure that we reach the 45 per cent replacement rate in retirement.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="080617110000070"></a>We recognise that this policy means that employers will have to work with a new earnings band. However, payroll software will be able handle the calculations with ease. I hope that that has explained our policy to the noble Baroness.</p>

It would be very helpful for my noble friend to provide forward projections on the increasing non-alignment of this cap, as against the alignment of the UEL with the upper tax threshold, so that we can see how they begin to diverge, particularly given that a &#163;3,600 cap on 8 per cent contributions cashes out at about &#163;45k, I think. That should provide plenty of head space for the sort of alignments that the noble Baroness was talking about. Can my noble friend help by writing to us more fully?</p>

However, I reaffirm the principle that if we aligned to the upper earnings limit in the primary threshold&#151;and those are generally uprated by inflation Rooker-wise and by everything that went with it&#151;there would be a potentially growing divergence, on the assumption that earnings are generally ahead of prices. Over time and the longer term, there could be a considerable divergence between those thresholds and the thresholds that we are considering when they are updated by earnings. I do not have data for the top end, but as regards the lower threshold, in 2012&#151;these are in 2006-07 earnings terms&#151;the amount would be &#163;5,035. It would be the same in 2030-40 in current earnings terms. If we uprated that band by prices, by 2040 the &#163;5,035 would have reduced to &#163;2,890 and we would be back with the problem of potentially incentivising people into pensions for whom the state was providing a better replacement rate. That is why we think the link with earnings is particularly important. I am happy to share the data with my noble friend and other noble Lords.</p>

The Government have just started on a process that is having a bit of a hiccup this year because they screwed up the 10p tax rate. The policy was to harmonise national insurance and income tax. Here we have a completely different set of rates overlaid on that, which will make it complicated for employees to understand the point at which they start paying tax, national insurance and pension contributions, so the cleanliness referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, has been removed.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="080617112000003"></a>The complexity is considerable for employees, and it is something that we want employees to relate to and understand. It is too easy to say that payroll software can pick up how it works for employers because this is going to micro-employers who have not in the past come into pension provision.

I emphasise to avoid doubt that this is a probing amendment about the sort of earnings that will count as qualifying, which will be exempt, and the effect that the decision will have on existing employers&#146; pension schemes of whatever sort.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="080617112000009"></a>The issue is that in personal accounts a total contribution of 8 per cent of earnings between &#163;5,035, in other words the LEL, and &#163;33,500 must be paid, of which the employer must pay at least 3 per cent. We all know that. Earnings include additional benefits such as overtime, commission and bonuses. If an employer wants to continue to operate their own scheme, rather than enrol staff in personal accounts they much check each pay period, either monthly or weekly to ensure that the contribution made to their scheme is at least as great as that which would have been made to personal accounts.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="080617112000010"></a>That is a problem because most private pension schemes currently use full basic earnings from &#163;1 upwards rather than ignoring the first &#163;5,035 and using a different sort of qualifying earnings.</p>

<a name="80617-0016.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="080617112000023"></a>Those schemes rarely take into account bonuses, overtime and commission. This adds administrative complexity and additional costs for the employer. Each month the employer needs to check that both the total contribution and the employer contribution made are at least as great as would be made to a personal account. There are also communication problems and potential employer-employee tension. The employer needs to explain this change to employees and may ask employees to pay additional contributions in pay periods where commission and bonus is earned. This is exacerbated by the fact that bonus and commission are often not paid evenly over the year. Employees may have to pay variable contributions, which might influence their decision on whether to stay in the scheme or opt out.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="080617112000011"></a>I believe that employers have three choices: accept the additional cost, complexity and communication problems caused by these changes; change their schemes to the same earnings definition as personal accounts; or close their schemes and enrol all employees in personal accounts. The Government&#151;indeed, all of us&#151;have made a point of trying to ensure that nothing in this Bill encourages employers to level down their schemes. The third point is therefore particularly important.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="080617112000012"></a>How does this affect employees? Employees may need to pay higher contributions in pay periods when bonuses or commission are paid. Contributions could change month to month or week to week. As the first &#163;5,035-worth of earnings are disregarded, employees who earn less than that amount in bonuses, commission and overtime will have less money paid into their pension funds. In addition, it is likely that employers will only have to pay the minimum contribution necessary and so employees may receive a lower employer payment. Employees who receive bonuses, commission or overtime of less than &#163;5,035 are most at risk of losing out&#151;in other words, low earners, the majority of whom are women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="080617112000013"></a>The question of whether bonuses, overtime et cetera should count towards qualifying earnings has a big impact in particular on money purchase schemes, and will be raised by my noble friend Lady Noakes later in her amendments to Clause 19. There are myriad perks that a jobholder can get from his employer that do not fall clearly into the definition given in the Bill. One obvious example is a car provided by the employer for his employee&#146;s use. Some employers give mileage payments for travel in the course of employment; others pay for all petrol used by their employee. I am sure that noble Lords can think of other perks, such as free plants from a nursery. This last example may be a little extreme, but noble Lords who know my background will see why I use it. The same point applies to any product made or sold by a firm and supplied to an employee for free.</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="080617112000014"></a>What advice will be given to employers to help them decide whether to count a payment? I am afraid that there is, as my noble friend Lady Noakes has just said, another complication. Earnings are calculated in different ways for income tax, where benefits of all kinds are counted, including those that I have just mentioned. However, in the calculation for national insurance, they are not. By using the lower earnings limit as the threshold for minimum earnings that qualify for auto-enrolment, do we not have a recipe for confusion? Subsection (3)(a) talks about what is included in the calculation: salary, wages, bonuses and overtime. As I pointed out at Second Reading, many existing employer pension schemes operate on the basis of any basic earnings, starting at &#163;1. Do the Government really want these employers to restructure their schemes so dramatically before they are given approval as qualifying schemes?</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="080617112000015"></a>Over the weekend, Joanne Segars, the chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94"></a><a name="080617112000026"></a>&#147;We support the Government&#146;s 2012 reforms but it is important that they do not add unnecessary costs to existing pension provision. All that is needed is a common sense change to the definition of Qualifying Earnings and we should see a good outcome for everyone. Ministers have underlined that they want the new Personal Accounts scheme to have a minimal impact on existing provision so we are hopeful that they will try to accommodate our concerns&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080617112000024"></a>I agree with her. That is why I tabled this amendment and why I have spoken rather more lengthily than I normally do. I beg to move.</p>

It is probably too late now but I would have found it hugely helpful if the amendments had been grouped because I think that we need to have a full discussion. We all agree that we want people to end up with the best-buy package, whatever that may be, but the question is: how do we provide a simple way of ensuring that they do so with as little alteration as possible to the existing structures of sound schemes, while ensuring that we do not build into the scheme a moral hazard whereby a few employers can pervert the notion of basic pay?</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="080617112000017"></a>If those are the contours of the debate, it seems to me that they are caught partly by this amendment, which is very interesting, and partly by the later amendments. Given that it is 10 minutes to 10, I am not sure what we do about that. Two companies, Scottish Widows and AEGON&#151;I know the people there a little and respect them greatly&#151;have told me that they are extremely worried about this issue. They feel that we are making problems here that we do not need to have. It may be that the Minister will wish to adduce arguments against that position, but at the moment I am disposed to believe that we have a real issue to address and I do not think that we can do it at 10 to 10&#151;I have a feeling that it will be split between two sets of debates.</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="080617112000018"></a>I am not sure of the best way forward. Ideally, the later amendments would have been grouped with this one but I see that they are starred and therefore that was not the case. I do not know whether my noble friend can help on this or whether the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is able to withdraw the amendment and recast it in some way for next Monday so that we can pick up these issues. I think that we will have the same debate twice and I do not think that that will be very fruitful, particularly at this time of the evening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="080617112000020"></a>Perhaps I may set out briefly where we stand: &#147;in some difficulty&#148; is probably the best summary. We have had some pretty heavy-duty lobbying. I do not say that in any unkind way; we are very glad that lobbying groups on both sides have taken the trouble to meet us and talk to us as much as they have, and on that I am sure that I speak for other Members around the Committee. On the one side, we have heard from the massed ranks of the NAPF, the CBI and the ABI, and from individual companies such as Norwich Union, Standard Life, AEGON and the Society of Pension Consultants. All, understandably, have made the point that they want to avoid costly changes to existing scheme rules, which have worked quite well and are well established. On the other side, equally persuasively, there is support for the definition in the Bill from organisations such as the Pension Coalition, Which?, the TUC, Help the Aged, Age Concern and the Commission for Equality and Human Rights, which

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="080617112000021"></a>I feel that the right answer&#151;I hope that we can work towards it&#151;is to have a compromise, perhaps based around some sort of grandfathering of existing schemes but with safeguards. However, to be honest&#151;and I believe that there is no harm in at least airing this now&#151;I find myself quite torn.</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="080617112000022"></a>I listen and talk to one group and think that they have some very good points; then I listen and talk to the other. This should be work in progress for the Government and I hope that they will consider carefully the fact that there are some serious issues and that they will not just ignore or brush aside the serious points made by the people who run the existing schemes.</p>

<a name="080617115000001"></a><a name="80617-0017.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80617-0017.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080617115000020"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I find myself in no difficulty, for once. This is genuinely work in progress for the Government. I hope that we will have a chance for a wider debate, but perhaps I may just deal with the script that I have.</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="080617115000002"></a>Clause 12 establishes both the qualifying earnings band and the range of reckonable pay components making up those earnings. Qualifying earnings underpin the calculation of contributions for money purchase pension arrangements and are also part of the criteria to determine whether a jobholder is to be automatically enrolled.</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="080617115000003"></a>Establishing a new minimum level of savings is vital if we are to realise our ambition of increasing pension savings, especially among moderate and low earners. Contributions need to be calculated at 8 per cent on a band of earnings as proposed by the Pensions Commission if they are to set a median earner with solid state entitlement on course to achieve an income in retirement of about 45 per cent of those median earnings. The commission proposed savings calculated on gross earnings. Reducing that drastically would affect the premise of the entire reform.</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="080617115000004"></a>We want to ensure that contributions are calculated on a wide definition of earnings. We are aware that about 65 per cent of those currently saving in defined contribution schemes have their contributions calculated on at least their basic pay. However, a narrower definition than planned would reduce the value of contributions, especially for workers with a low or no basic pay&#151;especially people who work in, retail, telesales and, as my noble friend referred to earlier, parts of the motor industry, for whom commission payments are a significant proportion of overall income.</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="080617115000005"></a>Reducing pay components could mean fewer workers reaching the point at which qualifying earnings trigger automatic enrolment. It would also open up a possible loophole that could be used for avoidance by enabling employers to reclassify their workers&#146; earnings, thereby reducing the level of contributions they are required to pay. I emphasise again that employers do not have to use those components. The requirement is to make contributions that would be equivalent or better than payments predicated on them. In addition, we do not want to include all earnings&#151;for example emoluments such as non-cash benefits. We do not consider that appropriate for the purposes of pension saving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="080617115000006"></a>Following discussion with stakeholders, we are amending Clause 28 to help and we will continue to listen to options which do not reduce the integrity of the policy. I stress that our focus is on the amount of money going into the schemes, not the method of calculation, and we are not asking schemes to change their arrangements. As stakeholders have highlighted, that may cause difficulties for both employers and their schemes. We continue to listen to their concerns and will consider reasonable options about how the test may be applied. We have already proposed an amendment to Clause 28, as I said.</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="080617115000007"></a>Some stakeholders have suggested transitional protection or grandfathering for existing schemes. However, we do not consider that to be a sustainable solution, as it will become increasingly complex over time and may undermine the new minimum level of saving for some workers. I know that others have suggested that there should be an annual reconciliation.</p>

<a name="80617-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="080617115000008"></a>I end by quoting from a statement by my honourable friend the Minister for pensions, Mike O'Brien:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95"></a><a name="080617115000019"></a>&#147;We must minimise any disruption to current pension arrangements, which is why the qualifying test must be designed in as simple a way as possible. I have listened to stakeholders and remain open to reasonable suggestions about how the test may be applied. We must strike a balance&#151;maximising new savers and saving, and supporting existing pension arrangements&#151;that's the key objective&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080617115000018"></a>I hope that, on that basis, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment, but I am sure that we will have another go at this next week, when we meet again.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000016"></a>The noble Lord said: The provision of an accessible public transport system in which people with reduced mobility can have the same opportunities to travel as other members of society is a key driver in improving their life chances and promoting social inclusion. Without accessible transport, people with reduced mobility are limited in their ability to access work, visit friends and family, participate in leisure activities or access healthcare and education facilities. That is why we have taken strong and positive action to ensure that public transport services are more accessible to the growing number of people who have previously faced difficulties when trying to use them.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000017"></a>Regulations requiring all new rail vehicles, buses and coaches to be accessible have already been introduced. There are around 4,700 accessible rail vehicles already in service which are covered by the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations, widely referred to as the RVAR. We should remember that many thousands of older rail vehicles have also been made more accessible by refurbishment.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000018"></a>The United Kingdom's leadership in this area has now been recognised at a European level and the European Commission has come forward with a new standard for the accessibility of trains. This is based largely on the RVAR. The introduction of the new standards is the reason why we are here today. The regulations before us are needed to prevent the application  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC362"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column GC362</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of dual regulatory regimes, European and domestic, in this area as the European standards will come into force automatically, through the Railways (Interoperability) Regulations 2006, while the domestic standards apply through the RVAR. It would not be desirable for a train to be subject to two different accessibility regimes. Therefore, since the new European standards will take precedence, the draft regulations before us contain provisions to disapply the RVAR from those trains to which the new standards will apply. The new European standard will apply to trains operated for passenger services on the UK mainline railway network, while the RVAR itself will remain as the accessibility standard for light rail, tram, metro and underground systems.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000019"></a>The Merits Committee has drawn the regulations to the special attention of the Committee because the exemptions under the new European regime that we are moving today are dealt with administratively&#151;as they already are for other aspects of that regime, such as signalling and radio communications&#151;rather than by statutory instrument. However, we are confident that consultation with the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee and others will ensure that the needs of people with reduced mobility are not taken lightly. No adverse comments were received on this issue during the consultation process.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000020"></a>We must also understand that we are talking only about limited exemptions for the oldest vehicles, which were built before any access standards were in place at all. There are no grounds for new trains to be introduced into service without being fully accessible. Simply disapplying the RVAR would leave the trains that were previously subject to it completely unregulated until they triggered the European standards by being refurbished. As that is clearly unacceptable, the draft regulations also ensure that there is an obligation on train operating companies to continue to operate these trains in an accessible manner, as if they were still subject to the RVAR standards, unless and until they trigger the new standards.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000021"></a>In addition to facilitating the introduction of the new European standards, the draft regulations also deliver on our commitment to set an end date of 1 January 2020 by which time all trains must be accessible. This measure was originally included in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 and enjoyed full cross-party support during its passage through the House of Lords.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000022"></a>Members of the House of Lords have consistently demonstrated both their interest in, and the strength of their support for, measures that improve the accessibility of our railways. That is the main reason why we are seeking approval for these regulations today. They will help secure significant improvements for all passengers, not just people with reduced mobility, and the rail industry has already been working to similar standards for approaching a decade. For those reasons I commend these draft regulations to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

However, I have a few points to put to the Minister. I should also like to point out that there is a little concern, felt particularly by train operators and other interest groups, about the effect of having two sets of regulations.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000025"></a>Train operators have expressed particular concern about the regulations&#146; effect on refurbishments. Are the Government sure that the regulations will not prejudice the future refurbishment of existing trains? We have two sets of regulations but train operators are refurbishing their trains to the first set. Might there not now be a hiatus in the refurbishment of carriages and trains? Can the Government assure us that operators will not be discouraged from refurbishing trains?</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000026"></a>Secondly, operators and interest groups have given mixed reviews regarding what form the regulation enforcement regime will take. Many operators feel that compliance should be enforced by existing safety management regulation. Some have suggested that it would be logical for the Office of Rail Regulation to take on a single enforcement role, whereas I gather that light railway operators have argued that Her Majesty&#146;s Railway Inspectorate should be the enforcement body. What steps have the Government taken to ensure that operators&#146; concerns about how the regulations will be enforced have been addressed? Will they ensure that the rail regulator is properly resourced to ensure compliance with any regulations? Can the Minister answer the questions on the enforcement of the new regulations?</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000027"></a>My next point is linked to my first point. The Minister said that there is an end date for compliance with the new European regulations. Might it not be better if new trains comply with regulations as they come on stream? What will happen to carriages that do not comply by 2020? Will they be taken out of the system? There might be a real problem about having sufficient stock at that time if some carriages are not compliant with the new regulations.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000028"></a>Whatever we do to provide accessibility for disabled people, sometimes the trains are so crowded&#151;certainly the trains that I use&#151;that people cannot get to the toilet if they want to because it is impossible to move. Would the Minister like to comment on that? How will disabled people get around on trains if they are so full most of the time?</p>

I shall start with his second point about enforcement. Can my noble friend explain whether the enforcement will be done by the Office of Rail Regulation rather than by the department? We now have an ORR that covers both safety and economic regulations. It seems to me that to comply with the principles of independent regulation that we have discussed so many times here in Grand Committee and in the Chamber, the enforcement of the various policies in the regulations should be done by the ORR. I shall be glad to hear the Minister&#146;s comments on that.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC364"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column GC364</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of Train Operating Companies which thinks that the changes in the regulations are in conflict with the European directive they are meant to transpose. The problem is that they introduce retrospective application of a TSI, which is not the intention of the interoperability directive. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, gave some examples. Many of us travel on Mark 3 passenger coaches, which have been around for a long time and will probably, the way things are going at the moment, be around after 2020.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000031"></a>As the TSIs more or less forbid retrospective application, the Government have a few problems. For example, there is a proposal to amend the 2006 interoperability regulations which transposed into UK law the interoperability directive (2001/16) and superseded the Railway (Interoperability) (High-Speed) Regulations 2002. The latter is one of the instruments we are talking about. However, the amendment proposes the retrospective application of this TSI to rolling stock placed in service before 1 August 2006&#151;and there is an awful lot of that around&#151;which is not deemed to be authorised under Regulation 4 of the RVA (IRS). The effect is to enforce changes to all pre-1999 rolling stock that has not been subsequently modified to comply either with the RVAR or the PRM TSI. Such rolling stock will have to comply with the PRM TSI by 2020 regardless of whether it will be subject to a major upgrade. But these changes might conflict with Article 1 of the interoperability directive (2001/16) which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08061798000162"></a>&#147;These conditions concern the ... placing in service ... of the parts of the system placed in service after the date of entry into force of this Directive&#148;.</p>
</ul><h5><a name="08061798000170"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000032"></a>I believe that ATOC has a point in suggesting that there is a serious legal anomaly between these draft regulations and the TSIs which they are supposed to be implementing. Can my noble friend give an assurance that the changes to the regulations do not set a precedent for retrospective application of the European technical specification which covers virtually every aspect of the railway? The disabled element is only one aspect, although a very important one, of specifications that cover all kinds of things. If we are to go down the route of retrospective application then it will cost somebody, probably eventually the Government, a great deal of money. It is a dangerous precedent.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000033"></a>Can my noble friend therefore also confirm which trains will be required to be modified by 2020? Is there a modification programme that would helpfully be linked to the other essential changes to rolling stock which will be required depending on where they are, including the introduction of ERTMS&#151;which, as we know, is due to be implemented on the Great Western by 2016 and then rolled out across the network in the following 10 years or so? My third question is fairly obvious: where will the budget for all this come from?</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000034"></a>Finally, I do not think that the new Southern franchise being let had any mention of the need to take into account or comply with these new regulations. Does the department intend to introduce these accessibility requirements within this franchise and all other franchises at the earliest possible date to ensure that modifications are taking place? I would be grateful to my noble friend for answers to those questions.</p>

I would like an assurance from the Minister that any exemptions to these regulations will come back for consideration in this House and will not simply be pushed through unilaterally by the Department for Transport.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000036"></a><a name="80617-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80617-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08061798000187"></a>Lord Addington:</b> I have a couple of brief comments. My noble friend has drawn attention to how the exemptions were dealt with. I think that I am the only Member of the Committee who took part in the whole passage of the Disability Discrimination Act, during which we had long and sometimes bitter arguments, and long and bloody battles, about ensuring that we kept control of these exemptions and monitored them.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000037"></a>As luck would have it, I was also a member of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee when we first noticed the number of exemptions. The first exemption I saw was about a vintage railway system. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, would agree on this, but my attitude to that exemption was: if you are a person in a wheelchair who wants a 1930s travel experience, by all means go in the guards van along with the mailbags, but if you are using a train as a commuter in the modern age, you require slightly better standards.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000038"></a>Let us not forget that improved accessibility in getting on and off trains also tends to help other people as well. It is almost a truism, but accessibility for those in wheelchairs tends also to help those pushing prams or carrying heavy bags. Such changes benefit the public as a whole. I am afraid that the rail industry has resisted these changes and commented that there should perhaps be other priorities. It is an ongoing discussion and there are merits on both sides. But I think that that aspect should bear some weight in the discussion.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000039"></a>As my noble friend pointed out, we have said that we want control over this because far too many exemptions have been granted in the past. If the department has a better lobby group than the disability lobby&#151;and between the transport and disability lobbies there is an interesting tug of war&#151;and the transport lobby gains access to the right ear, it is easy to see that exemptions may be passed rather too readily, as has happened. It would be a good step forward to ensure that Parliament is aware when these exemptions are passed. I look to the Minister for an assurance that we will have some way of checking this in future. We agree with the Merits Committee that the assurance we were given under the 2005 Act should still be valid. We should be able to see what is happening and check it. We do not have a good record here. In the past the transport lobby or the railways lobby seemed to get their way rather too readily.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000041"></a>I will come back to the Merits Committee point and exemptions as I wish to deal first with the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, who, like me, is a fairly regular user of the rail network and  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC366"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column GC366</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>enjoys its benefits and, no doubt, some of its discomforts, as we all do. He asked three questions which concerned primarily the refurbishment process and whether future refurbishments would be prejudiced in any way. I do not think that they will. The regulations certainly recognise previous RVAR compliance and I do not think that there will be a problem there. I understand why there might be concerns but I do not think that there will be any great difficulty in that regard. We have a good track record on this and we are ahead of the game. We are very familiar with the European standard. We are simply raising the bar a little but also taking careful account of compliance considerations.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000042"></a>I heard what the noble Lords, Lord Hanningfield and Lord Berkeley, said about enforcement. We think it is right that there should be enforcement through Her Majesty&#146;s Railway Inspectorate, which has an enviable track record of enforcement on safety matters. That is entirely consistent with its safety role. It is respected in the industry here and abroad for the way in which it operates, for the standards it sets and the valuable advice and guidance that it gives. Over the long history of our railway network the inspectorate has been an important element in improving safety standards and ensuring that, by and large, we travel in safety and in comfort on the network.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000043"></a>Overcrowding was mentioned. We are now well into the procurement process for 1,300 additional carriages, which will be targeted on the busiest parts of the network. They will ease overcrowding and ensure that proper facilities are made available for people with particular needs. I do not know what the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, thinks but I consider that on my line from Brighton the rolling stock is of a very good standard and provides a good level of comfort. Those of us who have commuted for longer than we sometimes care to remember have certainly seen those standards improve. I think that there is very good space provision. It is obviously best to travel outside the rush hour, but the new trains and carriages have done a great deal to improve the quality of services. I do not think that we will have an issue there; and with the way in which the procurement process is working, being targeted at easing pinch points, there should ultimately be greater satisfaction with the service.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, is, as ever, acute to the issues and well-versed in European concerns. I am grateful to him for supplying us with advanced warning of his questions. His first point was to request assurances that changes to the regulations will not set a precedent for retrospective application. Since 2001 we have made it clear that we intend to apply the accessibility regulations to rail vehicles introduced before the RVAR came into force and to set an end date for the national rail fleet to be accessible. In our view, the forthcoming replacement of the RVAR by the PRM TSI does not affect that commitment.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000045"></a>The noble Lord also asked for confirmation about which trains will be required to be modified by the 2020 date and whether we will establish a programme for modification linked to other essential changes to rolling stock. Which trains operate past the end date is a commercial matter for vehicle owners. They have identified to the Department for Transport which  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC367"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column GC367</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fleets they believe may fall into that category, and officials are working with them and DPTAC to identify the work that needs to be put in place. This has largely been welcomed as allowing vehicle owners to plan and to include rectification work during other upgrades and in maintenance schedules, consequently reducing the impact on vehicle availability. With the concerns about overcrowding, that is very important.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000046"></a>The noble Lord also asked whether we have the necessary budget to achieve full compliance by the 2020 date. The additional cost of setting the end date will generally be met in the first instance by the train owners who will recover them through increased leasing charges. When bidding for franchises, potential operators will take account of them in their bid, which will inform the amount of subsidy required from or premium paid to the Government.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000047"></a>Finally, the noble Lord asked a question about the new conditions for the Southern franchise. He said that they make no mention of the need to take account of and to comply with the new regulations and asked whether it is the intention of the department to introduce these requirements for accessibility within the franchise and, for that matter, other franchises at the earliest possible date. The current consultation regarding the South Central franchise seeks stakeholders&#146; views on additional items to be included in the invitation to tender when it is issued later this year. As we stated during consultation on the draft regulations in front of us today, it is already the Government&#146;s intention to specify accessibility works on a targeted basis for trains that bidders may be considering using in franchises in future. I do not think we should forget the significant improvements in accessibility that the rail industry has already delivered on older trains during the refurbishment process. We must not be complacent, but a pretty good job has been done, and that speaks volumes about the improvements that the rail service has enjoyed across the network and through the rail companies.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000048"></a>We have taken the comments and concerns of the Merits Committee very seriously. I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Glasgow, and the noble Lord, Lord Addington, for raising them today. In response to the Merits Committee, the department did not propose making amendments to the interoperability regulations of 2006 in order to introduce a statutory instrument for derogations under the PRM TSI; that is not our preferred policy. We wish to retain consistency in the manner of handling derogations against other TSIs, especially on regulation principles.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000049"></a>In the context of the interoperability regime, we believe that the SI route is disproportionate, especially when compared with the administrative manner of handling dispensations from station accessibility requirements to which the PRM TSI also applies. It has to be remembered that dispensations from bus and coach access regulations are handled administratively. This approach has not received adverse comment from the stakeholders that have been consulted, including DPTAC, which I would argue is a very authoritative body in this area. During the consultation process we made it very clear that we intend to use the exemption

<a name="80617-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000050"></a>The rail industry is very well aware that significant items such as passenger information systems, priority seats and wheelchair spaces must be provided. As a user, I would argue that those three things are of the utmost importance: they provide people with information in a timely way; there must be priority seating; and there must be very generous space allowances for wheelchairs so that there is proper movement. No adverse comments on this were received during consultation on the draft regulations; in particular, no adverse comments were received from the authoritative DPTAC body.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000051"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, spoke about exemptions and derogations. Of the 60-odd exemptions granted to trains and trams in public use, some 40 or so were granted in the period 1999 to 2002, which reflects the fact that many vehicles had already been designed or were being manufactured at the time when our work was being introduced. Those vehicles were built mainly in compliance with the regulations, but in particular cases time-limited exemptions were granted to enable the vehicles to enter service, replacing far less accessible vehicles, while certain non-compliance issues were resolved. The noble Lord made a point about exemptions. I understand the concern, but one needs to qualify it with a realistic look at the content of some of those exemptions and the impact on users. The user is the important element.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000052"></a>I think I have answered most of the points. If I have not, I shall be happy to take further questions. We gave this very careful thought and consideration. I understand the concerns, but we are not in a bad place. One has to remember that the endgame is to raise the threshold, the standards, the bar, which is exactly what we are trying to achieve. We have made a great deal of progress in that objective.</p>

The Government may well be doing it properly, but the reporting process to Parliament about what is happening&#151;this was actually my child&#151;concerns me. Something has been happening.

There is a facility for us to do exactly that. I was going to make the point that the consultation processes that we go through alert stakeholders to these issues. There is also the obligation in terms of making the exemption order. I guess that we just have

I simply want to be sure that we will ensure that this will still be reported on and debated in Parliament, and that all the new processes will be brought into the existing structure. If they are, some of my worries are removed because we still have a way of checking and holding someone to account if this goes wrong. That is really what I am after. If the Minister undertakes to ensure that everything will be done to ensure that this safeguard is there, I will feel better about this. It must be there because, despite the previous convictions of the Government&#151;indeed, of all Governments&#151;they stand accused of having been rather too blas&#233; in the past.

If there is a conflict between the two sets of regulations, which will run in parallel, it would be good to have his assurance that if someone developed a new train that could be operated in the UK, France and Germany&#151;in other words, if it was interoperable, which is the whole purpose of the TSIs&#151;it will not have a different set of regulations when it comes into the UK that will somehow be illegal in France. I became involved a long time ago with the development of a freight wagon, which had to have two separate sets of brakes, one of which operated in the UK, called a disc brake, and another one that operated on the Continent, which is a drum brake. You had to have two types of brakes in order to operate across one frontier. That is the whole point of a TSI; it should be Europe-wide. I hope that what my noble friend has said about the regulations will help to sort out the matter, but I am not entirely convinced that some train operators will not be upset and start taking legal action. I hope that that does not happen, because that would be very unfortunate.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000062"></a>The noble Lord said: It will make sense to take the two orders together and for me to speak also to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Disclosure of Information by SOCA) Order 2008. I hope that Members of the Committee have had the opportunity to read the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies these two related orders. As I will explain, the policy behind these orders is straightforward and purely consequential due to amendments made by the recent Serious Crime Act 2007 to provisions relating to recovering the proceeds of crime. I hope, therefore, we can be brief, as I contend that the nature of these orders is not controversial. Perhaps the real aid I can provide to the Committee is in explaining the quite technical drafting in these orders which does nothing more than to achieve simple, consistent and continuing policy.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000063"></a>The recent Serious Crime Act 2007 has abolished the Assets Recovery Agency. Amongst other functions, the agency had been the sole body in England, Wales and Northern Ireland which could investigate and pursue the civil recovery of the proceeds of crime. Civil recovery provides for the recovery of property which has been obtained directly or indirectly through crime. These are civil proceedings before the High Court and therefore do not require a criminal conviction. Essentially, the recovery action is against the property rather than the person.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000064"></a>To support the agency in this work, Part 10 of the Proceeds of Crime Act provided for the disclosure of information to and by the director of the agency. Significantly, for the purposes of the matter before us, the persons who could disclose to the director of the agency and the purposes for which he could disclose information were added to by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Disclosure of Information) Order 2003. That order was subject to a debate in this House in 2003 before it came into force on 24 February 2003.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000065"></a>Following the abolition of the Assets Recovery Agency, its functions of investigating and pursuing civil recovery has in England and Wales effectively passed to the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Crown Prosecution Service, the Serious Fraud Office and the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office.   


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC371"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column GC371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>In Northern Ireland, the functions have effectively passed to the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Serious Fraud Office and the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland. That change came into effect on 1 April this year.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000066"></a>The provisions for the disclosure of information in Part 10 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 were amended by the 2007 Act to refer to the Director of Public Prosecutions, the director of the Serious Fraud Office and the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. Equivalent amendments were also made to relevant provisions in the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 for the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office and the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 for SOCA. Importantly, the additions to the provisions for the disclosure of information made by the Proceeds of Crime 2002 (Disclosure of Information) Order 2003 were not transferred to the successor agencies by the Serious Crime Act. These are to be made by the orders before the House today.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000067"></a>The orders merely ensure that organisations which inherited the Assets Recovery Agency&#146;s work and functions can access the same information sources that were available to the Agency and can disclose the same information onwards. They also ensure that these organisations can use the information obtained to conduct investigations and proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to enable the recovery of criminally obtained assets. There is no change in policy. The orders do not cover the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office, which also inherited functions from the Assets Recovery Agency. It is covered by other legislation, has been made aware of the issue and will take any remedial action, legislative or otherwise, as necessary. I beg to move.</p>

My understanding is that the orders would add to the functions of protecting public health and the Financial Services Authority. That is what the orders say, but the Minister did not give that addition. I assume that that addition under the orders is correct. If I am correct, room was left for that within the original proceeds of crime legislation and we have no objection to additions being made to it.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000070"></a>My first question relates to the functions being designated under the orders with regard to the protecting of public health and the functions of the Financial Services Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act. With regard to the public health aspect, which is new to this legislation, will the Minister give examples of where public health might be compromised by the nature of the work or what is being carried out? I would like a snapshot of how public health could be   


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC372"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column GC372</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>involved. Under Schedule 2 to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, whom is it intended would be permitted to make a disclosure to the director in relation to public health? I cannot see that in the schedule. If it is not included, I presume there will have to be a further order at some stage. On the extension to the function under the Financial Services Authority, a person appointed to conduct an investigation under that authority is included in the schedule, which leaves the previous omission looking rather strange.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000071"></a>Under Section 47 of the Proceeds of Crime Act, disclosure on matters relating to individual tax matters is confined to the commissioner of the Inland Revenue or Customs and Excise. Would the same caveats apply to those authorities as apply to the Financial Services Authority? If so, who would be in the position of the commissioner? At present, in legislation, the &#147;permitted person&#148; is the person appointed to conduct an investigation.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000072"></a>Turning to the schedule, why is it that the Secretary of State should be involved in an issue relating, for example, to the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of offences relating to a social security matter or to checking the accuracy of any benefit payment? These would seem to be relatively trivial matters for the involvement of the Secretary of State, so what would dictate the level at which that holder of the office would become involved in disclosure? Are we to understand that we should read for &#147;Secretary of State&#148; anyone authorised by him or her to undertake investigations on their behalf? If so, should that not be the wording in the order?</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000073"></a>On the designation of those who are authorised to act on behalf of the Employment Agencies Act, the Companies Act, the Financial Services and Markets Act and the Proceeds of Crime (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, I note that these are termed as &#147;authorised persons&#148;. Can the Minister give us an indication of the likely seniority of that person in the organisation? I ask that because from a list of those currently designated under the Proceeds of Crime Act, it is clear that only commissioners are permitted to make disclosures to the director. It is of some concern that it does not seem to be the same situation in those that I have mentioned. Can the Minister reassure us about this because disclosure under this Act is a serious matter? I would be very uncomfortable if it were not done by the most senior officer in one of the listed organisations. If the Minister can answer those questions, I am happy with the order.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000074"></a><a name="80617-gc0002.htm_spnew15"></a><b><a name="80617-gc0002.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="08061798000197"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> By and large, we support these orders as we supported the efforts to deal with the proceeds of crime when the Act went through originally. We have recently discovered&#151;it was widely stated in the press&#151;that the Serious Organised Crime Agency has been suffering from a serious lack of efficiency. Can the Minister make a brief comment on that? At a time when we are delegating more powers to it, its capability and efficiency are relevant.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000075"></a>Were the recent, widely reported raids on safety deposit boxes, which yielded amazing and wide-ranging contents, conducted under this legislation? I presume that they were and that the fact that these orders have

Like the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, I am interested in examples of the protection of pubic health under the second order. I presume that they concern deliberate threats of contamination, blackmail and so on.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000076"></a>On the overall issue of the performance of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Minister can expect that we will be asking serious questions about it over coming months. However, I am happy to say just that about these orders this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000077"></a><a name="80617-gc0002.htm_spnew17"></a><b><a name="80617-gc0002.htm_spnew18"></a><a name="08061798000198"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> I thank noble Lords for their typically piercing questions on some of the detail of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (Disclosure of Information by SOCA) Order 2008 and the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Disclosure of Information) Order 2008. The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked about the public health issue. The order does not add to the functions of SOCA and the directors but to the purposes for which information can be disclosed. Those purposes are the exercise of any functions of protecting public health and the function of the Financial Services Authority under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. These functions were included in the 2003 order and are not new. An example in relation to public health would be that it might be used to protect health in relation to disclosing information that might come to SOCA or the directors about the illicit supply of medicinal products or that type of question.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000078"></a>On permitted persons, the functions of the directors and the Secretary of State can be delegated, so that a person within the department or organisation can act as, say, the Secretary of State. The question was about the level to which that will occur. I am not sure, so I shall come back in writing if there is a limit on the level. I am not sure whether that answers all the questions the noble Baroness raised. If not, I shall write to her.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000079"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked about SOCA&#146;s lack of efficiency. I think that is probably a little unfair on Sir Stephen Lander who is running it. The last report identified areas where there could be improvements. SOCA is delivering well in some areas, but there are some gaps. They will be picked up and run with. It is important that we make it run properly because it is crucial that it achieves what it was set out to achieve. It is unfair to say that it lacks efficiency; it is just that there were shortfalls in certain areas, as one could see from its report.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000080"></a>On investigations that have been taking place for three or four months, no information is currently being disclosed or obtained under the powers given by the orders. Clearly, there is no power to do so. I can reassure the noble Baroness on that: as no information is being disclosed or obtained, it clearly cannot be questioned by the courts. We are safe on that point.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000081"></a>I am not sure that I have answered a couple of the precise questions, but I will do so in writing. Apart from those, I commend this instrument to the Committee.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000087"></a>The noble Lord said: In February 2008, we began the rollout of the points-based system. At that time, we also announced our proposals for all the immigration and nationality fees we intended to charge during 2008-09. These regulations specify the fees for the next part of the points-based system to be implemented.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000088"></a>The Government are determined to continue to drive through the real improvements to the immigration system that we have said that we will deliver. We will protect our border and our national interests, tackle immigration crime and implement fast and fair decisions. These fees will help contribute to us delivering the biggest shake-up to our border protection and immigration system for over 45 years.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000089"></a>We have made substantial progress and are seeing the results. Stronger border controls are delivering falls in annual asylum claims, which are now the lowest for 14 years. Anyone applying for a visa now has his fingerprints checked against UK databases. So far, we have enrolled 1.7 million sets of fingerprints&#151;that is, people&#151;detecting 1,600 cases of identity swaps. In 2007, we removed an immigration offender from this country every eight minutes. Britain is the richer for migration, culturally, socially and economically. However, if migration is to continue to bring benefits to this country, it must be carefully controlled, and we are delivering that through the continued roll-out of the points-based system.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000090"></a>It is right and fair to both the users of the immigration system and to the general public in the UK that those who benefit most from the immigration system contribute proportionately more to the true end-to-end costs of that system. In setting current fee levels, we established the important principle of setting the fees for our

We are continuing to apply this principle in setting fees for the next parts of the points-based system to be implemented. In order to do this, we are using the powers under Section 42 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, which have been amended by Section 20 of the UK Borders Act 2007.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000091"></a>We have kept migrant fees for the next part of the points-based system to be implemented at broadly the same level as existing comparable current applications. Where we are introducing new fees for new services, we have proposed fees that reflect the benefits and entitlements of the application to the migrant or employer.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000092"></a>The fees for new products that are covered in the regulations being discussed today are as follows. An application under tier 1 of the points-based system for a visa as an investor or an entrepreneur will be &#163;600. An application under tier 1 of the points-based system for leave to remain as an investor or an entrepreneur will be &#163;750. An application under tier 1 of the points-based system for a visa in the post-study category will be &#163;205. An application under tier 1 of the points-based system for leave to remain in the post-study category will be &#163;400. An application under tier 2 of the points-based system for a visa will be &#163;205. An application under tier 2 of the points-based system for leave to remain will be &#163;400. An application for a tier 2 certificate of sponsorship will be &#163;170. An application for a multiple tier sponsorship licence where the sponsor is not a small sponsor will be &#163;1,000. An application for registration as a British citizen under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 will be &#163;400.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000093"></a>The purpose of tier 1 of the points-based system is to attract the most talented migrants who have the most to contribute economically to the United Kingdom. The skilled migrant tier&#151;tier 2&#151;is aimed at enabling UK employers to recruit individuals from outside the European economic area to fill a job that cannot be filled by a British or European economic area worker. In common with other parts of the points-based system, on introduction tier 2 will require migrants to have a sponsor licensed by the UK Border Agency. The fee to register on the sponsor register was set in the regulations debated on 25 February. These regulations bring in fees for the different types of sponsor licences that businesses will be able to apply for.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000094"></a>We welcome the contribution that legal migrants make to the economy and cultural life of the United Kingdom, and we have ensured that the proposed fees are at levels that will not damage the UK&#146;s international competitiveness. We believe these fees for the next part of the points-based system to be implemented are fair and proportionate, and are set at levels that recognise the value and benefits of a successful application to both the migrant and the employer. The fees have been set to ensure the UK maintains its position as an attractive destination for work and to do business.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>

The fees proposed here are fair and proportionate. They recover the costs of considering the application and help contribute to the true aim to end the costs of the system.

I say from the outset that we support the principle behind making reasonable charges for people who wish to come to this country and for those firms that want to employ migrants, and that they should be licensed to do so. Therefore, we have no difficulty with the regulations. However, I have one or two questions.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000098"></a>In general, the level of fees is intended to exceed the cost of Administration, but I think it is acknowledged that there will be an element of subsidy for applications that will be charged at below the administrative cost. Could the Minister tell us which applications will not have their administrative costs covered? I think he said that it applied to tiers 3 and 4, but I should like that to be confirmed. Is it anticipated that these fees will generate the &#163;100 million suggested in the accompanying notes, and will that be total income or profit? What are the administrative costs alone likely to be? How long will the costs be set for? Are they annual costs or will they apply for longer that that? If they are to be increased, will that matter come back to the House? Have the Government any estimate of the number of applications that it is anticipated will be made under tiers 1 and 2? Is the Minister confident that the UK Border Agency has the expertise and resources, both human and financial, to deal with these expeditiously so that people will not be kept waiting? As I say, I have no objection to the regulations.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000099"></a><a name="80617-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80617-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08061798000202"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> The regulations follow the statutory instrument that your Lordships debated at the end of February, when the Minister explained how current fee levels were being determined on the basis of the value of the services provided to the applicants. The noble Baroness has asked certain questions about these calculations, which I would like to follow up.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000100"></a>The intention is to make the aggregate total of fees charged for services connected with immigration and citizenship correspond with the money spent on securing our borders. The Minister gave the figure of &#163;2 billion this year, and he expected &#163;630 million to be generated from the fees. It would be useful to know whether that includes the amounts that are being generated by the applications under the regulations. If there has been any change in the arithmetic in the past four months, no doubt the Minister will let us know.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC377"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column GC377</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000101"></a>The Minister also reeled off the various fees that are to be charged under the regulations, but he did not explain how the UK Border Agency calculates the individual fees. He explained that some fees are above cost recovery and some fees are below it, but not the total arithmetic, which it would be useful to know more about in the interests of transparency. I agree with the principle that certain fees should be charged more heavily than others because of the value of the services that are provided. That is particularly the case in tier 1 and to a lesser extent in tier 2, but we would like to know the extent to which some people are being made to pay over the odds for the services that are provided for others.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000102"></a>The fees in table A are for tier 1 and for sponsorship licences where the sponsor is not a small sponsor for all tiers, which were already discussed on the previous occasion. The Explanatory Memorandum to the regulations says that in tier 2, for skilled migrants, the certificate of sponsorship will cost &#163;170. That certificate has to be issued by the sponsor to a person so that he can present it with his application for entry clearance or for leave to remain in the UK. In the UKBA statement of intent on skilled workers under the points-based system, the calculation of points is given, and it is clear that an applicant who does not fall into one of the categories in the list of shortage occupations defined by the Migration Advisory Committee will stand very little chance of getting in. A person belonging to one of those categories gets 50 points towards the required 70, while a job that satisfies only the resident labour market test of being advertised for two weeks without attracting an applicant gets only 35.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000103"></a>I am sorry not to have given the Minister prior notice of the point that I am now going to make. I tried to phone the Whips&#146; Office but no-one was there by the time I got around to it. My point concerns ministers of religion, who are included in tier 2. On 10 March, I asked a Question about the fees to be charged to unpaid Buddhist monks who enter the UK on short assignments, and asked what consultations the Government had undertaken with the Sangha on these matters. The noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, the Minister who replied on that occasion, said that the entry clearance fee would be &#163;200 under tier 2, but I do not see how a monk who is unpaid could possibly be dealt with under a scheme that is clearly designed only for employees. The Minister said that a monk could also apply under tier 5 as a temporary religious worker, but he did not respond to my question about the Sangha.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000104"></a>I wrote to Mr Liam Byrne, the Minister for Immigration, on 3 April. I got a reply from the deputy chief executive of the UKBA a month later saying that they had consulted widely, including representatives of the Buddhist community, without mentioning with whom they had consulted. In a subsequent telephone call, I discovered that the two persons who were approached were both laypersons. If the Government are genuinely interested in consulting the Buddhist community, they should include the Sangha, which means the order of monks, just as in their consultations with Christians they would include ordained priests in the Catholic or Anglican Churches, and not just a couple of laymen picked at random.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000105"></a>To ensure that there is no misunderstanding about this, a Buddhist monk is not paid anything and is not an employee. In the past, it has always been the practice for monasteries to bring in monks for short periods from their parent tradition in Sri Lanka or Thailand and I certainly hope that there will be some way of continuing that tradition under the points-based system. The chair of the Theravada Buddhist Sangha in the UK, the venerable Chao Khun Bhavanaviteht, whose letter I have passed to the officials, has written to confirm that there was no consultation with them and he fears that some temples may be forced to close.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000106"></a>I ask the Minister to ensure that any future consultation on matters affecting religion and immigration, whether by the Home Office, the UK Border Agency or any other public authority, includes the Sangha. If the only way for a monk from abroad to enter the United Kingdom is under TFI, the language of the UKBA statement of intent for TFI should be amended in so far as it deals with religious workers to cover the occupation of a monk, who is not employed and who is not filling a vacancy and does not have dependants.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000107"></a>I also suggest that the Theravada Buddhist Sangha be treated as a single sponsor for the purposes of issuing a certificate of sponsorship, notwithstanding the fact that Theravada temples and monasteries are autonomous, as it would otherwise be an expensive and burdensome task for individual monasteries or temples to obtain a separate licence. That is the kind of issue that could have been settled if the Home Office and UKBA had had proper consultations before the statement of intent had been issued.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000108"></a>At the foot of table A, we find that the fee for registration as a British citizen under the British Nationality (Hong Kong) Act 1997 increases from &#163;120 or &#163;200 to &#163;400. I wonder how the Government can justify that enormous increase. The person concerned is already a British overseas citizen, a British national overseas, a British subject or a British protected person. He has to satisfy the consul in Hong Kong that he is ordinarily resident in Hong Kong now and was so before 4 February 1997 and that he would have been stateless if he had not had one of these inferior forms of British citizenship. He has to produce documentary evidence proving each one of those requirements.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000109"></a>The only problem that arises occasionally is where persons of Nepali ethnic origin have been issued with Nepali passports, notwithstanding their continued possession of BNO passports as adults and the provision in Nepalese law that a person cannot simultaneously hold Nepalese and any other citizenship. The British Consul in Hong Kong and the FCO demand the production of a certificate saying that the Nepalese document was issued in error. Their refusal to acknowledge the plain meaning of a Nepali statute in these cases has led to unnecessary correspondence and, previously, when they were equally pigheaded in the case of BNOs of Indian ethnic origin, they even went to the extent of sending a joint team of the Foreign Office and the Home Office to New Delhi to verify the interpretation of Indian law. No doubt, if the costs of trying to prevent anyone from entering the United Kingdom from Hong Kong who is entitled to British

I would be grateful if the Minister could explain how the calculation was done.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000110"></a>My concern about the points-based scheme, now that we see how it works, is its total lack of flexibility. Mr Jonathan Sedgwick, deputy chief executive of the UKBA, writes to me as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08061798000163"></a>&#147;Requiring an application to be accompanied by the full fee before it is considered valid proves a more cost effective system to administer, and ensures a more robust application process. Waiving the fee for some applicants on the basis of their ability to pay would lead to an increase in the amount of administrative work to means test an applicant and chase any outstanding payments. If we apply the current principle of not considering an application until it has been paid, or a decision has been made on the applicant's ability to pay this could lead to long delays in our decision making process. Waiving the fee for some applicants would also lead to an increase in fees for other applicants to ensure that the costs of the Border and Immigration Agency are recovered&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08061798000160"></a>Precisely the same argument could be applied to many other services provided by public agencies of one kind or another. For instance, if we did not waive the prescription charge fee for the elderly, children or pregnant women, no doubt a considerable amount of administrative work would be saved. I expect it costs the Mayor of London a lot of money to give the elderly free underground and bus travel, so charges to other users of London transport must be higher to cover the loss of revenue.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000111"></a>The argument is spurious. As the noble Lord will be aware if he has seen some of my correspondence with the UKBA, serious hardship is caused to people upon whom these fees are imposed when they do not have the means to pay them. The scheme ought to have been made more flexible so that those who are not in employment or receiving income of any sort, such as many wives who come here to join their husbands, should be given some sort of concession so that they are not faced with the problem of borrowing money or getting it from a charity.</p>

I will try to answer the specific points put to me.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000113"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, asked whether tiers 4 and 5 would not recover costs while tiers 1 and 2 could. The answer is yes. It breaks down that the net benefit in the tier 1 area is about &#163;561 million to the Exchequer; in tier 2 it is about &#163;237 million; whereas in tier 5 we lose &#163;31 million. We are not recouping all our costs on tiers 4 and 5. The noble Baroness is absolutely right that they are set annually. Of course, we will come back to the House each time we wish to change them.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000114"></a>The UK Border Agency is confident that it has the resources to deal with all these measures expeditiously. The fees secure the necessary financial resources to allow that expeditious delivery. In totality, we expect to generate in the region of &#163;685 million in 2008-09, contributing significantly to the &#163;2 billion we will spend on securing our border and managing the immigration system.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000115"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked why we had set the fees at this level. We aim to keep the fees for the PBS route similar to the level of the pre-existing comparable route. We have increased several of the fees by approximately 3 per cent. Fees for new services or applications reflect the true operational costs of the system, while taking into account the value of a successful application in terms of entitlements and benefits to the migrant. Indeed, the British public at large feel that that is appropriate, as they get benefits from doing this. I have already mentioned that tiers 1 and 2 are higher than tiers 4 and 5. The majority of people we consulted supported our proposals. Some people felt that the fees could have been higher than they are, so we came to a sensible balance on that. We justify these fees by having debated with and talked to all the people involved&#151;I hate the word &#147;stakeholders&#148;. We set higher fees in those areas where we have in accordance with comprehensive research, looking at those thresholds.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000116"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, for telling me about his questions on Buddhist monks just before the debate, but I had no time to get a response. I will confront my noble friend Lord Malloch-Brown and ask him why he did not tell me that this had been asked; it has slightly caught me out. I think that tier 2 deals with religion but I take the point about people not being paid and whether one should look at tier 5 if they are coming to undertake non-graduate teaching. I am pretty certain that we have held discussions with the Buddhist community, but I hope that I may come back to the noble Lord in writing on that specific point.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000117"></a><a name="80617-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80617-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08061798000204"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> My point was that the Government consulted two laypersons in the Buddhist community; they did not consult the ordained body of monks, the Sangha. As I said, that is like saying that you have consulted with the Church of England when you have ignored the whole of the Synod and just picked a couple of laymen at random.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000118"></a><a name="80617-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80617-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08061798000205"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> I take that point. I shall get back to the noble Lord in writing on who we have talked to and what the position is, as I am not clear on that. He also asked whether consideration of applications should not be delayed pending payment of the fee. It is fair that users of the system rather than the UK taxpayer should contribute to this operation; that is the general consensus. If we considered applications before a fee was paid there would be no incentive for the applicant to pay. We must be a little wary of that. The costs for Hong Kong reflect the costs for citizenship and are in line with the 3 per cent increase. I shall come back to him in writing as regards Nepalese citizenship, as it is a detailed point and I am not absolutely clear about it. I do not want to mislead the Committee.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000119"></a>I hope that I have answered the key points. If I have missed any, I shall be happy to answer them in writing. However, most people accept that those who benefit from the immigration system should contribute most. As I say, that was very much reflected in our discussions with all the various interested groups. It is appropriate

<h5><a name="08061798000178"></a>5.07 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08061798000121"></a><a name="80617-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80617-gc0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08061798000206"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Baroness Vadera)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 (Sources of Energy and Technologies) Order 2008.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000122"></a>The noble Baroness said: Within their wider energy policy context, the Government are firmly committed to a major expansion of renewables and low-carbon technologies as part of a diverse energy mix. Generating low-carbon and renewable energy depends on developing reliable technologies, particularly appropriately installed microgeneration. Through this statutory instrument, the Government are seeking to define more precisely those sources of energy that they have already recognised as microgeneration and create a legal framework within which developing and possible future technologies can be encouraged.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000123"></a>This statutory instrument is also influenced by the development and marketing of air source heat pumps since the list was originally drawn up in 2006. Accordingly, it expands the major statutory definition of &#147;microgeneration&#148; to include technologies which wholly or mainly rely on,</p>
<ul><a name="08061798000166"></a>&#147;heat from air, water or the ground&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000124"></a>The Committee will be familiar with the term &#147;microgeneration&#148; which is widely used to define either low-carbon or renewable energy technologies that produce under 45 kilowatts for heat and 50 kilowatts for electricity. Roof-mounted photovoltaic panels and small and micro wind turbines are increasingly common but there are also micro combined heat and power units, micro hydro technologies, domestic biomass generators, fuel cells and various kinds of heat pump.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000125"></a>The Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006 defines &#147;microgeneration&#148; for the purposes of that Act and is relied upon in the Electricity Act 1989, the Gas Act 1986 and the Electricity and Gas (Carbon Emissions Reduction) Order 2008. The legal definition of &#147;microgeneration&#148; is set out in Section 26(1) of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006, and provides that,</p>
<ul><a name="08061798000167"></a>&#147;microgeneration&#148; means the use for the generation of electricity or the production of heat of any plant (which, for this purpose, includes any equipment, apparatus or appliance)&#151;</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08061798000164"></a>&#147;(a) which, in generating electricity or (as the case may be) producing heat, relies wholly or mainly on a source of energy or a technology mentioned in subsection (2), and</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08061798000165"></a>(b) the capacity of which to generate electricity or (as the case may be) to produce heat does not exceed the capacity mentioned in subsection (3)&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08061798000161"></a>The capacity mentioned in subsection (3) is 45 kilowatts for the production of heat and 50 kilowatts for the generation of electricity. The list of sources and technologies is set out in Section 26(2) of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act, which can be expanded or amended.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000126"></a>Section 26(4) provides that Section 26(2) may be amended by adding to the list of sources of energy and technologies when the Secretary of State considers that the use of that source of energy or technology would cut emissions of greenhouse gases in Great Britain. The Secretary of State considers that the use of heat from air, water or the ground would cut emissions of greenhouse gases in Great Britain.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000127"></a>The Energy Act 2004 also provides a statutory definition of microgeneration for the purposes of that Act and is relied on in the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005, the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 and some sections of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006. That definition is found at Section 82(6) and (7) and is framed in the same manner as the definition in the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006. Section 82(7) includes the same sources or technologies as are currently in Section 26(2) of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006, but with an additional category:</p>
<ul><a name="08061798000168"></a>&#147;other sources of energy and technologies for the generation of electricity or the production of heat, the use of which would, in the opinion of the secretary of state, cut emissions of greenhouse gases in Great Britain&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000128"></a>This statutory instrument will not affect the definition of microgeneration in the Energy Act 2004. In accordance with Section 82(7)(j), however, since the Secretary of State is of the opinion that the use of heat from the air, water or the ground would cut emissions of greenhouse gases in Great Britain, the definition of microgeneration in that Act must be read as including heat from the air, water or the ground.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000129"></a>Noble lords will be aware that the heat pump is a technology that transfers low-grade heat energy from a medium such as the ground, the air and water to another location such as a building. Air-source heat pumps work on similar principles to ground-source pumps, but they are generally regarded as less efficient since the ratio of heat energy outputs to energy inputs is less. Instead of using coils in the earth, a fan is exposed to air. The pump can be attached to the exterior wall of a building such as a ventilation unit. Interior air-source heat pump units can be fitted in kitchens and may resemble a domestic fridge freezer.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000130"></a>At the time of the passing of the Act, it was the intention that the definition of microgeneration included ground-source heat pumps. The Government wish to put the issue beyond doubt. &#147;Geothermal&#148; generally refers to heat from geothermal heat. While that can be found near the surface, for example in Iceland, in the UK it would require deep boreholes, such as the one in Southampton which is 1,800 metres deep. Ground-source heat pumps that do not use boreholes draw on solar energy stored in the ground. Although solar energy is in the current list, that generally refers to photovoltaic panels that absorb energy directly from the sun&#146;s light, rather than to solar heat energy stored in the ground.

I am happy to welcome it back and to look at the orders. I just have a couple of questions for the Minister. She mentioned the 50 kilowatts for electricity and the 45 kilowatts for heat. In the Energy Bill, there is a question mark over the transition of technologies and whether that limit of 50 kilowatts is acceptable, especially if you are dealing with anaerobic digester technology which could lead to a great deal more generation of power. That limit was set only in the technical notes and was not in the Bill. Can it be changed easily or will it take an amendment to the Energy Bill? If that is the case, I had better start drafting a revision to the Bill before Thursday morning.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000135"></a>This order is most welcome. Heat from air, water or the ground was on the cusp of fruition when we looked at this during the passage of this legislation. However, I have since been to the Mitsubishi factory to look at its air heat pumps, the possibilities for which are incredibly helpful, especially at the top of a tower block where a unit could be stuck on the side. Of course, the limiting factor for ground source heat pumps is the need for an open area of grassland which will not be built on because it would stop any solar radiation coming through. Is there a provision in this order, or will we have to come back each time new technologies are to be added? Is there an assumption that it could include the advent of new technologies?</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000140"></a>The noble Lord said: The order gives effect to the government policy set out in the Written Ministerial Statement of 16 January this year, following the publication of the report of the Senior Salaries Review Body on parliamentary pay and allowances. The policy as expressed in that Statement is that ministerial salaries should increase at the same rate as for Members of Parliament. The order will therefore increase the annual amount of the salaries of ministerial and other office holders under the Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000141"></a>The increases are 0.84 per cent of the amount of salary on 31 March 2007 from 1 April 2007; and a further 1.06 per cent, again of the amount of salary on 31 March 2007, from 1 November 2007. As with MPs&#146; pay, increases have been staged to deliver an increase for the year of 1.9 per cent, which included the 0.66 per cent automatic increase under the uprating formula in the 1975 Act.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000142"></a>We have noted the conclusions of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments on retrospectivity. As highlighted in that Committee&#146;s report, the Government accept that the order is retrospective. Nevertheless, the Government believe that the general presumption that powers delegated in enactments are not capable of being exercised retrospectively is outweighed by other factors in this case. In particular, some backdating of salaries is now common practice, especially in the public sector, due to the timings of negotiated pay settlements. The practice of backdating ministerial salaries to a limited extent has also been reflected in previous orders relating to ministerial salaries, such as the Ministerial and other Salaries Order 2001 and the Attorney-General&#146;s Salary Order 2000. Both orders were approved by the House of Lords.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000143"></a>As the Joint Committee points out at paragraph 1.12 of its report, the order applies only to those Ministers and other office-holders who are still in post when the order comes into force. The committee recognises that, while the order could have been framed prospectively, so as to confer equivalent increases on these Ministers and other office-holders&#151;characterised, for example, as lump-sum payments&#151;such provision would have

<p><a name="08061798000144"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Ministerial and other Salaries Order 2008. <I>21st </I><I>r</I><I>eport from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments</I>.&#151;(<I>Lord Davies of Oldham</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="08061798000145"></a><a name="80617-gc0004.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80617-gc0004.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08061798000211"></a>Lord Howard of Rising:</b> There are no objections to the order from this side of the Committee. However, on a purely personal note, the size of the increase in no way reflects the adeptness and adroitness with which the Minister answers Questions and debates. Looking forward, I have no doubt that the Minister&#146;s friends will be extremely pleased to see that these increases apply to the Opposition as well as to the Government.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000146"></a><a name="80617-gc0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80617-gc0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08061798000212"></a>Lord Shutt of Greetland:</b> I cannot quite fathom this; perhaps the Minister can help me a little. The Explanatory Note talks about these somewhat modest percentages being over and above the increases payable by virtue of an uprating formula. Then, today, there is an announcement that Cabinet Ministers will give up their pay rise for this financial year, and above-inflation rises for MPs and so on have been rejected. I do not understand how these things fit together; something is &#147;over and above&#148;, followed by announcement about holding it down. They do not seem to match.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000147"></a>I am always a little unhappy when I see this sort of restraint subsequently followed by, &#147;Ah, well, we need to catch up&#148;. That is when you really get bother, because catching up means bigger increases later, which is often unwise and unpopular. The numbers are very small, but I would welcome further explanation.</p>

<p><a name="08061798000148"></a><a name="80617-gc0004.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80617-gc0004.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="08061798000213"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, for asking me questions on which I am able to earn my pay. I was nearly covered with embarrassment by the noble Lord who spoke from the Conservative Front Bench. I suppose that I should have declared an interest; like other Ministers, I will benefit significantly from this increase, which has been identified as modest. The answers to the questions asked by the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, are quite straightforward.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000149"></a>This order relates to 2007-08. It is governed, like any order that provides for increases, by the Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975, which contains a formula that places MPs&#151;ministerial salaries are linked to MPs&#151;at the midpoint of a Civil Service grade. That produced an automatic uprating for 2007-08 of 0.66 of a per cent, or two-thirds of one per cent. The other increases increase the uprating from two-third of one per cent to 1.99 per cent, which is the pay rise for that year. As the noble Lord said, we are talking about modest amounts.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000150"></a>The pay freeze applies to this year, 2008-09. The Cabinet agreed this morning that Ministers will not take a pay increase this year, irrespective of the decisions of Members of Parliament when they consider their position in a month or so&#146;s time. The Government have enjoined Members of Parliament to have regard to the general expectation of settlements in the public sector of between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent. That is what we confidently predict that Members of Parliament  


<notus-date day="17" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC386"></a><b>17 Jun 2008 : Column GC386</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will pursue with enormous enthusiasm and great glee when the opportunity arises. Ministers will not be the beneficiaries of any increase that Members of Parliament vote themselves on such an occasion because of this self-denying ordinance for this year to illustrate the determination of the Government to control public sector pay in the battle against inflation that we all recognise is significant after today&#146;s announcement by the Bank of England on the increase in the rate of inflation.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000151"></a>We are talking about two different years. The Joint Committee was critical of the fact that, by definition, if I am talking on this order about 2007-08, there is a retrospective quality that we do not like in legalisation and eschew on every conceivable occasion that we can. The noble Lord will appreciate that the problem with regard to salaries is that a retrospective element is often part of the discussion framework where public pay is settled and in the private sector as well. In this case, it is clear that Members of Parliament are lagging behind in the decisions to be taken, and this order is considerably behind, applying, as it does, to last year. That is the retrospective element. We will seek to avoid it, but the Committee will appreciate that there is something unique about pay negotiations and, I hate to say it, Parliament has an interesting concept of pay negotiations.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000152"></a>As the Committee will know, Members of Parliament have striven might and main. I can remember the Ministerial and other Salaries Act 1975 and the basis on which that has obtained for Members of Parliament ever since. I recall the desperate tribulation that occasioned the Act simply because there was no linkage to anyone prior to that. Members of Parliament decided the rate. That is a pretty hazardous thing for Members of Parliament to attempt, but it has one great virtue, critical though members of the public doubtless are of Members of Parliament deciding their own pay.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000153"></a>I listened to the Lloyd George serialisation of Ffion Hague&#146;s book on the radio this morning. Lloyd George entered Parliament in 1890&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, will probably remember him. He gave up his earning power and had no salary at all. It is inconceivable that we would ever be able to run Parliament in a democratic age on the basis of the 19th-century concept that gentlemen of leisure served in Parliament and everyone else received their wise decisions.</p>

<a name="80617-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08061798000154"></a>That is the background to all this. I have never known any debate, even this very small one, to contain anything but embarrassment for those at the Dispatch Box who are trying to reply to it. I apologise for being in that position, but I hope that I have answered the questions sufficiently satisfactorily to commend the order to the Committee.</p>

I do not think that Lloyd George knew my father or my grandfather, but the history is useful. The main thing was the disposition between the two financial years. The Minister&#146;s explanation was good, and I thank him for it.</p>

The problem that the noble Baroness might have identified is that the retrospective element applies to Ministers in office but not to those who have left office.

Retrospective pay does not affect pensions one way or the other in the obvious sense that what are calculated are the years

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08061782000008"></a>In January this year, a man killed his mother-in-law before taking his own life. At the time, he was on bail awaiting trial for the alleged murder of his wife. On 16 January 2008 my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, answering a Question about the case (<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, col.  925) said that the Government would be looking at the law on bail. </p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08061782000009"></a>Bail decisions in murder cases will never be easy; the vital thing is to ensure that the courts strike the right balance between respecting individuals&#146; right to liberty and protecting the public.  The Government&#146;s aim is to target custody as precisely as possible upon those cases where there is a risk of harm to the public.  We are today publishing a consultation paper that sets out possible ways of helping the courts to achieve that aim.  We shall take account of views expressed in response to it in deciding whether to pursue these ideas.  Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses and are available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office. Copies are also available on the internet at: <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/consultations.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/consultations.htm</a>.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08061782000010"></a>My right honourable friend the Prime Minister said that &#147;if any changes in the law are necessary, we will make them&#148;.  The Government do not take it for granted that it will be necessary to amend legislation, but we shall not hesitate to bring forward whatever changes in guidance, rules or the law may be needed.</p>

My right honourable friend the Lord Chancellor and  Secretary of State for Justice (Jack Straw), my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General (Baroness Scotland), my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office (Meg Hillier) and the Scottish Solicitor-General (Frank Mulholland) attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. The following issues were discussed at the council:</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08061782000012"></a>The Commission gave an update on the revised timetable for delivery of the second generation of the Schengen information system (SIS II). Member states reaffirmed their commitment to the project but stressed the importance of the Commission delivering on time.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08061782000013"></a>The council secretariat reported some minor delays in the implementation of the SIS communication network and stated that better preparation from member states would ensure that there were no further delays.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08061782000014"></a>The council agreed a compromise text on the returns directive which could enable a first reading agreement providing it is approved by the European Parliament later this month. The UK has not opted in to this directive.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08061782000015"></a>Discussion continued on the directive for beneficiaries of international protection. Member states could not reach consensus on the scope of the directive and the qualifying period for long-term residence. The presidency concluded that there would be no further attempts to secure agreement under the Slovenian presidency.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08061782000016"></a>The Commission supported calls for EU action to resettle refugees from Iraq in principle although it wanted involvement of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as it was concerned about resettling people directly from Iraqi territory. The UK noted its own efforts in this area and supported the involvement of more member states in resettlement, but stated it must be a permanent solution, not just a temporary humanitarian evacuation. The incoming French presidency said that it would consider pursuing further EU resettlement activity.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08061782000017"></a>The council reached a general approach on the package of Pr1/4m related legal instruments, which provide an improved mechanism for the sharing of DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data for the purposes of preventing, investigating and prosecuting serious crime. The Commission underlined its support.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08061782000018"></a>The EU counterterrorism co-ordinator introduced his reports on the implementation of the EU counterterrorism strategy and action plan emphasising the importance of technical assistance to third countries and of information exchange.  He stated that radicalisation and recruitment was the main priority in the next six months and urged the Commission to issue its communication on this subject as quickly as possible. The Commission confirmed that it would do so. Member states welcomed the work of the co-ordinator and supported his recommendations.  The UK particularly welcomed the focus on radicalisation and recruitment and prioritisation of work with Sahel/North Africa and Pakistan.  The UK had launched its national strategy on Prevent the previous week, and would share its experience in leading the workstream on communications.  The presidency noted that the new ad hoc council group on information exchange would contribute to work on counterterrorism.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08061782000019"></a>The council endorsed the EU-Australia passenger name record agreement and the Commission remarked that the Australian PNR agreement should be a reference point for future PNR agreements.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08061782000020"></a>The presidency reported on the successful outcome of negotiations with the European Parliament about the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment through criminal law.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08061782000021"></a>The presidency outlined the background to the proposal to amend the ship source pollution directive to include criminal penalties for breaches of the rules.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08061782000022"></a>The council reached a general approach on the framework decision on the enforcement of decisions rendered<I></I>in absentia<I>.</I> Many delegations intervened fully to support the compromise agreement.

They noted that Parliament&#146;s opinion was still due and that the form must be finalised by Justice and Home Affairs counsellors.  The UK and other delegations warmly congratulated the presidency on their work on this initiative.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08061782000023"></a>The UK welcomed the progress made on the draft Eurojust council decision and supported the overall package proposed on Articles 5a, 9a to 9g, 12 and 13 concerning: on-call co-ordination within Eurojust; the powers of national members; the establishment of a Eurojust national co-ordination system; and the exchange of information, noting that it struck the right balance. With the exception of one member state, which retained a reserve on Article 9, all could accept the compromise text and the presidency therefore concluded that a general approach had been reached.  The presidency also concluded that the outstanding reserve could be dealt with in a recital to be discussed at a later date.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08061782000024"></a>The council agreed a compromise package on a number of aspects of the proposed maintenance regulation. In particular, to accommodate UK concerns, it was agreed that the applicable law rules should be removed from the regulation and that those member states that wish to apply such rules will use the optional protocol to the recently agreed Hague Convention on maintenance. The UK confirmed that this solution removed the main obstacle to future UK participation in the adopted regulation.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08061782000025"></a>It has been accepted that it will not be possible to agree Rome III (choice of law in divorce) in its current form as there is no unanimity in the council. It was agreed that there should be a period of reflection to explore how work in this area can be taken forward. One option that will be considered will be the use of enhanced co-operation.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08061782000026"></a>The presidency provided a report on the progress that had been made on e-justice and the priorities for future work. This was followed by a presentation from the Commission of a recent communication which sets out a strategy for e-justice work including proposals for how this will be financed.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08061782000027"></a>The presidency reported on the implementation of the JHA external relations strategy. The Commission said there would be a review of the external strategy under the French presidency.  The third report, due out in 2009, would be the basis for a new strategy. The incoming French presidency confirmed that implementation of this strategy would be a priority over the next 18 months. The presidency also reported on the EU-Russia JHA ministerial troika and EU-Ukraine ministerial troika.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08061782000028"></a>Greece outlined the challenges posed by high levels of asylum applications and illegal immigration. It welcomed EU financial assistance but would prefer increased burden sharing.  Priorities also included more work in countries of origin; information on legal migration opportunities; and more work on readmission agreements.  Some member states offered practical assistance but emphasised the need to uphold the integrity of the Dublin system and opposed any form of intra-EU resettlement. Further discussion on migration challenges at the EU border states will take place under the French presidency.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08061782000029"></a>The Rome I regulation on choice of law in contracts was formally adopted without discussion.  The UK did not opt in to this proposal but the Government are consulting with a view to accepting the measure post-adoption.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08061782000030"></a>Over lunch, there was a discussion of the proposal for an EU PNR agreement, with the presidency seeking views on what member states would wish to achieve under the incoming French presidency. All agreed that adoption of the measure would not be possible this year, leaving the possibility that it would have to happen under the Lisbon treaty if that were to enter into force in 2009. The UK urged progress during the French presidency. The Commission wanted to press ahead with discussion at both a technical level as well as politically.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08061782000031"></a>Member states also congratulated the presidency on the work of the Interior Future Group, considering ideas for inclusion in the new JHA work programme when the current programme expires at the end of 2009. Migration was stressed by many as the top priority for future work in JHA.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08061782000033"></a>On 10 July 2007, I announced that Sir Peter Williams had agreed to undertake a review of the teaching of mathematics in early years settings and primary schools in England (<I>Official Report</I>, cols. 1319-20). Today the review&#146;s final report has been published and I have written to Sir Peter Williams to confirm that we will implement the recommendations the review panel has made.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08061782000034"></a>The review, over the course of almost a year, has explored the important areas of: effective pedagogy of mathematics teaching; the range of provision required for pupils of all ability levels; the Every Child Counts programme (announced by the Prime Minister in May 2007); the conceptual and subject knowledge which should be expected of primary school teachers and early years practitioners; the most effective sequencing and design of the mathematics curriculum; and how parents should be helped to support young children&#146;s mathematical development.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08061782000035"></a>All children should receive the quality of mathematical teaching during their primary school years that ensures they reach their potential and have the opportunity to enjoy mathematics. We must build on the progress made since the introduction of the national numeracy strategy in 1998 and ensure that we address the problem set out in the report that it is culturally acceptable to admit to being poor at mathematics. Raising the profile of mathematics and attainment in all schools will begin to do this. I believe we will achieve this through implementing the key recommendations as follows:</p>
there should be at least one mathematics specialist in each primary school, in post within 10 years, with deep subject and pedagogical knowledge,

Implementation should commence in 2009 and be targeted initially to maximise impact on standards and to narrow attainment gaps. We are investing &#163;24 million in this over the next three years;local authorities should upskill their field force of mathematics consultants; andEvery Child Counts should take place in year 2 and generally be taught by a qualified teacher and involve one child.

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="08061782000037"></a><a name="80617-wms0001.htm_spmin6"></a><b><a name="80617-wms0001.htm_spmin7"></a><a name="08061782000058"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Ashton of Upholland):</b> My right honourable friend the Prime Minister (Gordon Brown) has made the following Statement in the House of Commons.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="08061782000038"></a>The 30th report of the review body on Senior Salaries is being published today. This makes recommendations about the pay of the senior Civil Service (SCS), senior military personnel, the judiciary and very senior NHS managers. Copies have been laid in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I am grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their work.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="08061782000039"></a>The Government have decided to accept all of the main recommendations of the review body as they are affordable and consistent with public sector pay policy. They will be implemented with effect from 1 April 2008. The cost of the awards will be met from within existing departmental expenditure limits.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="08061782000041"></a>For the SCS, the review body has recommended that for the three-year period 2008-11 there should be an indicative envelope of 7 per cent pay bill available for normal base pay increases and additions to the pot for non-consolidated bonuses. This multi-year pay arrangement will provide certainty and stability for departments and the workforce. The Government have decided to accept the recommended 7 per cent envelope but believe that the appropriate metric is pay bill per head rather than pay bill. This ensures that in the event of any changes in workforce size individual pay awards remain consistent with public sector pay policy. The envelope for SCS pay increases and bonuses over the next three years will therefore be 7 per cent of pay bill per head.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08061782000042"></a>For 2008-09, the review body has recommended a headline award of 1.5 per cent and a 1 per cent increase to the size of the bonus pot.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08061782000043"></a>The review body has recommended that progression target rates for pay bands 1 and 1A should be retained. The Government have decided to replace them with &#147;reference points&#148; which will serve a similar purpose but no longer have any limiting point on pay increases for serving staff.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08061782000045"></a>The main recommendations of the review body on senior military pay are:</p>
an increase of 2.2 per cent in the base pay for senior military officers;that two and three-star officers (major generals and lieutenant generals, and equivalents) receive an element of the X-factor (a supplement to base pay in recognition of the differences between military and civilian life) to be phased in over three years commencing 1 April 2008; and that the pay scales are restructured over the course of the next three years in order to give 1-star officers (brigadiers and equivalents) a 10 per cent minimum pay increase on promotion to 2-star.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08061782000047"></a>The review body's main recommendation for the judiciary is an increase averaging slightly over 2.5 per cent for almost all judicial salaries.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08061782000049"></a>The review body considered the pay of very senior NHS managers for the first time this year. It has recommended a 2.2 per cent increase in the pay of these managers from 1 April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08061782000051"></a>Ministers' pay is automatically linked to the average increase in the midpoint of SCS pay, which moves in line with SSRB recommendations. However, given the importance of public sector pay restraint at a time of economic uncertainty, Ministers will not be accepting any pay rise in 2008-09.</p>

<a name="80617-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08061782000052"></a>There is no longer a link between the SSRB's recommendations and the pay of Members of Parliament as there has been in previous years.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08061782000054"></a>The Government have accepted the main recommendations of the SSRB. The three-year pay award for the senior Civil Service will help to deliver economic stability and brings the total of public servants covered by these three-year deals to over 1.5 million.</p>

These illustrative scenarios are meant to capture the uncertainty around the outturn of future fossil fuel prices and are in line with other industry analysts' projections.
