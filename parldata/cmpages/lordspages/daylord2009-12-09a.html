In 2009-10, accelerated spend includes £969 million for DCSF to spend on capital projects in schools, £275 million for BIS to spend on higher education and research infrastructure and £525 million for CLG to spend on housing and regeneration. As reported in the Pre-Budget Report, including projected 2009-10 spending, it is estimated that £1.7 billion of the £3 billion total has now been spent.</p>

But short-term spending commitments are not a substitute for sustained investment, especially as the OECD notes that in Britain infrastructure projects are,</p>
<ul><a name="09120947000196"></a>"typically the first victim of fiscal consolidation efforts, while other less productive but politically sensitive projects survive".</ul>
<p><a name="09120947000189"></a>Will he commit all parts of government properly to consider and publish comparable cost-benefit analysis of major spending proposals, whether these proceed or not?</p>

<p><a name="st_3"></a>

That is absolutely the speed out of the starting blocks that we expect from London First. I am delighted to hear that she welcomes the support to Thameslink and Crossrail. Progress on both has already commenced, as is the case for other major infrastructure expenditure. The OECD's observation about infrastructure and capital expenditure being placed at risk during a recession is tested by the fact that we brought forward capital expenditure. Of course we indicate that it will decline going forward to 2013-14. In fact, it will fall from 3.3 per cent of GDP to about 1.25 per cent. But before we get too alarmed about that, I remind noble Lords that that represents three times the proportion of GDP for 1997 and twice the level in real terms. As far as cost-benefit analysis is concerned, that is at the heart of all our decisions.</p>

But is not the real problem how to get more funds into infrastructure investment? Will the Government give further consideration to the establishment of a national infrastructure bank that can take funds from institutional investors and private savers?</p>

The appointment of Mr Paul Skinner as chairman is to be welcomed. I am not persuaded that an infrastructure bank in itself would offer anything over and above the efforts we will make to channel long-term funds into infrastructure investment. I agree with the noble Lord-or at least with the thesis behind his question-that in the past our major pension funds have not invested in infrastructure projects, which, of course, have many features which would match the liabilities that they are seeking to finance.</p>

Can the Minister confirm that, despite reports in the press today, the Government will not seek to make a binding decision in relation to that runway before the next election?</p>

I shall no doubt establish, and indeed shall ensure, that my colleagues are aware of the reports, but I am unaware of any decisions having been taken in respect of Heathrow in recent days. I am clear that we are committed to investing in Heathrow as a major transport hub to support the UK economy and the integration of London with the regions-something that the party opposite is clearly unwilling to do.</p>

It agreed a report recommending the introduction of Oral Questions to Secretaries of State in this House, amendments to Standing Order 78, which governs the composition of the Committee for Privileges, and the abolition of the Personal Bills Committee. It also discussed the procedural implications of the coming into force of the Lisbon treaty and new editions of the <I>Companion </I>and <I>Erskine May</I>. As always, the Procedure Committee is pleased to consider proposals put forward by noble Lords.</p>

<p><a name="st_13"></a>

However, I do not believe-nor does practice have it-that the Procedure Committee is the best means of bringing about such change. Major changes of the kind that the noble Lord refers to are best considered normally by a Leader's Group and occasionally by a Select Committee. It is then for that group to report to the House and for the House to consider any proposals. The Procedure Committee then implements those proposals. As the noble Lord will be aware, the Leader of the House has already responded to these suggestions-most notably on 25 November and at the Procedure Committee this week-and she is, I understand, considering whether to proceed.</p>

The Motion for Monday's debate, which I shall be opening, is to recommend acceptance of the House Committee's report, but it also recommends setting up an ad hoc group to look into the recommendations.</p>

For that reason, I hope that there would be no movement on it unless it had been put to the whole House and considered in great detail. We all support the comments of the Leader of the House that the present system is working very well, especially in relation to the Lord Speaker.</p>

The noble Lord will no doubt wish to get a copy before they all run out. There is also a copy of a paper from the noble Lord, Lord Roper, the chairman of the European Union Committee.

The Government are working to ensure that we have in place the most effective measures to support their participation. A registration awareness campaign has engaged every Armed Forces unit, and the Government will extend the service declaration period from three years to five to increase convenience.  The Elections Minister met MPs and Armed Forces families' representatives last week to discuss further steps.</p>

Statutorily, there are only 11 working days from the close of nominations until polling day. This is a very tight timeframe, which presents logistical challenges for Armed Forces personnel serving overseas. However, for this election we are attempting to put a scheme in place, which will work for troops on active service in Afghanistan. We have been looking at the current postal voting system and we believe that it is possible to set up such a scheme, which would deliver ballot papers to and from Afghanistan in time for them to be counted. Why? Because there are a lot of supply flights to that country on a very regular basis. We are working towards that end. I have to emphasise that operational priorities must prevail at all times and we cannot guarantee success, but I hope the House will think that it is worthwhile trying.</p>

Representations can now be made to us about the committee's proposals or the original proposals until 19 January 2010. We will carefully consider the committee's advice, all representations received and all other relevant information, before taking our statutory decisions on whether to implement any unitary proposal.</p>

Given that the Boundary Committee is operating under rules that have been set for it by the Government, under what circumstances would the Government not follow the committee's advice?</p>

As for the second point of the noble Baroness's question, until we have gone through the process of receiving representations on both the original proposals and the Boundary Committee's proposals it is impossible to answer that; indeed I think it would be improper to answer it. We need to have a fair period when those representations can be made, heard and considered.</p>

It has cost Norfolk councils £2 million so far, and I believe that Cornwall has overspent by about £10 million. So it is the Conservative policy to revoke any such legislation, to ensure that the scarce resources are properly directed to front-line services. Is this not another example of government-botched business?</p>

If you want proof of that, look at the unitary authorities that were established in just April of this year and what is happening already. These councils are redesigning services to improve outcomes for local people; they are on track to achieve efficiency savings of over £150 million this year; and they are stripping out duplication and inefficiency, including removing some senior management posts, saving £22 million a year. So the proof is there that unitary authorities can work and do work. If you want the classic case of the challenges of two-tier authorities, you have waste collection at one tier of an authority and waste disposal at the other. What on earth is the sense in that?</p>

In terms of reviews, I mentioned a moment ago what has happened to those councils that became unitary in April 2009 and the improvements that are already ensuing. Again as I said previously, what drove the process in the first place were concerns over transparency and particularly over duplication of services in two-tier authorities. It is important that we review the recommendations that come forward and the representations that are made around those proposals. We are dealing here with specific proposals for specific areas.</p>

It is something like two to three weeks. Will he consider extending the timescale? More importantly, given the late stage of this Parliament and the very considerable widespread opposition in Norfolk to these proposals, is it not absurd to proceed with something with substantial upfront costs in the early years to be implemented in the next Parliament when it may well be reversed in that Parliament?</p>

Noble Lords would not expect me to accept that. Assuming that the process is completed in this Parliament, it would take primary legislation to reverse the process. In terms of the timescale, there is a requirement to have a six-week period between the Boundary Committee's recommendations and decisions. We are extending that because there is going to be a six-week period for representations. We believe that is fair. There will be some period over Christmas where there will not necessarily be full engagement, but the six-week period is beyond that required by statute.</p>

The Government are committed to action to tackle bribery. It is an insidious offence that undermines good governance, distorts competition, saps economic and social development and eats away at the very fabric of democratic society. The impact of bribery in developing countries can be particularly acute. It can add 10 per cent to the cost of doing business in some countries and siphons off billions of pounds of development aid into the pockets of corrupt officials.</p>

<a name="91209-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09120947000065"></a>We should be proud of the fact that the UK remains largely untainted by the pernicious presence of bribery and of our strong record as a champion of the global fight against corruption. Last month, Transparency International published its corruption perception index for 2009, which ranks 180 countries according to perceived levels of corruption among public officials and politicians. Inevitably, the expenses scandal has not helped our standing in the world, but we need to put that in perspective. The United Kingdom is ranked as the 17th least corrupt country in the world. We are equal third among the G8 countries and equal fourth among the G20. But we can and should do more. Our standing has been higher in recent years, and we need to reassert our position as a leading global champion against corruption. Taking firm action to address the expenses scandal, as we have done through the creation of the new Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, was one necessary step. The Bill before the House, which will put in place a modern and codified framework of criminal law to tackle bribery in all its manifestations, is another vital step forward.</p>

Your Lordships should be in no doubt that, while the existing criminal law is clearly ripe for reform, this country was and is fully compliant with our international obligations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09120947000067"></a>The issue is not therefore one of compliance or the scope of the existing criminal law, but whether it is wholly fit for purpose. The current law consists of the common law offence of bribery dating back to at least Magna Carta, and various statutory offences, brigaded under the banner of the Prevention of Corruption Acts, enacted in the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century. Given this ancestry, it is not surprising that the Law Commission has described the current law as,</p>

<a name="91209-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09120947000068"></a>While it has long been recognised that the current law is in need of reform, there has been considerable argument and debate about the form that the new body of criminal offences should take. It is for this reason that it has taken us longer than we would have wished to get to the point when we could introduce a Bribery Bill commanding the necessary widespread support, not just from Members of your Lordships House and of the other place, but from the business community and non-governmental organisations. That we have been able to reach this position is in no small way thanks to the careful analysis and consideration, first by the Law Commission and, secondly, by the Joint Committee on the draft Bribery Bill, chaired by the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross. I am delighted that he will speak in this debate. Therefore, on behalf of the Government, I record our gratitude to the Law Commission-to its chairman, in particular-and to all the members of the Joint Committee, especially the noble Viscount.</p>

<a name="91209-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09120947000069"></a>It is a testament to the Joint Committee's cogent analysis that the Government could accept, either wholly or in part, all but one of the committee's 39 conclusions and recommendations. The fact that this Bill has had the benefit of pre-legislative scrutiny does not, of course, mean that your Lordships will not want to scrutinise it in their usual thorough and forensic manner. I trust, however, that we have reached the stage where that examination can be about the finer details of the Bill rather than its core purpose and basic structure.</p>

<a name="91209-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09120947000070"></a>I now turn to the detail of the Bill. It creates two general offences of bribery, a third specific offence of bribing a foreign public official and finally a new corporate offence of failing to prevent bribery. Let me say a little more about each of these four offences. The general offences, in Clauses 1 and 2, cover on one side of the coin the offer, promise and giving of a financial or other advantage, and on the flip side the request, agreeing to receive or acceptance of such an advantage. These offences focus on the conduct of the payer or the recipient of a bribe and describe six scenarios, each involving the improper performance of a function, where one or other offence would be committed. These new offences will apply to functions of a public nature as well as in a business, professional or employment context.</p>

<a name="91209-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09120947000071"></a>Clause 6 introduces a bespoke offence of bribing foreign public officials. As I have already made clear, the absence of such an offence in our current law does not put the United Kingdom in breach of our international obligations. The existing general offences and, for that matter, their replacements in Clauses 1 and 2, cover the territory of the OECD convention, which does not require a separate offence. Indeed, in September last year the City of London Police secured the conviction, under the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906, of a managing director of a Wiltshire-based company in connection with the bribery of a Ugandan Government official. Having said that, we recognise that a bespoke offence would further underline this country's commitment to international efforts to stamp out the particularly insidious practice of bribing foreign public officials, not least because of the devastating impact that such practices can have in developing countries.</p>

<a name="91209-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09120947000072"></a>This quartet of new offences is completed by the offence of failure by a commercial organisation to prevent bribery. Again, corporate liability for bribery, as with other offences, is an existing feature of our criminal law. But this is another area where there is a compelling case for a bespoke, targeted offence.</p>

<a name="91209-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09120947000073"></a>One of the core conclusions of the committee chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf-I am delighted that he is speaking in this debate-into the ethical policies and procedures of BAE was the need for a proactive role for a company board in securing and maintaining high standards of ethical business conduct. We agree. But these are matters that are too important to be left to the commercial sector alone. The Law Commission came to the same conclusion.</p>

<a name="91209-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09120947000074"></a>Clause 7 creates an offence of failing to prevent bribery which can only be committed by a relevant commercial organisation. The clause also provides for a defence for a commercial organisation to show that it had adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery. We recognise that there has been considerable debate about what constitutes "adequate procedures" for these purposes. As we indicated in our response to the Joint Committee, the Government agree that guidance should be made available to commercial organisations. We propose that such guidance should be available well in advance of the new offences coming into force.</p>

<a name="91209-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09120947000075"></a>Over the coming months we will develop appropriate guidance, drawing on the expertise of business representatives, Transparency International and others. Among other things, we envisage that the guidance will provide illustrative good practice examples of adequate procedures.</p>

<a name="91209-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09120947000076"></a>While guidance will be in place to assist business, the message from the Bill is clear. The payment of bribes, including facilitation payments, is unlawful. If companies pay them in order to gain a business advantage they run the risk of prosecution. Bribery on any scale cannot and should not be tolerated or condoned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09120947000077"></a>Clause 12 provides a defence for law enforcement agencies, the security services and the Armed Forces. This is a significant departure from the draft Bill which included an authorisation scheme in respect of the security services. That scheme did not find favour with the Joint Committee. We accept that an authorisation  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1088"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1088</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>scheme, which was capable of conferring a broad exemption for the security services, was arguably cast too widely. I welcome the fact that in its briefing, Transparency International,</p>
<ul><a name="09120947000199"></a>"accepts that the Government has responded positively",</ul>
<p><a name="09120947000200"></a>to the Joint Committee's recommendation on this issue.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09120947000078"></a>While we have removed the authorisation procedure, we remain firmly of the view that some provision is required to address those circumstances in which the security services, law enforcement agencies and the military may have to use financial or other inducements to enable them effectively to discharge their functions.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09120947000079"></a>We note of course that the much-respected Constitution Committee of this House has expressed some concerns about this clause in the report it published last Friday. We thank the committee and its chairman for the report. Your Lordships may be assured that we will study it and its conclusions with care. We will respond to the committee in due course, having also heard the views of other noble Lords on this issue today and later on in Committee.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09120947000080"></a>There is one point that is not in the Bill but which the House would expect me to mention. The general offences in the Bill apply to all those performing functions of a public nature. As such, we intend that the Bill would apply to Members of this House and of the other place. The Joint Committee did not demur from this. It is, I believe, axiomatic that no Peer or Member of Parliament should be above the law. The draft Bill sought to deal with the consequences of this by providing for Article 9 of the Bill of Rights 1689 to be waived so that the words or conduct of a Member of Parliament or Peer charged with an offence under the Bill may be admissible as evidence.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09120947000081"></a>We recognise that the issue of parliamentary privilege is an emotive one, as we saw during the passage of the Parliamentary Standards Act. Members of both Houses rightly do not want to see an erosion of hard-won freedoms. The Joint Committee took the view that there were dangers in adopting a seemingly piecemeal and inconsistent approach to parliamentary privilege and suggested that the matter should more appropriately be dealt with in a parliamentary privilege Act. Given the Joint Committee's conclusion on this matter and the complexities and sensitivities surrounding this issue, we have not included provision in respect of parliamentary privilege in the Bill as introduced into your Lordships' House. None the less, we recognise that the House will wish to consider this issue carefully during the course of our debates, both today and during the subsequent amending stages of the Bill. We look forward to those debates and will reflect carefully on what is said on both sides of the argument.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09120947000082"></a>This is an important Bill which will deliver a modern and comprehensive body of criminal law to support the work of law enforcement agencies and prosecutors in rigorously combating bribery, both in the United Kingdom and abroad. It is an outcome to which everyone can subscribe and I hope the Bill will enjoy support from all sides of the House. We look forward to working with noble Lords to ensure its speedy progress. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<a name="09120947000083"></a><b><a name="91209-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09120947000302"></a>Lord Mackay of Clashfern:</b> My Lords, I warmly welcome the Bill and thank the Minister for the clear way in which he has introduced it. I also thank the Government for the required preparation. Your Lordships will recollect that a previous draft Bill was rejected by a Joint Committee of both Houses presided over by the late Lord Slynn of Hadley, to whom I pay tribute for the work he did while a Member of the House in both its judicial and legislative capacity.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09120947000084"></a>The principles set out in the Bill, and the manner in which it has been put together, are very clear and acceptable. I hope that the Bill will be given a Second Reading with acclamation. I am glad that it is proposed that it will then be referred to a Grand Committee because the Minister has hinted that there a number of detailed points of a committee nature that need to be addressed. I shall mention one or two-I shall not attempt to be exhaustive-which have occurred to me on studying the background and the Bill itself.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09120947000085"></a>My first point relates to what have been called "facilitation payments". The noble Lord, Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, gave a good example of these to the Joint Committee. He referred to the captain of a ship who, when seeking to have its cargo unloaded, was told by the stevedores at the port that it would be unloaded only on the condition that a payment was made to someone nominated by the stevedores, not necessarily to the stevedores themselves. That is a very difficult position for the captain of a ship to be in, and yet, if he paid, the Bill would criminalise his payment. Another example I have come across-there are quite a number in this general area-is that of someone on a business trip who, in order to board the aeroplane at the airport, has to get a boarding pass. He is asked by the official issuing the boarding pass for money, not to pay airport taxes but as a payment to the man himself-or the woman herself, of course; it is equally dangerous when it comes from that quarter. It is a difficult issue and I wonder whether the ordinary defence of duress could be adapted and available in this situation.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09120947000086"></a>The Minister mentioned the provisions about companies and one of the questions that arises is about the relationship between a holding company and, let us say, an overseas subsidiary company in regard to these responsibilities. We will want to examine these matters.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09120947000087"></a>There is also a question, as the noble Lord mentioned, about the defence of adequate procedures. There have been many requests, as the noble Lord also said, for authoritative guidance in this area. Having wondered about this, I think that the department of the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, could be responsible for giving guidance, just as the Department for Transport is responsible for the <I>Highway Code</I>. The provisions which give effect to the <I>Highway</I><I> Code</I> in law would be quite adequate for dealing with this matter. It would not be conclusive one way or the other, but it would be guidance that could be referred to as authoritative with the tendency either to implicate or to exculpate according to the situation. A great deal of the difficulty would be resolved by authoritative guidance of that kind, developed by the Department for Business,   


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1090"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1090</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Innovation and Skills after consultation with the business community. There are many different types of businesses operating overseas, where the question of what is adequate will depend very much on the nature of the business and on the knowledge it has of the situation overseas.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09120947000088"></a>There are many other questions that might be raised in Committee. I am concerned about the nature of the consent required for prosecutions. These offences under the older law generally required the consent of the Attorney-General. In the Bill, that has been replaced by the consent requirement of the three relevant directors, depending on the situation. The OECD had something to say about this. I think it is highly undesirable to reduce the responsibility of the Attorney-General, who is accountable to Parliament, in this area. It is true that some people suggest that because a person is a member of the Government, his or her discretionary judgments cannot be justified or treated as trustworthy. Some people may think that, but I think that the last thing that politicians, those with a responsibility in politics, should do is to accede to that. It is very important that the person taking decisions in this area should be accountable to Parliament. A great deal has been done and I have no doubt will be done in the development of protocols between the Attorney-General and the directors and that is a good and useful development, but I find it difficult to agree that the Attorney-General's consent should be taken out of the Bill without the full discussion that will ultimately be required under the provisions of the constitutional Bill now before Parliament.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09120947000089"></a>The last point that I want to make is in relation to Clause 12 and concerns the empowerment of the law enforcement agencies, the Secret Service, including GCHQ, and the Armed Forces on active service to do what the Bill would make unlawful, but to do it lawfully because they have authority to do so. The Constitution Committee has dealt with this in great detail and in a way that I find very convincing. This is a point that requires to be considered in Committee and I have no doubt that in due course it will be.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09120947000090"></a>In conclusion, we are greatly indebted to the Joint Committee for its consideration of the Bill-and very full and detailed consideration it was. Those thanks go to its chairman and to all its members. I also thank especially the Law Commission, and I venture to suggest that if its talents were used more freely in connection with the development of criminal justice legislation in this country, the system might be a good deal simpler, and a good deal better. I hope that the Government, having regard to how the procedure has developed into a Bill that is, I hope, very acceptable around the House, might find that attractive for further developments in the criminal justice system as a whole. Whatever can be said about the Bill, both in its substantive provisions and its procedures-particularly in relation to sentencing and the recovery of the proceeds of crime-it cannot be described as simple.</p>

I was also a member of the Joint Committee that considered this Bill in pre-legislative scrutiny.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09120947000094"></a>As I said while speaking in the Queen's Speech debate, this Bill is long overdue. Our current law is based on Acts of 1889, 1906 and 1916. The previous attempt to reform our legislation on corruption was abandoned in 2003, when the pre-legislative scrutiny committee was very critical of the draft Bill-here, I support the tribute from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, to my old friend the late Lord Slynn. However, it is virtually a unanimous view that the current Bill is a great improvement on its 2003 predecessor and I entirely agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, said on that.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09120947000095"></a>So far as the work of the Joint Committee was concerned, after its first meeting I thought that we would never come to an agreement about the changes to the law that were needed, but I was wrong. The committee's report was ultimately unanimous. I think that I speak for all its members in being very grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross, for his chairmanship. Many of the recommendations of the committee were, as the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said, accepted by the Government. In particular, the Government have introduced Clause 7 of the Bill as a replacement for Clause 5 of the draft Bill, which would have made it difficult-and, I believe, virtually impossible-to obtain the conviction of a company, even if it had failed to take reasonable steps to prevent bribery. That is an extremely important change, which greatly improves the Bill.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09120947000096"></a>Another issue on which the Government moved some way-although in my view not far enough-towards the recommendations made by the committee was in relation to guidance. The committee decided that guidance needs to be given on what amount to adequate procedures as a defence for a company to prosecution under Clause 7. In paragraph 16 of their response to the committee's report, the Government propose non-statutory guidance. What the Government propose to put into that guidance seems, so far as I am aware of it, reasonable. However, non-statutory guidance presumably means that nothing in the Bill will require this Government or any future Government to produce guidance. The provision of guidance is sufficiently important to require the insertion into this Bill of a duty for the Government to provide it. In the Bill's present form, there is no such duty.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1092"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1092</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91209-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09120947000097"></a>The committee did not suggest-nor does the Bill require-that there should be any system of clearances for individual projects, as is provided for in the USA. The view taken by this Bill on that subject is quite correct. Clause 9 transfers the need for consent to prosecution from the Attorney-General to the directors of the prosecuting authorities. The Attorney-General, however, retains the power of direction. I disagree fundamentally with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, on this. I believe that the Attorney-General should not have a power of direction so long as she remains a member of the Government. I should add that it is perfectly possible, although it would be somewhat unusual, for somebody to be accountable to Parliament for a decision that was not that of a Minister. However, although I disagree with this provision, I do not think that that is a cause for any change in the Bill, because it is not a matter for the Bill; if the position of the Attorney-General is to be changed in this respect, that needs to be dealt with in a separate Bill.</p>

One would rather have been swallowed up by the earth than have allowed anything in the nature of an ordinary ministerial duty to affect one's judgment. That was the tradition with which I came into the department.</p>

He, too, was a member of the Joint Committee. But however high the standards-and I think that they were of the highest for both him and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew-it increases the risk if somebody both holds the job of being the legal adviser to the Government and is a member of that Government. I would prefer that that did not happen. However, as I said, it is not a matter for this Bill.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09120947000100"></a>I have never understood why at the time of the abandonment of the investigation of BAE's dealings with Saudi Arabia the then Attorney-General, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, pushed the decision to discontinue the investigation on to the director of the Serious Fraud Office rather than taking that decision himself. It does seem that he would have been the appropriate person to take that decision.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09120947000101"></a>Now I come to what I see as the most serious problem in the Bill. Clause 13 of the draft Bill gave exemption from bribery offences for acts authorised by the Secretary of State so far as necessary for the functions of-to use their nicknames-MI5, MI6 or GCHQ. The committee was highly critical of this on the grounds that, first, it was not satisfied that domestic intelligence agencies-that is, MI5 and GHCQ-in fact needed the power to bribe; secondly, the Bill was not the right vehicle for extending the powers of the intelligence agencies; and, thirdly, it was doubtful in the eyes of the committee whether Clause 13 met the United Kingdom's international obligations, especially in so far as exemption could be extended to activities that were intended to protect the UK's economic interests, not just to national security or serious crime.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1093"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1093</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91209-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09120947000102"></a>The Government's reaction to that recommendation was quite startling. They replaced Clauses 13 and 14 from the draft Bill, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, has already pointed out, with Clause 12 of the present Bill. Not only do they fail to accept any of the points put forward by the committee, but they are substantially extending the exemptions. The security services are exempt, but so are law enforcement organisations engaged in the prevention, detection or investigation of serious crime and the Armed Forces on active service. The exemptions do not require any action by the Secretary of State in advance. Furthermore, the SFO and a senior representative of the police both said in written evidence to the Joint Committee that exemptions should not apply to them. I refer to pages 191 and 321 of Volume II, the evidence volume, of the committee's report.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09120947000103"></a>The question of giving exemption to the Armed Forces was never put to the committee for consideration. In their response to the committee, the Government have given no explanation of the circumstances in which the Armed Forces might require the use of those exemptions. It is arguable that there are some circumstances in which obtaining information could be regarded as falling within the scope of the Bribery Bill and that they therefore need some form of exemption-for instance, if MI6 were to pay a person employed in a uranium enrichment plant somewhere in the Middle East to tell it what was happening there. However, if an employee in a company that is conducting a major fraud gives information to the SFO or the police that will assist them in arresting those responsible, I cannot see that giving that information, whether paid for or not, can possibly be regarded as an improper performance of an employee's functions. If that is right, the action of the SFO or the police in paying informers or deciding not to prosecute them is plainly not bribery. If there is any doubt about that, a simple amendment would put it beyond doubt and would make a large part of Clause 12 unnecessary. Whatever the position may be for MI6, I do not believe that the exemption is needed for law enforcement agencies and no justification has yet been put forward for extending exemptions to the Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09120947000104"></a>There is one other matter of concern. The Bill does not deal adequately with the possible liability of a company for acts of bribery committed by a subsidiary or a joint venture company in which it holds an interest. The committee was unable to come up with proposals for how to deal with this because of shortage of time; we were allowed only a very busy 10 weeks in which to consider the Bill. As a result, the Bill does not include any recommendations for how this problem is to be dealt with. Plainly, there is a gap. Apparently, this will be left to be considered by the Law Commission when it is reviewing the law on corporate liability for crime. That may be some time off and meanwhile the absence of rules in the Bill could lead to serious loopholes in criminal prosecutions. I would have preferred to have had this matter covered by the Bill, but I am afraid, given the approach of the end of the present Parliament, it is not practical to include any amendments for this purpose during the time available. The gap will have to be closed at a later date, but that date needs to be as soon as possible.</p>

I hope that the Bill will be enacted speedily and push this country up the league table of the least corrupt countries, from a disappointing 17th place, if I understood the Minister correctly, to a Champions League position.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09120947000110"></a>I will focus my comments on Clause 12. Like the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, I regard Clause 12 as the most controversial provision of the Bill, providing as it does a defence for certain bribery offences for persons engaged in law enforcement functions, the work of the security and intelligence services, and the conduct of the Armed Forces. Such exemptions inevitably raise difficult and sensitive questions about the rule of law. As the Minister has already mentioned, your Lordships' Constitution Committee, of which I am a member, has published a report critical of Clause 12, which I commend to the House. I should like to mention briefly my three main concerns about Clause 12.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09120947000111"></a>My first concern is to understand why the Government think that it is appropriate to create an exemption for the domestic intelligence services from the criminal offence of bribery. The Joint Committee, at paragraph 203 of its report published in July, said that it had heard,</p>
<ul><a name="09120947000201"></a>"no persuasive evidence of a need for the domestic intelligence agencies to be granted an authorisation to bribe".</ul>
<p><a name="09120947000191"></a>Why then have the Government not accepted the recommendation of the Joint Committee to remove the clause creating this defence? In any event, surely the Joint Committee was correct when it said, at paragraphs 202 and 203 of its report, that if the intelligence services believe that they can justify exemptions from the criminal law, the case should be put before this House and the other place by means of an appropriate amendment to the Intelligence Services Act 1994.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09120947000112"></a>My second concern is that the Government's response to the report of the Joint Committee on these defences was not to narrow the exemptions from those in the draft Bill, but to increase them. The exemption in the draft Bill was confined to the security and intelligence services. The Government now seek to include in  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1095"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1095</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Clause 12 an exemption for law enforcement agencies-a category which is broadly defined to cover bodies such as HM Revenue and Customs, local authority trading standards officers and environmental health officers. That is a very broad description indeed.</p>

<a name="91209-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09120947000113"></a>The Joint Committee noted at paragraph 195 of its report that the evidence it received from the police and the Serious Fraud Office on the defence for the intelligence services did not suggest that the police and SFO believed that they needed any such defence for their own activities. Why then has an exemption for law enforcement agencies now been added to the Bill? In what circumstances is it envisaged that the police, Revenue and Customs, and local authority trading standards officers should be permitted to bribe people? Is there any evidence at all that the absence to date of such a power has hindered the effective performance of law enforcement functions?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91209-0004.htm"/>


<a name="91209-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09120947000114"></a>My third and final concern about Clause 12 is that in any event it does not contain the protection for the public interest contained in Clauses 13 and 14 of the draft Bill. The draft Bill confined the intelligence and security services exemptions to those cases where a prior authorisation to the act of bribery was given by the Secretary of State or a senior official. If law enforcement functions are to be added, prior authorisation should be by the Attorney-General.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09120947000115"></a>It is quite unacceptable for any intelligence officer of whatever rank, any employee of the CPS or any employee of a local authority carrying out law enforcement functions to be able to decide for themselves to carry out an act of bribery. Cases of bribery by public officials in order to carry out an intelligence function, a security function or a law enforcement function would, I hope we can all agree, be very rare exceptions. Any such departure from the rule of law must surely be carefully considered in advance by very senior officers of the state-not least to avoid any later dispute as to whether the officer was genuinely acting for official purposes, as well as to ensure that such conduct was truly necessary and proportionate. Paragraph 200 of the Joint Committee's report refers to the evidence of the noble and learned Baroness, the Attorney-General. She emphasised to the Joint Committee that the prior authorisation procedure was an important safeguard. I respectfully agree.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09120947000116"></a>Those are my main concerns about Clause 12. I give notice to the Minister that I-and, I am sure, many other noble Lords-very much look forward to debating with him during the passage of the Bill whether Clause 12 is necessary, whether it is proportionate and whether it is consistent with the rule of law.</p>

We have had time to think about the subject-some may say, and have said, too much time, but at least the result is worth it. Particularly, the judicious and vigorous chairmanship of the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross, enabled the scrutiny committee on the second draft Bill to reach unanimity in even the most difficult areas. The chairmanship of the late and much lamented Lord Slynn of Hadley was valiant too, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, said, he had a much worse

We on the scrutiny committees also had the benefit of in-depth analysis by Transparency International UK. I declare an interest as a member of its Advisory Council. The Government's response has been unfailingly constructive. I would say one could welcome this Bill unreservedly would this not risk putting some of your Lordships out of their job of examining legislation.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09120947000118"></a>It is important to see this Bill in a wider context. It does not just reform our outdated and piecemeal domestic law on bribery. It tackles wrongs-evils-suffered by people far beyond our frontiers. To quote the G8 2006 communiqué:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="09120947000194"></a>"Large-scale corruption ... can have a devastating effect on democracy, the rule of law and economic and social development. We recognise that corrupt practices contribute to the spread of organised crime and terrorism, undermine public trust in government and destabilise economies. Corruption can deter foreign investment, stifle economic growth and sustainable development and undermine legal and judicial systems. The net effect of corruption is felt most directly, and disproportionately, by the poor".</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09120947000119"></a>The Government's impact statement on the Bill, which is a very good read, gives chapter and verse about the deleterious effect of bribery on business as well as on economic and social development. Your Lordships may also know that the combination of the huge increase in global trade and the wide reach of exemplar legislation such as the American Foreign Corrupt Practices Act have changed the climate of business opinion about getting away with bribery, for good. In a way, the OECD anti-bribery convention is a subsidiary instrument to the change in reality. It is none the less the mark against which our Bill today will be judged.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09120947000120"></a>I think the Bill will comply, and the UK can hold its head up among the company of OECD nations. But there is one area where I also should like to press my noble friend the Minister. This is the defence for the security services. I welcome the fact that the Government have tried to meet some of the reservations of the scrutiny committee, but I recall the OECD stricture that while the purpose of national security is a valid defence, other actions undertaken by security services-for instance, in the service of national economic interests-are not. The defence in the current Bill covers any proper function of the security services, which includes more than national security. I see that the Constitution Committee is of the same mind, as well as all previous speakers in this debate. Can my noble friend offer a further narrowing of this defence?</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09120947000121"></a>Other noble Lords have enumerated the many positive provisions of the Bill, both in the debate on the gracious Speech and earlier today. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench, called it "a beacon". I will not duplicate what other noble Lords have said, but simply conclude by saying that this is a remarkably good Bill which has made a difficult subject manageable and implementable. Even more good will ensue when it becomes law, and that must be soon.</p>

Those are the two declarations that I should make at the beginning of my speech.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09120947000123"></a>I have four points to make: on the terrible and terribly corrosive effects that bribery has; on the need for strong corporate cultures, above all else, in civil and commercial society, as the bedrock of any defence against bribery; on the beneficial effects of the new duties laid on companies and, therefore, on their directors-in particular, on non-executive directors; and on the need to ensure that our security, intelligence, police and military are not impeded in any way in their sometimes covert but often life and/or property-saving activities. From what I have heard so far, I may be a sole voice arguing that in your Lordships' Chamber this afternoon.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09120947000124"></a>First, although I must say to the noble Lord, Lord Bach, that I deplore the length of time that it has taken for the Government to table the Bill after what has been said about the issue since 1997, I am glad that they have done it. I also note that they are doing something that Ministers are usually rightly restrained in claiming, which is introducing legislation with a strong moral component. It would be risky for the Minister to say that in his own praise, but I recognise that. Bribery at home and, in particular, abroad, undermines the rule of law, attacks the excellent principles of fair competition, as the Minister said, but, worst of all, is a morally destructive crime that has devastating effects on the poor and on the human rights of those in our less well off countries.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09120947000125"></a>This happens because bribery often diverts scarce resources in poor countries towards the purchase of inferior products. I have observed that in a business context. It certainly corrupts financial regulators, where there are such persons present in third-world countries, and police forces alike with devastating abandon, and sometimes leads to attendant violence. All those economic and human costs are usually felt most directly by the poor, just as development and democracy are undermined, as the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said in his introductory remarks.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09120947000126"></a>Secondly, although I welcome both the economic and moral purpose of the Bill, all the new sanctions and penalties that it introduces will be of naught to companies where that sort of behaviour has been almost institutionalised unless it is paralleled by deep, lasting and profound corporate cultural change. See a company-I have observed this-where bribery has been used and, generally speaking, you are looking at a company with a weak and devious corporate culture, with scant regard for proper ethical behaviour, little or no ethical training for staff, weak or dismissive board practices and, worst of all, an absolute determination to win contracts at all costs. That characterises companies where bribery has been used-here I speak about western European and, alas, UK companies.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09120947000127"></a>An example of this that has been used before is when such a company comes into receipt of proprietary information concerning products or intellectual property alike that belongs to a competitor who is chasing the self-same enticing contract. Rather than sending that information straight back unread, it uses the information  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1098"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1098</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to try to win the contract. That sort of company provides a positive incubating nursery for bribery. The board of that company is to blame, straight and simple. Corporate adherence to the law must always be prefigured by the construction of a strong ethical corporate culture that starts at the very top with the chairman, the chief executive, the chief operating officer and the non-executive directors, as it does in the best of the world's great companies, with ethical training being the norm.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09120947000128"></a>This is certainly not the place for a quick or slow seminar on how all that can be done but, in essence, every employee, great or small, should in such companies have a lively sense of, put simply, whether they would mind what they are about to do in private being writ large in public. That is a very simple test. In other words, would you mind your family or friends knowing what you are about to do, and the media then studiously reporting it? That is the key question. It has the great benefit of also being a very simple question. I have observed good practice in international companies where that is drawn again and again to the attention of individuals.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09120947000129"></a>Thirdly, directors of UK companies are moving into a new world of duties to prevent bribery, which I hope will be no mere box-ticking exercise. Indeed, it cannot be because it will demand a demonstrable set of adequate procedures being put in place to prevent bribes being paid. Only if this is demonstrable will they be able to seek mitigation and to avoid corporate liability. This is the world of strict liability as I, no lawyer, understand it.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09120947000130"></a>I say with respect-which I understand is the correct term to use-to my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern that no amount of guidance from the business ministry will help in this context. It is the companies themselves which, if challenged, must be able to demonstrate that they have those procedures in place; appealing to some bit of ministerial guidance will not help.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09120947000131"></a>It is not for the provisions of Clause 7 to spell out how this defence could be erected-that is not for an Act of Parliament to do. However, it is clear that to do so, companies would be taking a great risk merely to rest on some once-written but then quickly forgotten code of practice, which is dished out to employees on the first day that they come into service but not refreshed on an annual basis. I believe that ethics training on an annual basis is critical. It should start at the top, with the chairman, chief executive and board. They should be trained and refreshed just as much annually as those lower down the corporate structure. In other words, we need to show a continuum of corporate behaviour that illustrates that the culture of ethical behaviour is underpinned in this way.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09120947000132"></a>Doubtless there will be a huge growth in the consultants industry, with people advising boards, for considerable fees, on how to do this. That is not something for consultants; it is for the boards to take on board themselves.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09120947000133"></a>Fourthly and lastly, I am very glad-and thus far I am a lonely voice-that there seems to be reasonable cover in Clause 12, subject to all the forthcoming probing in Committee, for our intelligence services,  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1099"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1099</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>police forces and Armed Forces, in that financial and related advantages may be in the interests of security. I was saddened to see the inability of lobbying organisations such as Transparency International, which has done useful work, to recognise the need to protect life and limb in this way in extremis. Notwithstanding what the Minister said in his emollient introductory remarks to Transparency International's suggestions, in its view, recently circulated to your Lordships, it would have preferred Clause 12 to be omitted completely. That is what Transparency International said. This is a grudging acceptance, which I imagine will be played out during the debates on Clause 12; I do not envy the Minister in having to handle those particular debates.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09120947000134"></a>I was equally surprised to see the conclusion of the Joint Committee on the draft Bribery Bill. It says at paragraph 30 on page 88 of volume 1 of its report, published on 16 July 2009, that there was no,</p>
<ul><a name="09120947000202"></a>"need for the domestic intelligence agencies to be granted an authorisation to bribe".</ul>
<p><a name="09120947000192"></a>Tell that to those involved with the police or the domestic intelligence agencies which, domestically-not abroad in some conveniently distant uranium enrichment plant in Iran-may, using public money for the covert end of gaining intelligence via an informer, be in a position to prevent public carnage in some terrorist outrage.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09120947000135"></a>I fully accept that I have not read things in great enough detail; I should have consulted the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, for a quick tutorial, because I recognise that having trading standards officers et cetera embraced in this provision is probably a little bit daft, even for someone as robust on these issues as myself. But that said, I believe that it would be entirely wrong to deny domestic intelligence, and indeed police officials, the opportunity to use public money covertly to prevent terrorist outrages. Can you imagine if they did not and there was a terrorist outrage? The whole public inquiry industry would explode around us and many people would make a lot of money from attending to it.</p>

My experience in that capacity makes it obvious that I should, and do, welcome the Bill. Legislation of this quality was sorely needed, and it is my hope that it will play the part that the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, indicated, by helping to restore the reputation of this country. I have no doubt as a result of very instructive evidence that I received from Transparency International and others, including the OECD, that the lack of legislation was something that they were very concerned about, because they felt that this country was failing to perform its natural role as a global leader of proper ethical standards.

From my perspective, looking at the  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1100"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1100</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bill as a whole, I believe that it is one that we should readily accept. However, as a lay member of the Constitution Committee I draw attention to the committee's report and suggest that, when one looks at Clause 12, there is a weakness in the Bill in its present form.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09120947000138"></a>I would not base my criticisms of Clause 12 on who is included or not included but would adopt a more holistic approach by suggesting that this provision is not needed. I would suggest that the defence is put there no doubt to give reassurance to those who are referred to. However, if the defence were to be available-and a very heavy burden is placed on those who seek to rely on this defence, having regard to it being necessary to do so-I would be confident that the Attorney-General, if it be the Attorney-General whose consent was required, or one of the three directors who are referred to in the Bill, would consent to a prosecution. It seems to me that if it was clear that what was done was necessary in the public interest, then that is not a situation when prosecutions should occur. It should be no problem for the agencies referred to to be able to inform the law officer or director concerned that that is the position.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09120947000139"></a>As to whether it should be the Attorney-General or one of the directors concerned, I would support it being done by the Attorney-General. Recent experience has shown that there are great benefits in the person who has the onerous task of exercising that responsibility being clearly responsible to Parliament. It is also beneficial for Parliament to be able to question why a consent has not been given. Furthermore, I suggest that the message given by the presence of the defence will be seized on by detractors of this country, in so far as their activities in relation to corruption are concerned, as not giving the necessary support that those who want to eliminate corruption would expect.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09120947000140"></a>The other matter I want to refer to is guidance. Normally, it is not desirable for guidance to enter into areas of criminal law. On the evidence I heard in the committee, I have no doubt that a case can properly be made that this is an exceptional Bill in this respect. What is meant by "bribery" is particularly difficult to define exactly. It is no doubt because of those difficulties that the Minister indicated in a letter of 8 December this year to the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, chairman of the Constitution Committee, that it is the intention of the Government not only that there should be guidance but that the guidance should be issued before the legislation is brought into force. If the Government have given an assurance of that nature, which I have no doubt the Minister will be happy to confirm today, then it is of not great significance whether it is statutory or non-statutory guidance. What I apprehend will happen is the very difficult situations that can arise will seriatim be the result of decisions by those who have responsibility in this area. A common law will then develop with examples of situations which fall on either side of the line. That there has to be a line, and that it is a grey and indistinct line, is beyond doubt. One already knows of the situations that can occur: we have heard of one example, and I could give many more, showing that the industrial world is not sure how this legislation is to be applied. That it should be applied is of great importance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09120947000141"></a>It is right, as the noble Lord, Lord Patten, indicated, that there has to be a change of culture inside companies. It is very important that people in these companies should realise what they have to focus on. In practice, what is or is not corrupt is very easy to identify even though it is difficult to define. In particular, it has to be clear that for bribery it is not a sufficient justification to say, "I could not get the business otherwise". If you have to offer a bribe to obtain business, any company concerned for its reputation will decide not to do that business. That has to be the clear message. It is difficult, in producing a criminal offence, to give that message, but it has to be made clear in guidance. So I welcome that aspect of the Bill.</p>

I strongly support the Bill in principle, but it is important that we scrutinise carefully its detailed provisions. These cover: first, the law of bribery as it is to apply in the United Kingdom; and, secondly-this is particularly important-the law that in future is to apply to the bribery of foreign public officials.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09120947000143"></a>There is quite properly a strong desire, led by bodies such as the Corner House and Transparency International, to seek to do everything that we can to stamp out the widespread bribery that exists in substantial areas of foreign trade and commerce. But this is a complex area. If the new law is to be successful, it must be drafted with as much clarity as possible and it must be seen to be fair.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09120947000144"></a>Juries are on the whole not at all reluctant to convict for the very nasty criminal offences generally known as bribery and corruption. As the Law Commission has said, in general 95 per cent of the public have a good understanding of what these words mean. The Director of Public Prosecutions confirmed in writing to the Joint Committee on the draft Bill that the state of the current law has not in the past 15 years caused any serious problems in bringing prosecutions. I know from my own experience going back to 1979 that the same was true during that period. The main problem in prosecuting bribery has never been the law; rather, it is the obtaining of the necessary evidence. None the less, during my period in office, some very serious cases of bribery were prosecuted successfully. The first of the Guinness cases, involving Messrs Saunders, Ronson, Parnes and another, was one example of massive bribes. Other cases involved a series of carefully planned bribes in relation to contracts for the supply of expensive equipment in connection with the production of North Sea oil.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09120947000145"></a>Some supporters of the Bill believe that the fulfilment of our OECD obligations, which I strongly support, would produce a radical change. Clause 7 of the Bill imposes a duty on commercial organisations to prevent bribery. This will, I think, have a significant beneficial effect. I was personally impressed by the seriousness with which the duty to prevent bribery seemed to be taken by the representatives of major businesses who  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1102"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>appeared before the Joint Committee. But unnecessary or undue complexity, particularly coupled with any sense of unfairness, runs the risk of making offences that in concept, although usually not in execution, are quite simple unnecessarily difficult to prove. I will highlight briefly some of the key issues on which we should focus.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09120947000146"></a>The first-I feel that I have an uphill task in making this point-is the complexity of Clauses 1 to 5 of the Bill and the meaning of "improper", which has been chosen as the key word to summarise the necessary criminality. I say this with some diffidence, because no one has greater respect for Lord Slynn; I was his first pupil. He had an immensely difficult task and the law commissioners worked extremely hard on this, for which I pay them tribute. However, I share the view of some leading practitioners at the Bar that these clauses are complex and difficult to unravel.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09120947000147"></a>The word "improper" in the dictionary has a large number of meanings that fall well short of criminality-"abnormal", "incorrect", "unsuitable", "ill adapted", "unbecoming", "indecorous" and "indecent" are all examples. The noun "impropriety" includes "inappropriateness" and "unseemliness", as well as the more pertinent "morally improper conduct". There is a serious argument about whether the concepts of corruption and/or dishonesty should be a requirement of the offence. I think that we need to revisit that carefully.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09120947000148"></a>In one of the leading cases, the Lord Chief Justice, though hesitating over whether dishonesty was essential, handed down a ruling that the conduct must at least have been the "product of an evil mind", which seems to be a distinction without a great deal of difference. Juries understand well what is meant by "dishonesty" and, indeed, by "corrupt". Whatever the Bill says, they will be reluctant to convict an individual unless they are satisfied that the underlying conduct was dishonest or corrupt. Provided that the prosecution can marshal and present the basic facts, the dishonesty or corruption of the conduct usually sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>

<a name="91209-0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09120947000149"></a>There are alternative solutions to the present drafting, at which I hope the Government will look constructively and, if we can do a good job, perhaps favourably. One is the Australian solution, which will be well known to the department. It is not as concise as the present law in England, but it sets out the requirements very clearly and has the support of practitioners with a deep knowledge of the subject. The other is to seek to produce-this may involve some rather hard Christmas work-a shorter opening clause or clauses, amalgamating the provisions of the common law offence of bribery and the statutory provisions of the Acts of 1889, 1906 and 1916, each as amended by succeeding Acts and finally by Section 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. There is a great deal of overlap in the wording of those Acts and consolidation is a proper and potentially useful approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09120947000150"></a>Other matters on which we must focus are the absence of the defence recommended by the Law Commission at pages 128 to 136 of its October 2008 report, summarised at paragraph 7.49, to the effect that the person alleged to have offered the bribe has a defence if they show on the balance of probabilities that they reasonably believed that they were legally obliged or legally permitted to do so by the law of the

That may worry some colleagues and noble Lords who were on the Joint Committee; we had some discussion on it, but it deserves to be revisited. Should such a law be a written law? I am inclined to think that it should, but this is the real world. Some of the more sophisticated countries where this kind of corruption has taken place will probably find it only too easy to produce a convenient written law, but some of the less sophisticated countries may not produce any written law, but may indulge in practices that put the businesses in question in real difficulties. Maybe guidance will help; maybe it will not.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09120947000151"></a>I agree strongly with my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern about the role of the Attorney-General. Noble Lords might expect me to say that. At present, the Attorney-General must approve all such prosecutions. There are not so many that it is an undue burden and I believe that it is beneficial to the proper control by government in its very broadest sense. I draw the distinction between government and the prosecuting authorities, because the Government do not prosecute; it is the independent prosecuting authorities who prosecute. However, it is important that somebody answerable in this House or the other place should have ultimate responsibility for that and should carry it out in as good a manner as humanly possible. Under the Bill, any Crown prosecutor could bring a case. Much more supervision is needed than that. It is not just any Crown prosecutor; it is prosecutors for local authorities and the other major prosecuting authorities.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09120947000152"></a>Your Lordships' Select Committee on the Constitution made a number of points about the security services under Clause 12. Those points have already been extremely well made by other noble Lords, so I will not repeat them, but this is something that has to be looked at with great care. In my opinion, there must be a law officer or a Minister who is answerable to Parliament.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09120947000153"></a>Finally, we need to tackle the problem of debarment under EU law of any business convicted of bribery or of failing to prevent bribery from ever again competing for an international contract. The United States has been praised, to a great extent rightly, for leading the way in 1977 with its Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, but it has since put together a pretty elaborate scheme of pre-contract clearance. Germany, too, has put in quite an elaborate system: if someone looks like being convicted, you then put the case into suspended animation and in a sense put them on probation so that they do not get a conviction and are not prevented-so long as they behave themselves in the future-from continuing to compete. It is important that there should be a level playing field if we are to carry the confidence of the business community. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord West, accepted that point when I made it in my speech on the Loyal Address. I hope that the Government will be able to say more about it in the course of our proceedings.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09120947000154"></a>I well understand the Government's desire to pass this Bill. I shall do everything that I can constructively to help and, I hope, improve it without delaying it. But a flawed Bill could do more harm than good. I wish it well and look forward to playing a part in the future.</p>

In consequence, I come to the Bill now before us with some knowledge of the past legislation and the current proposals.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09120947000157"></a>I say to the Minister at the outset that I support this Bill. The Government have done well to tackle the need for better legislation to deal with bribery and I hope that we can complete the examination of the Bill before the general election. In the past decade, since the United Kingdom signed the OECD anti-bribery convention at the end of 1997, there have been a number of reviews of the United Kingdom's bribery legislation, including two Law Commission reviews, as well as the draft anti-corruption Bill in 2003, which was not taken forward. Now we are on much firmer ground and I hope that we can achieve this better legislation.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09120947000158"></a>As this is Second Reading, I shall make some broad comments on the Bill. It is a major Bill and a clean-sweep Bill: it sweeps away entirely the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889 and the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1906 and 1916 and replaces the common law offences. Clean-sweep Bills are quite rare-we do not have many of them-but I like them. In this case it was a wise decision to go the way the Government have gone. In place of these Acts, the Bill introduces two general offences: the offence of bribing another person and the offence of being bribed. It abandons the existing agent principal system and establishes a model based on an intention to induce improper conduct. We have to ask ourselves whether this is a better system. I say, unhesitatingly, yes. The existing agent principal basis has given rise to various difficulties in establishing how it applies in particular cases; the system now proposed is direct and more appropriate to the investigation and prosecution of this crime.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09120947000159"></a>Although most attention has been on cases or allegations about large defence contracts abroad, it is important to stress-this has not been mentioned much so far-that the Bill applies fully to home-grown bribery in the United Kingdom as well; its application goes right across the board. That is important. It also responds directly to the criticism of the United Kingdom, notably in relation to the OECD convention, and it should be beneficial to our international standing.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09120947000160"></a>In deciding what is expected of a person performing a function or activity, the test is what a reasonable person in the UK would expect. In a situation abroad, where United Kingdom laws do not apply, local practice and custom are not to be taken into account-this is an important point-unless that is required by the written law of the country in question. The net effect of this change is much stricter than the current arrangements.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09120947000161"></a>The Bill creates two new offences. First, it creates the separate offence of bribing a foreign public official. This is closely in line with the OECD convention, on which the definitions draw. It has a wide coverage. However, it is realistic to recognise that there may be  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1105"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cases where a person seeking a bribe is not, strictly speaking, a public official; he might be, for example, an influential member of a political party in the country in question. There are difficulties. None the less, the clause as it stands is certainly justified.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09120947000162"></a>Secondly, Clause 7 creates an offence of failure to prevent bribery, which can be committed only by relevant commercial organisations. Companies or partnerships must obviously examine their organisations to ensure that they do not risk breaching this new clause. I expect the first reaction of companies and partnerships to the arrival of the Bill will be to look at their organisation.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09120947000163"></a>The Bill has an extra-territorial application. In general, I do not like extra-territorial application but bribery is perhaps one of the clearest examples of potential offences that cross the territorial divide. Actions abroad are caught by the Bill if the person performing them is a British national, a person who is ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, a UK incorporated body or a Scottish partnership.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09120947000164"></a>Finally, I have two points that are not in the Bill but which have been discussed already to some degree. First, there is the question of guidance on the Bill. I welcome the Government's acceptance, in their reply to the Joint Committee, that guidance on the Bill should be available to commercial organisations. We may discuss this point and the timing more fully in Committee, but I note that the Government propose to follow the model of the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 and are to publish guidance before the new bribery offences come into force. I quote the reply to the Joint Committee and I note that whatever we say in this House always has an influence. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, did not say,</p>
<ul><a name="09120947000203"></a>"before the new bribery offences come into force",</ul>
<p><a name="09120947000165"></a>but,</p>
<ul><a name="09120947000204"></a>"well before the new bribery offences come into force".</ul>
<p><a name="09120947000166"></a>We are always making progress as we go along.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09120947000167"></a>Secondly, I agree with the strict conclusion of the Joint Committee and with the Government that so-called facilitation payments should continue to be criminalised. However, like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, I have a certain sensitivity about the difficulties of this point. In this respect and in respect of corporate hospitality, it is important that the Crown Prosecution Service should respect very formally the principle of proportionality. This is important generally, but it is also important because the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of the USA, although it is in many ways an excellent Act, none the less exempts from the bribery prohibition,</p>
<ul><a name="09120947000205"></a>"facilitating payments for routine governmental action".</ul>
<p><a name="09120947000168"></a>This, it is explained in a note from the US Department of Justice, would include such action as payment of bribes for loading and unloading cargo and similar activities. So it is a serious point. At the working level for companies that are perhaps not of vast size but have some external trade or contract, these sorts of payments are important; such companies need to be clear that they will be treated fairly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09120947000169"></a>It is unusual to have a Second Reading debate that approximates to a love fest-I am sure that the Minister will take that on board-but this is a very good Bill and I repeat my view that, subject to the comments that I have made and what is going to be examined in Committee, including Clause 12, the Bill deserves to go on to the statute book.</p>

So many noble Lords have welcomed it that the last speaker referred to our debate as "a love-fest". I am not sure it is quite that, bearing in mind the number of detailed criticisms that have been made, but this is certainly a more soundly based attempt than earlier ones to create a comprehensive, effective law of bribery. It owes a great deal to the work of the Law Commission, especially its 2008 report with the rather odd title <I>Reforming Bribery</I>. I think I know what they meant; it was just that the semantics was slightly odd. The Government are to be congratulated on implementing a major Law Commission report. The Bill will assist in the battle against bribery in all part of our commercial and public life. I see it as significant for international trade, where bribery and corruption, if they exist, pollute the very basis of trust and integrity which must underpin healthy, mutually beneficial trading relationships. An expansion of world trade is, of course, highly beneficial to the people of the world, but that must be based on the real value of goods and services, not on backhanders that distort true competition. Clearly, if bribery in global dealings is to be adequately combated, improvements and greater clarity in our law need to be complemented by equally strong measures taken by our trading partners. Hence the importance, as other speakers have indicated, of according with the OECD convention and other conventions against bribery across the world.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09120947000171"></a>This Bill is concerned solely with criminal law, but perhaps I might mention something that I think other speakers have not so far referred to. I hope that Ministers can confirm that the civil law in this country can continue to have its uses in combating and acting as a deterrent to bribery. For example, if there is a contracting party whose agent has been given a bribe to induce him to place the contract with the bribe's donor, the contracting party may sue to recover the bribe and, more importantly, can rescind and remove the effectiveness of the contract. The civil law, usefully, applies irrespective of any proof of corruption.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09120947000172"></a>I believe that the Law Commission was right to concentrate its attention on the value of criminal law in combating bribery. It was also right not only to propose two general offences-which have been described and might be summarised as active and passive bribery-but to propose the new, discrete offence of bribing a foreign official. The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, indicated that there may be problems with the phrase "foreign official", especially if that is defined too narrowly, because in many countries key people who have tremendous influence may not hold an official post that is registered in the local equivalent of <I>Whitaker's Almanac</I>, but are none the less influential. The public increasingly resent any possibility of senior company officers trying to hide behind the corporate veil and  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1107"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1107</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>avoid individual responsibility. I am therefore glad that the Government have accepted the Law Commission's proposal to follow Section 12 of the Fraud Act 2006 by imposing individual criminal liability on any senior company officer-and that does not mean just directors-who can be said to have consented to or connived at the commission of either of those two general offences in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09120947000173"></a>More controversially, Clauses 7 and 8 create a new criminal offence where a commercial organisation fails to prevent the offence of active bribery committed by someone performing services on its behalf. Parliament is generally more cautious about making a sin of omission a criminal offence, and rightly so, but-as others have pointed out-the organisation will have a defence if it has in place "adequate procedures" to prevent persons down the line associated with the organisation from engaging in bribery. There will be a need for a useful discussion in Committee on the guidance that the Government have said they will offer-and whether unofficial, non-statutory guidance to commercial organisations to assist business is sufficient.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09120947000174"></a>Your Lordships will recall that the Law Commission devoted some 20 pages of its report to justifying this new criminal offence, and it claimed support from the earlier report entitled <I>Business Ethics, Global Companies and the Defence Industry</I> proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, who spoke earlier in this debate.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09120947000175"></a>The noble and learned Lord's recommendation 9 involves the introduction of a proactive supervisory role at board level over decisions made further down the line that carry risks of unethical behaviour. The noble and learned Lord said that company boards must forbid so-called "facilitation payments". The use of criminal law is justified by the need to deter companies from giving any support to a culture of bribe-taking. The statements of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, have been given added impetus by the Law Commission report and now by this Bill.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09120947000176"></a>There is only one other matter that I want to mention because it has been referred to by a number of speakers. I was, as I usually am, impressed by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. It was a speech of principle. He was concerned with the rule of law. He was concerned that Clause 12 adumbrates a number of defences that would seem to contravene the rule of law and, perhaps even more important as a practical point, that the Government have not really showed chapter and verse what the occasions are when bribes would have been helpful and would have been useful under some sort of public interest rubric.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09120947000177"></a>I was also interested in the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Patten-not at the moment in his place-in which he referred to examples where a bribe is made to an informer for information and some terrible disaster occurs if that bribe is not given. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, thought that there was something in that-he will correct me if I am wrong-because he indicated that we do not really need these defences so long as the person whose consent is required for prosecution, such as the Attorney-General, is able and entitled, in the public interest, not to go ahead where the public interest suggests that that would be a bad thing to do.</p>

Thank you for those. As the chairman of the committee, I ought to say thank you to some other people as well, starting with my colleagues. We had two excellent clerks. We had the two professors, who were our expert advisers. We had a first-class back-up team. Where would we have been without the oral and written witnesses, who provided the raw material for what we said? I add to that today's contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Patten-which was backed up by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf-about the way in which corporate ethos ought to be applied to this sort of thing. There was more detail than I have heard before and I would have hoped that it was very useful for the Government. Perhaps this is an occasion when pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee has proved itself to be a valuable matter.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09120947000180"></a>There have been some comments, particularly by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell-who unfortunately is not in his place-about complexity. Most speakers have not complained about the complexity of the criminal offences that have been, or will be, created by the Bill. I remind the House what happened under the previous law. Professor Horder set it out on page two of the evidence book, stating:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="09120947000195"></a>"We started with a law governed by a very vague term, the notion of 'corruptly', and the courts themselves could not agree what that meant in law. There are decisions saying it involves dishonesty, there are other decisions saying that does not involve honesty".</p>

<p><a name="09120947000193"></a>If that is not complex and confusing, I do not know what is. I would have thought it was better to depart from that sort of approach and look at what we have in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09120947000181"></a>It is important to have concepts that a jury will easily be able to understand and apply, and it all leads up to that. A jury will have to consider improper performance, and the judge will have to direct them on what that means because there is quite a lot about it in the Bill. The jury will have to look at the question of the good faith of the person providing the funds, and at the expectation point that is set out in one of the clauses.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09120947000182"></a>Complexity could be said to arise from the cases that are listed. Those cases are only examples that the prosecutors will have before them. They will choose one or possibly two of them; they will collect the evidence and decide whether to prosecute and, if so, under what case. They will then draft an indictment with the particulars-in Scotland this would be done by the Procurator Fiscal-and present the case to the jury. On the basis of the facts thus presented, the jury will have comparatively simple decisions to take, and that must be a huge advantage in a matter of this sort. I agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, that one does not want complexity, but that is not written into the Bill at all.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09120947000183"></a>We welcome the Government's response to the Select Committee's report. I am glad that they have dropped the question of parliamentary privilege; the Bill was  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1109"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1109</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not a good vehicle for that, and it requires more general consideration. I am glad that they have clarified the non-role of the Attorney-General and the handing over of the decisions to the directors of the other prosecuting authorities, which is in their response.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09120947000184"></a>I also mention something that I do not think anyone else has: we now include Scotland. After all, the complaint by the OECD related to the United Kingdom. The original project was only in relation to England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the Select Committee pressed the Government to see if they could not include Scotland as part of the United Kingdom. This has been done, and I am sure the necessary drafting has been correctly put in.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09120947000185"></a>Then there is the question of Clause 12. I will say no more about that because it is obvious that Committee stage will be much occupied by that point.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09120947000186"></a>I also welcome what has been said about guidance. The way in which companies are going to comply with this legislation is not necessarily going to be immediately obvious to them, and guidance will be very helpful, even if it not in a statutory form. It must, however, be produced before the offences come into force. That is what the Government have promised, and I am sure that they will do what they say.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09120947000187"></a>The Bill needs to be passed, and I applaud the Government for putting it into the programme for this short Session of Parliament. We have been under criticism from the OECD for a long time for not including anything, including the foreign public officials offence. We now have it for the whole of the UK. Another matter that the Government might like to apply their minds to is whether it can be extended to the Crown dependencies and the Overseas Territories, because they are also under our jurisdiction to this extent and should occupy the attention of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09120947000188"></a>It seems that the Government have covered most of the problems raised by the Select Committee, except for Clause 12. I would suggest to your Lordships that the criminal offences have been very carefully drafted and are workable, and I hope that the House will give this Bill the fair wind that everybody seems to have offered it this afternoon.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09120956000003"></a>I was very interested in what my noble friend Lord Patten, who is not here, had to say about the possibility of the police informer being bribed. I could easily be wrong here, but it seems to me that paying somebody to turn Queen's evidence is not paying him to do something improper but to do something proper. I therefore suggest that the Bill does not cover this. If  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1110"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that is true, it is unnecessary for anybody who has authority in law enforcement or trading standards to have the power to bribe in the United Kingdom. That must be wrong.</p>

<a name="91209-0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09120956000004"></a>To continue on the issue of trading standards, we have had a continual creeping abuse of power under the Terrorism Act, RIPA and SOCA powers. For example, a person was arrested for taking photographs of St Paul's Cathedral, and I believe the noble Lord, Lord West, was even stopped under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act.</p>

<p><a name="09120956000094"></a>Those people should not be given the power to bribe. To me, it is as simple as that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09120956000007"></a>I turn to the Army and the secret services. It is perfectly reasonable that the secret services should allow James Bond to bribe the head of SMERSH. Under those circumstances, the head of SMERSH would be acting improperly according to his own lights, but we would want very much to know about it. However, such action should be taken only with proper prior authority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09120956000008"></a>There is the saying that you cannot buy an Afghan, you can only rent him. The other day it was noticed that the Italians, using traditions that go back deep into the inter-city state politics of the 12th century, bribed the Taliban to keep quiet all around them, and the area was peaceful. I do not know whether that is right or wrong, but it may be possible to argue that such behaviour should be allowed as a public interest duty. It was noticeable that after they forgot to tell the French that they had been bribing, 10 or 11 French people were killed, which was serious. We should not hamper the Armed Forces or the dirty work of espionage agents by not allowing them, with high-level prior consent, to behave in that way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09120956000011"></a>Many of the points that I might have made on this important Bill have already been made by noble Lords. I hope that brevity will not seem superficial. I cannot refrain from making at the outset of my brief remarks  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1111"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a disgruntled complaint about the rushed pace at which we were obliged to work. Even the Government called it a very challenging timetable. They can say that again, although I hope that they will never have to.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09120956000012"></a>The whole point of a joint scrutiny committee is frustrated if it is not given a reasonable time for its work. I think that the Government acknowledge that we should have been given a minimum of 12 weeks. We were given 10. In consequence, some aspects of our work, notably with oral witnesses, had to be inappropriately curtailed. This was a pity, because the great merit of the Bill and its proclaimed purpose is that it provides for a new scheme of consolidated bribery offences, to cover bribery here and abroad, in place of the hotchpotch of legislation-referred to already-going back at least 120 years. The Minister said that it went back to Magna Carta. This is a long-called-for undertaking which is well worth taking time over to be sure that we get it right.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09120956000013"></a>The definition of bribery in the early clauses of the Bill might have yielded some of its undoubted complexity had we had more time to explore the matter. I am afraid that I continue to find it a real candidate for a cold towel around the head, and I do not envy those who will have to explain it to a jury or, in the case of legal advisers to corporations, to companies. They may well be hard pressed to explain the Act with the confidence required of them by their employers. For my part, at any rate, I shall await with a good deal of concern progressive news of how the definition works out.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09120956000014"></a>It would, however be graceless not to match that disgruntled complaint, and perhaps to exceed it in importance, by congratulating the Government on abandoning the old requirement of a principal-and-agent relationship and, instead, adopting a conduct test. Time will tell whether hingeing that test upon the concept of improper performance of a relevant function or activity will prove more serviceable than relying on the simple-or at any rate, single-adverb "corruptly". I note the evidence cited by the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, on the varying ways in which courts have treated that. It was obviously an important point.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09120956000015"></a>I am also pleased that for the specific offence of bribing a foreign official the Government have provided that the conduct in question will amount to bribery when the official is neither requested nor required by the applicable written law to be influenced by the offer, promise or giving of an advantage. In other words, it has to be by written law for the conduct not to amount to bribery; evidence of established but unwritten custom or whatever will not suffice to exclude it from bribery. We went into this with witnesses with some care because it is such an important matter-in the commercial context, in particular. We elicited from them that this would be an appropriate and practical formulation and I am grateful that the Government have adopted it in this amended Bill.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09120956000016"></a>Thank goodness, too, that in the new offence targeting companies which fail to prevent bribery by persons acting on their behalf, the Bill no longer focuses on whether a "responsible person" was negligent rather than on the collective failure of the company to have in place adequate anti-bribery procedures. I am grateful for the assurance that we will have guidance in that  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1112"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regard, and I agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, that it does not matter too much whether the guidance is statutory or otherwise. Keeping the concept of negligence would have introduced some quite superfluous complexity when, as I have already suggested, complexity is not exactly in short supply in this Bill, and I am very glad that the Government now agree.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09120956000017"></a>We have heard a great deal about Clause 12 and I do not need to repeat it, save to say that I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, made an absolutely devastating criticism of the decision to keep it. I think that that is right and I listened with much sympathy to the speech of my noble friend Lord Patten. However, I think that we were right to recommend that the clause be removed from the Bill on the basis of the evidence that had been given. It is worth reminding the House briefly of what is said at paragraph 202 of our report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09120956000105"></a>"Transparency International UK told us that any decision to pursue these proposals should be taken through a more appropriate piece of legislation".</p>

<p><a name="09120956000095"></a>I warmly agree with that. Transparency International said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09120956000106"></a>"While we welcome the Government's openness in acknowledging that bribery may be used by the security services, we have the gravest doubts as to whether any worthwhile long-term national interest is served. If the security services can make a case for such an 'opt-out', they should present it for appropriate parliamentary scrutiny; and it should form no part of any general law of bribery".</p>

<p><a name="09120956000096"></a>I suggest that it is very hard to argue against that. We said at paragraph 203:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09120956000107"></a>"We heard no persuasive evidence of a need for the domestic intelligence agencies to be granted an authorisation to bribe. Neither are we persuaded that this draft Bill is the appropriate vehicle to extend the security services' powers to contravene the criminal law".</p>

<p><a name="09120956000097"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, made a very telling point when he said that if it can be shown that it is in the public interest for such a course to be taken, that militates conclusively against a prosecution being authorised. That is another good reason why the Attorney-General should retain the jurisdiction that she has at present.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09120956000018"></a>Lastly, and not only as a member of the well-known ex-Attorneys club, I was very pleased to read in the Government's response to our report, at paragraph 25, that they do not now intend to bring forward any legislation relating to the Attorney-General. As my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell of Markyate said today, parliamentary accountability demands that the Attorney-General's constitutional role remains in place.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09120956000019"></a>We have waited long enough for an acceptable anti-bribery Bill to meet both our domestic and our international requirements. My strong feeling overall is that this offering deserves our warm support and that we should now get on with seeking to make it even better.</p>

It lurks at the very foundation of every community and society in the world to some extent.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09120956000021"></a>The consideration given in the past 14 years to this matter has certainly been comprehensive and rigorous. Indeed, one could start earlier than that with the Salmon commission of 1976, which dealt with the matter, but the real genesis was the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life, in its report of 1995. From that point onwards, there has been an irony. One can identify 12 different stages from White Papers, reports, committee examinations-including the sterling work done by the committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Colville of Culross and the work, already referred to, carried out by the noble Viscount, Lord Slim. Therefore, one has the sense of legislative soil that is well harrowed, but somehow, the Bill ended up-if I may mix my metaphors-in a rather vulgar sprint, with more rush than would have been anticipated.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09120956000022"></a>Be that as it may, I am quite sure that the Bill is a progressive development and one to be greatly welcomed. I am sure that the Government were entirely correct in centring on the concept of proper or improper behaviour. Once one has the proper heart, core and kernel, the rest of the Bill falls into place. That is very much as happened with the Theft Bill 40 years ago, when the concept of appropriation suddenly took over from all the difficulties there had been with the previous Larceny Acts. Nearly everything else then fell into place. It may not be all that simple. The point has been made that the definition of impropriety may be embarrassingly wide in relation to certain prosecutions.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09120956000023"></a>I wonder whether the Government have thought carefully about including, in addition to the question of impropriety, the test of dishonesty. Dishonesty is well understood by juries; it was defined very clearly by the Court of Appeal in Ghosh 25 or 27 years ago. The House will remember the two tests. First, the jury has to decide the objective test: is the conduct that has been proven against the defendant such that, according to an objective view, one would regard as dishonest? That is test one. If the prosecution overcomes that hurdle, there is the second test, which is seeing through the eyes of the defendant. Did the defendant appreciate that it was dishonest-not according to his base ideas of honesty, but according again to the standards of ordinary, decent people?</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09120956000024"></a>In other words, that is a totally objective test and a subjective test according to objective standards. That may sound complicated, but I do not think that it is. Judges and juries have been able to cope with that very well. Would we lose anything if we had such a test to clarify the meaning of that rather wide term "impropriety" in relation to the main structures of the Bill? I suggest not.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09120956000025"></a>There may be another reason for introducing a reference to dishonesty. The Explanatory Memorandum states that it is not anticipated that there will be a very considerable increase in the number of prosecutions, nor indeed that there will be any greater pressure on prison places. One may ask rather tartly: if you are developing a new mouse trap, what is the point if it does not catch mice? But that is not the point of this

It set forward this fact: between 1997 and 2003 the average number of prosecutions each year for this offence was 21. That is a very low figure, especially considered side by side with the average number of prosecutions for the offence of fraud in the same years, which was of the order of 23,000. Nobody would for a moment suggest that only 21 cases of bribery and corruption occurred in the United Kingdom during that period. Nobody would suggest that it was as low a figure as 210 or indeed 2,100.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09120956000027"></a>Offences of bribery and corruption, as every Member of the House appreciates, are very different from burglary offences; you know when those have happened. With rape offences, you will know when some of those have happened, as complainants all too often will not go to the police, although when they do the offences are recorded. The same applies with robbery and so many other offences. Bribery and corruption is not like that. There is often no conscious victim. There is often no overt evidence at all that anybody can track down.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09120956000028"></a>This is where we come to Clause 12. I have the utmost respect for the submissions made by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, in this matter. The defences deal with two main areas. One is entrapment, which is not the nicest way of going about a prosecution, nor something that juries like and appreciate. Nevertheless, in some circumstances it is the only way that the root of evil can ever be got at. In many cases the actual payment of money by authorities will be necessary, not because it is right to do so, but because all the other alternatives are worse.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09120956000029"></a>On that basis, we must have one of two things. Either one should have Clause 12, with all the checks and reservations, including the discretion of the Attorney-General and everything else, considered in this matter. Or we might consider including the test of dishonesty in relation to these situations. If you have the test of dishonesty, it may not be necessary to have Clause 12.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09120956000030"></a>The most pertinent remark was made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell of Markyate, when he said that it is not the law that is the problem, it is getting at these situations and exposing them. Unless there is a commitment by the community to invest money and human resources in order to smell out and root out these situations, then the main problem will remain with us.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09120956000031"></a>I would like to apologise to the House: in the Grand Committee, there is a matter involving the Welsh language, a subject very close to my heart. I would be grateful if the House would forgive me if I leave now-meaning no any discourtesy to anybody who is going to speak-for a matter which I hope will be dealt with shortly. It is not a complete defence, but I hope it will be a substantial mitigation.</p>

I join in the tributes that have already been paid to the chairmanship of the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross, who curbed a number of us-I put myself foremost among the offenders-from asking too many questions and conducted those proceedings admirably.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09120956000033"></a>This is a good Bill. It revises ancient legislation that is completely out of date and that does not cope with the present circumstances. I found the G8 St Petersburg summit communiqué of 16 July 2006 a very good statement of the current problems. That communiqué said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09120956000108"></a>"Large-scale corruption by individuals who hold senior executive, judicial, and legislative positions can have a devastating effect on democracy, the rule of law, and economic and social development. We recognize",</p>

<p><a name="09120956000098"></a>said the Governments concerned at the G8,</p>
<ul><a name="09120956000118"></a>"that corrupt practices contribute to the spread of organised crime and terrorism, undermine public trust in government, and destabilize economies. Corruption by holders of public office can deter foreign investment, stifle economic growth and sustainable development, and undermine legal and judicial systems. The net effect of corruption is felt most directly, and disproportionately, by the poor".</ul>
<p><a name="09120956000034"></a>That is a concise statement of the problem as it applies worldwide.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09120956000035"></a>My late noble friend Air Marshal Lord Garden, whose departure I much regret, was an adviser to Transparency International on the prevention of corruption in the official arms trade. On 14 December 2006, he said to this House:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09120956000109"></a>"The United Kingdom has a slightly iffy reputation on the use of money to facilitate defence contracts. I should have thought that it was in the national interest to clarify that. If-and I say if-commissions are paid in a corrupt way, it makes for an inefficient defence industry, so we pay more at home for our defence equipment, and it undermines Governments overseas, so we reduce our security".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/12/06; col. 1716.]</p>

<p><a name="09120956000036"></a>That is a very wise insight into the problems of the defence industry in this country.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09120956000037"></a>In introducing the Bill, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said that he disagreed with the suggestion that the existing law is fully compliant with international obligations. I take issue with him on that. Transparency International has pointed out problems but the OECD working group on bribery also has been active. It has, going back five years, made four demands of this country that we should revise our law. Whereas the signatories to that convention number 36, 35 had complied years ago, but we had not updated our law. The working group said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09120956000110"></a>"In light of the numerous issues of serious concern, the Working Group has requested the UK to provide quarterly written reports on legislative progress".</p>

<p><a name="09120956000099"></a>Furthermore, it said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09120956000111"></a>"Current UK legislation makes it very difficult for prosecutors to bring an effective case against a company for alleged bribery offences".</p>

<p><a name="09120956000100"></a>That was in its report in 2008. So your Lordships will appreciate that there is a problem which is recognised internationally and that this Bill addresses that problem.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09120956000038"></a>Perhaps I may first refer to the definition of bribery. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, said that what is meant by bribery is difficult to define exactly,  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1116"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1116</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and that is true. It depends very much on the facts and on the context in which gifts are given or awards made. I learnt my lesson very early on, as a pupil, when my pupil master successfully defended a local licensee on something to do with bottles-I cannot remember exactly, it was very small beer. But we succeeded and the licensee sent us both a crate of whisky, which was far in excess of the actual subject matter of the charge. My pupil master, who happens to be the brother of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, said, "One bottle I might accept, but a crate?". He sent the whole lot back and I learnt a very good lesson. However, I did not follow it entirely because once, in Hong Kong, I was provided at the end of a successful case with a silver plate. It was silver-plated actually, but it had on it an inscription in Chinese which said something about silver tongue or something. It was actually the name of a "Perry Mason"-type television programme, but they put it on this plate. I took it home and hung it on the wall very proudly until a Chinese visitor said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09120956000112"></a>"That is very, very nice and commendable Martin, but you have hung it upside down".</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09120956000039"></a>It is difficult to define bribery exactly. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell of Markyate, said that this Bill is too complicated; that "improper" means a large number of things. Well so it does. However, it is only in the court that the facts and the context can be investigated and it is only then that one can determine what label one should apply to what has happened.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09120956000040"></a>What should always be remembered by your Lordships is that the prosecution rarely has to prove every ingredient in an offence. There is an issue in a case. Sometimes there are two issues, but generally speaking there is only one. Under current procedures a defence statement requires the defence to define the issue and then an agreed set of admissions will cover many of the facts which the prosecution would otherwise have to prove. That is modern criminal procedure.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09120956000041"></a>Clauses 1 to 5 can be reduced to a couple of simple propositions. First, was an advantage given or received-that might be the issue in the case. Was it to induce a reward or reward a person for the improper performance of a function? Secondly, is that function caught by the act? Is it a function that should be performed in good faith, impartially or in performance of a trust? That is really Clauses 1 to 5. One can pick out the particular ingredient a case is about, define it and simplify it for the jury. Although the wording of these clauses is quite complicated, in fact the case as presented in court will undoubtedly be refined to a very large degree.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09120956000042"></a>A number of issues have been discussed. I refer, first, to the question of guidance. On pages 46 and 47 of volume one of its report, the committee refers to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 1977 in the United States which provides that a rebuttable presumption will arise that acting in accordance with advice will mean that no offence has been committed. The Attorney General of the United States is required to provide an advisory service so that a company that is wondering whether a set of proposals could amount to bribery can go along to the Attorney General's office and get advice.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1117"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1117</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91209-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09120956000043"></a>In Hong Kong, the Independent Commission Against Corruption has brought Hong Kong to the standing of third of the least corrupt countries in the world by its rigorous stamping out of corruption. It has a Corruption Prevention Department which created an Advisory Services Group in 1986 which has advised more than 3,000 private companies. The committee points out, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, mentioned, that there was not time to carry out a further inquiry to explore the ICAC in any detail. It is a body that I have personal connection with over a number of years. Something like an advisory service would be a very good thing for British industry. Indeed, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, pointed out that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09120956000113"></a>"The Department of Trade and Industry could give guidance. It would not be conclusive but it would be authoritative".</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09120956000044"></a>It so happens that this morning I decided to look at what sort of advisory service is provided by the trade and industry department. It does indeed have one, so I filled in a query form asking how to avoid bribery in a particular overseas country, and sent it off. I understand that it takes around seven days for a reply, and I shall inform your Lordships in due course if a response ever comes.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09120956000045"></a>The tax advisory teams of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs provide advice to companies and individuals on whether what they are doing is legal so that they can act accordingly. I was heartened, as was the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, by the reference of the noble Lord, Lord Patten, to strong ethical corporate structures as being the real key to preventing corruption, but I cannot quite go along with him when he says that no guidance will help in the long term and that you cannot rest on something written on a scrap of paper that can be cast aside and forgotten. There is some truth in that, but a proper advisory service might be a good thing.</p>

<a name="91209-0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09120956000046"></a>I turn now to Clause 12. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, said that exemptions such as those outlined in the clause raise difficult and sensitive questions about the rule of law. That took me back to the statement made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, in December 2006 where, in talking about the stop put on the BAe investigation, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09120956000114"></a>"It has been necessary to balance the need to maintain the rule of law against the wider public interest".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/12/06; col. 1712.]</p>

<p><a name="09120956000101"></a>That is an interesting balance because I would have thought that the rule of law was the overriding public interest. However, what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, has said about that is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="09120956000115"></a>"If it is necessary in the public interest, a prosecution should not occur and agencies can inform the director accordingly".</p>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91209-0007.htm"/>



<p><a name="09120956000102"></a>To my mind, that is the way to go about it. If the security services have sensitive information and need to make a submission to, say, the director of the Serious Fraud Office, surely it is better that it is made at an early stage so that the relevant person, the Director of Public Prosecutions of whoever it may be can consider what is put before him and decide whether it is in the public interest that the prosecution should go forward. There is nothing unusual in that because the two-pronged test of the Director of Public Prosecutions  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1118"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1118</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is always this: is there evidence that makes it more likely than not that a prosecution will succeed, and is it in every case in the public interest that this prosecution should continue? How much better to leave it to prosecutorial discretion than to set out a provision that none of the other 35 countries which are signatories to the convention has. I am sure that it highlights the fact that our security services may go around bribing people, which is perhaps not a good thing. So surely it should not be in the Bill that defences of this sort can arise. We say that Clause 12 is quite unnecessary.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09120956000047"></a>It is right that the prosecutorial discretion will now rest with the directors of the various agencies such as the Serious Fraud Office, HMRC and the DPP. We do not agree that the Attorney-General should play any further part in an individual case. I know that the OECD does not control this country, but it has recommended in specific terms that we should ensure, in any amendment to our legislation, that the Attorney-General cannot give instructions to the director of the Serious Fraud Office about individual bribery cases. That is in no way binding upon us, but we should try to remove prosecutions from any political connection. I regard it as unhappy and unhelpful that the redefining of the role of the Attorney-General has been removed from the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill now in another place, but that is an argument for another time.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09120956000048"></a>I have made some criticisms of the Bill. However, I repeat that it is a good Bill and we on these Benches will do our utmost to ensure that it goes through expeditiously before this Parliament comes to an end.</p>

It is not, for once, one of those Christmas-tree Bills that we expect to come from that department, when this issue and that issue-all unrelated-are added together, leading to some rather confused debates on Second Reading and rather bad legislation at the end. It is not part of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, described in the Queen's Speech debate as a "torrent" of legislation. It is a single-issue Bill that deals with one discrete subject. The Ministry of Justice should perhaps make more use of Bills referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, as clean-sweep Bills. That is a good description of a Bill that deals with just one issue and removes other Acts from the statute book, possibly making the statute book better. The noble Lord and his department will find it easier to get their legislation, which will be better legislation, should they follow that line in future.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09120956000050"></a>However, no one could accuse the Government of having produced this legislation in haste. My noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew complained that 10 weeks was perhaps too short a time for the committee to have considered the Bill and that a little more time might have been necessary. It has taken more than a decade for the Government to come up with this Bill since it was first promised. It was the Minister's boss, now the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State, Jack Straw, who published a paper on consolidation and amendment of the Prevention of Corruption Acts in  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1119"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>June 1998 only weeks after becoming Home Secretary. Although the Law Commission published a draft Bill in March 1998, it was not until March 2003 that Ministers laid their draft Corruption Bill before Parliament.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09120956000051"></a>We then had the Joint Committee, which was chaired, as many noble Lords, including my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern, have said, by the late Lord Slynn. The committee, which was commissioned to examine the Bill, found that its approach to corruption was fundamentally flawed. The Bill was then withdrawn and the Law Commission was asked to draft a new Bill. It was not until March 2009-nearly 12 years after the Government first promised a unified corruption Act-that the draft Bribery Bill was published. That was then considered by the committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Colville of Culross. I join all Members who have spoken today in congratulating my noble friend on chairing that committee. I should say "the noble Lord", but I say "my noble friend" because many years ago I sat at his feet as his pupil, although I am not sure that much of his talent rubbed off on me.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09120956000052"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord on his committee's report and those other Members of the House, including the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Thomas of Gresford, my noble and learned friends Lord Lyell and Lord Mayhew, my noble friend Lord Onslow and the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, on their sterling work on that committee.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09120956000055"></a>As the Minister pointed out in his introduction, bribery has been illegal under United Kingdom domestic law for centuries and a process of ad hoc reform has led to a patchwork of offences under the common law, the Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act 1889, the Prevention of Corruption Act 1906 and the Prevention of Corruption Act 1916. There have been few developments in the law for more than 90 years, aside from the jurisdictions of these offences being extended in 2001 to include acts committed abroad by United Kingdom citizens and companies.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09120956000056"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for confirming that we are nevertheless compliant with our international obligations. I note that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, disagreed on that point. No doubt that is something that we can explore at a later stage.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09120956000057"></a>The Minister quoted the Law Commission, which recently described the law of bribery as,</p>
<ul><a name="09120956000119"></a>"riddled with uncertainty and in need of rationalisation".</ul>
<p><a name="09120956000103"></a>We all recognise that, when the Joint Committee was taking evidence in its scrutiny of the draft Bill, all witnesses supported the case for reform, reflecting calls that were first made by the Royal Commission on Standards in Public Life some 30 years ago. Particular criticisms of current law include the use of inconsistent terminology, the artificial divide between public and private sectors and the focus on whether or not an individual is acting as an agent on behalf of a principal, a concept which is both complex and leaves gaps in the law.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1120"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1120</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91209-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09120956000058"></a>I understand that few individuals have been prosecuted under the existing bribery legislation in recent years, as I am sure the Minister will be able to confirm in due course, although a number of allegations have been pursued as part of a fraud charge. No company has ever been convicted under the current law aside from Mabey and Johnson, which recently pleaded guilty to making corrupt payments after self-reporting them to the Serious Fraud Office. The fact that this does not reflect the scale of the problem represented by bribery may in part be attributed to the difficulties in gathering evidence in support of a prosecution, as my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell made clear.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09120956000059"></a>Briefly, although we are broadly satisfied with this Bill and feel that it is worthy of our support, we will look at the fine detail in Grand Committee, as the Minister and the House would no doubt expect us to do.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09120956000060"></a>We have concerns about how the Bill is framed and we will probe, for example how Clause 7 will work in practice. An offence of omission is being created for companies that do not prevent bribery. The defence is vague. We will probe what is meant by "adequate procedures". One of the core aims of this legislation must be that it is clear and unambiguous. We have heard representations from businesses that seek assurances that they are not going to be left in difficulties because of the change in the law. A great deal may hinge on what sort of guidance is put in place, rather than on the wording of the Bill, and we will certainly be looking at putting down amendments to elicit more information from the Government on this. I was therefore interested that so many noble Lords mentioned the need for guidance; the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, and others particularly stressed its importance. The noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross, stressed the importance of the timing of that guidance and of ensuring that it is in place before the Bill comes into force. That it is certainly something that we would want to look at in detail.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09120956000061"></a>We will also examine carefully, as my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern put it, the safeguards that are in place before a prosecution can be made. There are very differing views on what the role of the Attorney-General, as opposed to the three directors, should be; the view of the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Thomas of Gresford, was different from that of my noble and learned friends who are sitting behind me. No doubt, again, we can debate the matter in Grand Committee, where we shall want to look at it carefully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09120956000062"></a>The Minister, my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern and others referred to the report of your Lordships' Constitution Committee, chaired by my noble friend Lord Goodlad, which is highly critical of Clause 12. Virtually every noble Lord has mentioned Clause 12; I shall not repeat their names. The issues of whether there should be defences for the security services and law enforcement agencies, how wide they should be and whether they will need the consent of a Minister will take up a good deal of our time when we come to deal with them in Committee.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09120956000063"></a>A great many other issues will arise. The Minister referred to parliamentary privilege, although others said that that issue might be for another day and

A question arose about the facilitation of payments. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, referred to the problem relating to subsidiary companies and so on and my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell of Markyate referred to the complexity of Clauses 1 to 5 and whether we need to simplify them. We will explore all these matters carefully.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09120956000064"></a>Having said that, I think that this is a rare example of a Bill that is destined not to change much during its passage through the House. We will wish to examine its provisions thoroughly and we may have to make changes in that process, but, I repeat, we support the Bill and will do our utmost to ensure that it gets on to the statute book before the general election, whenever that might take place.</p>

I am not sure that I know enough to say whether I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, that this is a love fest-or to disagree with him in the way that my noble friend Lord Borrie chose to do-but it must come fairly close to it. I thank all noble Lords who have participated in the debate with a special emphasis and a special conviction. It is clear that the Bill attracts broad cross-party support and that all who have spoken believe that it will provide the robust law that our prosecuting authorities and courts require and will considerably enhance this country's standing in the international arena.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09120956000066"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, almost apologised not only for his cough-which I have, too-but for his grouse at the beginning of his speech; he said it was a minor grouse. However, it was a well-made point about the challenging, as we described it-he had another word for it-timetable that the Joint Committee had to face. Two points can be made about that: first, that it makes the conclusions of the Joint Committee even more impressive; and, secondly, that without the timetable it might not have proved possible to bring the Bill before the House and, it is to be hoped, into law during this truncated Session. The Joint Committee's work on the Bill is as good an advertisement for pre-legislative scrutiny as there has been so far. Once again, the Government thank the noble Viscount and his team for what they did.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09120956000067"></a>We have listened this afternoon to the many substantial points that have been made and I assure the House that we will consider them with care and do our best in Committee to answer them where we feel it right and to concede to them where we feel it right as well. Let me answer one or two of them this afternoon.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09120956000068"></a>The noble Viscount talked about Scotland. I agree that it is very good news that the Bill will extend to Scotland and I am pleased to say that we have reached agreement on this with the Scottish Government, subject, of course, to the Scottish Parliament publishing the necessary legislative consent Motion, usually named after my noble friend Lord Sewel. As with the Crown dependencies, it will be for them to update the law in the normal way. We are in regular discussions with  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1122"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1122</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them; I am the Minister at the Ministry of Justice with that portfolio and I will advise the House in due course on the progress being made with those discussions.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09120956000069"></a>Turning to the complexity of definitions, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, argued that the general bribery offences in Clauses 1 to 5 were too complex. It is true that, superficially, bribery may be regarded as a straightforward concept, but for the purposes of the criminal law, drafting an offence which is wide in scope at the same time as being readily understood and legally certain is a challenge. There has been other support, from the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, and other noble Lords including the noble Viscount himself, who argued for abandoning the inherently difficult and vague concepts of agent/principal and acting corruptly, found in the existing legislation, and adopting the offence as recommended by the Law Commission. The Law Commission consulted widely on this and possible alternatives and concluded that the improper conduct test was the best possible option and the Joint Committee endorsed that approach. We hope that we have adopted a careful balance between simplicity, certainty and effectiveness.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09120956000070"></a>On facilitation payments, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, and the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, questioned whether such facilitation payments would be caught by the offences in the Bill. It has also been suggested that criminalising facilitation payments could put UK businesses at a disadvantage compared to their US counterparts, given the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in the US. Facilitation payments are already caught by the offences contained in the current law and the Bill does not seek to change that position. We are adamant that our objective must be to address bribery in all its forms. We are not unaware of how the real world works, but we believe that tackling petty bribery in itself is a key element in changing the culture of corruption. In the UK, as at present, prosecution will depend on whether the evidential and public interest tests in the code for Crown prosecutors have been satisfied. That code does reflect the principle of proportionality-it may not be in the public interest to prosecute where payments are small; much will depend on the particular circumstances. However, those who continue the practice of making such payments have to be aware of the continuing risk of prosecution. Providing exemptions for facilitation payments, as the US does, is not a universally accepted practice. Such exemptions do create artificial distinctions that are difficult to enforce and have the potential to be abused. Indeed, the OECD, much mentioned in the debate, is today launching a recommendation on this very issue. It highlights the corrosive effect of small facilitation payments and recommends member countries undertake periodically to review their policies on small facilitation payments to combat the phenomenon and to encourage companies to prohibit their use. We do not apologise, then, for the tough stance that we are taking in the Bill, but we very much take the points that have been made in the debate.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09120956000071"></a>There is of course an issue around the position of the Attorney-General and her role in bribery prosecutions, and different views on that issue are seriously held around the House. I would point out that the prior consent of the appropriate authority before proceedings  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1123"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1123</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can commence is only required where it is essential to enable a consistent approach to be taken to decisions to prosecute. I remind the House that, in 2003, the Joint Committee found the consent of the Attorney-General was not required for these purposes. We think that a requirement of the consent of the director of the relevant prosecuting authority achieves the right balance on bribery, but I emphasise that that does not affect the superintending role of the Attorney-General over the main prosecuting authorities.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09120956000072"></a>I turn to Clause 7, and the issues around adequate procedures and guidance. A number of noble Lords discussed that issue, including the noble Lords, Lord Goodhart and Lord Williamson, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, and the noble Viscount, Lord Colville. That adequate procedures defence is designed to be flexible. It is not defined in the Bill, as specific procedures will depend on the size of the organisation, the relevant business sector and the degree to which the organisation is engaged in high-risk markets. The House will appreciate that what is appropriate in a large organisation to prevent bribery may not be appropriate in a smaller organisation, so the procedures should, we think, therefore be proportionate to the circumstances of the particular organisation.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09120956000073"></a>We intend to publish guidance that draws on the knowledge and expertise of stakeholders. We intend it to cover the Clause 7 offence, particularly the adequate procedures defence. However, the guidance will not set out detailed prescriptive standards; rather, we intend it to be indicative by setting out broad principles and illustrative good practice examples of adequate procedures. We also intend the guidance to be available well in advance-there, I have used that phrase again-of the implementation of new offences. The CBI, in its briefing to noble Lords, said that it welcomed the defence of having adequate procedures in place to prevent bribery, and broadly supported that approach. On what constitutes adequate procedures, it welcomed the fact that the Government have agreed that official or non-statutory guidance must be provided, containing broad principles and illustrative best practices. It said that it was also welcome that there appears to be recognition that different sectors operate in different contexts, and that such non-statutory guidance will be produced after the Bill has received Royal Assent but before the offences come into force. The Government are pleased that the Confederation of British Industry has that view of that issue.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09120956000074"></a>There has been a suggestion-the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, spoke on this-that a central advice facility, similar to that provided by the United States and Hong Kong, might be beneficial here. The Joint Committee obviously thought about that a lot, and heard evidence on it. It recognised that such an advisory service could be beneficial, but in the end noted that there might be difficulties in establishing such a service in this country, and was concerned about the impact on the independence of prosecutors in particular. We agree with it on that issue and do not think it appropriate for our criminal justice system.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09120956000075"></a>Having said all that, the director of the Serious Fraud Office has indicated that there would be occasions when his office would discuss points of general principle  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1124"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with companies, under what is described as its policy of engagement, including those on proposed mergers. However, he drew a clear line at providing a formal advisory service.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09120956000076"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, mentioned Article 45 of the EU procurement directive. He asked whether conviction for the Clause 7 offence would trigger mandatory exclusion from participation in a public contract under that article. The article provides that any candidate or tenderer who has been convicted of certain offences, including fraud and corruption,</p>
<ul><a name="09120956000120"></a>"shall be excluded from participation in a public contract",</ul>
<p><a name="09120956000104"></a>and a discretionary approach shall apply for all other offences. We believe that being convicted of a Clause 1 or a Clause 6 offence will trigger the mandatory exclusion, as those offences will fall within the ambit of the directive. It would be appropriate for mandatory exclusion to follow, given the complicity on the part of those who manage the organisation and company.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09120956000077"></a>I tell the House, and the noble and learned Lord in particular, that we are presently considering whether a conviction for the Clause 7 offence would fall within the ambit of the directive. In such cases, the culpable conduct on the part of the organisation is not bribery in itself but rather a failure to prevent bribery. I hope and expect to have a definitive answer to the noble and learned Lord's excellent question on this issue by the time we have reached Clause 7 in committee.</p>

<p><a name="st_96"></a>

It is one of the matters that we will have to consider in deciding what our attitude is towards an offence under Clause 7. However, it is an important point.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09120956000080"></a>I turn to the failure on the part of a commercial organisation to prevent bribery, joint ventures and syndication. The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, referred to this. He asked about the operation of the corporate offence in relation to the activities of a joint venture over which a company might not have real control. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, mentioned this point too.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09120956000081"></a>Clause 8(4) of the Bill makes clear that, whether a person or body was performing services on behalf of another,</p>
<ul><a name="09120956000121"></a>"is to be determined by reference to all the relevant circumstances".</ul>
<p><a name="09120956000082"></a>It is indeed possible for one person, or a number of people, to be deemed to be performing services on behalf of more than one company. That is sensible if the Bill is to be effective. It depends on the circumstances but it may be that a bribe by a person performing services for one company in a joint venture is rightly regarded as being paid in connection with the business of any of the companies involved in that venture.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09120956000083"></a>Our purpose is clear; we want to encourage organisations which are involved in joint ventures to ensure that they are satisfied that adequate procedures are built into the arrangements for their joint venture.  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1125"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I need to point out that, before an organisation can be held culpable under Clause 7, the prosecution has to prove that the bribe was paid with the intention that business, or an advantage in the conduct of business, be obtained or retained for that organisation. Where this connection cannot be made the organisation will not be guilty.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09120956000084"></a>I will say comparative little about Clause 12 tonight. I am delighted to see the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, in his place. I thank him and his committee again for their report. A number of issues arise around Clause 12. I was extremely grateful for the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Patten, at least as far as it concerned this particular clause. He is not absolutely alone. He has me for company at the present time, in defending Clause 12.</p>

<a name="91209-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09120956000085"></a>The first issue is whether Clause 12 is drafted too widely. My noble friend Lady Whitaker believes it is and many other noble Lords think it is too. She was kind enough to acknowledge that we had already come a long way in meeting the reservations of the Joint Committee.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91209-0008.htm"/>


<a name="91209-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09120956000086"></a>A similar point has been made by Transparency International. I remind the House that the defence would not cover conduct that would amount to bribery of a foreign public official. Our objective is to ensure that law enforcement agencies, the intelligence services and the Armed Forces can continue to undertake their important functions effectively. There will be occasions when conduct would amount to an offence under the Bill in order to secure intelligence critical to our national security or to ensure the safety of military, intelligence service or law enforcement personnel. It would not be appropriate to criminalise that conduct. However, any person wishing to rely on the defence would have to demonstrate that his or her conduct was necessary in any given case.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09120956000087"></a>I shall quote from what Transparency International said in its briefing to noble Lords on Clause 12; the noble Lord, Lord Patten, referred to part of this in making his point:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="09120956000116"></a>"The Government's earlier draft Bribery Bill provided for authorisation by the Secretary of State for bribery by UK security services. The JSC heard that the OECD Working Group on Bribery had never encountered any law anywhere that expressly authorised bribery. The JSC opposed the proposal on the ground that the Bribery Bill was not the appropriate vehicle to extend the security services' powers to contravene the criminal law. The Government has responded to the JSC's recommendations in two ways: (a) instead of giving a wide authorisation to the security services to pay bribes, there is now a more limited defence to prosecution; and (b) Section 12 identifies specific areas where benefit-giving might be considered to be for the public good: e.g. police transactions with informers, military actions in the course of armed conflict and security services. TI-UK would on balance prefer the Clause 12 to be omitted; but accepts that the Government has responded positively to the JSC's recommendations".</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09120956000088"></a>With regard to the accusation that the blanket defence is much broader than the authorisation scheme of the draft Bill, it is right that the authorisation scheme did not cover the Armed Forces or law enforcement agencies, but the authorisation scheme of the draft Bill allowed a much wider exemption to the provisions of the Bill because that scheme allowed for class authorisations that could provide cover for a  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1126"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>range of conduct by a range of people associated, for example, with one or a number of operations conducted by the security services, which could subsist for six months and could be renewed for another six months. In contrast to the authorisation scheme, anyone who bribes will be guilty of the offence unless that person can prove that the defence applies. The defence is case-specific and ensures that the necessity or otherwise of the conduct is tested by reference to the roles of individual people and the particular circumstances of individual cases.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09120956000089"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, among others, questioned more broadly whether the clause was needed at all; the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, certainly did so in his powerful speech. It is questioned whether the Clause 12 defence of the legitimate purposes of the state is necessary, and it has been suggested that it would be better simply to rely on prosecutorial discretion. Leaving aside broader issues of whether Clause 12 is too broadly set at the moment and includes too many people and too many groups, and dealing with the question of whether we need a Clause 12 at all, I begin to put the case now for the clause. Those who are afforded defence under the clause exercise significant functions on behalf of the public. It is indeed a sensitive area, as the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, reminded us. It is right that the law should afford those people who undertake important functions the reassurances of a defence at the outset if the effective discharge of their functions necessitates conduct that would otherwise amount to an offence.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09120956000090"></a>In conjunction with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, the provision, which gives a clear and transparent statement of the circumstances in which a person otherwise liable for bribery has a defence, would assist prosecutors in deciding whether a case should proceed. Transparent is an important word here. In the specific context at issue, we think our clearer and more transparent approach is more appropriate than allowing such decisions to be made with broad discretion alone. In other words, if the senior prosecutor on such a case decides to prosecute, the defendant should be able to run this defence in front of a jury.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09120956000091"></a>I note the well made criticism that no examples of where this might be material have been given to the Joint Committee or by me to the House today. It is an important point which I will take away to see whether it is possible to bring those examples to the notice of those in this House interested in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09120956000092"></a>Clearly, we will return to Clause 12 and other matters in the Bill. My noble friend Lord Borrie asked whether the civil law will still have a role in the fight against bribery. The answer is yes, it certainly will-the Bill does not affect the civil law.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09120956000093"></a>I hope I have dealt with some of the points that noble Lords have raised. Those points will come up in Committee. I thank the House again for its sympathetic reception of the Bill and look forward to debating further matters in Grand Committee after our Christmas break.</p>

American researchers and academics are conducting similar research into the dangers and benefits of the media in all its aspects: advertising and public relations, safety when using the internet-particularly for children accessing electronic media in their own bedrooms-and the desirability of trying to protect children from the dangers they may encounter and the influences which may impact upon their understanding of the world around them.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09120959000002"></a>In a relatively short speech, it is not possible to do justice to all this work, fascinating though much of it is. But the fact that it is being done at all reflects on the need to help and educate young people about the power of the media, for both good and ill, and their need to learn how to use that power.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09120959000003"></a>One major element in the media is advertising and other material in magazines directed particularly at women and girls. Members may know that my colleague in another place, Jo Swinson, recently launched a campaign to prevent magazines from artificially enhancing models' beauty by covering skin imperfections, flattening stomachs and extending legs. I love the thought of extending legs, don't you?</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09120959000004"></a>MPs who back the campaign want magazines to adopt a code of conduct that will ensure that all images which have been digitally enhanced are marked as such, and that enhanced images should be banned altogether in magazines directed at under-16s. This is not an unimportant matter. The statistics show a rise of 47 per cent in the number of under-18s admitted to hospital last year for treatment of anorexia or bulimia, and many research problems confirm the ill effects of these enhanced images on women and girls. The support given to the campaign by Equality Minister Harriet Harman is especially welcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09120959000005"></a>As part of the work done in connection with Jo Swinson's campaign, the Liberal Democrats asked a body of experts from around the world to provide information on the impact of idealised media images on how adults, adolescents and children think, feel and behave with respect to their body and appearance. I shall read out the nine sentences which sum up the findings. The paper confirms, first, that body image is highly significant for physical and mental health and thus well-being. Body dissatisfaction is a significant risk for mental health. Secondly, the weight of evidence documents the detrimental effect of idealised media images. Thirdly, these detrimental media effects start

Fourthly, some people seem particularly vulnerable. Fifthly, exposure to media images has long-term effects. Sixthly, alternative advertising images-for example, images of women of size 14, rather than the current mania for very thin models-are as effective in terms of selling products. Seventhly, people are neither fully aware of the influence of media images, nor of their artificiality. Eighthly, interventions that curb media influence protect and enhance well-being. Ninthly, policy debates are longstanding, but change is now happening in Europe and the USA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09120959000006"></a>In this context, an article in the <I>Guardian</I> quoted a number of organisations involved in manipulating images. The editor of <I>Vogue</I> magazine has commented on,</p>
<ul><a name="09120959000016"></a>"the removal of any 'flaw' so that a new kind of human perfection has been reached ... where women don't have wrinkles or eyebags and nobody has pores or veins or facial hair".</ul>
<p><a name="09120959000014"></a>Another authority, Stewart Price, from Digital Retouch says that he may,</p>
<ul><a name="09120959000017"></a>"remove a smile line here and there, make them look a little younger. You can thin out someone's neck or fix a blemish, whiten teeth, drop a few pounds-whatever is not aesthetically pleasing to our eye".</ul>
<p><a name="09120959000007"></a>But a former editor of <I>Marie Claire</I> concludes that this perfectionism is in the service of product sales, and adds that she thinks readers can appreciate a more honest approach.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09120959000008"></a>Whether that last comment is true, however, is open to doubt. A 2007 study by the University of Missouri showed that all sorts of women felt noticeably worse about themselves after only three minutes of viewing models in magazine photos. Research by the University of Sussex confirms the widespread discontent among young girls as to their body image. They generally want to be at least a size smaller at an age when most of the women who contribute to the work of this Chamber were probably not paying any attention to such matters.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09120959000009"></a>I want to consider another aspect of this subject, namely the potential dangers of early access to the electronic media on the part of children in their own homes. The Byron review, <I>Children and New Technology</I>, makes a particularly relevant contribution to the discussion of how to keep young people safe, while the Ofcom reports give us a good understanding of how parents and children organise viewing of different sorts of media, including TV, games, talking to others, and trying out different programme options.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09120959000010"></a>It is clear from Ofcom that children have a variety of experience of how their access is managed. Parents try to exert power and influence on their children's use of the internet, for example, but, as older children retreat to their own rooms, it may become more and more difficult for parents to keep up with their children's level of expertise in using the media available to them. The year-on-year comparisons of the Ofcom analyses show that in many households children are more expert than their parents in accessing what they want to see or with whom they wish to interact. A particular problem is that poorer families have less contact with electronic media and their children may be less well armed to defend themselves against more dangerous programmes and contacts. Have the Government been able to offer any assistance to parents in these circumstances,

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09120959000011"></a>The Byron review is more directly related to combating the dangers inherent in the easy availability of electronic media to inexperienced young people. Indeed, its author declares from the first the belief that,</p>
<ul><a name="09120959000018"></a>"crucial and central to this [safety] issue is a strong commitment to changing behaviour through a sustained information and education strategy. This should focus on raising the knowledge, skills and understanding around e-safety of children, parents and other responsible adults".</ul>
<p><a name="09120959000015"></a>The author goes on to say that, just as we know swimming baths to have some dangerous aspects but we teach our children to swim while avoiding such dangers, so we should do the same with respect to teaching e-safety to children and young people. The need is both for adults-teachers and parents-to acquire a good understanding of issues around e-safety and for them to ensure that children acquire the skills and online safety awareness that they need. A caveat reminds us that, although children may have better online skills than their parents, that does not protect them from risky situations. The more skilled they become, the more risky encounters they may have.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09120959000012"></a>The report's conclusions seem very sensible. It argues, first, that the "staying safe" element in <I>Every Child Matters</I> should include e-safety. Secondly, the author notes that nothing prevents schools integrating ICT and e-safety education as part of other subjects. Indeed, it seems that primary schools already seem to manage it in this way. Thirdly, the report concludes that there is no need for "wholesale changes" to the curriculum; e-safety and media literacy should be embedded in the existing curriculum. The fourth conclusion is that teachers and staff need training in the e-safety element in the curriculum. Finally, the report recommends that the Government should encourage teachers to focus on e-safety by identifying it as a national priority for the continuous professional development of teachers and the wider school workforce. Do the Government agree with those four very practical recommendations? If so, are they being put into action already?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09120959000013"></a>Few things are more important than the education of all children so that they can, as adults, play their full part in society-as parents, workers, volunteers, family members and citizens-in the broad sense of that term.

TV, advertising in all media, the internet, social networking and indeed print journalism, for as long as it lasts, are the context and condition of their lives from an early age. These are not merely media in which they live and move-as it were, the ecology of their lives-but forces scientifically and expertly targeting them.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09120962000003"></a>So children need to be equipped with skills for survival in this mediated existence. Ninety-nine per cent of children aged eight to 17, the Government tell us, now have access to the web and to the virtual world that it opens up. Eighteen per cent of children, we are told, have come across harmful or inappropriate content online. I do not know how "harmful" or "inappropriate" are defined for the purpose of this statistic. I suspect that the bullying and manipulation of the fashion industry, about which the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, spoke powerfully just now, are not taken into account here. At any rate, it is right that online safety is to be made a compulsory part of the curriculum from age five, and I welcome the green cross code.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09120962000004"></a>As children grow, they need a developing awareness of the nature of the media, which are omnipresent in their lives, and of the forces acting on them. They need to understand what powerful persuaders and propagandists are trying to do to them and what they themselves are trying to do in response as they adapt to mediated life. Otherwise, young people will be unable to become independent, self-aware, self-determining, responsible agents-which, I presume, we should be aiming for in education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09120962000005"></a>As politicians, we are apt to applaud the so-called creative economy and give thanks for its exceptionally rapid growth in Britain and its contribution to employment and exports. We do not think enough about its psychological and moral effects on those who are ill equipped educationally to deal with it. We may tut-tut about the tyranny of fashion and celebrity. Every now and again, we have a more acute spasm of anxiety about copycat conduct, as in the Jamie Bulger case, where there was evidence that the boys who murdered Jamie were re-enacting scenes from a video. We may be startled by reports about the latest computer game sensation. It may be "Modern Warfare 2", "Assassin's Creed 2" or "Left4Dead2", with more and more people playing at killing more and people more and more luridly. But we are liberal, we do not like to be prudish or spoilsports, and it may just be that some of us are not entirely up to date in our knowledge of some of that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09120962000006"></a>We can be sure that today's media are not activated by Reithian values-nor do I wish the media to be preachy or culturally authoritarian. I do want young people to be educated to have a critical capacity, to be discriminating. That is what I mean by media literacy. I notice that the term "media literacy" is commonly used in a technical, neutral sense: young people are to learn IT skills as they are to learn to read and write. Being able to work the gadgetry, to operate the technology, is only a preliminary. What then matter are questions of significance, of value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09120962000007"></a>The words "literacy", "criticism" and "discrimination" have shifted in common usage. Literacy once denoted not just the capacity to read but being relatively well

Criticism, in the sense of the term inherited from Matthew Arnold by IA Richards and FR Leavis, was a moral endeavour, a rigorous inquiry into authenticity, quality, how literary effect was achieved and what literary greatness meant. Discrimination was an educated capacity to recognise fine distinctions of literary and moral purpose, means and effect. Those terms are still used in those earlier senses in expert discussion and, indeed, in the national curriculum documents, but for most people today they have different and more neutral or negative connotations.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09120962000008"></a>I see an analogy between the history of the slow acceptance and development of English literature as an educational discipline and the slow progress of media studies in schools.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09120962000009"></a>A hundred years ago, the study of English literature struggled to secure a place in grammar school and university curricula. There was not yet a convincing methodology for teaching Eng Lit. Philology was grimly established, but literary critical technique was undeveloped and lacking in intellectual rigour-and was denounced as such-in some of the grander public schools until well into the second half of the 20th century. Our literary heritage was commandeered as propaganda to serve various ideologies and sentimentalities about patriotism and nationhood. An educated person was supposed somehow to absorb, pretty well without being taught, a knowledge of great drama, poetry and novels. Gradually, however, English became a serious, respectable discipline. When well taught, systematic and rigorous study of literature confers enhanced delight in literature as art, better understanding of how words can most tellingly be used, a more acute awareness of an author's intentions and a more developed capacity to understand human motive and to distinguish different kinds of moral conduct. All of that is an education for citizenship and democracy.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09120962000010"></a>Well conceived and practised study of the media will confer equivalent benefits. We should pay tribute to some of the pioneers of media education in this country: Cary Bazalgette, Colin MacCabe and Stuart Hall. Study of the media has certainly gained ground in the national curriculum in the work that has been developed in technology and the media, English and citizenship, but it is still at an early stage. It needs to enlarge the bridgehead. Given the ubiquity, aggression and power of the media and, to put it more positively, the immense intellectual and creative energies of film, television and other media, media studies should surely be central to the school curriculum. We should see to it that critical study of the media fortifies and enriches every young person in their capacity for an independent, capable and confident engagement with the world around them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09120962000012"></a>I want to talk about one particular aspect of children and the media. This concerns child internet safety. My Private Member's Bill on age verification passed through all its stages in your Lordships' House earlier this year.  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1132"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I hope that the Government will support the principles of that Bill, which basically seeks to protect children from internet dangers by insisting that systems are in place to determine whether people buying over the internet meet the minimum age. Young people can, and in test cases have, easily purchased pornography, alcohol, knives and so on through the internet.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09120962000013"></a>The question today is about trying to ensure that pupils in school have a better understanding of the influence of the media. I suggest that this is a difficult task. Young people like the media in all their forms. I am delighted that personal, social and health education is to be a statutory subject of the curriculum. PSHE should encourage informed decision-making about a whole range of issues, including drugs and alcohol, sexuality, diet and how the media might be used sensibly. Teaching resistance to pressure and assertiveness are part of that process. I believe that resistance to media pressure may be very difficult. Young people naturally take risks and risk-taking is exciting; the media often encourage risk-taking to an unacceptable level.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09120962000014"></a>I suggest that the law has a part to play in protecting children as well as the imperative to help them to protect themselves through example and education. I also believe that there is a place for public education campaigns to alert parents and families about the dangers of some media influence. The purchase of online goods and services by underage children is one such example.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09120962000015"></a>The media, including the internet, can entertain, inform and instruct, but they must act responsibly, particularly with regard to children. Parents and schools cannot do it all. Use of the internet has increased dramatically. In 1999, only 9 per cent of the UK population could access the internet from home. Between 2000 and 2004, this percentage increased by 126.5 per cent. Fifty-eight per cent of us use the internet. Close to 90 per cent of teenagers have a personal TV, as do 60 per cent of five and six year-olds.</p>

<a name="91209-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09120962000016"></a>The problem with the massive use of the internet is that children are vulnerable to being exploited. Professor Tanya Byron, who was mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, spelled out the many challenges relating to children and their use of the internet in her report last year. The Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety launched its <I>Digital Manifesto</I> earlier this year. Its recommendations include blocking access to all known child abuse websites, protection from access to age-restricted goods and services, and data protection. It calls for a review of progress on the take-up and use of child safety software in the consumer market and incentives for firms to develop new technical measures designed to help to protect children and young people online.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09120962000017"></a>In the Gambling Act, Parliament made it compulsory for all online gambling sites to devise methods of determining the age of everyone who came on to the sites. Such provisions came into force in 2007 and seem to be working well. Specialist companies carry out verifications. Online retailers of age-restricted goods and services should have effective systems in place to prevent underage sales. The law does not sanction underage sales but the law is being manipulated. Companies should be providing online and effective ID checks in order to screen underage people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09120962000018"></a>It is easily possible for children who are under age to purchase from the internet. A 14 year-old boy was recently, in a test case, able to buy a prepaid card with cash at a local store. Card retailers say that their cards can be sold only to people who are aged over 18, but the boy was not questioned about his age. He bought pornographic videos from Amazon and knives from Tesco; they were delivered to his home and personally signed for. Oddbins delivered some vodka to his home and he was able to bet on a football match online. In the light of such temptation and excitement, I wonder how influential the school curriculum might have been, or might be. No, the law needs to step in.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09120962000019"></a>I saw recently in the press that Microsoft and Tesco were joining forces to start marketing and selling videos and films over the internet. Apparently they are going to be sold as downloadable items. We will no doubt see more of this kind of thing happening. Any product that is capable of being digitalised will be digitalised and will be sold online. TV programmes, advertisements and games are already available. Perhaps I may remind Tesco and Microsoft, as other companies have been reminded before, that many of these items are the subject of legally prescribed age limits. If companies cannot satisfy themselves that they can sell these items legally over the internet, then, frankly, they should not be selling them at all.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09120962000020"></a>I mentioned the gambling industry. Under the Gambling Act 2005, having a robust online age verification system in place became a condition of obtaining a licence to provide gambling services online. Perhaps we should have the same condition for all services online-that is, any company that wishes to sell age-restricted goods online should obtain a licence, which would confirm that they had taken all reasonable steps to ensure that the law was not being broken. That is precisely what my Private Member's Bill sought to do. I still hope that the Government will adopt the principles of my Bill and ensure that it becomes enshrined in legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09120962000021"></a>Children need protection from age-restricted online sales. They also need education about the media.

There is always a danger when preparing for such debates that you will go back to nurse-to the way it was done before. When I heard that this debate was about the influence of the media, I immediately thought about the old argument, which was only a small part of my noble friend's argument, about acceptable ways of presenting information on the body to children and how it will influence them. The reason I thought that is probably down to an extremely good joke-which I think I heard on "The News Quiz", though I am not quite sure who the comic was-at the expense of one Karl Lagerfeld, who apparently said that size 0 models are attractive and sell more. As the comic pointed out, Karl Lagerfeld might not be the best person to say

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09120962000023"></a>What are you trying to do with the image? What will your body be used for? I always approach such questions from the sportsman's angle and the fact that there is no "perfect male body". However, there are perfect male bodies for doing various types of sports and functions. Females, who are in the ascendant in number here, will probably have their own idea of the most pleasant body to look at. However, the perfect body to be a middle-distance runner is not the same as the perfect body to be a front rower in a rugby scrum, a basketball player or a gymnast. Reports talk about the model's image, but it is actually the marketing man's idea. This is where the enhancements that my noble friend talked about come in.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09120962000024"></a>Size 14 is the normal female shape. The sportsman side of me says and the sports fascist says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="09120962000052"></a>"Get out there and get running and all become size 12".</p>

<p><a name="09120962000049"></a>Is that realistic? What is the balance between encouraging somebody to be healthier and to achieve something that is realistic? We must look at how we are going to achieve it. Greater education in the true sense of the phrase is probably a very strong aspect of it. Examining how we get into this argument is another example. There is aesthetics and there is use of your body. Do we actually promote the marketing of physical activity? That is a very old argument which I have gone back to far too often in this House. It was described to me once that exercise is the wonder drug for the National Health Service. How are we going to encourage people to take exercise that suits their body, that they will enjoy, that they will be successful at: exercise that not only suits their physical characteristics but also their mental ones? A huge education pack comes into this field.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09120962000025"></a>If you regard your body merely as something to be displayed or as an ideal that should be displayed, you cut out far more people from looking at it. There will be one image. The fashion industry takes most of the pounding here but it may not be the only example. How do we approach this? How do we get the education within the system? At school, it may be a case of intervening early enough to tell people that their bodies will all be different shapes and sizes. There is no perfect shape-you cannot be everything.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09120962000026"></a>The male of the species gets a slightly easier deal here. As I understand it from some of the briefing I received, the model male effectively is the tall, thin person with the wide shoulders who does certain exercises and has muscles that stick out. The ideal is basically a smaller version of the heavy pumped up bodybuilder. You have to tell people that bodybuilders get this way only by stripping all the fluid out of their bodies. They can maintain this only for short periods of time to keep the muscle mass going and then they can display it only for a short time. They have stripped so much fluid out of their systems that they probably could not run a mile without dying-I have probably overstated the case. Still there is a price to pay.</p>

Just wailing and protesting that it should not happen is not going to work. How do I know that? We have been doing that for a long time. I do not know when I first heard that all models were too thin and how unhealthy it was, but it has got to be at least 20 years ago. I am sure it goes back further than that.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09120962000028"></a>We have to try to get a new approach. Merely protesting about it will not work. The noble Baroness, Lady Massey, made a good point about new media and other images. It was a good attempt and a good approach to try to handle it. Also inherent in the argument is that there is only so much control we can bring in without being overly restrictive. We are always on this and the noble Baroness is taking her turn at balancing on a knife edge. You can slip either way. I applaud her courage totally and dread following it. What we have to do is try to get this balance right. The idea of educating to see there are right and wrong ways of doing things is important. However, we must not overplay it.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09120962000029"></a>Are the video games referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, a worse example of what happens with violence than the black and white films of my childhood? Then if you were shot with a high calibre handgun you put your hand to your chest and went "oh they got me" and died without a murmur. What is a worse image of violence? What is a worse image of what it is about-the Sam Peckinpah blood and guts splashed everywhere or that? What encourages the use of violence as not having a downside? I do not think it is a discussion we have often enough. So if we take on the images and look at what is going on, we will probably be in a better state.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09120962000030"></a>The current government campaign showing what knives actually do to people is good, as are the adverts shown later at night when we do not expect school pupils to be watching television. They show what happens if you get absolutely drunk on 14 pre-mixed cocktails and end up falling about on the way home. We have probably all seen the one showing the young girl. That is probably a better way of educating people and addressing the issues than just saying it is dreadful. We must address the world we are in.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09120962000031"></a>We must also remember that when talking about the young, the impression given for as long as I can remember is that society is going to come to an end because the young are so appalling. I can recall the reaction to people with long hair, then people with short spiky hair, then people with floppy hair and very different clothes. They were all going to destroy society. They all had a go and they all failed. We may not like all the different bits of society, but they have always been there, and whether they are bigger or smaller is a matter for debate. I suggest that what is required is an ongoing process because there is no right answer, merely a right answer for the moment.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09120962000032"></a>I return to the subject I started with. I have a couple of photographs of size zero models with me that I will not show because they would not appear in the record. They reflect what I call "concentration camp chic". If such a look is encouraged in the system, it has an effect on young girls, who are one of the most vulnerable groups. They need to be helped to get away from these impossible images that may even have been airbrushed

Trying to reveal it might be a way forward. Let us try to show the price that has to be paid for a certain look.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09120962000033"></a>Even a professional athlete becomes a figure of health only because he eats five meals a day, sleeps more than we would, trains harder and for longer, and has no social life for 10 to 15 years because he does not go out at night. We should let people know that there is always a price to pay. The rewards may justify that kind of life and we may applaud it, but often it is a place that only a few can reach.</p>

As I was listening to the noble Lord, Lord Addington, about size zero models, I was reminded of an article in the <I>Guardian</I> just before the last election. It said: "Sandy Verma, Tory poster girl". I thought to myself, "Wow, what a wonderful tribute". While the article horrified my children, it gave hope to every 40-plus, size 16-plus, 5 foot 3 inch-or-under woman in Great Britain. That is the point, I think, that the noble Lord was trying to make. However, I shall go back to my script now that I have got that off my chest.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09120962000035"></a>It is undeniable that, rightly or wrongly and be it positive or negative, the media leave a lasting impression on our children and young people. With emerging media forms such as social networking, user-generated content, online communities and social worlds, online gaming and peer-to-peer file-sharing, new challenges and questions are posed. Half of these even I still do not understand, but not for a second should we underestimate the power and potential of these media for impressing both good and negative effects on our children and young people, as positive attitudes towards social integration, learning and education, cultural experience and identity formation are many of the skills that have been lost through the fracturing of our communities. It can be argued that through using the media actively, children and young people can be educated to recognise the potential risks and benefits in a safer environment.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09120962000036"></a>However, concerns about the harmful effects of the media on children and young people are rarely absent from the headlines. The dangers from the internet are linked to sexual exposure, video games linked to violence, and magazines linked to emotional insecurities and illnesses such as anorexia in teenagers. These are but a few of the associated themes. It is vital that parents and schools both play their part in helping children to understand and utilise the positive benefits that can be achieved, yet ensuring that they hold firmly the levers of control in their hands so that where young people are not able to decipher the message through whatever medium they are exposed to in order to know what we think is acceptable, an adult can step in and take responsibility.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09120962000037"></a>Yesterday, the Prime Minister announced his plans on internet safety becoming a compulsory part of the curriculum from next year for those over five. I should like a little more clarity on that announcement. First, what form will the plan take? Will it be a separate  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1137"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lesson or part of another lesson? Who will teach it and be responsible for creating the guidelines? Will existing teachers deliver these lessons and how will the information be passed on to parents, who will undoubtedly need to reinforce the importance of internet safety at home? How much does the Minister estimate the cost of the programme to be? How will we monitor its success or failure?</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09120962000038"></a>While internet safety is important, will the Government recognise that the seriousness of other forms of media and their influence on young people is equally important? What plans do the Government have to take action to address the problems identified by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, in magazines, for example? We wish to ensure that parents are at the forefront of these campaigns. It is first and foremost their duty to ensure that what their children and young people access is age-appropriate and provides positive information to make the right choices. It is crucial that along with schools, they are part of the solution and not just bystanders on government initiatives.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09120962000039"></a>Although I support wholeheartedly efforts to improve our children and young people's safety, especially from the harmful effects of the media, I believe that this may not be the method to achieve such aims. Much thought needs to go into how action will manifest itself into reality. Our schools are already overstretched, often understaffed, and subject to ever-increasing demands. While we on these Benches appreciate the reasoning behind the teaching of media safety in schools, and the influences of the media on our children, surely the main focus of schools should be teaching core academic subjects and giving children the ability to develop critical thought processes so that they can decipher what is right and wrong through whatever exposure to media they receive.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09120962000040"></a>We believe that giving more powers to schools, giving heads control over their budgets, with a less prescriptive national curriculum and freedom regarding who they employ, would allow them to do more to educate children about the influence of the media in the contextual needs of those individual schools. Given that many schools are still unable to reach the core skills required by the curriculum, we do not wish to distract them by handing them even more Whitehall diktats and directions. I look forward to the Minister's response because these questions are incredibly important, not just to us in the Chamber but to parents who will be listening to the debate carefully.</p>

As others have said, I will not be able to do justice to all the points raised, or to those which should be responded to, in the time available, but I will write to noble Lords on those that I miss out.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09120962000042"></a>I shall endeavour to provide a good overview of what work the Government are doing in response to these kinds of questions. We all agree that the media  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1138"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are everywhere in our lives-particularly in the lives of young people who have access, which no one could have dreamt of 10 years or even five years ago. The percentage of young people with access to the internet is rising sky high The explosion of new media has taken many of us by surprise, and like many noble Lords, I find it hard to imagine what it is like being a young person now living in a virtual world, as well as living in the real one.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09120962000043"></a>To make some general points, it does not do justice to this complex issue to have a polarised debate, which pits two extremes against each other. That is sometimes what happens on this subject outside the House. One view is to blame the media for the woes of society and casts children and young people as hapless victims while another argues that those same children and young people are sufficiently knowledgeable and media savvy to understand exactly how to respond to the wave of information and messages they encounter daily. It is not that simplistic. As ever, your Lordships' House is cognisant of that.</p>

<p><a name="09120962000050"></a>This does seem to me to be overly simplistic. There can be no doubt that access to the wide range of media now available can be hugely beneficial to our children, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, said. It offers children important opportunities, for example in terms of entertainment, learning, creativity, cultural experiences and social networking. I very much agree with my noble friend Lord Howarth on this. There are great opportunities, but at the same time we need to recognise the risks, as my noble friend Lady Massey set out and as the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, said in her opening speech.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09120962000044"></a>For example, new research that is to be published tomorrow, and already referred to, shows that 18 per cent of children said that their parents do not know what they do on the internet. This is an important issue. That is why the Prime Minister, who takes this very seriously, yesterday launched "Click Clever Click Safe", the UK's first internet safety strategy which sets out what we are collectively doing to keep children safe online. We believe this is the first strategy of its kind produced anywhere in the world, and it follows on, as noble Lords are aware, from the Byron review and the very comprehensive analysis that Tanya Byron there made.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09120962000045"></a>The noble Baronesses, Lady Thomas and Lady Verma, and of course my noble friend Lady Massey, asked about the Byron review and the Government's response. As I have said, "Click Clever Click Safe" was launched yesterday by the Prime Minister, but this came about because of the establishment of the UK Council for Child Internet Safety in response to Tanya Byron. This brings together government, industry and charities to take a comprehensive and partnership approach. Over 140 organisations and individuals have come together to help develop this strategy. In response to Tanya Byron's report, the Government have launched a major public awareness campaign which will come over the next two years, based on new research into what support parents and children are looking for. This is going to be a funding commitment of around £9 million to support the campaign on child safety, and includes a focus, as noble Lords will be pleased to hear, on issues like cyber-bullying.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1139"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column 1139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91209-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09120962000046"></a>Also in response to the Byron review, we have been working to give those who work with children, such as teachers, social-workers and childcare-workers, access to free, high-quality resources-for example, through the development of our Know IT All site for teaching materials, which is accessible through DCSF. These are very high quality free teaching materials that will be available specifically for secondary teachers from March 2010.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09120962000047"></a>Also, we have seen the launch of the Green Cross Code, "Zip it, Block it, Flag it". This has been developed with children and young people and of course builds on the work and expertise of CEOP. We hope that this will become, from a very early age, from primary school, as all-pervasive as "Stop, Look and Listen" was for the Green Cross Code when we were growing up.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09120962000048"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked how we will know if any of this makes any difference. She is right to do that because what we have done through the UK strategy is to put some very tough evaluation measures in there, and we will be asking parents and children whether a difference has been made.</p>

<p><a name="09120962000051"></a>We will also be publishing soon the report from Professor David Buckingham on the impact of the commercial world on children and young people's well-being, together with the Government's response. I cannot anticipate that report too much, but I will make sure that noble Lords have sight of it as soon as it is out.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09120964000001"></a>The first work we need to do is to support schools, as many noble Lords have said, and help them to enhance the media literacy of their pupils, to help them stay safe and enjoy the opportunities that both the old and new media have to offer. My noble friend Lord Howarth referred to media literacy extending beyond technical skills. He is right. I was interested in his comparison with the development of English literature. It can play an important role in helping children navigate their way through the media maze and to become critical evaluators of what is presented to them, not only in the media but otherwise in life, too. These life skills are important and we need to do much more work on that aspect of media literacy. It is core business for the education system.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09120964000002"></a>The second area in which we need to do more is where, notwithstanding the considerable social change in recent decades, the ecology of families is such that parents are also key participants in their children's engagement with the media-and so they should be. We want to look at how best to help parents to guide their children to help them deal with the commercial messages transmitted via the old and the new media. Where children and young people display risk-taking behaviour such as my noble friend Lady Massey described, it is all the more important that we empower parents to act positively in the face of the internet and new media so that they can help young people-particularly teenagers-as they take risks in the online world. We will say more about this in the Green Paper on families that we will publish next year.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09120964000003"></a>It is also important that the regulatory framework keeps pace with technical developments and the subsequent new media techniques that might be directed at children. Following public consultation on the guidelines for advertising through broadcast and non-broadcast media, the relevant codes are currently being revised.

This was a matter of great concern to my noble friend Lady Massey. We welcome the fact that the Internet Advisory Bureau has developed a set of good practice principles for online behavioural advertising which came into force in September 2009.</p>

<a name="91209-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09120964000004"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, raised the question of body image. The Channel 4 programme "How to Look Good Naked" has been running an online petition calling for a body image confidence lesson to be included in the school curriculum. Personal, social, health and economic education already includes provision of information on how to lead healthy lifestyles and offers opportunities for young people to develop confidence on these issues. However, the Government announced recently their intention, which was widely welcomed in the House, to make PSHE part of the statutory national curriculum. Provisions to this effect have been included in the Bill currently in the other place.</p>

<a name="91209-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="09120964000005"></a>In primary schools, children will learn about healthy lifestyles and how the body changes with the approach of puberty; in secondary schools they will start to learn about the physical and emotional changes that take place at this time. There is considerable flexibility for schools to determine how they present learning in areas such as this and guidance will be produced early in 2010 to support schools. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State will meet with the presenter of "How to Look Good Naked", Gok Wan, to discuss this question. I know he is looking forward to that meeting.</p>

<a name="91209-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="09120964000006"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, referred to airbrushing. I am aware that the post-production retouching of images in advertising is a common practice in order to show a product-or, in many cases, a woman, a real person-in the best light. This is an issue of great concern. If the Advertising Standards Agency finds that an advertiser has used airbrushing or image-enhancing techniques in a socially irresponsible and misleading manner, it can act. This is an extremely new area of concern and I am delighted that my right honourable friend Harriet Harman is supporting the campaign.</p>

<a name="91209-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09120964000007"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, talked about perfect male bodies and the diverse physiques that are required to excel in different sports. The noble Lord touched on a really important point, not just for boys but for girls too. Physical activity, sport and participation in sport, which we are promoting through campaigns such as Change4Life and the five-hour commitment for sport in schools, are essential. It is really important that we get girls participating in sport, because it is through developing physical confidence that we can help to give them better body confidence.</p>

<a name="91209-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09120964000008"></a>I am running out of time and it is so unfair, because there is so much more to say, but I will pick up on any additional points which I should have made. I was delighted with the story of our noble poster girl; it is a wonderful note on which to end. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, for making this debate possible and I apologise for not picking up on everything.</p>

The 2008 regulations were previously amended by the Immigration (Biometric Registration) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, which came into effect on 31 March 2009.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000005"></a>Since 25 November 2008, we have issued more than 120,000 identity cards to successful applicants. The scheme has enabled us to identify persons using false identities to apply for leave, which has led to 15 successful prosecutions. A further 14 cases are awaiting prosecution and several other applications are under investigation.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000006"></a>The identity cards are a more secure means of demonstrating a person's entitlement to work and live in the United Kingdom. As we crack down on immigration abuse and identity fraud, it is a high priority to issue identity cards to foreign nationals who are subject to immigration control. We therefore want to continue our rollout by adding tier 2 skilled workers extending their stay in the UK.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000007"></a>The regulations will enable the identity card for foreign nationals to be issued to those applying to extend their stay under tier 2 of the points-based system, which covers: people coming in to fill vacancies that have been advertised to resident workers, but when no residents were available to fill the vacancy, which includes those coming to fill shortage occupations; employees of multinational companies who are being transferred by an overseas employer to a skilled job in the UK-based branch of the organisation; elite sportspersons and coaches whose employment makes a significant contribution to the development of their sport at the highest level, such as Premier League footballers; and people coming to fill a vacancy as a minister of religion, missionary or member of religious order.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000008"></a>The regulations also reflect the change in the immigration category of "sole representative" to a "representative of an overseas business", which is intended to encourage inward investment to the UK by providing a means for overseas companies to transfer an employee to the UK in order to establish the UK branch or wholly owned subsidiary.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000009"></a>The regulations extend the definition of dependants to include unmarried and same-sex partners. They also make provision for dependants of foreign nationals to apply for a card when applying for leave as a dependant. Such dependants will be able to apply for a card either at the same time or subsequent to the person on whom they are dependent becoming a cardholder themselves.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000010"></a>I am pleased to have brought the regulations before the Committee today. They are an essential part of our strategy for combating irregular migration and the associated abuses arising from such activities. The regulations seek to combat those things and I hope that the Committee will support them.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000011"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09120954000119"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale; on every other occasion in Grand Committee, I have been accustomed to going third.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000012"></a>These Benches-noble Lords can see the support behind me-do not support the regulations. We do not support the national identity card scheme so it follows that we do not support the regulations. Phrases such as "the thin end of the wedge" have been used on a number of occasions. We have probably now moved a little closer to the middle of the wedge.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000013"></a>Since warning the Minister last night of only a couple of questions that I thought I might have on the regulations, thinking that most of the points would be rhetorical, I have come up with some more questions. I apologise that I have not warned him of them, but they are all perfectly obvious and I am sure that he is well briefed.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000014"></a>First, since the scheme is being rolled out as part of an incremental arrangement, what has been learned so far? How successful is the scheme in the Government's view? How is the success measured? The Minister has told us that 120,000 cards have been issued, that there have been 15 successful prosecutions and that 14 cases await prosecution. I assume that that means that they are awaiting trial and that all 29 refer to prosecutions  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC55"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC55</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>made possible by the cards. I do not know whether the Government are able to give us any comparison with the pre-card regime.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000015"></a>Also, who were the stakeholders with whom the regulations were discussed? What were their views? They are mentioned in paragraph 8.1 of the Explanatory Memorandum. If there was no formal consultation on the regulations, presumably there is no formal collation of the views but, in a scheme which is being rolled out, it is fundamental that the views of stakeholders are accumulated and made available in some manner.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000016"></a>I am aware that I have now probably been speaking for as long as the Minister. I apologise to the Grand Committee, because I intend to go on for a bit longer.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000017"></a>The Government have stated their reason for focusing on foreign nationals-the difficulties experienced by employers in deciding whether a foreign national is entitled to work. I am intrigued to know how much more rolling out will be required for there to be full coverage of foreign nationals. Until it is full, how much use is a partial scheme? I am intrigued to know that the regulations cover footballers and members of religious orders. To many citizens, those two would be much the same. Indeed, some football supporters regard themselves as missionaries for their sport and their teams. It is difficult not to think of foreign nationals as guinea pigs with relatively little public support. I do not mean groups that we have heard about-groups that are likely to abuse or breach the requirements. We know what happened when the Government tried to extend the scheme to airport workers; no doubt that is why they are sticking with foreign nationals. What assurances can the Minister give about fears of discrimination against some groups? Will this not adversely impact on members of black and minority-ethnic communities?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000018"></a>Foreign nationals get the card only if they are here legally and already have documentation to prove it. Most people in this country illegally have come over on visas and have overstayed. I make the point, which has been made before and which we will make again and again, that exit checks are needed, not ID cards. We need to catch criminals, not just identify them.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000019"></a>The appraisal annexed to the Explanatory Memorandum states that ID cards for foreign nationals will deter some illegal immigrants and will therefore reduce crime. What is that crime? Is it the crime of illegal immigration or is it suggested that illegal immigrants are disproportionately criminal in their tendencies?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000020"></a>On fee income from overseas students, it is stated that an element of the immigration fees paid by them is attributable to the card. Since most of the funding for their fees comes from overseas sources, the fee is counted as a benefit to the UK economy. I am not asking a question about this; I simply want to put on record that I find that comment slightly shocking. The annexe also states that the card will make life easier for the cardholder over time. I again make the point that only when there is a full rollout will we see the benefits.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC56"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC56</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000021"></a>There is great emphasis on the benefits to employers, who have to check whether potential employees are entitled to work. In the debate on this regulations yesterday in the Commons, the Minister, Meg Hillier, said that the scheme,</p>
<ul><a name="09120954000100"></a>"is going very well. We are beginning to get reading machines out there; we have a number".-[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Third Delegated Legislation Committee, 8/12/09; col. 7.]</ul>
<p><a name="09120954000093"></a>She said there were 12 reading machines in active use at border controls and that they would be rolled out more widely. She said that the 12 readers would be deployed across major ports from January. Apart from the fact that 12 machines seem very few if this scheme is to be comprehensive, even as regards this relatively small group, I do not understand how it can help employers until each employer has a reader or easy access to a reader. I assume they are very expensive.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000022"></a>Another benefit that the Government claim is that the scheme will help stamp out health tourism. Those who seek to extend their stay because they have come over for private medical treatment that has not finished will have practical difficulties in obtaining the card. The chances are that they will be too unwell to traipse off to do whatever is necessary to get that extension recorded.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000023"></a>We are also told in the Explanatory Memorandum that cards will make things easier for the groups concerned. I do not understand that. It is an overarching point. Perhaps the Minister will be able to answer it. I shall not ask him to justify the regulations on the grounds of fighting terrorism because I am convinced there is no answer. However, I shall ask, finally, whether he can cheer us up by telling us that no further order or rollout is proposed in the next six months.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000024"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09120954000120"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for explaining this statutory instrument with such thoroughness and brevity. I am afraid that, like the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I may have to take a little longer than he did.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000025"></a>The Government's experience in using ID cards for migrants in this country in increasing numbers and categories is surely not unconnected to their desire ultimately to see them carried by every citizen. As the Minister will know, we are against such use. The Minister will not be surprised that I, like the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, have a number of questions on these regulations.</p>
<h5><a name="09120954000107"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000026"></a>First, the Explanatory Memorandum to the regulations states that the extension of use of biometric immigration documents, or identity cards for foreign nationals-which is what they really are-will,</p>
<ul><a name="09120954000101"></a>"make it easier for these foreign nationals to demonstrate their entitlements to their sponsor and access other benefits. It will also make it easier for employers to confirm any entitlement to work as the card clearly sets out the holder's entitlements".</ul>
<p><a name="09120954000094"></a>However, have the Government not failed to prepare business and public services to be able to check these ID cards?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000027"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, mentioned that the Minister's colleague in another place had said that 12 identity card readers had been issued by the  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC57"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC57</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Government. I believe that this statement was first made shortly after the beginning of October. Be that as it may, can the Minister update the Committee on the number of readers that will be issued? Twelve, I agree, seems a very small number. To my knowledge, there is no timetable for the rollout of the readers. I should also appreciate knowing how many readers the Government believe are needed and where they will be sited. The noble Baroness mentioned ports and airports but, surely to goodness, for the scheme to work properly, they should be much more widely disseminated.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000028"></a>Does the Minister also accept that the inability of organisations to scan or read these biometric documents has already resulted in the creation of a black market in fake ID cards? The Explanatory Memorandum further states that employers will not be required to undertake any additional checks. Does that mean that employers will not have to check the ID cards of foreign nationals whom they already employ, and who will be required to apply? How can one possibly expect someone who employs, for example, a foreign cleaner to know whether their employee is domiciled legally in this country?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000029"></a>Secondly, part of the Government's justification for extending the categories of foreign nationals required to apply for identity cards is the need to,</p>
<ul><a name="09120954000102"></a>"phase out less secure documents".</ul>
<p><a name="09120954000095"></a>Which documents are classed as "less secure" by the Government? Why are biometric visas considered more secure, given that they are already being produced by the criminal fraternity?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000030"></a>Thirdly, the Explanatory Memorandum states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09120954000099"></a>"Once the National Identity Register is fully operational it is the Government's intention that the identity card for foreign nationals will be designated as a document under section 4 of the Identity Cards Act 2006, as soon as it is practical".</p>

<p><a name="09120954000096"></a>Is it therefore the Government's intention eventually to store the details of foreign nationals on the national identity register alongside those of British citizens? What would be the rationale for joining those data sets, if the Government intend so to do? Somewhat related to this, can the Minister confirm that further information will be added to the identity cards at a later date?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000031"></a>Finally, one of the Government's rationales for issuing identity cards to those granted further leave to stay in the United Kingdom under tier 2 of the points-based system is,</p>
<ul><a name="09120954000103"></a>"to enable UKBA to bring forward the rollout of identity cards to higher risk categories".</ul>
<p><a name="09120954000097"></a>Will all high-risk categories now be covered? If not, what are the remaining high-risk categories and when do the Government intend to roll out ID cards to them?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000032"></a>Does the Minister accept that foreign students remain a high-risk category, despite being covered by ID card legislation? How many foreign students in the UK have ID cards and is it compulsory for students applying from abroad to register for them in advance? Would it not be better for the Government to focus their efforts on tackling the gaps in the student visa regime rather than being distracted by attempts to roll out ID cards?</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC58"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC58</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000033"></a>I should probably know the answer to my next set of questions, but I am afraid that I do not. Are student visas time-limited? What happens at the end of their courses? Do students return to their country of origin and, if they want to work here, reapply for a visa or work permit from there, or can they do it from this country?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000034"></a>Despite what I have said, we on these Benches support biometric identification for foreign nationals in the form of biometric visas. Those details should be kept on the appropriate Home Office database, whether it is the asylum registration card or immigration casework database and so on, and not the national identity register. We shall not on this occasion oppose the regulations, but the Government should not be distracted or justify failing to address the many weaknesses in existing systems by putting in place an expensive measure from which I can see no prospect of stopping illegal immigration or terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000035"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09120954000121"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My Lords, I thank noble Lords for their contributions. I was indeed brief. I see no great point in going back over an ID card debate which has been resolved and is now in statute. I do not criticise at all the fact that other political parties have a different view about identity cards, which they have held consistently. On the broader point, which I accept, we are seeking to provide an incremental approach. Effective from the end of November, identity cards became available voluntarily-"voluntarily" is the important word-to those who live and work in Greater Manchester, and to airside workers at Manchester and London City airports. It is in that sense that the word "voluntary" becomes critical, except where we have a requirement on people, for reasons which these regulations seek to identify. A number of interesting points were made by the Liberal Democrat and Conservative spokespersons and I will try to deal with them in the order in which I took them on board.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000036"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, referred to health tourism and those people who are unable because of health conditions-or, indeed, anything else-to attend a public inquiry office or a post office to acquire the document. The answer is that those who are under medical treatment should apply for an extension of stay for that medical treatment. Mobile units can be deployed for applicants who are unable to attend a public inquiry office. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that those individuals would be denied their rights to apply and to be successful in acquiring the card that they need.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000037"></a>I was asked what, effectively, is the value of the card to the incoming tier 2 worker. The card provides a single document that confirms not just status but, importantly, entitlement to work, and access to public funds and local services where that applies. It combines quite a number of documents into one much simpler to understand document.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000038"></a>Discrimination concerns us all. In the summer, I covered the job of Meg Hillier while she was on maternity leave. She is the Minister responsible for identity cards at the Home Office. The truth is that we have been closely in concert with the Commissioner for Racial Equality to ensure that this scheme is fair. I believe that it is the reverse of discrimination. Someone  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC59"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC59</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who has this card would be able to avoid any suggestion of discrimination because it gives a clear identity and would protect those individuals. I will come to that when I deal with the other questions that have been put.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000039"></a>On stakeholder consultation, there has been extensive engagement with stakeholders, both those who are likely to require identity cards or volunteer to have them, and those who are likely to want to engage with identity cards in the business community. Key stakeholders include major employers, universities, the finance sector and business groups including the Federation of Small Businesses and the CBI. That consultation led to the card being positively received by applicants, employers and universities, but some concern was expressed that the requirement for skilled workers to apply for the card could inconvenience them. To address that, the UKBA has introduced additional enrolment centres and contracts for enrolment centres to be provided by the Post Office. There was a problem of people coming into one part of the country and being greatly inconvenienced by not being able to get to a convenient centre. We have now extended that facility to 17 Crown post offices, which will allow applicants to enrol at more convenient times-for example, at lunch times and on Saturday mornings. There is no requirement to have an appointment for such an enrolment, so it should be relatively easy.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000040"></a>Again on discrimination, this will apply only to those who are subject to immigration control. Those who are subject will have to apply for leave only if they wish to stay in the UK. If they are granted that leave, they will be issued with a resident's permit as proof of their immigration status. That comes in the form of a vignette sticker for foreign nations, which contains certain biometric information to satisfy requirements of EU regulations. Those regulations oblige the UK to issue residence permits in a biometric format to replace the existing non-biometric documents. Therefore, we believe this card will serve the purposes of applicants, employers, local government and local social services. Importantly, it has been well received and has helped to secure our borders. We have heard about the 29 people who are subject to legal process. This has led to prison sentences of four to 18 months being imposed. The measure has helped to capture escaped prisoners, including one connected with a firearms offence. What have we learnt to ensure that the system is customer-friendly? We have learnt that it must meet the needs of customers. That is why-as I have just mentioned-we have increased the system's capacity by extending it through post offices.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000041"></a>The quantified benefits are listed in the assessment but they are subject to complex rules. The calculations are complex and many of the quantified benefits are cross-cutting. We keep benefits under review and in future may be able to quantify further benefits in a wider national identity scheme as it is implemented, and as the opportunities for improving efficiency are identified. All sectors covered by the card will be recognised.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000042"></a>Card readers exercised the noble Baroness and the noble Lord. If you look at the long term-I am going back to the ID card debate, which I do not really want to get into-eventually we will have card readers rolled  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC60"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC60</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out in retail, finance and local authorities, not just at borders. I have been carrying a chip-and-PIN card in my wallet for a number of years. For at least half that time it was of no use whatever because there were no chip-and-PIN readers in retail establishments or banks. However, over time, when the value of the chip-and-PIN card-in this case, a credit card-became known, they became worth investing in on the part of retailers, finance companies or local authorities. When a lot of people were prepared to invest in the cards, the capital costs of investment fell. I believe that in the longer term that will also be the case when the identity card rolls out. I make that last point before I encourage the noble Lord to rise to his feet. I am not inviting a debate on the broader aspect; I am simply saying where I believe card readers are going in the longer term. He is absolutely right; in the short and medium term we have to provide card readers at borders. They are used at airports and ports. I am happy to send the noble Lord a list detailing that.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91209-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000043"></a>The relationship between the information on the identity card and that on the national identity register was raised by our Liberal Democrat colleagues during the passage of the borders Bill. Information about individuals who apply for identity cards will be recorded on the national identity register; that is a simple fact.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000044"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09120954000122"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> My Lords, before the noble Lord gets on to that point, he gave the example of chip-and-PIN cards, such as debit and credit cards, eventually being read in shops and banks. Does that mean that the readers for these biometric cards are expected to be provided by the private sector and by local authorities but not by central Government?</p>

<p><a name="09120954000045"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09120954000123"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> As part of that question, does the Minister accept that there is a fundamental difference here in that retailers wish to encourage purchasers to make purchases by making that process as convenient as possible for them? I do not think that is comparable to the ID card situation.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000046"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09120954000124"></a>Lord Brett:</b> I was responding to the broader question of the rollout of card readers. The noble Baroness is absolutely right; that is a responsibility of Government. That is why we are placing them at ports of entry and airports. In the broader and longer term-and I should probably have tried to avoid this debate by not commenting at all-when the value of chip and PIN was seen by the retail and finance industries they were prepared to invest. We believe that it will be similar with identity cards. In the experiments of the past and the rollout that we have now, there is an indication that, for example, an advantage that applies to a student population does not necessarily apply to someone of my venerable age. The ID card can be used in a nightclub or another establishment that requires people to carry their passports to prove their age at the moment. It can also be carried around all the countries of Europe and the EEA, without the requirement to have a passport. Those are not necessarily arguments for this debate-they may be for a broader area of debate-but we do not anticipate a further order on this issue or related issues in the next six months. I think that that will bring noble Lords some relief.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000047"></a>I turn to some of the other questions, although I am not sure that I will get them all. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has a tremendous appetite for questions that require detailed answers, which I am more than happy to respond to, although I am not sure that I can respond to them orally and do justice to their value. However, I can almost certainly provide a written response.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000048"></a>We do not believe that we see, so far at least, any black market in identity cards. There may be one in identity cards for other purposes, but the cards that are being produced are quite difficult to copy. There was a <I>Daily Mail</I> article a year ago-or in the summer, at least-that pretended that an identity card had been cloned, but it demonstrably did not clone the national identity card that is produced under these regulations. It took a blank card and put its own information on it. Although there is always a danger that technology, criminality and ingenuity go together to defeat us, at the moment we certainly do not believe that that is happening. Indeed, we think that we have designed a card that it would be extremely difficult to clone or forge.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000049"></a>A question was asked about discrimination, and I hope that we have dealt with that. The current vignette that is placed in the passport will be replaced by 2014, when it is assumed that 90 per cent of foreign nationals will have an identity card. That achievement will provide third-country nationals with a single document to confirm identity, status and entitlement to work and facilitate access to services. We believe that that is a reverse of discrimination and provides employers, universities and others that provide such services with a single document that can be accepted as identity and entitlement. At the moment there are numerous documents that can be produced as proof of identity and entitlement, but that causes confusion and a considerable burden in authenticating documentation and confirming identity and entitlement. We hope that what we are putting forward is a much simpler but non-discriminatory way of protecting our borders and the individuals concerned.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000050"></a>A number of other questions need to be answered, but we have taken a considerable time in a long day of statutory instruments. I wonder whether the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, in particular, would be content for me to respond in writing to the questions that he put, or whether any particular question burns into his heart and soul so badly that he cannot live without an answer given orally.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000051"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09120954000125"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> My Lords, if that is a reference to my amateur dramatic past, I think that we had better forget it. There is only one question from the list that I produced that the Minister has not answered to which I would be extremely grateful for an answer today, on the subject of students, given that we have a Starred Question on Tuesday on students, artists and that sort of thing.</p>

The problem referred to may indeed be part of the gestation for the Starred Question-that there is more difficulty around people who come to the United Kingdom for a short period with visas under the new regime. By including sport personalities and others, we seek to overcome that. I suspect that there will still be some problems for people with short-term requirements who come on short-term visas, but there has always been a problem in relation to people in the business sector who may have an engagement in London or Manchester at very short notice. We do not seek to do anything different; we certainly do not intend to make things more difficult for them. I suspect that the question has been raised on several occasions and that my Home Office colleagues are sympathetic to finding a solution to it. The regulations do not make life more difficult in any way; I hope that they would ease the situation somewhat. If that is an inadequate answer, I will ensure that I get another answer to the noble Lord in quick time-before the beginning of next week.</p>

I probably made a mistake in mentioning Tuesday's Question. Of course, the noble Baroness and I both asked questions about students in specific relation to the regulations, but if the noble Lord is happy to write I am sure that she, and certainly I, would be happy to receive his missive.</p>

I was asked whether visas for students were time-related. They are related to the course that they are on. A problem raised with us was about students having a course in medicine or what have you that went beyond the normal period of a university degree. That is one of the issues that has been taken care of.</p>

In an effort to further improve  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC63"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC63</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>international co-operation we seek to designate Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Israel, Montenegro, Serbia and Switzerland as participating countries for the purpose of various sections of that Act.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000056"></a>The designations that will be made under the order are required to enable the UK to ratify the second additional protocol to the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, and I discussed on Monday evening as part of the debate on an excellent report from one of your Lordships' Select Committees. The convention is an important instrument in the provision of mutual legal assistance between states and forms the treaty basis for a high proportion of both incoming and outgoing requests for criminal mutual legal assistance. The second additional protocol is aimed at strengthening mutual legal assistance among the parties to the convention and widening the scope of mutual legal assistance which is available. As I said, it is worth noting that the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Union made clear in its recent report on money-laundering and terrorist financing, which was the subject of an excellent debate on Monday, that it is keen that the UK move swiftly towards ratification of the second additional protocol. That is what we are taking forward in this order.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000057"></a>I shall read my brief slowly, because it confuses me when I read it quickly. To ratify the second additional protocol the UK needs, among other things, to be able to deal with requests for mutual legal assistance in accordance with Sections 31, 47 and 48 of, and paragraph 15 of Schedule 2 to, the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003, and to ensure that UK criminal process is served overseas in line with the provisions of Sections 4 and 4B of the same Act.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000058"></a>Under the scheme of the 2003 Act, for the UK to seek and provide mutual legal assistance to a country in accordance with these provisions, it is stated that it must fall within the definition of a "participating country" in Section 51(2)(b) of the 2003 Act.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000059"></a>A country falls to be regarded as a participating country under Section 51(2)(b) if it was a member state of the European Union on the date on which the relevant provision of the 2003 Act was commenced or if it has been designated as a participating country in an order made by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000060"></a>While most of the countries which are parties to the second additional protocol were member states of the EU on the date on which Sections 4, 4B, 31, 47 and 48 of, and paragraph 15 of Schedule 2 to, the 2003 Act were commenced, and therefore fall to be regarded as participating countries for the purpose of those provisions, some of the ratifying states were not. Accordingly, this order seeks to designate those states as participating countries for the purpose of those provisions.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000061"></a>The effect of the designations will be as follows. Designating the relevant states as participating countries for the purposes of Section 31 of, and paragraph 15 of Schedule 2 to, the 2003 Act will allow the UK to execute requests for witnesses in this country to give evidence in foreign proceedings by telephone and to ensure that where such evidence is given the process is  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC64"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC64</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>supervised by a court in the participating country. Designating the relevant states as participating countries for the purposes of Section 47 will allow the temporary transfer of UK prisoners to that participating country to assist with investigations into an offence that may or may not have been committed in the UK. Similarly, designation for the purpose of Section 48 will allow the temporary transfer of prisoners from a participating country to the United Kingdom to assist with investigations into an offence which was, or may have been, committed in that participating country.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000062"></a>Designation as participating countries for the purposes of Sections 4 and 4B of the 2003 Act will mean that service of process, written charges or requisitions from the UK to persons in participating countries must be by post, save where the person's correct address is unknown, where it has not been possible to serve the process by post, where there are good reasons for thinking that service by post will not be effective or where it is inappropriate. Switzerland is not designated here as it has already been designated as a participating country for the purpose of these sections at an earlier date.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000063"></a>The UK is committed to improving the provision of mutual legal assistance, which is a key tool in ensuring that cross-border crime can be combated and that justice is achieved for British victims of crime. Ratifying the second additional protocol will further these aims. This order, which will allow us to ratify the second additional protocol, will therefore be of great benefit to British victims of crime. I accordingly commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000064"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09120954000131"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b><b></b>My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for explaining this order, which designates a number of countries as participating countries for the purposes of the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003. This means that the number of arrangements for mutual legal assistance for criminal matters that the UK can have with other countries and vice versa is increased. That is good. As the Minister also said, this order covers the temporary transfer of prisoners to assist in investigations, allows a witness to provide evidence by telephone for use in proceedings in another participating country and states the procedure by which process must be served on an individual. The countries being designated today are members of the Council of Europe, and many of them are candidate countries for EU membership or are observer states, such as Israel. The Council of Europe has done much to harmonise legal standards between countries. Mutual legal assistance in criminal matters is no exception and is important.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000065"></a>As we agreed in Monday's debate on the EU committee's report, crime is increasingly cross-border. The problem is that differences between national procedures can mean that information gathered in one country cannot be used in another because the way that the information was obtained does not fit with the national procedural requirements. This was the rationale for the 1959 European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, which provides that a requesting state can ask another state to comply with some formalities or procedural requirements essential under the former's national legislation. However, the backdrop of our consideration of this order must be  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC65"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC65</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>how far we have confidence in the judicial and police systems of other countries that will be parties to the reciprocal agreements. Can the Minister therefore say how the adherence of participating countries to agreements on mutual legal assistance, including standards of treatment in criminal matters, is monitored and ensured?</p>
<h5><a name="09120954000110"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000066"></a>This is particularly important in the context of Chapter 5. I am dealing with this a little more broadly than the Minister did with his specific references to sections of and schedules to the Act. These provisions deal with the transfer of UK prisoners to a participating country to assist with a criminal investigation into an offence which was, or may have been, committed in the United Kingdom. Corresponding provisions allow for the transfer of prisoners to this country.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000067"></a>The noble Lord will know that people in prison, either on remand or as convicted prisoners, are potentially vulnerable to pressure to consent to transfer orders. Can he therefore, on behalf of the Government, give your Lordships' Grand Committee a clear assurance that any such prisoner being transferred to any of the countries listed in the order will receive appropriate legal advice and say what that appropriate legal advice will be; and that they will not be placed under implied or actual pressure to give their consent? This is important because-it should be noted-this consent cannot be withdrawn once given. This has an added importance, given that the provisions also do not exclude the transfer of particularly vulnerable prisoners, such as those under the age of 18; albeit that provision is made for an appropriate adult to give consent in certain circumstances on behalf of a youthful or physically or mentally disadvantaged person. Can the Minister assure us that a transferred prisoner's return to the United Kingdom from the countries listed in this order, which include the Balkans and Israel, will be guaranteed and that steps will be taken to ensure their safety while in these countries' custody? Can the Minister clearly state what steps will be taken to ensure their safety?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000068"></a>Finally, the Government have said that they expect the power to transfer prisoners to be used rarely. How many prisoners have been transferred to other countries to date under the current arrangements, particularly to assist in the investigation of crimes that are alleged to have taken place here in the United Kingdom? Can the Minister give your Lordships' Committee a clear assurance that the Government will not permit transfers, either from or to the United Kingdom, within the EU, the Balkans and Israel, which offend this country's understanding and sense of proportionality and fairness?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000069"></a>I turn now to a related matter. In extending the number of states designated as participating countries, this order is required before the United Kingdom can ratify the second additional protocol to the European convention, of which we heard quite a lot on Monday. We know that it is the Government's intention to ratify the protocol. The European Select Committee was critical that it had taken the Government since 2001-eight years-to reach this point. In evidence to the committee, a Home Office official said that this was because of,</p>
<ul><a name="09120954000104"></a>"one or two policy issues ... around mutual recognition in areas like control, delivery, covert surveillance",</ul>



<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC66"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC66</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09120954000098"></a>and "joint intelligence teams". Can the Minister please expand on what these issues are and how the Government have addressed and are addressing them? Earlier this year the Government estimated that the UK would ratify the protocol by the autumn. Clearly this is no longer the case, so when do the Government now expect to do so? Also, how are the Government encouraging other countries to ratify the protocol? I will not repeat the obvious question that I asked on Monday because I am awaiting the Minister's missive on that and other subjects.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000070"></a>As I said, mutual legal assistance is important, but the Government must be careful about how it is used. On the basis that the Minister can give your Lordships' Committee the appropriate assurances that I have asked for, we can support the order.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000071"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0002.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09120954000132"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> My Lords, a number of my questions were very similar to those of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, so I will not take the time of the Committee by repeating them. I thank the Minister for his presentation of the order and assure him that we support what the Government propose and that my comments will be easier than those on the last order.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000072"></a>When I saw the order, I asked my noble friend Lord Wallace whether he had any comments, leading as he does on foreign affairs. Almost inevitably, he pointed to the juxtaposition of Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Switzerland, and asked whether the Government had previously considered the quality of the Swiss police and prosecuting authorities to be on the same level as those of the states of the western Balkans, and co-operation with them to have been comparably difficult. I take his point that Switzerland is not now being designated, as it already has been. I do not know whether it is fully participating or will be when this is passed, if that is the right way to put it. Perhaps more sloppily, are all aspects now covered as regards Switzerland?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000073"></a>I have warned the Minister of these questions. Are there any remaining European countries which are not participating? With regard to the service of process to be undertaken by the post, how reliable are the postal services in the countries in question? How is service achieved now, before the order comes into effect? I ask that question from my background as a solicitor. I no longer practise but the scars of failing, or being aware of other people failing, to serve something stay painfully deep with one. I should say that my firm was never in that position. It was from observing others.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000074"></a>I would imagine that any expenses attached to the new arrangements for travel, telephone and so on would be de minimis, but the Minister might like to comment on that. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has asked about the protection of prisoners going to certain other countries. Will the Minister comment on custody conditions in the countries concerned? We will all have read about the luxurious accommodation in Gstaad made available to one person who is being held in Switzerland, but I hardly think that that is typical. The more serious question is with regard to some of the countries whose facilities are perhaps not as developed as those in western Europe.</p>

To deal with the questions more or less in the order that they were raised, the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about the adherence of participating countries.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000076"></a>Parts of the 1959 convention undertake to give the widest measure of mutual assistance possible within domestic law. The MLA process relies on good faith, mutual trust and a common interest in fighting crime. MLA arrangements between the UK and countries designated in this order have been good and ratification of the second additional protocol should only strengthen those relations. If any problem arises in relation to the MLA, the aim will be to deal with these problems at official level and to escalate them to a ministerial level if necessary. If that does not prove to be successful were there to be a problem, there is a provision in the second additional protocol, Article 29, to support the friendly settlement of any problem arising out of the application of the convention and its protocols through the European Community on Crime Problems of the Council of Europe.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000077"></a>On ratification and entry into force, the Government are bringing forward another piece of necessary secondary legislation to ratify the protocol. This statutory instrument is in relation to civil and criminal liability of officers in international joint investigation teams. It will be subject to a negative resolution. Once this is laid before Parliament, and if this secondary legislation is passed by the House, the UK Government will be in a position to prepare instruments of ratification with the second additional protocol. It would then enter into force on the first day of the month following the expiry of three months after the date on which the UK deposits the instrument of ratification with the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe. The aim is to complete that process as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000078"></a>Ratification of the second additional protocol is necessary for the UK to be able to access the full range of mutual legal assistance available under it. It provides a framework for a broad range of mutual legal assistance and is specifically available to states that have ratified it. This includes assistance in relation to joint investigation teams, covert investigations and controlled deliveries. The protocol also provides a number of operational benefits. By requiring process to be sent directly to individuals and by allowing direct transmission of mutual legal assistance requests by prosecutors, bureaucracy is reduced and the entire mutual legal assistance process expedited. It is important for the UK to show its commitment to MLA internationally and the importance that it attaches to it as a tool in the fight against international crime. We hope that this move will encourage other countries which have not signed or ratified the protocol to go through the same process, perhaps without the great expanse of time between signing and ratification which was a criticism of the committee of the noble Lord, Lord Jopling, which I found hard to argue against.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000079"></a>On legal assistance, it is entirely a matter for the prisoner concerned whether they wish to consent to any temporary transfer. No pressure would be applied, and there would be no adverse consequences for them

They would need to seek legal advice if necessary, but it would be their responsibility and not that of the state.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000080"></a>I was asked how many requests have been received under Sections 47 and 48. The answer is very simple: to date, the UK has neither made nor received any such requests. Consequently, no prisoner has been transferred to or from the United Kingdom under these powers. It is not envisaged that the designation of these countries will lead to a large number of such exchange requests.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000081"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was rightly concerned that the transfer of prisoners should be proportionate. In considering the proportionality of any temporary transfer to assist in criminal investigations, three important points are to be kept in mind. First, the transfer should be for only a short period and as long as was necessary to assist in the investigation in question. That point would be made at the time of request from the MLA transfer country. Secondly, the transfer should be carried out only with the consent of the relevant prisoner. Thirdly, the purpose of the transfer should be to assist with a criminal investigation. I am sure that most noble Lords would find that aim easy to understand and recognise its importance.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000082"></a>Given the limited circumstances in which a transfer of a prisoner could therefore take place and the fact that they were being transferred quite voluntarily, together with the important public interest that such transfers could serve, I can see no argument for their being deemed disproportionate. If it were, the transfer would have to be shown to be compatible with the ECHR. If the transfer were considered to be disproportionate when measured against that, it could not take place.</p>

<p><a name="09120954000083"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked a number of related questions, one of which was about Switzerland. Having spent considerable time during the past 12 or 15 years in Switzerland, I have views about its democracy and the way in which it applies locally, but I do not believe that anyone could accuse the Swiss police authorities or police force of being other than of the highest standard. It is a consequence of Switzerland not being in the EU that it does not fall automatically to be considered a participating country. Therefore, there must be an international agreement to which both the UK and Switzerland are party, and it would need to be designated as a participating country for it to be fully involved. For example, it has already been designated for service of process under the previous EU-Switzerland agreement, but the problem with that was that it dealt with fraud but did not go any wider. However, Switzerland has ratified the second additional protocol, and we intend to do likewise. Therefore, it is necessary and appropriate that we designate it as a member state in our participating country list.</p>

All current EU member states are participating countries for the purpose of the Crime (International Co-operation) Act 2003, which means that all EU member states can benefit from the provisions of that Act, which is relevant only to participating countries.

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000085"></a>The noble Baroness and the noble Lord were concerned about the custody conditions into which prisoners might be transferred, however temporarily. As we said, the consent of the person in custody in the first instance is required, otherwise it will not take place. Additionally, we are bound by the Human Rights Act to act in accordance with convention rights, and it would not be appropriate to send a person into custody in a country where custody conditions could give rise to a breach of the ECHR. For the purposes of this order, a person in custody in the UK would be only temporarily transferred on the rare occasion when they were assisting with a UK investigation abroad.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000086"></a>The noble Baroness raised the question of expenses. With the exception of costs related to TV/video link evidence and to the temporary transfer of a prisoner into and out of the UK, it is standard practice with mutual legal assistance that the requested country meets the cost of providing assistance and that the cost of providing telephone connections and so on would be de minimis.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000087"></a>What difficulties have we seen with the process? How reliable are the postal services in other countries and how do we achieve this? There is no difficulty in serving the process in the vast majority of cases. Currently the service of process in these countries can be effected by post or by sending a relevant document to a country's central authority and requesting the use of postal services. But most often it is effected by using private companies such as FedEx, UPS or whatever, so the quality of the postal service within the country is not necessarily a matter of real concern. At the moment, services can still be sent by post, but the order makes it an obligation that it should be sent by post, save in the limited circumstances to which I referred. That will minimise bureaucracy and ensure that documents are served as quickly as possible.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120954000088"></a>I think that that deals with most of the questions. When we ratify depends on the second SI, but we are determined to move forward as quickly as we can. I hope, with noble Lords' support, we can ensure that this order goes on its way and that we are one step closer to the overdue ratification.</p>

Before I proceed further, I wish to state that in my view this statutory instrument is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000002"></a>The background to the regulations is the credits for parents and carers, introduced into the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 by the Pensions Act 2007, which both replaces and builds on the home responsibilities protection provisions. The Act introduced a new carer's credit available to people engaged in caring, which the regulations provide to include caring for one or more persons for a total of 20 hours a week or more.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000003"></a>The Committee may recall that, when the credit was first proposed, it was to be available only where the persons cared for were in receipt of a relevant disability-related benefit. However, following discussions with carers' representatives, it was decided to extend the provision to those caring for at least 20 hours a week for people without a qualifying benefit, but where the need for care was certified by a health or social care professional. The provisions were warmly welcomed by noble Lords but there were some reservations  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC71"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC71</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>concerning the delegation of the provisions to regulations. I hope that these regulations, which define "engaged in caring" and are the result of extensive collaboration with stakeholders, will reassure noble Lords.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000004"></a>The overall consensus has been that the certification arrangements should operate with a "light touch" to avoid disqualifying someone who is not in regular contact with professional health agencies. Consequently, the range of people who are able to certify the need for care is designed to be as broad as possible. There is no prescribed list of people who could certify, and this could be done, for instance, by a member of a voluntary group in regular contact with the person being cared for.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000005"></a>We have worked throughout with representatives from Carers UK, which has helped to produce the guidance for certifiers. I am delighted that we have also been able to work with Carers UK to produce a most successful Carers Rights Day last Friday, which this year had a theme relevant to these regulations of "Caring for your Pension".</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000006"></a>As a result of these credits for carers, around 160,000 more people could start to gain a credit for the basic state pension in 2010, including around 115,000 women. Also around 240,000 more people could accrue entitlement to state second pension than are currently doing so, including around 145,000 women. The Committee may have noticed that these figures are somewhat higher than those contained in the Explanatory Memorandum to the regulations. The lower figures represent those estimated to gain through caring for someone with a disability-related benefit only. They do not include those where the need for care is certified. We have arranged for the Explanatory Memorandum to be corrected and relaid.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000007"></a>The regulations also include some provisions to help other carers. Foster carers, defined here, and people getting child benefit for a child under 12 are expressly provided for in the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. Also in respect of child benefit, Regulation 5(1)(a) provides for the partners of child benefit recipients to be treated as "engaged in caring" for the purposes of these credits. That is when the child benefit recipient cannot themselves benefit from the credits because he or she already has a qualifying year for basic and additional pension purposes-most usually through paid work.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000008"></a>From April 2008, we introduced a similar provision for transferring HRP entitlement between partners. That has proved very useful on those occasions where the "wrong person" has claimed child benefit and their partner, at home with the children, would otherwise not have received credits towards a state pension.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000009"></a>I need to draw noble Lords' attention to one small drafting error in the regulations. As some may have noticed, the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09120966000044"></a>"is in receipt of income support",</ul>
<p><a name="09120966000010"></a>in Regulation 10(2)(a) are superfluous. Income support carers, defined in Regulation 5(1)(c), are not required to make an application.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000011"></a>In summary, these regulations seek to ensure that the greatest number of genuine carers benefit from  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC72"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these new credits. They put in place the final piece of the legislation designed to enhance the pension prospects of carers and others with broken work records. The credits, together with the reduction in the number of qualifying years and the single contribution condition, will mean that from next April around three-quarters of women reaching pension age will qualify for a full basic state pension, compared to around half without these changes. Ultimately, around 95 per cent of women will qualify for a full basic state pension. It will become possible to obtain a full pension solely on the basis of credit so that, for the first time, caring will be fully on a par with paid employment. I recommend these regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09120966000012"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09120966000052"></a>Lord Freud:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his full explanation of how these regulations will work. I also welcome the statutory instrument, which puts into effect measures which I know my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale strongly supported in Committee on the then Pensions Bill a little more than two years ago.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000013"></a>These regulations ensure that carers and foster parents obtain full contribution credits for national insurance purposes. It is clearly in the interests of the state and, indeed, of all of us, that people who take on these important and historically undervalued roles are allowed maximum flexibility in building up their rights to receive state pensions and other relevant support. To that extent, it makes a statement about the social value of the role of caring. The regulations spell out the mechanism by which carers will get carer's credit and, in particular, whether the person they are caring for is entitled to benefit. The approach adopted here is the introduction of the care certificate and the reliance on certification by health and social care professionals, and even, in some cases, members of voluntary groups, all approved by the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000043"></a>I note that the Minister talked about this process being conducted with a light touch. I am sure we are all aware of the current concern being expressed at the so-called light-touch regulation in so far as it applied to our ruined financial sector. I became concerned when I read the draft notes for certifiers about what was being required from them. Clearly it is a sophisticated judgment, as one can see when one looks at the definition of care. The draft states that care may take many forms; that it is important that we recognise a wide range of caring responsibilities; and that it is equally important that we take a balanced view which does not reward somebody for performing duties that would normally be considered day-to-day housekeeping. The second implication of these draft guidance notes is that it is a time-consuming requirement. The notes refer to needing to know the circumstances of the particular carer in some detail. The implication is that the certifier needs to keep in touch with developments in case circumstances change, so it is quite a sophisticated burden.</p>
<h5><a name="09120966000046"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000014"></a>In the austere times we are facing, I hope that this new light-touch regime does two things: first, that it is effective in preventing fraudulent claims; and, secondly,  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC73"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it does not bring with it a heavy burden of regulatory oversight. My concern is that if there were lurid stories in the press about people abusing the system, the reaction would be to tighten up, and make far heavier, the regulatory burden as opposed to the light touch which is envisaged. The risk with such a system is that it is expensive in the requirements it imposes and in the direct costs of operation. I shall be most interested to hear the Minister's response on the assessment that the department has made of the issues surrounding fraud and cost in this area. I should also like to be told the absolute cost of incorporating these extra people into the state pension system, as I could not find that in the notes.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000015"></a>The inclusion of foster carers in the regulations makes sense in the context of the severe difficulties that we have seen in recent years in the provision of fostering places. Anything that makes fostering easier and more rewarding is to be welcomed. However, the regulations are likely to improve provision very much at the margin. The challenge to the Government remains to make sure that there is adequate and stable fostering for children. We have had warnings from those involved in the fostering sector that there is a shortage of people prepared to be foster parents-therefore, the options, when placing children, are narrowed-and that too few people are entering the area at a time when we face a looming generational changeover. Therefore, my second area of inquiry to the Minister is: how do these regulations fit into the Government's measure to ease the shortage of foster carers?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000016"></a>I broaden out the question of care to refer to the Government's current plans on providing a national care service, of which the provisions we are discussing would clearly form part. The Green Paper, <I>Shaping the Future of Care Together,</I> suggested strongly that this service would be paid for in part out of disability living allowance and attendance allowance. I say "suggested strongly" as no other funding alternatives were sketched out in the Green Paper. However, yesterday the Secretary of State, Andy Burnham, said in another place, at col. 170 of Commons <I>Hansard</I>, that there would be "no cash losers". Therefore, my third question is: how, then, do the Government plan to fund the national care service? Subject to the response on that, I assure the Minister that we will support this instrument.</p>

<p><a name="09120966000017"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09120966000053"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for explaining the regulations so clearly. We on these Benches give them our wholehearted welcome. As the Minister said, this arises from the Pensions Act 2007, and establishes new rules for  class 3 national insurance contribution credits for those bringing up children or caring for others for 20 or more hours a week. The regulations will in particular greatly improve the state pension records of women, who tend to get a raw deal from the current system. For the first time, caring is to be treated on a par with paid employment for the building up of pension entitlement.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000018"></a>We on these Benches are particularly pleased that the Government have taken on board the proposals in the new clause tabled by my Liberal Democrat colleagues in the other place on Report on the Pension Bill 2007. The new clause, subsequently withdrawn after the  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC74"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister promised to consider it in the context of regulations, was entitled "certification scheme for carers" and would have put in the Bill the proposals that we are now considering.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000019"></a>The 2006 White Paper <I>S</I><I>ecurity in </I><I>R</I><I>etirement</I>, which floated a narrower reform, pointed out that around 390,000 carers were not accruing basic pension rights. The White Paper went on to observe that 120,000 of those carers, who were caring for 20 hours or more a week, appeared to face more difficulties in the labour market, not altogether surprisingly, than those caring for fewer than 20 hours a week. The regulations will ensure that at least they are not now compromising their pension entitlement by their most valuable caring activities and not just for those disabled people on qualifying benefits. As we know, a lot of sick and disabled people just cannot face applying for, or just will not apply for, disability living allowance or attendance allowance, or are past the qualifying age for applying for DLA.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000020"></a>It is also welcome that the credits will be available for up to 12 weeks to cover periods of sickness, holidays and respite care, as well as occasions when the disabled person is in hospital and has had any qualifying benefit withdrawn. I presume that if no qualifying benefits have been received, under this regulation the carer will still be covered for 12 weeks. That was not entirely clear in the Explanatory Memorandum. A carer friend of mine says that she is almost busier than normal when her son is in hospital.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000021"></a>I, too, thank the Minister for sending the guidance notes for certifiers. I note that they are to be published on the internet. Will they be available anywhere in hard copy? I imagine that many carers are not necessarily internet literate. That brings me to my next point about how this very welcome policy is to be publicised.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000022"></a>My honourable friend in another place, Mr Steve Webb, made the point that the carers we are talking about may not come into contact with the benefit authorities at all. I do not think that we can assume that all carers can or will access Directgov on the internet. In many ways, healthcare professionals are likely to be key players in letting carers know about their entitlements. While on the subject of healthcare professionals, could the Minister say whether that is a term of art or just a catch-all term? I know that the certifier does not have to be a healthcare professional, but I am curious about whether the term is defined for the purposes of this legislation. What about someone who is a practitioner in the alternative health field, such as an acupuncturist or a homoeopath?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000023"></a>Going back to how the new scheme will be publicised, perhaps notices could be posted in GP surgeries and advertisements taken out in local newspapers. MPs could be encouraged to help disseminate information to their constituents. I note that the Government intend the certification process to be as light touch as possible. That is very welcome, as long as the publicity about the scheme is not light touch, otherwise the take-up will be disappointing. I also note that there is no time limit for claiming the credits and it may be extended indefinitely at the discretion of the Secretary of State or HMRC-a rather surprising fact given the usual strict rules on  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC75"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>backdating. Nor is there expected to be a charge paid by the cared-for person to a healthcare professional or other person for certifying a care certificate, although that cannot be enforced. All in all, we welcome this regulation most warmly.</p>

<p><a name="09120966000024"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09120966000054"></a>Baroness Pitkeathley:</b> My Lords, it is probably more than 20 years since I started to campaign for a lifetime of caring to be treated equally to a lifetime of paid work in relation to the state pension, so I am a very happy person today. I commend the Government's flexibility in changing legislation to allow carers to be accredited by a professional to show that they are providing the appropriate numbers of hours of care. As the Minister mentioned, he has worked very closely with Carers UK and I declare an interest as its vice president. Carers UK has argued that restricting this to those caring for those with certain disability benefits will mean that some carers miss out, for example those caring for someone with a mental health condition who refuses to claim or somebody caring for several people getting the lower rate DLA.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000025"></a>This is the first time that those caring for 20 hours a week will have a concrete entitlement. This is recognition that 20 hours is the threshold beyond which carers' employment prospects are damaged. A number of measures will help carers to build up pension entitlement and will reduce reliance on means-testing in future, including, as we have heard, the introduction of a new carer's credit for those who are caring for 20 hours or more a week for someone who is severely disabled. That should mean that thousands more carers are eligible for a full basic state pension. The reduction in the number of qualifying years for the full basic state pension means that carers with disrupted contribution records can still build up a full entitlement. The removal of the first contribution condition means that someone who has never worked can still qualify for a full basic state pension. These are hugely important steps forward in stopping carers finding themselves in poverty as a direct result of their caring.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000026"></a>I share the concerns of the noble Baroness about publicising this and perhaps I may link that to the questions posed by the noble Lord, Lord Freud, about fraud. Far from being notorious for defrauding the system, carers are notorious for not claiming. That is the most important reason why we have to publicise this. I am very grateful to the Minister for being prepared to work with the carers' organisations on take-up and the Carers Rights Day.</p>

I always feel very strongly about this, as noble Lords will perhaps permit. The noble Lord also made a point about the cost. We always have to bear in mind the cost of not supporting carers, not only during their caring life but after their caring has ceased. They contribute £87 billion to the economy. The costs of this measure have to be taken in proportion. I conclude with sincere thanks and congratulations to the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="09120966000029"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09120966000057"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank all noble Lords who have spoken in support of these proposals. I start with my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley and acknowledge her strong campaign over so many years. I guess that I should apologise that it has taken us so long to get to where we are, but I am delighted that she is pleased. Like both other noble Lords who spoke, she recognises the huge contribution that carers make to individuals and to our society as a whole. My noble friend also picked up on the point that this is not only about carers' credits. Introducing only 30 years' contributions to get a full basic state pension and dealing with the first contribution condition are important components of making sure that more people can access a basic state pension. I will come on to the point about publicity in a moment.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000030"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Freud, asked what the light-touch approach would entail with this increase and the likelihood of fraud. We need to balance the need to ensure that only genuine carers are awarded credits against the intention that the burden of proof to be placed on them is minimal. That is so that as many carers as possible are able to benefit through our low-key approach. We believe that the risk of fraud is very low because no cash benefit is attached to the credit and the prospect of obtaining an increase in benefit at some point in the future, as opposed to immediately, is unlikely to have much appeal for those who would otherwise seek to abuse the system. However, I agree with the point made by my noble friend about looking at the balance of things and at the huge contribution that carers make to our society.</p>
<h5><a name="09120966000047"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000031"></a>The noble Lord asked about the certifier being responsible for notifying any change in circumstances. I think he asserted that that was the position. That is not the case; it is for the carer to inform the authorities of any change in circumstances. The certifier needs to be satisfied only that an appropriate level of care was needed at the time of certifying. He asked whether that will be a sophisticated and time-consuming process. It should not be because by having a light-touch approach and a broad approach to who might certify, we are giving opportunities for those who engage routinely in helping people. It would automatically be part of what they know and are engaged in, so they are best able to make those judgments.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000032"></a>The noble Lord asked about the costs of the arrangements. The total cost in terms of state pension expenditure is estimated to be £50 million to 2020. I thought a schedule outlining the costs was attached to the Explanatory Memorandum. If it was not, I shall let the noble Lord have a copy. It shows the costs claimed through the qualifying benefit route or the certification route and how they potentially build up over the period to 2050. The noble Lord raised a broader point, which is outside these regulations, about the shortage of foster carers and he made suggestions. The provisions we are making here to enable foster carers to have better access and to build up better pension rights are positive.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000033"></a>He also asked about proposals for the new care and support reforms, which are referred to in the Green Paper. He said that there are no costings for them nor  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC77"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC77</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>information about the means by which they might be paid for. He will be aware that a range of options were proposed in the Green Paper and that we are consulting on them. I think the paper originally promulgated five options and dismissed two: costs being entirely paid by individuals and, at the other end of the spectrum, being entirely paid by the taxpayer. There are a range of alternatives in between. That is the fundamental point.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000034"></a>It was asked whether DLA and AA will be abolished to pay for the national care service. In the longer term, there may be a case for bringing some disability benefits and the adult social care system together into a single system as a better way of providing support for all older and disabled people. However, we will make changes to disability benefits only if we are certain that by doing so we can better support disabled people. We know that disability benefits are popular because they provide a universal entitlement that does not depend on where a person lives. They provide a cash budget that can be spent on the services people want, and they are often used to support lower-level needs that help people stay well for longer. These three aspects will all be important components of the new care and support system and will ensure that if disability benefits for older people are reformed as part of a national care service, people receiving the affected benefits at the time of reform will continue to receive the same level of cash support under a new and better care and support system. I think the noble Lord referred to the fact that the Secretary of State for Health gave an explicit assurance in October that we have ruled out any suggestion that DLA for the under-65s will be brought into the new national care service.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000035"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, welcomed these provisions, as I knew she would. She was committed to them as we debated them during the passage of the Pensions Bill. She asked how we can ensure that carers know about these credits. We have been working in partnership with Carers UK. Carers Rights Day, which I referred to, encouraged carers to claim all the financial help and support to which they are entitled. A second burst of media activity is planned from February to raise awareness of the availability of the new carer's credit from April. Our communications people will target broadcasters, such as "The One Show", and news outlets and will work with them on packages. They will also work with the personal finance pages of the national and regional press to give practical advice to carers on how to apply for the new credit.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000036"></a>Consumer magazines such as <I>Good Housekeeping</I> and <I>My Weekly</I>, together with specialist carer magazines, will also be targeted. Information and guidance for carers will be available on the internet. The idea of information being available in GPs' surgeries is very helpful and something that we will look to take forward. I hope we can encourage Members of Parliament to have information available in their surgeries.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000037"></a>The noble Baroness asked specifically whether there will be hard copies of the guidance. I think Carers UK and similar organisations would be likely to be able to provide these. At the moment we have no specific plans routinely to circulate hard copies, but we want this to be taken up as widely as possible and will do  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC78"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whatever we can to that effect. The noble Baroness asked specifically about 12-week breaks and how they will apply, particularly when somebody has not accessed disability benefits. Would the 12 weeks still apply? The answer is yes, they would.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120966000038"></a>The noble Baroness asked about the definition of a healthcare professional. Is it term of art? I seem to recall that we debated this during the Welfare Reform Bill. I do not remember which one. I think the noble Baroness and her colleague-</p>

<p><a name="09120966000039"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09120966000058"></a>Baroness Thomas of Winchester:</b> I think it was during the Pensions Act. Perhaps I am wrong.</p>

<p><a name="09120966000040"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09120966000059"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The noble Baroness may be right. I have a feeling that we also debated it in relation to the Welfare Reform Act 2007. We have no definitive list and it is not a term of art as far as we are concerned. The regulations refer to health or social care professionals. In practice, the certifier should be a person who, in their professional capacity or as a volunteer, is familiar with the circumstances of the individual disabled person and is able to confirm that they need the amount of care that is being provided. Each application will be considered on its merits. I hope that definition also helps the noble Lord, Lord Freud.</p>

<p><a name="09120966000041"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09120966000060"></a>Lord Freud:</b> I thank the Minister for giving way. I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, for giving way earlier. I apologise for not having thanked her at the appropriate time. I am still learning some of the procedures of the House. The Minister's argument is an extremely powerful one. My concern about fraud is that the reward for this is so long term that it gives a new meaning to the expression "long-form fraud", but the numbers mean that it would be well down the list of things that people indulge in. I would also be grateful for the schedule, which was not in my copy but must be available somewhere. I would be grateful for that and the costs. Given what the Minister has said, I am entirely content and strongly support the statutory instrument, as I said before.</p>

<p><a name="09120966000042"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09120966000061"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I am very grateful to the noble Lord for that intervention and his support and, indeed, for the support of all noble Lords.

<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC79"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC79</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09120967000002"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09120967000092"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Davies of Oldham):</b> My Lords, the Committee will be aware that those carrying out waste recovery or disposal operations must have either an environmental permit or must register an exemption from the need for a permit. The UK is one of the few member states to use the discretion that provides permitting exemptions as a lighter touch form of regulation for those operations that pose a lower risk of harm to people or the environment. It might be thought, as we discuss these issues in Committee, that we have made something of a rod for our own back, because where the line is to be drawn is the subject of this debate. But in the general pursuit of lighter regulation, we are sure that the fact that the UK pursues this broad policy is entirely right.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000003"></a>The problem is that exemptions have developed in a somewhat ad hoc manner over the years. When problems have been identified, previous attempts to tighten up the controls have led to the development of several complex notifiable exemptions with registration requirements not dissimilar to those in place for applying for a permit. Experience has shown that many exempt waste operations actually pose a much higher risk than some permitted operations-for instance, commercial-scale composting and large metal recycling operations. The problem is that at the moment the regulator, namely the Environment Agency, is able neither to carry out sufficient assessment of the proposals before the exempt operation starts nor to undertake appropriate levels of monitoring and inspection based on the environmental risk posed and the level of compliance being achieved. Conversely, there are no exemptions at all for many small-scale low-risk operations involving certain reuse or recycling operations for a broad range of wastes from the recycling of coat hangers to the use of lion faeces to make cat repellents, in which the wider danger is by definition somewhat restricted.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000004"></a>Other exempt waste operations have been subject to abuse, with landscaping developments the size of small landfill sites operating under an exemption for the use of waste in construction with no limit on the quantities deposited. The other place debated this poor state of affairs last year and the Government undertook to do something about it. These imbalances rightly led to calls for a review of the boundary between those operations that ought to be permitted and those that should be exempt. The exemptions review carried out jointly by Defra, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Environment Agency over the last three years has involved significant dialogue with a wide range of businesses and others and has included not one but two public consultations, which have led to the proposals before us today.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000005"></a>The regulations will change the boundary. After consideration of all the responses to the consultations, the Government concluded that the most effective and cost-efficient means of ensuring that the waste framework directive's requirements are implemented in a proportionate, risk-based way to meet our better regulation and simplification agenda is to provide new and amended exemptions for smaller-scale low-risk waste operations, while restricting or removing the extent of exemptions for higher-risk operations.  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC80"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC80</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Importantly, the decision on where to draw that boundary has been carried out using a systematic assessment against a number of environmental principles and other criteria, an approach that was very widely supported by those responding to the consultation. These principles and criteria are to be enshrined in government guidance so that they can be used in future reviews. We are currently consulting on the guidance to accompany the revised exemptions. I assure the Committee that this guidance will be completed and in place before the changes to the legislation come into force next April, if these regulations are approved.</p>
<h5><a name="09120967000006"></a><I>5.30 pm</I></h5>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000007"></a>Operators of the new simple exemptions will be able to register one or more exemptions in relation to as many sites as they operate at no cost-with just one exception-and with a minimum of information needing to be submitted.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000008"></a>Eighty-eight per cent of the existing 145,000 sites that are registered as exempt will remain exempt. Others that are currently paying for and subject to assessment under a notifiable exemption will benefit straightaway from the free, simple exemption. The number of exempt sites will be added to by potentially thousands of additional sites for which there is currently no exemption provided in law but where the agency has not required them to apply for a permit; in other words, the low-risk positions.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000009"></a>Nine per cent of current exempt sites will no longer need to register as they are not considered to be carrying on waste recovery or disposal operations. That leaves the 3 per cent of sites that pose the highest risk or have been subject to abuse and therefore merit closer scrutiny. Those will need a permit. Most of them are already subject to notifiable exemption controls and may be subject to relatively minor changes to the measures they have to take to mitigate any risk of harm or pollution. These include the larger metal recycling sites, large-scale land remediation and landscaping developments, and spreading waste on land for agricultural benefit. The exception is composting, where commercial-scale composting will be subject to greater requirements to mitigate the risk that it poses.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000010"></a>I emphasise the benefits for the majority of operators. In last week's Commons debate, mistaken allegations were made about the impact on the 3 per cent of operations that will require a permit, particularly in respect of planning permission, as well as the extent of changes being made to the environmental permitting regime. I hope that the Government's reply to that debate will have been sufficient to allay concerns. I know that the other place proceeded to a vote on the issue.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000011"></a>It is imperative that we provide the many new and amended exemptions that will encourage businesses to carry out recycling and recovery and reduce the burdens on them, as well as bring an end to abuses and inadequate controls. Not to do so, or to remove exemptions altogether, would be wrong and undermine our drive to encourage recovery and recycling to deliver the objectives of the waste strategy. It would have a financial impact on many smaller organisations in a wide range of sectors that rely on the exemptions to store, dismantle or treat a wide range of recyclable  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC81"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC81</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wastes. The proposals are a key simplification measure. They have been through thorough impact assessment and scrutiny by the Merits Committee and are an example of better regulation that is proportionate and targeted. That is why we have made these significant revisions of the previous regime.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000012"></a>That is the basis of and philosophy behind the proposals. I commend the regulations to the Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09120967000013"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09120967000093"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing these regulations. I must declare an interest as a farmer and grower whose business may be affected by the regulations in one way or another, even though there are exemptions for agriculture.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000014"></a>I listened with care to the presentation of the background to these regulations. In general, we understand the reason for their introduction. We have some sympathy with the strategy and welcome the exemptions. However, I have a large number of detailed comments and questions, and I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I rather exceptionally give the pedantic side of my nature a stroll this evening. Much of the forensic work on this has been done by my researcher, but I received letters from the British Metals Recycling Association and the Community Composting Network. I noticed the Minister made special mention of these two elements. Their involvement and concern is interesting as it indicates that although what they do is currently seen as virtuous, and is encouraged by the Government, they are anxious about the impact of the regulations. The metal recyclers are concerned that these regulations will reduce capacity and increase costs and burdens for no public or environmental benefit. The CCN is rightly concerned about the impact on community food waste composting schemes. These prize-winning schemes are now obliged to pay for the most expensive permits. I shall not go into the detail of their letters because, from the way in which he introduced the regulations, the Minister is aware of this subject area. I hope it may be possible to revisit them in the interests of allowing the small-scale operations of the Community Composting Network to continue without unnecessary burdens.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000015"></a>The regulations come into force on 6 April 2010, which is some time ahead. Are the Government expecting difficulties? Are there any hidden nasties that they are likely to have to deal with? The document is complex and amends a number of previous permitting regulations. It is difficult to follow. There is no contents page or separation of the major chapters. Page 6 contains the place for the signatures to the regulations and the start of Schedule 2. Page 12 has a main heading, "Schedule 2", and the start of Schedule 3. Page 51 has the end of Schedule 3 and the start of Schedule 3A. The presentation is not easy on the eye. The Government talk about light-touch regulation, but this is heavy-going regulation.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000016"></a>I shall go through the regulations page by page. On page 2, Regulation 2 amends Regulations 3 to 12 of the 2007 regulations. That is an interesting observation. On page 4, do the final two lines under the table mean that Schedule 3 to the regulations currently in place will be succeeded by these regulations on 6 April 2010? Midway down the page, there is a line:</p>
<ul><a name="09120967000081"></a>"'previous Schedule 3' means Schedule 3 to these Regulations as it had effect on 5th April 2010.".".</ul>

<p><a name="09120967000066"></a>It is confusing reading. I am not entirely sure whether "these" refers to the regulations before us or to the 2007 regulations.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000017"></a>I note on page 4 the exclusion of mushroom compost from the list of excluded activities, which the Minister mentioned. Why have the Government done that? What is the reasoning behind it and have the Government considered the implication for mushroom producers of this change?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000018"></a>On page 5, there is a mention in paragraph 12(2)(k) of the "appropriate authority" under the regulations. Who is the appropriate authority? There is no definition of what an appropriate authority is. Is it the Secretary of State, the Welsh Government, the Environment Agency or some other such body? There also appears to be some confusion on this page between the regulations of 2007 and 2009. When the regulations are consolidated, it would be useful if it were made clear to which previous regulations the text refers.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000019"></a>I turn now to page 6. What is the significance of and meaning of the inverted commas before the words "Schedule 2"? They are not closed off anywhere and it seems a rather strange compositional idea to have included them in the text. Paragraph 1 refers to the waste mobile plant, which,</p>
<ul><a name="09120967000082"></a>"has the meaning given in regulation 8(4)".</ul>
<p><a name="09120967000067"></a>Where is regulation 8(4)? It certainly does not exist readily for me to be able to point it out within these regulations.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000020"></a>There is also a question about the whole business of the relevant authority. What sanctions apply in the case of invalid registrations? Who will carry forward the failure to register an exception? Apparently, it is the local authority in whose area the operation is first carried out. Can that always be proved or demonstrated? It must be quite difficult to police and local authorities may have difficulty in operations that spread over local authorities.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000021"></a>At the bottom of page 7, the regulations state:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09120967000076"></a>"The information in this sub-paragraph is the name and business contact details of an individual officer or employee designated by the establishment or undertaking to be the primary contact for the purposes of registration",</p>

<p><a name="09120967000068"></a>which is obviously trying to pin the registration to a particular individual. I am sure that the Minister will understand why that is there, but it will lead to an awful lot of bureaucracy if individuals change and the responsible person changes within an organisation. Would it not be better to make it possible for people to be designated not only by name but by function within an organisation?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000022"></a>Turning to page 8, new paragraph 7(2) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09120967000077"></a>"Any other registration is valid until the end of validity of the first registration made in relation to the establishment or undertaking".</p>

<p><a name="09120967000069"></a>Are registrations time-limited? What is the meaning of the "end of validity"? I have read and reread that and cannot work out where that phrase fits in and to what it refers.</p>

<p><a name="09120967000072"></a>from an establishment an undertaking to be registered or renew a registration. There are not many activities within the local authority that are time-limited to five working days. Why is this particular thing so important that such an exceptional timetable should be imposed? I am all in favour of efficiency, but the administration of this may put a lot of local authorities under considerable pressure. A lot of work is involved in registering these exemptions.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000024"></a>On page 10, there is reference to the matters affecting national security, which it is right and proper should be a consideration. Under Regulation 11(4) for the first time and, subsequently, under paragraph (6), there is a reference to a person. Who is this person? Is it any person or a significant person? Is it a person of authority; in which case, what authority? Could it be the person next door? This rather strange phraseology is lacking in precision as to the nature of the person. How many of these exemptions have been thought likely to occur? If the Environment Agency has to deal with more than 300,000 septic tanks-the Minister and I debated the whole business of registration of septic tanks-we know that there will be many more as a result of these regulations. It is a major bureaucratic task, particularly if it is to be done properly and efficiently.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000025"></a>Paragraph (12) requires people to record, in the case of an exempt waste operation,</p>
<ul><a name="09120967000084"></a>"the quantity, nature, origin and, where relevant, the destination and treatment method of all waste disposed of or recovered in the course of that operation".</ul>
<p><a name="09120967000073"></a>If this is supposed to apply to farm waste, what is this? Is it cart loads or weight? Surely, the Minister does not really anticipate that farmers will have to go to a weighbridge to weigh the muck before they put it on the field or the packing house waste before they replace it. I cannot imagine that that is the case. Unless record keeping is done for a particular purpose, it can often become abused. It either has to be done properly or not at all. It is hard to see how this regulation can be done with any precision, in which case it might be better not to bother to try to do it.</p>

<p><a name="09120967000026"></a>Under Regulation 13, records will have to be inspected. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09120967000080"></a>"Every exemption registration authority must carry out appropriate periodic inspections of establishments and undertakings carrying on exempt waste operations in respect of which it is the ... authority".</p>

<p><a name="09120967000074"></a>That could be a very large number of establishments. Where are the personnel coming from? Are there not already enough inspections on farms, for example?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000027"></a>I turn to page 12 to discover another pair of inverted commas before Schedule 3. I mentioned inverted commas before in connection with Schedule 2. Then I came to page 14, which refers to waste lagoons. Why would the public want access to a lagoon, slurry pit or down? It says that the public should not be able to obtain access  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC84"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC84</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to the waste. If the lagoon or pit is on the farmer's property or behind a fence or wall, the public cannot be said to have access in any legal sense. Will that be sufficient? Here it does not say "legal access"; it refers only to access to the waste. That could be held to be a very different thing. Who is going to pay for the closing of these storage areas?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000028"></a>At the bottom of page 14 and the top of page 15, there is a very untidy bit of printing. There is a line at the bottom of page 14 and an open space at the top of page 15; the composition of it is not particularly good. On page 15, Table 1, code 020103, why is plant tissue waste and dredging spoil included in a table that is otherwise devoted to inert material? There are several references, other than those mentioned in 170505, but I have been unable to find 170505 in any other table in the regulations. Does it exist? Perhaps the Minister will tell us what it refers to.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000029"></a>On page 16, paragraph U2, code 160103, why is there a limit of 50 tonnes on the amount of baled tyres when the top of page 19 refers to 40 tonnes of tyres when they are in a retaining wall? Page 19 refers to having 40 tonnes of end-of-life tyres. That seems a bit inconsistent; I cannot understand why 50 tonnes is considered to be okay in one place and 40 tonnes is the quantity in another. That rather suggests to me that some of these figures have been plucked out of the air, rather than reasoned.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000030"></a>I turn to the burning of waste, such as timber, in paragraph U4 at the top of page 17. There is a plant in Troon; I understand that Scotland is not part and parcel of these regulations, but I know of a yard that accepts all the cut timber from Arran, takes of the bark and trims the side branches and then planes or logs the trunks and has heaps of different kinds of processed wood in a huge yard, protected by a chain-link fence with double gates and a lock. The flood bank between it and the sea is higher than the piles of wood probably 50 yards away and used by the populace to walk their dogs and push their prams. Would that situation be considered secure? If not, are the Government calling for small-scale operations to be run on tighter or higher standards than commercial ones? It says that waste should be stored in a secure place, but how will that be defined?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000031"></a>I note, too, that 0.4 megawatts is the standard for which exemptions will apply, but why has that figure been chosen? Why is it not 1 megawatt or 0.25 megawatts? It will be only a small-scale operation if it can use only a maximum of 50 kilograms an hour, as it says in paragraph U4(3)(a) on page 17.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000032"></a>Page 18 refers to reseeding waste water treatment plants. Under paragraph U6(3)(b), the specific condition is that,</p>
<ul><a name="09120967000085"></a>"the waste was not produced at the plant".</ul>
<p><a name="09120967000075"></a>Does it have to be moved and fresh brought in? Why is it that the waste produced at the plant cannot be used for reseeding?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000033"></a>I have mentioned the whole question of tyres, on page 19. I notice the enormous differential between stones and bricks capable of being used in their existing state only-in other words, heaps of building materials-which are limited to 100 tonnes in a pile, and blast furnace slag and stones only, for which the figure is  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC85"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC85</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>50,000 tonnes. Surely these materials are essentially very similar, yet the variation in the amount of material that is allowed to be stored in one place is considerable.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000034"></a>We saw the quantity of mushroom compost allowed earlier, and here we have 1,000 tonnes of mushroom compost able to be stored. I wonder how all these figures are tied up and who has gone through and audited them to make sure that there is a certain rationale behind them all.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000035"></a>Perhaps the gem in these regulations is on page 20, already referred to by the Minister, about lion faeces. The Minister has handled many things for this Government. I should think that this is the first time that he has found himself having to handle lion faeces and argue why it should be limited to five tonnes, whereas sheep, rabbit or deer faeces can be limited to 100 tonnes. Where is the logic in this? Does the lion limit relate to the ferocity of the beast when compared with the rabbit? How were these figures calculated and why did the Government see them as different? Are there any other animals? These are just four animals out of the animal kingdom that happened to find themselves distinguished by being mentioned in these regulations.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000036"></a>I had a lot more that I could say, but I do not really want to carry on going through this in detail. I hope that I have made the point that there are inconsistencies in the Statutory Instrument that need to be addressed. These are real concerns to the many enterprises working in this area who may well find themselves on the wrong side of these regulations. I hope that the Minister will be able to satisfy us that his department will be looking at them before they produce the consolidated regulations, which I understand will be early in the new year. I wonder what will be added, amended or deleted, and how easy it is going to be for noble Lords looking at them again to understand them. I hope that the presentation of the new Statutory Instrument will be a good deal more straightforward than the current one.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000037"></a>I hope that I have adequately drawn the Grand Committee's attention to what I see as the arbitrariness in these regulations. My main question is whether the waste directive requires the maintenance of a register of those carrying out exempted waste recovery or disposal operations, because that is a heavy duty that is being imposed on people who are by definition exempted. I have very serious doubts about the ability of local authorities and the Environment Agency to maintain a register in accordance with the terms laid down without having to spend a lot of money, which we know is not there. I have even greater doubts that these regulations actually serve the public interest, but I have no doubt that they will greatly increase the regulatory burden on the vital recycling industry.</p>

It falls to me at very short notice to speak from these Benches, because my noble friend Lord Addington has had to attend to duties in the Chamber. However, I am delighted to do so, because it enables me to do something that I never dreamt I would be able to do, which is to share with  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC86"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>your Lordships a true story. Many, many years ago-about 30 years ago-a very good friend of mine, Mr Roger Hayes, left school and went to work as a horticultural trainee for a London council. One afternoon in the summer he was working away, doing his job in the potting shed, when there was an almighty bang outside the window. He looked out to see flames shooting 30 feet into the air. He dialled 999 and asked for the fire brigade. It was all going very well until the lady from the emergency services asked him what exactly was on fire. He had to confess that some months earlier, the circus had come to town and had gifted to the local authority three tonnes of exotic animal dung. It had rested there in the yard at the park and, over time, the methane within it had accumulated to the point at which it spontaneously combusted and was about to set off another major fire. I think I know how the noble Lord is going to answer about why lion faeces gets a mention in these regulations. That is a true story.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000039"></a>I am delighted to be speaking on these regulations for a couple of reasons, which will become evident in my very short speech. These are the latest in a series of environmental permitting regulations from 2007 and 2009. They are all due to be included in consolidating regulations, and the environment planning regulations 2010 will come into force on 6 April 2010. In fact, these regulations will not come into force until that date, and they will exist in law for only a very short time before they are consolidated into the new regulations.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000040"></a>The Government have failed, despite a great deal of consultation, to reach consensus in two areas that concern us. We are not clear why the Government are insisting on pressing ahead with these regulations four months before they come into force, rather than using the time to make more efforts to find consensus with the operators. The two areas of dispute, as the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said are metal recycling and composting.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000041"></a>It is obvious that both those areas can and must make a major contribution to the objective of a zero-waste economy, as part of the overall strategy of carbon reduction, recycling and waste reduction. It is worth noting that it is 30 years since the Liberal Party, of which I was a member, adopted a policy of zero waste. It is very nice to see other parties slowly catching up with us.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000042"></a>It is equally obvious that inappropriate systems of metal recycling and composting have the capacity to cause real nuisance to residents. No one wants a scrapyard next to their home, and in the case of metals we all know about the problems of theft and illegal trading-for instance, stolen fencing and gully grates. We agree that there is a real need to stamp out illegal operators. The proposal for an enhanced public register of exempt businesses will help with this, but more and better co-ordinated resources by the police and enforcement agencies is also needed. What estimate has been made of the capacity of local authorities to enforce these regulations?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000043"></a>The danger with the regulations as they stand is that they might result in unintended consequences  of less metal being recycled, and they may even  tempt some small businesses on the margins to use the illegal sector.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000044"></a>Composting is a tremendously important subject. I, too, have received the briefing from the Community Composting Network. Community composting schemes, where they exist, provide a means of removing and using vegetable waste in areas where composting would otherwise be impossible or unlikely-in the kinds of urban areas where there are very few gardens, for example. Noble Lords will know that there is a specific campaign in London at the moment targeted at enabling people who have very small gardens, or indeed sometimes just have balconies, to grow more of their own vegetables. Having a resource such as a community composting scheme is very important. I listened very carefully to the Minister's opening speech and I noticed that he talked about commercial-scale composting. I suggest that there is a difference between commercial-scale composting and commercial composting. There are a number of community organisations that encourage composting on a very large scale. They do not do so for commercial benefit; they do so for other good. The Community Composting Network is one such organisation. They are concerned that compliance with a threshold of 10 tonnes of waste at any one time will cause problems for their schemes. They have made the argument for a 50-tonne limit. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister what was the clear evidence-based justification for the Government proposing a limit of 10 tonnes. What efforts have the Government made to draw a distinction between commercial-scale composting by commercial operators and composting by not for-profit organisations?</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000045"></a>It is estimated that the cost of registration, as proposed by these regulations and others, would mean that local community schemes would have to find between £7,500 and £15,000. That is a considerable sum for small community organisations. Even the proposed permit of £1,590 in the first year could be prohibitive and prevent people setting up schemes that we know have an environmental and social value.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000046"></a>I end by making a plea to the Minister to consider whether, given the four months that remain, it might be possible to engage in further discussion about these regulations and to see if it is possible to come to a consensus that would enable schemes which, for all sorts of other reasons, not least their health benefits, we all wish to encourage.</p>

<p><a name="09120967000047"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09120967000095"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> My Lords, I have listened to this, not being part of the Bill team. I have been part of the environment team in the past. We are in Grand Committee and bound by its rules. This is a classic example of legislation that should never have come into Grand Committee. It should have been taken on the Floor of the House in a much more open way. We cannot divide in here and we would have to cause a significant upheaval if we wished to have a Division on this legislation now. Having listened to the wonderful dissection of this legislation by my noble friend and supported in many ways by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, from the Liberal Democrats, I have to ask the Minister to be gracious enough to take this away and do a lot of work with it and give us another opportunity to go through it before it comes to the Floor of the House to be passed, otherwise I believe he will risk losing a Division in the House when it comes back.</p>

<p><a name="09120967000048"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09120967000096"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I hear what the noble Lord has just said. I understand the seriousness with which he approaches these issues, as do we all, but I hope that I am in a position to give such reassurances about the regulations as to make his rather nuclear approach to them seem unnecessary. I hope that he will feel that we have made enough progress, given our consultation in preparing the regulations. We all recognise that what is involved here is a shift of a boundary. As with any boundary, there will always be concern that, just across one side, the case is almost the same as on the other-that is in the nature of the issue. I wanted to emphasise in introducing the regulations that we are concerned both with rationalising the present position so as to exempt that which can be exempted and with environmental objectives, which I think are subscribed to in all parts of the House.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000049"></a>I want to reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, on commercial composting by small community groups. A cost may be involved in applying for the permit, but community groups also have a responsibility for the environment-an issue which I know the noble Baroness holds dear. We need controls to ensure that the environment is protected, because there have been instances where the operations of community groups have produced problems in the local environment; hence the necessity for us to bring them within the framework. I understand entirely the distinction that she made between a commercial operation and a small community group being involved in an activity which has a commercial dimension to it but is on nothing like the same scale. However, there are obligations with regard to the environment in that process, which is what the regulations seek to address.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000050"></a>I am torn between two responses in this speech. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, demanded of me that I make a defence of the principle of the regulations, the importance that we attach to them and the extent to which we have carried out the necessary consultation, yet I heard from his noble friend what he rightly called a precise "dissection" of where explanation is necessary; that is, on almost every page of the regulations. So it is a fairly tough call, but I shall do my best.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000051"></a>I shall give the general proposition, which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, both hinted at and disregarded when he outlined a number of his anxieties about the regulations. The regulations amend those of 2007. The provisions will be incorporated into the regulations of 2000. The mystical inverted commas are there to indicate that they will be included within existing regulations. I assure the noble Lord that, when the consolidated version of the 2000 regulations is available, nearly all his anxieties about text and ease of understanding will be allayed. I have the greatest sympathy with him and commend him on his research-if anyone else helped as well, I hope that he will commend them on behalf of the Committee for their diligent work. The textual complexity reflects the fact that these regulations amending other regulations must be put within that context. That is why some of the difficulties occur, including our dear friends the inverted commas, which are a metaphor for the problem as a whole.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC89"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="09120967000089"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000052"></a>I take the obvious point that the noble Lord made about being unsure what the appropriate authority was and how it was defined in the regulations. However, the appropriate authority is defined in the 2007 regulations, into which these provisions fit. Of course, as he would expect, the appropriate authority is the Secretary of State, or Welsh Ministers in the context of the Welsh provision. That problem obtains right the way through these issues. I shall address his substantive points in a moment. However, he identified the fact that these regulations are far from being a clear read and that one can identify references which are difficult to analyse. I repeat that these are amendments to the 2007 regulations and are incorporated within them. That is why the appropriate authority is not repeated in these regulations because that is incorporated in the ones which clearly identify that authority. I hope he will accept that I am not in a position to dot every "i" and cross every "t" in relation to how these regulations read.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000053"></a>The noble Lord asked a number of important and substantive points, one of which concerned mushroom compost and why it was not included under the exemption operations. Composting operations will be required to be regulated by local authorities through a Part B permit, as is the case now for off-farm commercial composting. We deem that mushroom composting needs to be brought under greater control because of the problems it causes for the environment. We have had complaints about this form of waste and we are responding to them. The noble Lord may say that he has never been upset by mushroom compost in his life. I bow to his experience, which, I have no doubt, is greater than mine. However, I draw deep on my 16 year-old daughter's experience of spending a week on a mushroom farm. She said to Dad, "never again". She made the point that mushrooms were good to eat but were not necessarily the most congenial thing with which to be involved every hour of one's working day. As the noble Lord will appreciate, the problem with compost is that it can lead to persistent complaints from local people. That is why we need regulation.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000054"></a>The noble Lord referred to validity of registration in Regulation 7(2). That gives effect to the three-year registration period for all operations carried on by operators. That is a general basic rule with regard to the operation of the regime. The noble Lord said that Regulation 10 concerned national security. Any person can apply for a direction. There is no particular requirement about who can apply for that. That provision is consistent with all other legislation. He asked about the responsible person on page 7 of the regulations. I understand his point entirely; you name someone and that person leaves the organisation the following day and the business has to inform the authority who the relevant person should be. The reference to the name of the person is merely an administrative concept to provide a contact for queries. It is not part of the information that will appear in the public register, but it is important. It might not be a person. It might be an officer or whatever it is defined, but the noble Lord will recognise that it merely identifies to whom the authority should make the appropriate approach.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000055"></a>I have several other references in great detail here, but they all fall within the broad framework that these regulations must be placed within the context of the 2007 regulations that they are amending. They are nothing more than that and are no more sinister in their drafting. If the noble Lord is saying that he cannot accept this type of drafting for regulations, that would put quite a burden on the Government. If we had to provide with every regulation the finished product of the regulation that we were amending-if that is what is being considered-the person moving the regulation would have to separate the whole time the difference between that which is already law and established and that which is being changed. No Government have done that before. It is an interesting concept but not one that I favour. I have enough problems dealing with regulations on this basis let alone the more onerous one.</p>

That is the whole purpose of the exercise. It would greatly reassure us if we knew that that consolidated statutory instrument could be debated on the Floor of the House. If that were possible, all these matters would be much clearer and noble Lords would have proper control over the finished documents, whereas the Minister has admitted that it is quite difficult for noble Lords to fully understand the implications of everything that is here.</p>

It is difficult to understand, but as I just indicated the only alternative is enormous. Already, at the stroke of a pen and as the result of one phrase, the noble Lord would double the amount of work relating to this particular regulation if every regulation or order that comes before the Committee which amends orders from the past needs to be considered in those terms. I am afraid that no Government would think that that was the way to go about amending. I sympathise with the difficulty and I enormously applaud the rigorous way in which he sought to overcome those difficulties and identify the real issues as well as the drafting ones. But if he will forgive me, I will ask him to accept the drafting and I will try to deal with the real issues.</p>

<p><a name="09120967000058"></a>The noble Lord mentioned the thresholds for anaerobic digestion. The limit was developed in conjunction with the National Farmers' Union and the biogas industry and is deemed to be an appropriate threshold for small-scale on-farm biodigestion. That is an agreed position with the interests concerned.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000059"></a>I was asked why plant tissue waste is included in the inert waste section. The waste type issue will be subject to review and, if deemed necessary, we will amend that at the earliest opportunity. The noble Lord has a point there. We may need to reconsider that. On the issue of plant codes, the references on codes are set out in the list of waste regulations. Again, I agree with the noble Lord. The problem is one of cross-referencing. That is the difficulty. There is nothing more sinister to it than that.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000060"></a>The noble Lord asked about the difference between the two concepts of tyres, the different forms of storage and why they had different limits attached. The tonnage

They are stored in different ways and are intended to be used in different ways. That is why, in certain circumstances, one has to have limits of 50 tonnes and 40 tonnes in the regulations.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000061"></a>The noble Lord asked a general question about quantities, and the noble Baroness identified a particular dimension on which, as she rightly indicated, I do not have much experience. For the most part, the quantities have been arrived at following assessment of the risk and discussion with businesses that carry out the activity. We have exemptions from European law, and are much more flexible than it might have directed. One of the advantages of the way we have gone about this is the flexibility, but we have to stipulate maximum quantities under that law, and that is why these figures are there. There is bound to be a certain arbitrariness about that and it is, of course, bound to be a matter of judgment.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000062"></a>On access and security, all page 14 does is set out a definition of what is secure for the purposes of interpreting storage conditions. On waste not produced at the plant, which is covered on page 18, to which the noble Lord drew attention, I emphasise that this exemption is to enable water treatment plants to reseed the treatment process. To do that effectively, they need to bring waste in from other plants. The exemption has been developed with the full input of the waste water industry. We have had extended discussions on that. I hope the noble Lord will accept that point.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000063"></a>The waste directive will require the registration to be updated. It will be updated as operators reregister every three years. The noble Lord will recognise that three years is in the regulations.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000064"></a>I hope I have answered the questions that the Committee raised. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, raised broader issues. I need to put them into context. The risk-based approach that we are taking and the environmental principles we have used to determine that operations should or should not be exempt now and in the future have received overwhelming support. I have indicated how narrowly focused these changes are. We believe that the changes to waste exemptions will benefit the industry and regulators and will encourage genuinely low-risk waste recycling and recovery operations. Those who will benefit include a wide range of businesses, particularly the smaller enterprises to which the noble Baroness referred. Our estimate is that these measures will lead to savings of around £255 million over 10 years, which is not a negligible amount. The overwhelming majority of those that are currently exempt from the need for a permit will continue to be exempt, and many others, including some of the sectors mentioned today, will benefit from a new, low-risk exemption that will be free to register.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120967000065"></a>The noble Baroness raised metal recycling. We are aware of the metal recycling industry's concerns that the revised exemption will be onerous for those who will no longer benefit from it and will need a permit. I am aware of the great contribution made by the metals sector and support it wholeheartedly. We have given a commitment to take measures to encourage legitimate

So that is the advantage of the obligation-the information that local authorities collect. We also support this professional industry, and its competence to operate its sites can be demonstrated in a way that is appropriate for it.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000001"></a>Reference has also been made to composting. We have significantly reduced the size, scale and scope of the composting exemption. Unfortunately, many composting sites merit much greater assessment and inspection than is provided under the current exemption. This will rightly lead to commercial-scale operations having to provide some of the same infrastructure and pollution-control measures that other waste treatments are required to meet and reduce the high level of concern surrounding some operations. It will be appreciated that a balance has to be struck between the interests of those who are seeking to increase composting-we all see the value of that-and the fact that there are dangers in local environments from composting that is not regulated, which is why we have put things in a framework.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000002"></a>This has been an intensive debate. I am not sure that I was fully equipped to deal with quite the degree of precision with which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, addressed the regulations, and I congratulate him on the intensity of his scrutiny, but I hope I have done enough to allay his concerns-and, even more, to allay the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. I commend the regulations to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09120977000003"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0006.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09120977000124"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Lord Davies of Oldham):</b> My Lords, this order has already been approved by the National Assembly for Wales.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000004"></a>I begin by putting on the record this Government's strong commitment to the Welsh language. It plays an essential role in Welsh society, and is of course the language of choice for many people in Wales. This LCO is therefore of unique importance, and I am pleased to see a number of noble Lords eager to  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC93"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC93</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>participate in this debate, which follows the scrutiny undertaken in the other place by the Welsh Affairs Committee, by this House's Constitution Committee and by a committee of the National Assembly for Wales. I commend all those committees and those who worked on them for their scrutiny, which has helped to build a broad consensus of support for this LCO.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000005"></a>The Government's approach is informed by four principles: first, that the National Assembly for Wales is the natural home to legislate in relation to the language. It is logical and appropriate for the nation's legislature to be able to pass laws on the Welsh language.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000006"></a>Secondly, the order builds on existing statute in relation to the language and in particular on the Welsh Language Act 1993, with which I know a number of noble Lords here today are more than a little familiar. The Act provided a firm basis for the language to develop, ensuring that organisations providing services of a public nature implemented schemes to carry out some or all of their business in Welsh. These provisions now need updating to better fit with current times, but the order retains the focus of the 1993 Act on key public services provided by public authorities or by private companies.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000007"></a>The third principle, which I believe is crucially important, is that we strike the right balance in going forward between the interests of those whose first language is Welsh, and who wish to conduct their daily lives in that language, and the large majority of people in Wales who do not speak Welsh. That figure, as all Members of this Committee will know, is 80 per cent-a significant number whose interests also need to be considered.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000008"></a>The final principle is that any duties should be applied reasonably and proportionately. The Welsh Affairs Committee in the other place agreed this principle in its excellent scrutiny report. The principle is particularly important in the context of securing the support of business and enterprise in Wales for these proposals. No one would want to see the private sector discouraged from investing in Wales because of burdensome Welsh language duties being inappropriately imposed on business. What is right in respect of a large public authority need not necessarily be right for a smaller private sector company and, recognising the levels of unemployment in Wales, we all know that the Welsh economy needs to encourage as many of those small businesses as it can in those circumstances. What is more, what is right in Meirionnydd may not be right for Gwent, so we have to take those issues into account.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000009"></a>This order is based on clear principles and a common-sense approach to developing the language. Its drafting reflects the real concerns of some about its scope, but at the same time meets the pressures for change. I believe that the order strikes the right balance between the complex and sometimes competing interests which the Welsh language engages. It has ensured a broad consensus on how best to proceed and works in the best interests of everyone in Wales.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000010"></a>The order would allow the National Assembly to legislate to promote or facilitate the use of the Welsh language, and allow the treatment of the Welsh and English languages on the basis of equality. That is based on wording from the Welsh Language Act 1993.  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC94"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC94</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It excludes, as noble Lords will know, the use of Welsh in the courts and prohibits the National Assembly from imposing duties in relation to the Welsh language on any body other than those falling within the 10 categories listed. Those categories include: public authorities; bodies established for specific purposes by royal charter; bodies which receive public money amounting to £400,000 or more in any financial year, and organisations-including private ones-that provide key public services including electricity, gas, water, telecoms, post, bus and rail services. As I indicated, some of those are private, some are public and one or two almost escape definition, but I shall not get into that now.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000011"></a>The order includes a crucial safeguard enabling bodies in those categories to challenge the imposition of Welsh language duties on grounds of reasonableness and proportionality. This is a robust safeguard against any inappropriate imposition of such duties. It ensures that the reasonableness of duties will be a key consideration in developing Assembly measures, and provides an important reassurance against disproportionate obligations being imposed on any body, especially smaller organisations, whether they are charities or companies in business sectors such as mobile telephony or energy.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000012"></a>I believe that this order puts in place a framework for the devolution of powers over the Welsh language to the Assembly which is robust and which provides for a strong and healthy future for the language, building on the achievements since 1993 in a common-sense, evolutionary way to make the language a source of pride for everyone in Wales, whether or not they actually speak Welsh. It provides a firm foundation on which the Assembly Government can build in developing their proposals for an Assembly measure to take forward the language. I hope noble Lords will appreciate the safeguards which are there regarding the proposal and that this, almost above all, ought to be a matter for the Welsh Assembly rather than the UK Parliament to decide, and accordingly I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09120977000013"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09120977000125"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I thank the noble Lord for having presented this statutory instrument as well and as clearly as he has. The Welsh language is a very emotional business, as is the Irish language. I come from Ireland, as most people here will probably know, and I love the Irish language-in the same way as I am sure all Welsh people love the Welsh language. Long may they both live. That is my personal and, I think, my party's stance.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000014"></a>I urge some caution, because this issue has difficulties, pitfalls and costs. I also suggest that, as far as possible, we look at it in a voluntary way. It is absolutely right that the Assembly has the power to do what it will with the language. As the Minister said, there can be no other place to run and manage the Welsh language than the Welsh Assembly. That has to be central to all our thinking.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000015"></a>The Conservative Party has a proud record on the Welsh language. The Welsh Language Act, piloted through Parliament by my noble friend Lord Roberts of Conwy, has done much to generate good will for the language, with the consequence that increasing numbers are using it today.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC95"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC95</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000016"></a>The 1993 Act has always encouraged participation on a voluntary basis. It is applicable to public bodies but other organisations have adopted their own Welsh language schemes.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000017"></a>Although we should not second-guess what the Assembly Government will do with the competence transferred to them, it is clear from the list of bodies that could potentially be subject to the legislation that they intend to extend compliance with Welsh language schemes to bodies other than public bodies. These include gas, water and electricity suppliers, telecommunications companies, bus and railway companies and post offices. It would be a concern if, by imposing duties on such a wide list of bodies, the Assembly Government were to do anything to damage the good will that has developed towards the Welsh language since 1993.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000018"></a>The draft LCO also provides that no duties may be imposed on any person under any legislation that might be brought forward by the Assembly Government under the provisions of the LCO unless there is a means to challenge those duties on grounds of reasonableness and proportionality. That is all very well, but it appears that the LCO contemplates the setting up of a significantly large bureaucracy to administer the Welsh language legislation.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000019"></a>One must also have regard to the current adverse economic climate. Complying with a Welsh language scheme will undoubtedly cost a lot of money. Consequently, the Welsh Assembly Government should be very careful about imposing duties on bodies not currently subject to compliance with Welsh language legislation if to do so would potentially prejudice the viability of an otherwise successful organisation. This is where clear and positive thinking has to be divided from emotion, desire and passion.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000020"></a>The LCO also provides that duties may be imposed on persons providing services to the public who receive public money amounting to £400,000 or more in a financial year. It is unclear how the figure of £400,000 has been arrived at. The figure of £200,000 in the original draft order appears to have been plucked out of the air, and the new figure is clearly simply that previous figure doubled. I am afraid that the Minister is having a busy time with numbers this afternoon but perhaps he can advise us how that figure has been arrived at.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000021"></a>The legislative competence extends also to imposing duties to comply with Welsh language schemes on persons engaged in central banking. Given that there is only one central bank in this country-namely, the Bank of England-it is hard to see why competence should be sought in respect of that body. Perhaps the Minister could explain the reason for including the Bank of England within the ambit of the order.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000022"></a>There is also a significant concern with regard to post offices. Most post offices in Wales are run by sole proprietors or, frequently, husband and wife teams. They are frequently not Welsh-speaking; indeed, traditionally, running a sub-post office has been regarded as a semi-retirement job for people from across the border. It would be unfortunate if the imposition of compliance with a Welsh language scheme were to  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC96"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC96</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>deter such individuals from setting up in business in Welsh villages. It is all very well having an appeals process, but it is unlikely that prospective purchasers of sub-post offices would wish to go through such a process and the very existence of an appeals process might amount to a deterrent.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000023"></a>To summarise, the Welsh Assembly Government should think carefully as to whether, and when, they should impose new duties in respect of compliance with Welsh language provisions. The current legislation has approval and public support. It has made the Welsh language a vibrant part of Welsh national life. The Assembly Government should think carefully before doing anything at all which would damage the good will that the language currently enjoys and which might ultimately prove counterproductive.</p>
<h5><a name="09120977000113"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09120977000024"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09120977000126"></a>Lord Roberts of Conwy:</b> My Lords, this is one of the most extensively considered orders ever to come before your Lordships, as we can see from the excellent Explanatory Memorandum. It has been subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny in the National Assembly and in the House of Commons Welsh Affairs Select Committee and it has been debated in the Welsh Grand Committee. It has had a very full breakfast of consultation and there is probably more to come as Assembly measures based on the order take shape.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000025"></a>All that is entirely appropriate, given that the order will transfer more powers relating to the Welsh language-our most precious possession-from this Parliament to the National Assembly. As a humble promoter of the last Welsh Language Act to pass through this Parliament-the Act of 1993-I am glad that the principles of that historic Act, which has served Wales and the language well for the past 15 years, are to be preserved.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000026"></a>We sometimes forget, under the baleful shadow of the so-called Tudor Acts of Union which discouraged the use of Welsh, just how much this Parliament has contributed positively to the preservation and promotion of the language. It was an Act of 1563, promoted by Humphrey Llwyd of Denbighshire in the Commons and Richard Davies, Bishop of St Davids, in the House of Lords that secured William Salesbury's translation of the New Testament and Davies's own translation of the <I>Book of Common Prayer</I> for use in Welsh churches by 1567. We had to wait a few more years until 1588 for a complete translation of the Bible, by William Morgan, but it stemmed from the same inspirational source. Richard Davies came from the Conwy valley, as did William Salesbury and William Morgan. All were patronised by the Wynn family of Gwydir-no relation to me.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000027"></a>Of course, a number of other important Acts of Parliament have ensured the language's rightful place in court proceedings, for example, and I am glad to see them noted in the Explanatory Memorandum.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000028"></a>The Welsh language is part of British as well as Welsh heritage and has been highly valued as such. In spite of all the consideration that has been given to this order, there are still some potentially controversial issues, as my noble friend Lord Glentoran said, and some could become sore points. But I remind myself  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC97"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that this is a permissive order and that the Welsh Assembly still has to decide precisely how to legislate and whom the legislation will affect within the parameters laid down here.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000029"></a>I understand that the Minister most closely concerned at Assembly level, Alun Ffred Jones, is to hold meetings in different parts of Wales to test people's feelings and to elicit their views and wishes. I shall content myself with uttering a few caveats, because language is a highly sensitive issue and it is easier to offend and antagonise people than it is to please them. Without popular good will and support, progress is impossible. So far, we have been able to nurture and grow that support in Wales and to benefit from it.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000030"></a>Mention is made in the memorandum of a desire to describe Welsh as an "official" language. The matter was debated in your Lordships' House and the other place in 1993 and occasioned Divisions both here and in the Commons. The Government defeated the amendment by a majority of 39 here and 44 in the other place because no one knew what the implications of such a statutory declaration might be. English is not declared to be an official language anywhere in our law, I am told. I would advise those who may be considering reopening that debate to read the parliamentary proceedings in both Houses and to re-examine the arguments for themselves before they step into that minefield.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000031"></a>I am glad that the order is very specific as to the persons who may be affected by having duties laid on them and that there is a right of appeal, with tests of reasonableness and proportionality being relevant. We have to thank the Welsh Affairs Committee for those improvements. The last thing we want in this context is a clutter of objections to requests for language schemes and the whole paraphernalia and bureaucracy of a seemingly endless appeals procedure that is too much in demand and may result in enforcement. The mechanisms of appeal and enforcement have still to be established. Personally, I believe that enforcement is counterproductive and that the language stands to lose more than it has to gain if enforcement becomes the order of the day. Popular support for the language may be seriously eroded and, if that were to happen, it might be difficult to restore the spirit of good will that the language has enjoyed.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000032"></a>The proposed language commissioner will inevitably feature in this sphere, but we know little about his office and functions as yet. I hope that the commissioner will have a constructive role and that people's worst fears will not be realised. The cost of new measures is another factor that will need to be taken into account, especially in the wake of the recession and the cutbacks in spending that will inevitably follow the Government's pledge to halve the deficit. I understand that the Welsh Language Board has a staff of 70 at present. Are increases anticipated? The more persons included in the list, the more civil servants will be needed to supervise them and the greater the direct costs to those having duties imposed on them, their clients and customers. The costs will eventually be loaded on to the public.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000033"></a>I have one final point to make, which concerns translations. Almost all the schemes and duties involve  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC98"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC98</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>translation, which has become an ever more substantial industry since the passage of the 1993 Act. Translation can be costly. Many are asking whether this represents the best use of resources and justifies the increased price of publication. The National Assembly itself has recently been agitated over the issue in connection with its official <I>Record </I><I>o</I><I>f Proceedings</I>. There is no easy answer, but it is an issue that we must be aware of, especially when we include bus and train timetables, gas, water and electricity bills and Post Office matters that may be subject to Assembly measures. I am sure that the Assembly will consider that.</p>

<p><a name="09120977000034"></a>I reiterate that the language is a sensitive and potentially controversial issue. So, too, is legislation in this field. The 1993 Act was voted against at Third Reading in the other place by none other than Plaid Cymru; the Labour Party abstained. Now, 15 years later, I think that both parties would agree that the Act has done a great deal of good, raised the profile of the language and improved its status. There is enthusiasm for it, too.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000035"></a>The language lobby has traditionally been critical of central government, whichever major party was in power. Now its target will be the Welsh Assembly Government in Cardiff, as responsibility for the language has passed to them. However demanding that lobby is, I hope that the Welsh Assembly Government will never forget that you cannot force a language on people and that any progress made in the extension of its use must be because people really want it and regard it as a highly desirable asset for themselves and their children.</p>

Clearly, the noble Lord has outlined a great number of details from his own knowledge and his acute observations on this legislative competence order.

<p><a name="09120977000039"></a>We are considering this LCO and what will occur later with measures concerning the language. I especially welcome it, even though, as we have heard, the process has taken far too long. The order is now on its passage through this House and has been scrutinised in considerable detail, not least by the Welsh Affairs Committee in the other place. The Explanatory Memorandum states that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09120977000107"></a>"The primary purpose of the Draft LCO ... is to provide the National Assembly for Wales with legislative competence in relation to the Welsh language".</p>

<p><a name="09120977000104"></a>I have written beside that: "Big deal!". In Wales, we will be able to legislate much more on the language. To be fair, however, it also says that it will concern the existing functions of Welsh Ministers and the Welsh Language Board, which, as we know, started in 1993.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000040"></a>The world has moved on a lot since 1993, particularly in the educational sector. Many more young people in Wales now speak Welsh. All my grandparents spoke Welsh but, as my family was in proximity to Merthyr Tydfil, much of that language skill was lost for two generations. I can speak some Welsh, and I can understand practically all of it, but I am very pleased to say that all three of my children speak Welsh fluently. That pattern has been repeated across Wales, particularly with the advent of ysgolion meithrin, which enable young children to learn the language at a very early age in preschool, which is when they absorb it like blotting paper.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0006.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000041"></a>The Welsh Not in the 19th century was a terrible thing, but the language survived. It has survived because of the activities of many people. In the 1980s, the 1970s, and even the late 1960s, there was the Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, the Welsh Language Society. It was very unpopular in some places. However, it undoubtedly brought the language to the fore.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000042"></a>The good, detailed work done on the LCO in the National Assembly and here in Parliament by members of the Welsh Grand Committee and the Welsh Affairs Committee in the House of Commons, especially its chairman, Dr Hywel Francis, has made this LCO much more readable and understandable. The process has been long, but it is now much more objective.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000043"></a>In summary, we owe a great debt to those who have gone before us-those of all parties in Wales and those of none. Wales is always at its best when it unites across party divides. As for my own Liberal party, just consider what Lloyd George did to disestablish the church. I think also of my more recent colleagues, Lord Geraint and my noble friend Lord Hooson, not to mention the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies-who, happily, is here today. He has done tremendous work on this. The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, has also taken a great interest. There are others whom we must not forget. The late Gwynfor Evans was a Plaid Cymru leader and a Welsh language campaigner who was prepared to go on hunger strike for a Welsh language television channel-a channel which has ultimately made a huge difference to people in Wales who can now access the language. I was recently talking to someone on the borders of Scotland, the secretary of a rugby club, and the only way he could see his local region play rugby was to watch S4C. Many English speakers who are fond of their national game can also access the Welsh language by this means. It has been a great uniting thing.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000044"></a>This instrument is passing through both Houses in a week when Wales's First Minister, Rhodri Morgan, a great supporter of the Welsh language, is retiring. I thank him, too, for all the work that he has done to promote the cause of Wales and, especially, the Welsh language.</p>

I wholeheartedly agreed with the Minister when he said that if ever there was a devolvable responsibility-that is not how he put it, but that was the thrust of it-that should be transferred as generously as possible to Cardiff, this is it.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000046"></a>Indeed, I doubt whether there can be any challenge to that fundamental reality. There are 20 headings in Schedule 5 to the 2006 Act. Many of those, you might say, are almost exclusively Welsh, but in all those cases, there will be some cross-border effects, some knock-on effects that will not be totally confined to the land and nation of Wales. This is the exception. This is the 20th and this is exclusively a Welsh matter.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000047"></a>I want to disabuse anybody who subscribes to the idea that commitment to the Welsh language is in some way a sentimental or emotional matter. It may very well engender sentiment and emotion, but I would say that it is much more than that: it is a matter of truth and principle. The way that I would put the case would be this: I would say that every language is unique and priceless and part of the patrimony of humankind. That strange scholar, Dr Johnson, said that he was always saddened to hear of the death of any living language. When one thinks of it, every language in the world is a work of genius. Its nuances reflect the hopes, aspirations, fears, attitudes, mores and standards of those people who have spoken it and espoused it. It is as much a work of human genius as the best that has ever come from the hand of the artist, the sculptor or the architect.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000048"></a>It is in that light, I respectfully say, that one has to look at the responsibility of humankind in general for the Welsh language, as it has for every other language, and for the people of Britain in general, let alone the people of Wales. The generality of status is at the basis of our attitude to the language. The Welsh language is one of the oldest spoken languages in Europe. It has existed for about 1,500 years, and has a history that goes back, some say, to an origin as far back as the Himalayas. It is of Indo-European origin. It is a living language, spoken by 500,000 people. As the Minister rightly said, that is only one-fifth of the Welsh people; 80 per cent of them-2.5 million-do not speak it. In my case, it was a pure accident of birth and geography that I speak Welsh, as is indeed the case with one or two other Members of the Committee. I only hope that I would have had the courage and assiduity to learn it otherwise, but it was a fortuitous accident. It is still my main language when I am at home. It is the language in which I live practically the whole of my life when I am at home in Cardiganshire.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000049"></a>Nothing gives me a greater thrill than to hear people who are not Welsh-speaking, but who are members of the Welsh nation, refer to the Welsh language as "our language". That is the attitude that will gives the Welsh language a possibility of remaining a vibrant, living thing in British life. The language has enjoyed a renaissance over the past 20 to 30 years, but its life is far from safe. The pressures on it are very considerable and only our best efforts will safeguard it. So if one lays down any conditions that stultify that   


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC101"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC101</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>possibility, one is doing the language a great disservice. There is a school of thought that says, "Well, you can make all the pious declarations you like in relation to the Welsh language. You can weep oceans of sentimental tears, but you shall not spend a penny of public money and you shall not place a single imposition on anyone. You shall not impose any burden that makes life even marginally more difficult for businessmen". Saying that effectively writes "finis" to the life of the Welsh language. I am not suggesting that such a case has been deployed in the Committee today, but it is essential to remember that if we want a priceless treasure of humankind to remain, we have to pay for it. One appreciates how difficult it is to preach a sermon like this in the strained financial circumstances that exist at the moment, but it is right to remember the central reality of the situation.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000050"></a>On the content of this legislative competence order, I appreciate that it is very much the product of a compromise, but so many things in politics and in life are. For myself, I would probably have wished for a somewhat more adventurous approach than this, but we have to achieve the fine balance referred to by the Minister and the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Roberts. It is very much a matter of balance. However, if on the one hand there is stodgy, unimaginative passivity, you will achieve nothing. You might as well say right now that we will let the Welsh language go. On the other hand, an overly aggressive and adventurous approach may create a wholly counter-productive situation.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000051"></a>No Act of Parliament or piece of delegated legislation can of itself save a language. All that statutory provision can do is create the conditions that make it possible for a language to thrive better than it would have done had one not resorted to the provision. It is on that basis that this matter takes the situation forward a little from the 1993 Act, which I regard as a very important milestone in the journey of the Welsh language through life. I appreciate that it gives quite substantial powers to the Assembly, which I am sure it will use sparingly and reasonably, bearing in mind all the time that goodwill will be the oxygen of life for Welsh in the years to come.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000052"></a>The one matter I would contend with is this. Nothing that we are doing today creates any legislation at all. If this order passes through the House of Lords without challenge, as I hope it will, all we will have done is peg out an area. It is for the Welsh Assembly to build a legislative edifice upon it. If the Assembly has no plans to start on that edifice soon, then this exercise will have been useless. However, I am sure that that is not the case and that the Assembly has plans that one trusts will be brought to fruition in the near future.</p>

However, I have one or two caveats-to which I will come-but I begin by paying tribute to the signal contribution of the teachers in the Welsh-medium schools, in particular, and the voluntary teachers in  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC102"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC102</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the nursery schools. Their contribution has been invaluable. The status of the language has been strengthened immensely since the passing of the Welsh Courts Act 1942 and, subsequently, the Welsh Language Act 1967, which was presented by the late Lord Cledwyn. Then, of course, came the important Welsh Language Act 1993, which was the creation of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000054"></a>When I look at the Welsh language scene in the round, three things stand out. First, more and more precise Welsh speakers in Wales are now demanding the right to live a full life through the medium of Welsh. This is fairly new. Indeed, I can recall how I avoided using the term "right" for many years because I thought it would be difficult to attain a consensus on that basis. However, I have come round to the view that there is a growing consensus in Wales that we ought to be constructing a framework of facts. Secondly, the Welsh language domains in north Wales and west Wales, which have been one of the most valuable assets of the Welsh language, but not the only one, are shrinking rapidly, with adverse consequences which we may not be able to assess fully. Thirdly, while the Welsh-medium schools-in south-east Wales in particular- are over-subscribed, with huge support from parents who are non-speakers but wish their children to have access to their linguistic heritage, it is an immensely difficult task to ensure that Welsh is a living language beyond the school yard. It is a daunting task which confronts us.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000055"></a>I am deeply appreciative of the time and resources given by the members of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee to the examination of the draft order. However, I must confess that I am confronted by a dilemma. I wonder whether the order has been over-scrutinised. On the other hand, I am bound to accept that its drafting has been improved as a result. In that difficulty, I content myself by saying that there is a special art to translating the language of politics into the language of Government and legislation, and it cannot be acquired overnight. The Welsh Assembly Government may wish to look at some of the difficulties-perhaps in their departments, perhaps in their legislative procedures-and if there are such difficulties, consider how to improve them.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000056"></a>I turn briefly to my two main caveats about the order. I regret-this will come as no surprise to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy-that the phrase "official status" is not included in the document. I am aware that it has been claimed since the passing of the 1993 Act that the principle of equality of the two languages embodied in that Act confers the status of official language on the Welsh language. If that is the case, why not enact the principle in a declaratory statement? I am pretty confident that this issue will not go away, but I am concerned that more of our young people may sacrifice their careers in order to achieve that objective.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000057"></a>My second caveat arises out of the appearance of the word "freedom" rather than "rights" in Matter 20.2. "Freedom" is a novel word in Welsh language legislation. It is not defined in the interpretation clause. Moreover, I understand from our human rights lawyer that the word is threadbare of meaning in the context  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC103"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC103</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of this legislation. Interestingly, what the Welsh Assembly Government Minister for Heritage said in evidence to the Welsh Affairs Committee on 27 April suggested very strongly to me that he was not particularly enthusiastic about the terminology-references may be found in Questions 294 and 332 of the oral evidence. What is required is a carefully drawn framework of rights for the users of the Welsh language, rather than the vague concept of,</p>
<ul><a name="09120977000109"></a>"freedom of persons wishing to use the Welsh language".</ul>
<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000058"></a>Notwithstanding the caveats that I and others have, this is an important order, which will facilitate the continued regeneration of the language upon the path which began in 1942.</p>

<p><a name="09120977000059"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09120977000132"></a>Lord Jones:</b> My Lords, in 1974 the special adviser to the Secretary of State for Wales, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, was the noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies. It might be said that his service to the Welsh language has been a life's work. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, rehearsed the difficulties, pitfalls and costs of the order. I acknowledge the distinguished role in the governance of Wales of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy. He was right to emphasise the great consequences of Bishop Morgan's Bible. Certainly in the 16th and 17th centuries there were no referendums and no prolonged consultations. The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, said that the Welsh Not was a terrible thing, and he has an insight into our social and cultural history when he says that. I thank the Minister for his masterly opening. He trod carefully and had his brief at his side.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000060"></a>Here is history in the formal and simple words of the order: "Constitutional Law", "Devolution", "Wales" and "2009". Those words are in the context of the speeches that have been made before my own humble words. With regard to context, as a humble Minister in the Wilson and Callaghan Administrations from 1974 to 1979, I had responsibility for the Welsh language in what was the original Welsh Office formed by Prime Minister Harold Wilson. When it was established in 1964, the Welsh Office was led by the first Secretary of State, the bilingual James Griffiths, who in the Attlee Government initiated the National Insurance Act. My reaction is to say that from little acorns do great oaks grow.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000061"></a>For a Minister 35 years ago, it was a difficult brief. The Government of the day, with no or very little majority, were harassed politically by Welsh nationalists and others, and the language and road signs were often in the front line of political skirmish and battle. Astonishingly, today in the 21st century the Welsh Assembly Government are a coalition of Labour and nationalists. I think that they are because today there is to be a new leader of the Welsh Assembly Government and, one anticipates, a new Government, perhaps with different personnel.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000062"></a>My summary is that one can only wish the order well and acknowledge that it is historic-the story of the language of our nation in modern times. Perhaps the Minister will write to me with a considered reply if he cannot give detailed responses today to my brief questions.</p>




<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC104"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC104</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="09120977000116"></a>7.30 pm</h5>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000063"></a>First, what was in the Wales-wide consultations? What was the stance of the Wales CBI? Is there, according to the CBI, a consequence for the small and medium enterprises where the order is concerned? It looks to be positive in paragraph 7.15 of the Explanatory Memorandum. Secondly, as a consequence, will there be a further impact on our universities? I should declare my interest as a university chancellor.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000064"></a>Paragraph 7.1 is more than interesting. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09120977000108"></a>"The Welsh language is one of the defining characteristics of the UK's cultural heritage and an essential component of the everyday lives of",</p>

<p><a name="09120977000105"></a>580,000 Welsh speakers in Wales. That is very bold and very truthful. Paragraph 7.2 is equally interesting. It refers to ensuring,</p>
<ul><a name="09120977000110"></a>"that the language can continue to be a prominent and vibrant part of people's everyday lives".</ul>
<p><a name="09120977000106"></a>Surely, it must be that. These are powerful statements. On reading paragraph 7.10, I conclude that in later years more legislation will be required. I wish to be brief, but I say again that I wish the order well.</p>

<p><a name="09120977000065"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09120977000133"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate, although there is a somewhat obvious diversity of contribution between the eloquence we would expect from those whose natural language is Welsh but who were speaking in English and some more prosaic questions to which I have to address myself. I pay tribute to not just the emotion but the love of language, and of the Welsh language, that has been expressed in this Committee. We all appreciate those who have spoken with such passion. Of course, my noble friend Lord Prys-Davies has done so much with regard to the language since he has been at Westminster. We very much appreciate that he is able to make his contribution today.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000066"></a>I shall address myself in a moment to the caveats, but, first, I pay tribute to the work that has been done and to others. In that context, the progenitor of the 1993 Act is here. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, has seen the development of the legislation which he introduced and then piloted through, and we pay tribute to that.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000067"></a>As to the prosaic questions, the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, will never let me get away with just rhetoric. So I shall address myself to his question. Let me emphasise that I do not think that costly bureaucracy will be set up by the Assembly of Wales, to which we devolved this issue. As was rightly said by the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, this is an enabling measure. It is for the Assembly to decide what must be developed in law. I assure the Committee that it is for the Assembly to address itself to any attendant costs of the legislation that it puts forward, but I do not anticipate huge costs. It is already making plans and, if this measure goes through, knows what it wants to do. It knows that it wants the establishment of a commissioner and an enforcement regime to accompany any imposition of duties, but these do not need to be costly. There has to be some enforcement regime, not because we think that the development of the language will depend on   


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC105"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC105</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>legal enforcement, but because there is no point at all in passing a law that regulates if one cannot enforce its prescriptions. There is an element of cost, but that is a matter for the Assembly to decide.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000068"></a>The other matter on which the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, expressed anxiety was the CBI. The CBI has expressed its enthusiasm and commitment to this measure. It clearly identified the obvious issues that the Assembly should not inhibit business, particularly in these circumstances where we want to encourage business in Wales. That would be the judgment of the Welsh Assembly with regard to the issue. Who better to make those judgments? All that I can testify to the Committee today is that the Welsh CBI has looked at the matter and welcomed it, knowing that the Assembly will ensure that the measure will not inhibit the development of business.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000069"></a>As to whether £400,000 was a figure pulled out of the hat, it is a figure that indicates that the organisations have to be in receipt of a significant amount of public money to come within the scope of the order. Otherwise, the great danger would be that we would be making regulations for organisations of the most modest kind. No, this is an issue for large and significant organisations. Public bodies come within its scope and bodies that receive £400,000 per annum. In a sense, any figure is drawn out of a hat, which I think is the phrase used by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. It is bound to be, but it is the question of judgment about the size of the organisation that needs to be considered. That is the basis of that figure.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000070"></a>Post offices are already subject to the Welsh language scheme under the 1993 Act, as the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, would remind us. If anybody considered the imposition of duties on them unreasonable or disproportionate they could certainly challenge that, including individual post offices or entire organisations. The whole Post Office could do the challenging. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, can rest assured on the particular point that he identified about those who take up their retirement serving in Welsh post offices. I thought that our greatest concern was the persistence and survival of Welsh post offices, rather than who ran them. However, he can accept reassurance on that.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000071"></a>On a general point, the Assembly must exercise its judgment on the impact of its legislation on private companies. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked about the Bank of England, which brought me up with a jolt as I had not briefed myself intensively on its role in this context. The Bank of England, like the Post Office, is subject to the Welsh language scheme under the 1993 Act. That is why we have to include it within the framework. I should have thought that the noble Lord would regard that as a source of rejoicing-that such an august institution has its role to play with regard to the Welsh language.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000072"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, in accurate terms-and who could be more accurate?-described the significance of the 1993 Act and developments subsequent to that. There is no doubt that this is an important order carrying on the work that the 1993 Act identified.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000073"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, indicated just how fragile language can be through his own family history. We all know that if language is not passed down from one generation to the next, by definition it atrophies and dies. It might have been the case that at one stage, in very substantive parts of Wales, there was a great danger that the Welsh language was declining into insignificance. Perhaps his family history reflects that decline and the resurgence that is a reflection of the developments over the past three decades. We should rejoice in the changes since then to which noble Lords have subsequently paid such testimony. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, for putting this order into context and for emphasising even more than I could the fact that it is for the Assembly to produce the necessary legislation if this enabling order goes through.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000074"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Prys-Davies, made a most eloquent speech about the necessity of ensuring that the language flourishes and develops, given its extraordinarily long history. I am not prepared to accept that the concept of "official" matters a great deal. English is not an official language; there is not a law in England that defines English as official. But if Welsh is equal with English, we have achieved the status that surely guarantees Welsh always to be a very significant part of all public utterances and all bodies in Wales subject to the law. The noble Lord also raised the issue of a right rather than a freedom. It may be a little late in the day for me to get too involved in such philosophical and constitutional matters. The term freedom makes it clear that a person would be free to speak the language and should be able  to do so without interference other than in particular circumstances or specific limitations. A right, however, would enable an individual to call on the state or any other specified body to do something to support his or her right to speak Welsh. When we are talking about a language, surely guaranteeing the freedom is the issue that we are seeking to achieve rather than seeing rights insisted on. After all, that would introduce an element of legalism into the issue, which may not be necessary with regard to the language.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000075"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Jones, asked about the CBI. I hope that I have answered him on that. He asked whether I would write to him; well, I am not going to write to him-I am going to give him the answers now. I have already answered him on the CBI. He asked about education and the universities. Education is clearly in the scope of this legislation; the impact on the universities depends on the legislative Assembly and on the universities. After all, they enjoy considerable freedom in Wales as they do in England. It will be for those institutions to reach decisions, but if the Welsh Assembly does not have the interests of Welsh universities as a high priority, the Assembly would surely be neglectful of education in Wales beyond any conceivable measure.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000076"></a>This has been an inspiring debate, as I thought it would be, about an order which is not a modest order but has a wonderful logic to it, derivative from the 1993 position, the Act and the work that has gone on

The primary benefit of this legislation is to enhance public safety and we believe that it will bring real benefits to hearing-impaired people.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000078"></a>I am sure noble Lords will join me in thanking the Hearing Aid Council for the work it has done in regulating the private hearing aid profession for over 40 years, but now is the time for change. The framework legislation that sets out the powers and duties of the Hearing Aid Council in respect of the regulation of private hearing aid dispensers is outdated. To deliver high-quality services, change is needed and modernisation will prevent gaps in patient safety from occurring.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000079"></a>Noble Lords will be very aware that the background to the proposed transfer of functions stems from the Hampton report in 2005 on regulatory inspections and enforcement. This report called for the merger of the Hearing Aid Council into a new body. After considering the Hampton report's recommendations, the Government reached the view that, in fact, the Health Professions Council was best placed to regulate private hearing aid dispensers.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000080"></a>The Health Professions Council, established in 2001, has a modern legislative framework. It already successfully regulates 14 other health professions. It has more comprehensive powers and duties than the Hearing Aid Council, which will enhance protection to patients and the public.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000081"></a>The transfer of the register of private hearing aid dispensers to the Health Professions Council will deliver real benefits for everyone concerned. Private hearing aid dispensers will benefit from a considerable reduction in their annual registration fee, from £695 to £76. Employers of private hearing aid dispensers will no longer need to register, as they currently do with the Hearing Aid Council. This will reduce the regulatory burden on businesses and bring them into line with  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC108"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>other employers that are regulated under consumer protection legislation, such as the Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Employers will also make savings as they will no longer have to pay an annual registration fee. The Health Professions Council has significant economies of scale, with over 200,000 registrants, compared with only 1,700 on the Hearing Aid Council's register.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000082"></a>The abolition of the Hearing Aid Council will also achieve the Hampton report's aim of reducing the overall number of regulators. This will result in a small reduction in public expenditure as we will no longer need to support the Hearing Aid Council's running costs. Most importantly, hearing-impaired people will be better protected by a well organised and highly respected regulator with enhanced powers.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000083"></a>At present, the Hearing Aid Council can take action against a practitioner only once harm has actually occurred. However, the Health Professions Council will have the power to remove a practitioner from the register before any harm takes place, on the grounds that a person is likely to present a risk to the public.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000084"></a>The Health Professions Council sets standards of education and training, performance and conduct and is overseen by the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence. The Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence provides external assurance that the Health Professions Council is undertaking its duties effectively through its annual performance review process. In its most recent report, the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence described the Health Professions Council as a transparent, well organised, efficient and cost-effective regulator.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000085"></a>The content of the draft order itself transfers the register of private hearing aid dispensers held by the Hearing Aid Council to the register held by the Health Professions Council; it creates a new offence relating to the dispensing of hearing aids by unregistered persons; it makes provision connected with the abolition of the Hearing Aid Council and the cessation of its functions; and it makes transitional arrangements in respect of uncleared Hearing Aid Council casework at the point of transfer.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000086"></a>The Health Professions Council will, for the first time, protect function as well as title. The title "hearing aid dispenser" will be protected, as is currently the case, but in future, any person not registered with the Health Professions Council who performs the functions of a hearing aid dispenser will also commit an offence. The protected functions will be assessing or testing an individual's hearing, or prescribing a hearing aid for an individual, with a view to supplying a hearing aid for retail, sale or hire to, or for the use of, that individual.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000087"></a>The proposed transfer of the register of private hearing aid dispensers from the Hearing Aid Council to the Health Professions Council will take effect on 1 April 2010. All private hearing aid dispensers on the Hearing Aid Council's register on that date will automatically transfer to the register held by the Health Professions Council. Both the Hearing Aid Council and the Health Professions Council fully support this transfer and are working closely together already to ensure a smooth transition. The Health Professions

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000088"></a>The Department of Health has undertaken a full public consultation exercise on the draft order as required by the Health Act 1999. There were 32 respondents to the consultation and the responses were, in general, overwhelmingly supportive of the proposal. In particular, 97 per cent of respondents-noble Lords can work out how many that is-supported the proposal to transfer the functions of the Hearing Aid Council to another body and supported the Health Professions Council as being the most appropriate regulator.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000089"></a>During the debate on this order in another place there was widespread consensus that the policy of the Health Professions Council regulating private hearing aid dispensers was entirely appropriate. A question was raised about the position of retailers of hearing aids who were not traditionally performing the functions of a health professional. This group of people will not be regulated by the Health Professions Council but are covered by normal consumer protection regulation.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000090"></a>We are grateful for the support given to these proposals by the councils, the professions and all the bodies which have an interest in supporting hearing-impaired people, including the voluntary organisations. These changes bring benefits to everyone and, in particular, the measures will provide improved protection for the hearing-impaired. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09120977000091"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09120977000136"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, the Committee will be grateful to the Minister for introducing the order, which is politically uncontroversial. Indeed, my understanding is-and she has just confirmed this-that it has the full support of all principal stakeholders, including the main voluntary organisations representing deaf people. I am not, therefore, going to spend time talking about it at any length except to welcome its provisions in the round and, more especially, the consequences which will automatically flow from the transfer of regulatory powers from the HAC to the HPC, such as improved public protection, the introduction of fitness-to-practise procedures and the significantly lower retention fees for practitioners. The HPC has proved its worth and its quality as a regulator and the transfer we are approving today has been the subject of considerable thought and consultation.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000092"></a>Besides bringing the regulation of hearing aid dispensers up to date, the order also opens up over the medium term the prospect of regulatory simplification in that it should one day be possible to bring both public and private dispensers on to the same professional register, which they are not at the moment. Indeed, I understand that some NHS audiologists are not regulated at all and that those who are are subject to a mix of statutory and voluntary regulation. That situation cannot be anything other than confusing to the general public. It would be helpful to have the Minister's confirmation that unification of regulation in the sense I have described is, indeed, the Government's intention. I should also be grateful if the Minister would comment on how the Government plan in the future to regulate hearing aid assistance.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000093"></a>Finally, I join the Minister in paying tribute to the Hearing Aid Council for its diligent and conscientious work over the years.</p>

<p><a name="09120977000094"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0008.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09120977000137"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness for introducing the order to the Committee in such a clear and comprehensive way. Like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I do not intend to trouble your Lordships for long. That said, I have indicated on previous occasions that I have a personal interest in this subject, being the child of someone who has been reliant on National Health Service hearing aids for approximately 70 years. Consequently, it has long been my concern that people who are losing their hearing have sometimes gone to the private sector in desperation. There has always been concern about the level of service; by that I do not mean just issuing a prescription but the service provided to people in that situation.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000095"></a>There is real pressure in this area. That pressure may be unique to the field of hearing aids; it does not apply to, for example, optical services. That pressure arises because much of the innovation occurs in the private sector. New technology comes to the private sector long before it comes to the NHS. Therefore, there is a commercial interest behind that. I do not for a moment want Members of your Lordships' Committee to think that I consider private dispensers do not have the interests of their clients at heart, as that is not the case. However, in view of what I have just said, I welcome this measure. I also pay tribute to the Hearing Aid Council for the work that it has done. It is commendable that a body should work so assiduously towards its own demise; that is very generous of it. It is right that the Hearing Aid Council, which did not have fitness to practise powers, should transfer its functions to the Health Professions Council. I noted what the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, said about the challenge that this presents to the Health Professions Council. It has previously protected titles, not functions. The functions that it will have to regulate in future were listed by the noble Baroness: assess, test and prescribe hearing aids. Does that definition include screening? Screening for the hearing impairment of children and adults is carried out in a large number of places and I want to be absolutely sure that those who carry it out are properly regulated. However, I am not clear whether that falls within this definition.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000096"></a>Like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I noted that there is an intention that private and public dispensers will be registered on a single register with a single set of standards. In my view that day cannot come soon enough. Everybody who suffers a hearing loss deserves the very best and consistent treatment. When do the Government envisage that that unification of registration will happen? I understand from the Hearing Aid Council that it is unlikely to happen until 2011, at least, even though the transfer will occur in 2010. I wish to see that development occur speedily. Like all the bodies and voluntary organisations that have worked on the unification, I think this is a very good measure and I wish it good speed.</p>

<p><a name="09120977000097"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09120977000138"></a>Baroness Pitkeathley:</b> My Lords, I am chair of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence, which is keen to ensure that public protection issues are properly dealt with. The CHRE seeks an assurance  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC111"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC111</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>from the Government that the HPC will be required to address, through its appropriate committees, the case of any HAC registrant who currently has a sanction imposed on them. It is important that the HPC committees have the full range of sanctions available to deal with the case appropriately and are not bound to follow the HAC's decisions. This is vital if a new system of regulation for hearing aid dispensers is to offer improved levels of public protection. I therefore want to put a very specific question to the Minister: can she confirm that it is Parliament's view that when professionals transfer from the Hearing Aid Council register to the Health Professions Council register-or, indeed, in any similar situation in the future because I think we are talking about a principle here-it expects the HPC to exercise its judgment in reviewing whether sanctions imposed by the Hearing Aid Council on an individual are adequate for public protection? I also offer my congratulations to the Minister for her speedy, but clear, exposition and to the Hearing Aid Council and the HPC for their work on this.</p>
<h5><a name="09120977000118"></a>8 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09120977000098"></a><b><a name="91209-gc0008.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09120977000139"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I thank noble Lords for their comments and the fact that there is such a welcome for the order. I have had one of the most comprehensive briefs ever-and all excellent stuff. I think that we have been able to find an answer for virtually every question.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000099"></a>The noble Earl asked whether there were plans to regulate any more professions. Indeed, the Health Care and Associated Professions (Miscellaneous Amendments and Practitioner Psychologists) Order 2009 introduced a statutory regulation saying that we would be looking to bring them under the Health Professions Council. A number of groups of healthcare workers are currently not regulated, and we are considering the need to regulate them, and when regulation is justified, identifying an appropriate model of regulation in the light of the recommendations of the extending professional regulation group. That includes hearing aid assistance. The noble Earl also asked about how audiologists could be regulated as a priority. We are consulting on the proposals for healthcare scientists, and we expect to publish the response at the turn of  


<notus-date day="9" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC112"></a><b>9 Dec 2009 : Column GC112</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this year. We published a White Paper in February stating the Government's intention to introduce statutory regulations for healthcare scientists as a priority, and that is what we are pushing forward.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000100"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, asked about screening, which was a perfectly sensible question. I think that I touched on that in my opening remarks. The legislation addresses the functions performed by the registry as assessing hearing, testing and prescribing a hearing aid, so it includes screening. Provided that the screener is not carrying out these functions with a view to the sale, retail or hiring of hearing aids, there will be no need for them to register. We would expect the screening to be carried out in the manner in which it is being done.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000101"></a>On the merging of private hearing aid dispensers, and NHS-associated practitioners undertaking a hearing aid practitioner role being regulated as one professional group, the role is just emerging within the NHS and requires further development, including ensuring that it fits within the overall career framework for healthcare scientists. The new arrangements are being proposed as part of modernising scientific careers, so I do not expect that the timetable will be any faster than the one that the noble Baroness mentioned.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000102"></a>I can confirm to my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley that Article 6(7) of the hearing aid dispensers order will allow the HPC to deal with cases where the HAC has imposed a penalty in any way that it considers fit, and indeed, there will be a complete review of cases to do whatever it considers appropriate. When the functions transfer from one regulatory body to another, it makes sense to have a review process on the sanctions imposed by that transfer. The HPC has confirmed that it will review outstanding cases and those with sanctions internally in the first instance, with the outstanding cases then likely to be reviewed by a panel. It is not anticipating problems. It is meeting the HAC to discuss outstanding cases on a two-weekly basis. We expect the number of cases to be very small indeed.</p>

<a name="91209-gc0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120977000103"></a>I hope that that answers most of the questions. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09120946000009"></a>A meeting of the Education, Youth and Culture Council was held on 26 and 27 November. I represented the UK for the culture and audiovisual section of the council on 27 November.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09120946000010"></a>The council adopted, without further debate, the conclusions on promoting a creative generation by developing the creativity and innovative capacity of children and young people through cultural expression and access to culture.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09120946000011"></a>The proposal for the European Year of Voluntary Activities promoting Active Citizenship (2011) was adopted by the council. The year's aim is to improve the environment for volunteering in the EU, to raise

A budget of €8 million has been allocated for this initiative.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09120946000012"></a>The council adopted the conclusions on media literacy in the digital environment encouraging the promotion of media literacy, including through formal and informal education, to maximise the potential of the internet and minimise possible risks. The conclusions were adopted without further discussion.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09120946000013"></a>There was then a presentation by the Commission on the Google books report. The Commission had strong concerns about the revised Google books settlement, and argued for the development of an EU legal framework on global copyright issues. The Commission encouraged member states to increase the number of EU books being digitised and highlighted that initial findings from the recent consultation on Europeana (the European Digital Library) has shown strong support for the initiative.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09120946000014"></a>A policy debate on the digitisation of cultural content in Europe followed the Commission's presentation. All member states agreed on the importance of fair but user-friendly copyright rules, and the need for EU level co-operation and encouragement. Public/private partnerships were also supported by the majority of member states, with many citing the usefulness of the Arrow project. There was no request for further member state funding for Europeana.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09120946000015"></a>Under any other business, France raised the current financial difficulties faced by cinemas in transferring to digital systems. Slovenia, supported by a number of member states, requested that books written in minority languages should be allowed to have a zero tax rate. The Spanish gave a brief presentation on their forthcoming presidency. An informal council meeting would be held on 29 and 30 March, a seminar on copyright and digital libraries in Madrid on 26 and 27 April, a European cultural heritage conference on 29 April and a conference on the mobility of artists on 25 May in Madrid.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09120946000016"></a>Finally, Austria asked the Commission to explain their proposed next steps following a letter received from Commissioner Reding on the Council of Europe convention on Transfrontier Television. This concerned the legal implications of signing a convention that related to an area of EU competence. The Commissioner argued that the letter merely reflected the current legal reality. The Commission did not want their future right of initiative to be affected by the Council of Europe convention, but agreed that we should co-operate on the basis of complementarity. They did not rule out the possibility that a prior negotiating mandate may be necessary.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="09120946000019"></a><b><a name="91209-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="09120946000039"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> My honourable friend the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09120946000020"></a>Budget 2009 announced that, in order to ensure that the system of pensions tax relief remains fair, affordable and sustainable, tax relief on pension contributions would be restricted for those with incomes of £150,000 and over. This restriction applies to all contributions, including those from employers.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09120946000021"></a>The gap between the announcement and implementation creates a real risk that those affected, or who believe they might be affected, would attempt to forestall the new rules by making large contributions now to take advantage of higher rate tax relief that would not be available to them after April 2011.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09120946000022"></a>To prevent this, at Budget 2009 the Government introduced an anti-forestalling regime. It seeks to enable high-income individuals to continue to receive higher rate relief on pension contributions that they would have made in the absence of the announcement of the 2011 reform, but not on higher contributions prompted by that announcement.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09120946000023"></a>As announced in the 2009 Pre-Budget Report, the restriction of relief from April 2011 will apply to individuals whose income, including the value of any pension benefit funded by (or eventually funded by) an individual's employer, is £150,000 or over. This will be subject to an income floor so that those with pre-tax incomes, excluding the value of any employer contributions, of less than £130,000 are unaffected. So, the restriction will apply to about 2 per cent of pension savers, who currently receive around a quarter of tax relief on pension contributions.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09120946000024"></a>To prevent an estimated £400 million of tax revenues being put at risk before April 2011 by additional forestalling, the Government have today announced that the anti-forestalling rules will be extended to apply to individuals on incomes of £130,000 and over (with income being as defined on the same basis as in the existing anti-forestalling rules), effective from 9 December 2009 and for the remainder of this tax year and next. This will be legislated in Finance Bill 2010 and draft clauses will be published shortly.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09120946000025"></a>Those newly brought into the regime will be subject to the special annual allowance, which remains unchanged. This means that they will continue to receive higher rate relief up to the level of their normal (defined as quarterly or more regular) pension contributions; or the lower of £30,000 and average contributions over the past three years if contributions are less regular than quarterly; or £20,000; whichever is highest. Contributions exceeding these limits made prior to the new rules taking effect will not be charged. Further detail on these provisions is available at <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk">www.hmrc.gov.uk</a>. Around 98 per cent of pension savers will not see their tax relief restricted by these provisions.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09120946000026"></a>The Government believe that this action is necessary, and that a straightforward extension of the current anti-forestalling provisions is the simplest, least disruptive and least burdensome way to achieve this.</p>

<a name="09120946000030"></a><b><a name="91209-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09120946000041"></a>Lord Brett:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09120946000031"></a>The UK has provided £40 million per annum for the past four years to support the United Nations (UN) Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). The CERF provides UN humanitarian agencies with early funding so that they can respond immediately when a crisis strikes. The fund is also able to channel funds to neglected emergencies.</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09120946000032"></a>To date, over US$1.5 billion has been contributed to the CERF by 109 UN member states and 19 private donors, of which the UK is the largest single contributor. During this time, the CERF has committed $1.4 billion to emergency programmes in 71 countries.<b></b>CERF has been an important part of the humanitarian response in nearly every major crisis in 2009. CERF was the top source of funding for five of the six UN emergency appeals launched in 2009; namely, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, Madagascar, Namibia, Burkina Faso, and the Philippines. The top recipients of CERF funds to date have been: DRC ($162 million), Sudan ($102 million), Kenya ($79.4 million) Somalia ($71.3 million), Ethiopia ($69.5 million), Afghanistan ($60.1 million), Sri Lanka ($56.8 million) and Zimbabwe ($52.2 million).</p>

<a name="91209-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09120946000033"></a>CERF has performed well over its first four years of operation. An independent evaluation of the fund in 2008 found that the CERF "has proven itself as a valuable and impartial tool, becoming in a short time-frame, an essential feature of international humanitarian action and complementing other humanitarian financing mechanisms".  The evaluation report concluded that CERF has helped to accelerate humanitarian response and increase the coverage of needs.</p>

These include: use of risk and intelligence information; targeted assurance testing of businesses' systems and procedures; credibility testing of alcohol supply chains; physical checks at revenue traders' premises, including warehouses, wholesalers and retailers; and the use of criminal and civil investigation techniques against the highest risk individuals and businesses.</p>

Many of these discussions are informal and provide a method of seeking advice on the bidding process as well as determining levels of interest. The department does not routinely record informal discussions. However, since November 2007, six formal proposals have been received and were examined in line with departmental guidelines. Recently, defence equipment and support has set up the Defence Suppliers' Service and issued direction and guidance to all Ministry  of Defence directorates on how to handle inquiries of interest and unsolicited bids from commercial  suppliers.</p>

Twenty of them will offer faster decision-making where the UK wants to see better systems in place, for example: aid to disaster zones; protecting British business ideas; strengthening the EU's research and innovation capability; liberalisation of the energy market. Sixteen of these either will not apply to the UK or will apply only if we choose to opt in; for example, in justice and home affairs. Fifteen of them will be purely procedural changes; for example, how we adjust the rules for technical implementing committees. All other areas where unanimity applied under the treaty of Nice will remain unchanged following entry into force of the treaty of Lisbon.

The UK has long been an advocate of the need for NATO's transformation to be a continual process to ensure that the alliance has the right capabilities and structures to meet current, emerging and enduring challenges to its security, including cyber defence. We have, therefore, also urged allies to consider NATO's role in tackling new threats, such as cyber attack, as part of the process of updating its strategic concept.</p>

However, following detailed analysis of all physical evidence and witness statements, all suspects were released as it was assessed that there was insufficient evidence to be reasonably confident that a successful prosecution could be undertaken in either Kenya or (more recently) Seychelles. The subsequent destruction of any pirate equipment and weapons serves as a disruption measure and prevents their future use.</p>
