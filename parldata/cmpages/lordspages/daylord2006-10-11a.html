fighting immediately. The Government must also accept a UN force for
Darfur and the bolstering of the African Union force until the UN can
arrive and they must restart the political process with the
non-signatories to the Darfur peace agreement. We are urging

villages in Darfur destroyed by the National Islamic Front
regime&#146;s genocidal policy, does he agree that the time has now
come for the consideration of serious measures, such as targeted
sanctions or the refusal of visas to the regime&#146;s
representatives, instead of, as at the present moment, giving
invitations to the chairman of the Khartoum Stock Exchange, who is in
London at the invitation of the Foreign Office? How long are this

that there will be a need for further consideration of further
sanctions against a wider group of people. The other critical issue has
been to establish a viable African Union force to keep the peace, as
far as that is possible, across Darfur. On20 September, that
process looked impossible, but it had been achieved, at least in
outline, by the end of that week. That force has to be capable of doing
the job of protecting the people of Darfur until the United Nations can
take over the responsibility, as it must.</p><p><a name="06101153000017"></a><a name="spnew_4"></a><b><a name="_spnew2"></a><a name="06101153000341"></a>Lord

for their citizens, are bent upon encouraging the most appalling
atrocities and are continuing to do so in defiance of world opinion? Is
it not indeed time that very much firmer sanctions were mobilised
against the Khartoum Government and more were pressed for in the United
Nations? What will happen when the African Union mission ends, which is
any day now in September and October, when the UN mission will come, at
the earliest, in January? How will the killing going on in the mean

sake of clarity, the agreement that was reached with the African Union
in New York, to which I was a party, means that its mandate has been
extended until the end of December with a significant improvement in
United Nations assistance. I can say from overnight discussions that
there has been agreement with, at least, President al-Bashir about what
the United Nations&#146; additional assistance should be. That is a
small step
forward.</p><p><a name="06101153000019"></a>I do
not dissent at all from the view that there are the most serious crimes

entered into, but it is also true that rebel groups are killing widely.

them all to sign the peace agreement, from which many absented
themselves.</p><p><a name="06101153000020"></a><a name="spnew_7"></a><b><a name="_spnew3"></a><a name="06101153000343"></a>Lord

Lords, do the Government agree with the analysis of the International
Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty in 2001 that the
primary responsibility for protecting human rights lies with the
Government concerned, that if the Government fail to discharge that
responsibility it passes to the Security Council and that if the
Security Council fails adequately to act, the question arises of
whether the greater harm lies in the damage to international order of
bypassing the Security Council or in the slaughter of human beings
while the international community looks on? If the third of those
situations arises, does my noble friend agree with Mr Kofi Annan that
not even the principle of national sovereignty can protect crimes
against
humanity?</p><p><a name="06101153000021"></a><a name="spnew_9"></a><b><a name="06101153000344"></a>Lord
Triesman:</b> My Lords, in the
meeting that preceded the United Nations General Assembly last year,
the world community agreed that a responsibility to protect should be
part of the operating code of the United Nations. That means that the
first responsibility is with the government concerned and then it
passes, irrespective of sovereignty, to the international community. In
Security Council Resolution 1706, drafted by the United Kingdom, that
is explicitly written into the terms of the decision by the Security
Council, taken without a vote against and with three abstentions. In
the final analysis, the Security Council&#151;and the United
Nations&#151;will be tested by whether it takes that responsibility
seriously with the full implications that it
bears.</p>

have seen President Obasanjo&#146;s reference to impending genocide
and his offer of additional Nigerian troops for the African Union
force. In view of the implacable refusal by Khartoum to allow the
United Nations to take over the operation, will the international
community do better to concentrate on AMIS Plus, with the possibility
that the UN might lend military units to AMIS, and more robust rules of
engagement so that it can adequately protect the civilian

position is that the United Nations needs to take over this operation,
but the fact is that there would be an interregnum&#151;and there
would have been one from the end of December through to 1 January if
AMIS had not been prepared to step in with additional assistance, as I
said a few moments ago&#151;from the United Nations. Bolstering that
force should be done in a way that is compatible with a transition to
UN. I believe that the international community has an obligation to put
all pressure on the Government of Sudan to agree to a UN force, and all
pressure on the other rebel groups to sign the peace treaty, which they
could have signed several months ago and spared many thousands of
lives.</p><p><a name="06101153000024"></a><a name="spnew_12"></a><b><a name="_spnew5"></a><a name="06101153000347"></a>The

and I will give some examples from both an operational and an equipment
standpoint. What we are doing operationally today in Baghdad and
Basra&#151;Operation Sinbad&#151;is a
neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood clearance of the sectarian killers, with
reconstruction on a neighbourhood basis, which is having real success.
The chair of the Basra security council, Hammadi, has been out on the
streets with the local press, pointing out what has been done to
develop local schools. On equipment&#151;just to give one
example&#151;improvements in the accuracy of our munitions to reduce
collateral damage and investment that we have put into communications
have had a big impact on the effectiveness of our operations, which has

Soley:</b> My Lords, I am not sure that the Minister
can answer this, but I shall ask it nevertheless. Is it not common
sense and common knowledge to most of us now that Iraq will go down in
history as an example of how to win a war and lose the subsequent
peace? That happened because when Colin Powell was talking about the
post-conflict situation, he was increasingly marginalised and power
went to Donald Rumsfeld, with the result that there was no
post-conflict plan in operation, which left us very exposed in the
south of Iraq. We have all paid a very high price for that. That is the
lesson, and it is a very important one, not least because there will be
other times when we have to intervene, as the previous Question
exemplified.</p><p><a name="06101153000035"></a><a name="spnew_23"></a><b><a name="06101153000358"></a>Lord

face in Iraq today. Concern is mainly focused on the difficulties that
we have in the cities, primarily Baghdad but also Basra. It is correct
to say that we had a successful operational campaign in March 2003,
which we expected more rapidly to become a peacekeeping operation; we
did not expect to have an extended counter-insurgency operation such as
we have been faced with. However, we are responding to that from the
lessons that we have learnt on the ground and we are seeing progress in
the reconstruction effort. A million people in Basra now have
electricity and water 24 hours a day. That was not the case a year ago,

seen that that has worked. This summer, two provinces have been
successfully handed over to the Iraqi security forces. We hope that the
situation will allow us to hand over a third province. However, the key
is the progress that we are able to make in Basra and Baghdad. That is
where the main challenge is and that is where we are focusing our
attention, but our strategy has not changed. We are following a clear

elections and the establishment of a constitution. There is no doubt
that the Iraqi people want the country to progress but, as has been
said, there is tremendous sectarian violence between the Sunnis and the
Shia. We have to stick with this. We have seen progress in a number of
provinces. The main area of difficulty is within the cities. We have a

anything that the Security Council deemed appropriate. If it is
introduced, I would hope that it would be sufficiently robust to do the
job properly. On the second question, which requires some comment, the
mandate that the AMIS force has in Darfur could and should have been
used far more extensively than observation. At the beginning it

vaccine started in September. By the end of November, 13 million doses
will have been delivered to GPs. This represents nearly 90 per cent of
the total available vaccine. A further 2 million doses will be
delivered by the end of December, making more than 1 million more doses
available than were used last year. The UK Vaccine Industry Group has
informed us that 97 per cent of influenza vaccine is provided for the

&#163;15, can he assure us that GPs will receive these important
vaccines? I declare an interest as my local GP has not yet received
them. Can the Minister again state that the Government&#146;s

have already exceeded the 75 per cent vaccination of high risk groups
which the World Health Organisation recommended for 2010&#151;they
did it last year, and we are continuing along that path. It is for GPs
to order their vaccines from the supplier; they do not do it through
the Department of Health. As I said, a maximum of 3 per cent is
available for private sales, which is meant to ensure that high risk
groups for vaccines go to their GPs for
vaccination.</p><p><a name="06101153000057"></a><a name="spnew_45"></a><b><a name="_spnew19"></a><a name="06101153000380"></a>Baroness

Why does there seem to be, for GPs in their practices, always a
shortage at this time of year? This is not the first time that we have
heard that there has been private supply available when some NHS
practices have not had it. Perhaps the Minister can explain why we
cannot get vaccines to GPs faster.</p>

the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton. That is a great
name, but the name &#147;The Lord Chancellor&#148; is an even
better one. I wonder why it is that these things have slipped. When I
raised the issue before, the noble and learned Lord said that he would
consider it. I suppose he probably gave it 30 seconds of his
consideration because obviously it has not made much difference. Would
he be kind enough to say that he did consider it and that, owing to an
oversight, it has been put down in the name &#147;Lord Falconer of

considered whether the Motion should be in name of the Lord Chancellor,

it is something that I do as Lord Chancellor. Therefore, ever

amendment would remove &#147;or

basis of my argument is that threatening a superior officer and being
disrespectful to a superior officer are two entirely disparate
situations. The huge distinction between making a threat and being
disrespectful is recognised by subsection (4), which provides for a
maximum of 10 years&#146; imprisonment 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_260"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for the former offence but only two years for the latter one. My
objection to the word &#147;disrespectful&#148; is that it is so
wide that it could cover anything that an officer believes to be
disrespectful to him&#151;dumb insolence, walking away, muttering
under the breath and so on. It lacks clarity and could lead to
differing decisions depending upon the make-up of the court martial
court. Indeed, the Joint Committee on Human Rights was concerned to
seek from the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, a definition of
&#147;disrespectful&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101153000087"></a>Another
problem is that there is no statutory defence. It is very interesting
to compare this provision with Article 89 of the American Universal
Code of Military Justice, which creates a similar offence, but
separately from that of being threatening. The code defines the offence
in this way:</p><ul><a name="06101153000291"></a>&#147;Any person
subject to this chapter who behaves with disrespect towards his
superior commissioned officer shall be punished as a court-martial may
direct&#148;.</ul><a name="06101153000281"></a>But, unlike
this proposed legislation, it contains a definition of
&#147;disrespect&#148;:<ul><a name="06101153000292"></a>&#147;Disrespectful
behavior is that which detracts from the respect due the authority and
person of a superior commissioned officer. It may consist of acts or
language, however expressed, and it is immaterial whether they refer to
the superior as an officer or as a private individual. Disrespect by
words may be conveyed by abusive epithets or other contemptuous or
denunciatory language. Truth is no defense. Disrespect by acts includes
neglecting the customary salute or showing a marked disdain,
indifference, insolence, impertinence, undue familiarity or other
rudeness in the presence of the superior
officer&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101153000088"></a>Your Lordships
may appreciate my comment that &#147;disrespectful&#148; is an
extremely broad idea. There is in the American code, however, a special
defence:</p><ul><a name="06101153000293"></a>&#147;A superior
commissioned officer whose conduct in relation to the accused under the
circumstances departs substantially from the required standards
appropriate to that officer&#146;s rank or position under similar
circumstances loses the protection of this article. That accused may
not be convicted of being disrespectful to the officer who has so lost
the entitlement to respect protected by Article 89&#148;.</ul><a name="06101153000282"></a>Your Lordships may
feel that that is a very sensible, special statutory defence.
Furthermore, unlike the two-year period of imprisonment that is the
maximum for the offences suggested in the Bill, the maximum punishment
in America is a bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and
allowances and confinement for one
year.<p><a name="06101153000089"></a>Disrespect is a concept
that ought not to be linked as a criminal offence with threatening
behaviour, which of course is very serious. I cannot think of any
instance of being disrespectful which would not be covered by the
familiar offence repeated in Clause 19 of
conduct,</p><ul><a name="06101153000316"></a>&#147;prejudicial
to good order and
discipline&#148;</ul><a name="06101153000283"></a>which,
incidentally, carries exactly the same penalty. But case law on conduct
prejudicial to good order and discipline allows a defendant to argue
that he spoke the truth or that his offending words or gestures were
not prejudicial to good order and discipline.
<p><a name="06101153000090"></a>I am indebted to Mr
Gilbert Blades, a very experienced solicitor-advocate in this field,
for his recollection of a case in which a sergeant called the
regimental sergeant-major&#146;s argument at a sergeants&#146; mess
a load of &#147;unparliamentary language&#148;. I will not give
your Lordships the precise terms. The sergeant was charged with conduct
prejudicial to good order and discipline,

argument had indeed been a load of unparliamentary
language.</p><p><a name="06101153000091"></a>The purpose of the
amendment is to separate the offence of being
&#147;disrespectful&#148;; at the very least it should be clearly
defined, and a special defence similar to that set out in the United
States statute should be incorporated in it. But since that would take
some drafting, I will leave it for a later stage of the Bill. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101153000092"></a><a name="spnew_64"></a><b><a name="_spnew27"></a><a name="06101153000399"></a>Lord
Kingsland:</b> We have some sympathy with the
proposal by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, but I want to be
clear about its exact nature. The amendment seeks to remove the word
&#147;disrespectful&#148; from the Bill altogether. We are not
sympathetic to that; we believe that it has a place in military law.
Respect for the commission, and everything that derives from that, is a
key part of discipline in our Armed Forces.</p><p><a name="06101153000093"></a>The amendment severs
&#147;disrespectful&#148; from &#147;threatening&#148;, but
does not seek to replace the word in any part of the Bill. Having
listened to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, I sense that his
rather thorough exegesis of the American law suggests that he might be
prepared to entertain the reintroduction of
&#147;disrespectful&#148; in some other part of the Bill if it
contained both a careful definition and a statutory defence. I see the
noble Lord nodding, so that is clearly the direction in which he is
going.</p><p><a name="06101153000094"></a>Perhaps I may
respectfully suggest to the Minister that the proposal of the noble
Lord, Lord Thomas, as he outlined it, is worthy of serious
consideration by the Government. We would need to think carefully about
it; but we would not be in favour of removing altogether the concept of
disrespect.</p><p><a name=""></a>Serving in the Armed Forces is unlike
any other activity. The notion of respect for superior authority is
absolutely vital to operational effectiveness in the field. The notion
of disrespect is a component of it. However, the noble Lord, Lord
Thomas of Gresford, has rightly raised an important point and we look
forward to hearing the Minister&#146;s
reaction.</p><p><a name="06101153000095"></a><a name="spnew_65"></a><b><a name="_spnew28"></a><a name="06101153000400"></a>Lord
Borrie:</b> I felt a great deal of sympathy with the
words of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, except on two
matters. If my recollection is right, he said that
&#147;disrespectful&#148; could include what a superior officer
thought was disrespectful. Clause 11 is sufficiently objective, as it
states that a person commits an offence if his behaviour
&#147;is&#148; threatening or disrespectful. The mere subjective
view of a superior officer would not be
sufficient.</p><p><a name="06101153000096"></a>The second point on
which I quarrel slightly with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, is in his
reference to Clause 19, which sets out the familiar offence of doing
something which is prejudicial to good order and service discipline. I
recollect that the phrase was &#147;military discipline&#148; in my
day, but it is the same thing and the offence is enormously wide in
scope. However, I notice that Clause 19 states that an offence is
committed only if a
person,</p><ul><a name="06101153000317"></a>&#147;does an act
that is prejudicial&#148;.</ul>

disrespect given by the noble Lord under Clause 11, which included
words which were disrespectful, would not be covered by the existing
Clause 19.<p><a name="06101153000097"></a>However, the noble
Lord&#146;s nod in response to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland,
indicated that he does not want just to be negative and to delete
&#147;disrespectful&#148;, but, ideally, would wish&#151;perhaps
it is more appropriate for the Minister to do it than him&#151;to
introduce a separate clause as an amendment so that there is a clear
distinction between &#147;threatening&#148; and
&#147;disrespectful&#148;. I entirely agree with the argument of
the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, that it is not appropriate to include in
the description of the same offence those two, very disparate
matters.</p><p><a name="06101153000098"></a><a name="spnew_66"></a><b><a name="_spnew29"></a><a name="06101153000401"></a>Lord

that ethos is to make clear the need for respect towards a senior to

&#147;disrespectful&#148; is not a problem, because all members of
the Armed Forces are given clear training in how to address their
superiors and how to behave towards them. In this context, what amounts
to &#147;disrespectful&#148; within the ethos of the Armed Forces
is
clear.</p><p><a name="06101153000100"></a>Therefore,
the concern that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has relating
to the word being too broad and not defined is not in practice an issue
that would cause us a problem. We recognise that there is a judgment to
be made on the maximum sentence of 10 years, which is a reduction from
an indeterminate period of imprisonment in these circumstances, and we
think that 10 years is
appropriate.</p><h5><a name="06101153000327"></a>3.45

Amendment No. 37 seeks a belated response from the Government. My
honourable friend the Member for Aldershot in Committee in another
place was promised a note clarifying when civil servants are
accountable to the military justice system. I would be grateful if the
Minister could respond now or in writing to me before Report, as this
important issue seems to have slipped through the
net.</p><p><a name="06101153000118"></a>Amendments
Nos. 40 and 201A deal with the inaccurate certification of service
material, which was constructively debated in Committee in another
place. Amendments tabled by my honourable friend Robert Key raised
important questions about the certification of military equipment. If
ships and aircraft are included in the Bill as equipment but must have
proper certification, equipment used by the Army should also be
included. There is a safety issue here: tanks and artillery guns, along
with other equipment, can be dangerous to operate. They must of course
be certified correctly, and our amendments seek to achieve that by
ensuring that &#147;service material&#148; as defined in Amendment
No. 201A is
included.</p><p><a name="06101153000119"></a>In
Committee in another place the then Minister, Don Touhig, rightly found
fault with our initial definition of service material. Therefore, we
have provided a revised definition in Amendment No. 201A to the Supply
Powers Act 1975 that is based on extant legislation that is
sufficiently wide to meet the Minister&#146;s concern. The amendment
tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Garden, seeks a similar redefinition and
we support his objectives, but the Liberal Democrat amendment limits
the expansion of applicable equipment to combat vehicles, rather than
service material. We have drafted the definition of &#147;service
material&#148; to ensure that it is wide enough to cover all
applicable equipment. In Committee in another place the Minister gave a
clear assurance that the Government would consider this further and
that he would write to Committee colleagues. We await with anticipation
the Minister&#146;s response.</p><p><a name="06101153000120"></a>Amendment No. 41 would insert a new
clause entitled &#147;Dangerous conduct&#148;, which seeks to
clarify how our Armed Forces are affected by health and safety
legislation. This was also debated in Committee in another place.

to our men and women serving on the front line so we must get it right.

Attlee:</b> I remind the Committee of my interest as
a serving officer in the TA, subject to military law as I speak. I have
tabled Amendment No. 38 in this group. Clearly, it is vital to our
democracy that Ministers are honestly and accurately briefed by the
military. Noble friends in this House have been led astray because of
inaccurate briefing from the military and have had to apologise to the
House at the Dispatch Box. My amendment would ensure that a specific
offence is committed if Ministers are inaccurately briefed in the way
that it
describes.</p><p><a name="06101153000122"></a><a name="spnew_71"></a><b><a name="06101153000406"></a>Lord
Garden:</b> I have tabled one
amendment in this group but I shall speak first to the other
amendments. We are generally supportive of those amendments,
particularly Amendment No. 37, which proposes that the offence should
apply to civilians. However, I have a problem with the aspect of the
offence proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, that connects
parliamentary business and the supply of false information. It seems to
me that supplying false information to a Minister will probably be a
reasonable offence under military law without having to attach
additional burdens of proof regarding the parliamentary business
aspect.</p><p><a name="06101153000123"></a>Several
parts of the Bill deal with what is required of official records.
Amendments Nos. 40 and 41, which stand in the name of the noble Lord,
Lord Astor of Hever, and which concern records and dangerous conduct,
are entirely sensible. My Amendment No. 59 in this group relates to
what is covered by inaccurate reporting. Clause 36 is entitled
&#147;Inaccurate certification&#148;, but it might be much better
if we ordered the Bill in such a way as to have all these matters in
one place. In any event, we need to realise that the technology is
moving on. I accept the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Astor, that
even with the inclusion of land combat vehicles the wording may still
be too narrow, but we certainly do not want to restrict the provision
to aircraft and ships. The technology that is associated with all forms
of military activities is becoming highly complex and an audit trail of
servicing will be needed to record who has done what to equipment to
ensure that everything is all
right.</p><p><a name="06101153000124"></a>Amendment No. 201A
concerns the definition of &#147;service material&#148;. I have a
slight worry that it is too narrow; it focuses too much on material
used for defence and does not include things that are
enabling.</p><p><a name="06101153000125"></a>I am sympathetic to
the amendments. I believe that these provisions could be redrafted to
make them clearer and to ensure that we have them all in one place, and
I hope that the Government will want to do that. That would cover us in
future rather than simply repeating what was in the service discipline
Acts.</p><p><a name="06101153000126"></a><a name="spnew_72"></a><b><a name="06101153000407"></a>Lord

offence to cover certificates 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_265"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 265</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for all combat vehicles, as the noble Lord has said. We have considered
this for land vehicles and equipment. Taking into account the fact that
other systems are already in place for land vehicles, we have concluded
that it would be excessively bureaucratic to extend such a system of
certification to every combat vehicle. We are satisfied that existing
systems are adequate. The noble Lord made the point that, as technology
changes and vehicles become more complex, this is something that we
need to review, but as we stand today we are correct. A failure by
service personnel to carry out those checks and inspections effectively
can amount to neglect of duty or other
offences.</p><p><a name="06101153000127"></a>Amendment
No. 37 would apply the offence of making false records to civilians
subject to service discipline. We believe that civilians accompanying
the Armed Forces should be subject to service discipline only so far as
is essential for operational effectiveness and fairness. It would be
wrong to make them essentially the same as service personnel when it
comes to disciplinary offences.</p><p><a name="06101153000128"></a>Nevertheless, I was
slightly tempted by Amendment No. 38, which would provide for up to two
years&#146; imprisonment for giving me incomplete information about
these amendments. More seriously, it would extend the offence of making
false records far beyond the legitimate disciplinary purpose of
ensuring that members of the Armed Forces do not make false official
records or suppress them. It would cover the giving of
&#147;insufficient&#148; or &#147;incomplete&#148; information,
perhaps at a meeting or where a service man or woman knows that the
Minister needs only a summary of the main facts, rather than complete
information. It would hamstring the Armed Forces in their ability to
make judgments about what information to provide to Ministers. There is
clear MoD guidance on the provision of information to Ministers, which
stresses the requirement for meticulous accuracy and highlights the
fact that the consequences of misleading Parliament are severe and that
those who do so may be held to account. But Amendment No. 38 is too
wide and should be
rejected.</p><p><a name="06101153000129"></a>Amendment No. 39 is
unnecessary. It specifies that in Clause 18 the definition of a
document should include any &#147;electronic or computer
document&#148;. This is already covered by the definition in
subsection (5); a document
includes,</p><ul><a name="06101153000319"></a>&#147;anything in
which information is
recorded&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101153000130"></a>Amendment
No. 40 concerns inaccurate records. It would replace and extend Clause
36. Its scope would be greater than the current Clause 36 because it
would relate not only to ships and aircraft but to any service
material, and service material, as I will explain, would cover anything
needed for defence purposes. As I said on Amendment No. 59, Clause 36
is restricted to the formal certification procedures for aircraft,
aircraft material and any matter relating to the seagoing or fighting
efficiency of Her Majesty&#146;s ships. It is not appropriate to
extend such formal procedures to a huge range of other service
materials. Other offences apply to any inadequacy and record
keeping&#151;for example, disobedience to orders or neglect of duty.
The amendment is therefore unnecessary. The amendment would also extend
the offence to civilians, and I have already explained why I do not
think that that would be right.</p>

conduct. The proposed new clause in Amendment No. 41 would create a new
offence of using service ships, aircraft and materials in a way that is
likely to injure someone. It would apply both to service personnel and
to civilians subject to service discipline. We believe that this is
unnecessary in disciplinary terms, because dangerous conduct is already
covered in the Bill by disciplinary offences such as neglect of duty,
hazarding a ship and so on. The worst cases might also come within
criminal offences such as manslaughter, but the proposed offence is far
too wide. It does not require negligence and it does not require risk
of serious harm, yet it seems to cover accidentally dropping some
equipment on someone&#146;s foot.</p><p><a name="06101153000132"></a>The amendment is also new in that it
would apply to civilians subject to service discipline. It would
effectively make criminal the careless handling of service material by
a contractor or, for that matter, by a member of a service family in
such a way that someone is likely to be injured. It is often tempting
and sometimes seems attractive to add or create new offences, but this
would be the wrong way to deal with dangerous conduct by
contractors&#151;even more so by other civilians subject to service
discipline.</p><p><a name="06101153000133"></a>The new clause
refers also to &#147;service material&#148;, a definition of which
is provided in AmendmentNo. 201A. That definition of
&#147;service materials&#148; would cover anything required for
defence anywhere in &#147;the Commonwealth&#148;. I have already
explained why I think that the proposed amendments using that term are
too wide and would further complicate the already excessive
requirements of the proposed offence. I wrote to the noble Lord after
our debate on 24 July and the matters were dealt with in a memorandum
to the Select Committee on the
Bill.</p><p><a name="06101153000134"></a>I ask noble Lords not to
press their amendments.</p><h5><a name="06101153000328"></a>4

Garden:</b> The Minister reads from
his brief without responding to our debate. Regarding my amendment,
which aims to widen the remit of incorrect certification of equipment,
perhaps I may give him an example. He stated that it would be unduly
bureaucratic for land systems to be included in addition to naval and
air systems. However, in modern warfare, we increasingly need to ensure
that there are proper devices for the identification of friend and foe.
Such devices are and have been fitted to aircraft but, as we discovered
in Gulf War 1, they are key pieces of equipment for the land forces,
too, if they are not to suffer friendly fire incidents. I assume that
the servicing and certification of such equipment, whether it is for
the air or ground element, is equally important and that people should
be held equally responsible for discharging their duties. Therefore,
there must be a supervisory system of oversight to make that happen.
This is not a question of there being a bureaucratic process; it is a
question of life-and-death systems that depend on people correctly
filling out records. Before I decide whether to press my amendment, I
would like to hear a response that is not just about bureaucratic
systems.</p>

Drayson:</b> The noble Lord makes a
fair point relating to the complexity of the military equipment in some
cases and how that can be fundamental to its purpose and to issues such
as those which he has described, including combat friend-or-foe
identification. The question is how we produce a definition of the type
of equipment&#151;not relating to aircraft or ships but operating
within the land environment&#151;that would be covered by this
clause. A definition that related to all service material or to all
combat land equipment would be too
broad.</p><p><a name="06101153000137"></a>I have listened to the
noble Lord&#146;s arguments and I will go away and think about this
matter. The important point is that we produce a definition for service
equipment used outside the air and maritime environment that enables us
to discriminate between those service materials for which this clause
would not be appropriate and those materials that we felt were
sufficiently important and fundamental either to operations or to the
safety of our Armed Forces. I have taken on board the noble
Lord&#146;s points and will see whether it is possible to do that in
the

Although my amendment seems a fairly minor typographical one, it is
important that subsection (2)(c) and (d) should provide a way out of
being found guilty if a drug is taken or administered on the orders of
a superior officer.</p><p><a name="06101153000149"></a>The clause
does not quite meet the situation in which service men and women find
that they need to take protective drugs&#151;for example, in theatres
of operations where they may be exposed to biological agents or
whatever. Often, they are given advice rather than an order and are
left to make a decision one way or the other. In the past, that advice
has occasionally been quite strong but it has been short of an order,
and one needs to take that into account.</p>



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_268"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101153000150"></a>Under
this clause I also want to raise the question of performance-enhancing
drugs, into which a great deal of research is being carried out. Again,
I am looking to the future of warfare. In the United States, such drugs
appear to have had an operational status. I should like the Minister to
assure us that the clause does not give a superior officer the
authority to order the use of a performance-enhancing drug. I think of
a case in April 2002 in which two American pilots killed four Canadians
on the ground and injured eight others. The subsequent inquiry into
that friendly fire incident revealed that the pilots had been taking
amphetamines&#151;legally from the American
perspective&#151;supplied by the US Air Force. We certainly did not
ever do that when I was in the Air Force. I trust that that is the case
today and that we are not in any way legitimising that sort of event.
Does the Minister believe that the clause addresses the problem or
should we insert an amendment that would ensure that we did not
administer to our service people drugs designed for performance
enhancement?</p><p><a name="06101153000151"></a>So I have two
questions: one concerns the advisory use of drugs; the other relates to
whether there is an absence in the clause of a prohibition of the use
of drugs for reasons other than protection. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101153000152"></a><a name="spnew_77"></a><b><a name="06101153000412"></a>Earl

Drayson:</b> I agree with the noble Earl, Lord
Attlee&#151;the noble Lord does talk a lot of sense on these points.
He is right that a development is taking place in defence research on
the whole area of performance-enhancing drugs. I shall go away and
reflect on whether we need to be clearer about those drugs, but our
central point of concern is that the amendment is broad: it would be a
defence to take advice from a superior officer, whatever the reason for
that advice, even if the officer was not medically qualified.</p><p><a name="06101153000154"></a>The central point is that the advice
needs to come from an officer who is medically qualified. The noble
Lord mentioned his own past experience within the military of the way
in which these things were done. It is very important that the advice
originates from medical advisers and is then passed on through the
chain of command. That situation will be covered by subsection (2)(a),
which provides a defence where a drug is taken or administered on
medical advice. Under those circumstances, the serviceman would not be
guilty of an
offence.</p><p><a name="06101153000155"></a>Therefore,
there are two important points. First, it is important that the advice
originates from someone who is medically qualified and, secondly, it is
important that the advice comes down through the chain of command in a
way that validates that the advice, once given by the personnel's chain
of command or commanding officer, has come from someone who is
medically qualified.</p><p><a name="06101153000156"></a>I will take
on board the point he makes about performance-enhancing drugs because
there are developments on this issue. Having said that, I hope that the
noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his
amendment.</p>

the question of advice. It seems to me possible that strong advice
could be given by a superior officer that did not emanate from a
doctor, but which none the less would greatly influencethe
conduct of a subordinate. I do not think that the advice should be
quite so narrowly construed as the Minister seems to have in mind. If
you get advice from a superior officer, that should be
sufficient.</p><p><a name="06101153000161"></a><a name="spnew_83"></a><b><a name="06101153000418"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> I absolutely
understand the noble and learned Lord&#146;s concerns. This is an
important point because we need to ensure that we have sufficiently
defined the issue so that it is clear that if a soldier receives advice
from his chain of command, it has gone through a validated procedure
and originated from someone who is medically qualified. It would be
wrong for people who are not medically qualified, and who have not been
authorised to do so by the chain of command, to give advice to our
personnel on the use of pharmaceutical agents in that way. Making it
absolutely clear in the Bill is a positive
step.</p><p><a name="06101153000162"></a><a name="spnew_84"></a><b><a name="_spnew34"></a><a name="06101153000419"></a>Lord

absolutely happy about this. The medical advice is about the safety or
otherwise of the drug. The use of the drug in order to enhance
performance, or whatever it happens to be, may be an operational view.
I am not too happy that the advice which emanates from the medical side
is necessarily sufficient defence if the subordinate has been ordered
by his superior to take a particular drug in order to enhance his
performance. That enhancement

May of Oxford:</b> I do not know a great deal about
this subject, but there are at least three categories: medical,
operational and ethical. Some of these performance-enhancing drugs will
have the character, as the noble Viscount so clearly pointed out, of
being a lesser evil. Better to take it than just fall over where you
are. As I understand it, however, some of the things under
consideration are designed to give an extra edge of one kind or another
to frail humans. All three dimensions are involved in those:
operational considerations are best left in the hands of the military;
medical considerations are best left in the hands of informed people;
and, ultimately, there are ethical questions about which drugs are used
and which are not. I therefore welcome the Minister&#146;s
recognition that it would be good to sharpen the definitions in this
part of the Bill.</p><p><a name="06101153000165"></a><a name="spnew_87"></a><b><a name="06101153000422"></a>Lord

short debate on an important and developing subject.</p><p><a name="06101153000166"></a>I am not sure that I totally follow the
Minister&#146;s lead on the question of &#147;orders or
advice&#148; from a senior officer. I understand that in practice
advice should come from the medical side. However, we are talking about
an offence of unfitness or misconduct through alcohol or drugs. If a
serviceman is strongly advised by a superior officer to take a drug
which causes him to be unfit or to be guilty of misconduct, that should
be a defence. It is irrelevant that the practice ought to be through a
medical adviser. I hope the Minister will take that away and look at it
again, so that we have that sorted by Report stage.</p><p><a name="06101153000167"></a>The debate on performance-enhancing drugs
is the more important point. I totally take the thoughts of the noble
Viscount, Lord Slim, that you can have a performance-enhancing drug
that may keep you going on the ground, but which may cause you not to
be able to fly as accurately as you otherwise might when in the air. It
is a difficult judgment, and there is also the ethical question that
has just been raised.</p><p><a name="06101153000168"></a>This is
an opportunity to lay down some ground rules about the use of such
drugs: who is responsible and what happens if the operational decision
is made to give a performance-enhancing drug which leads to a problem,
such as the American pilots had with their friendly fire incident. Does
that become a defence against unfitness or misconduct through alcohol
or drugs&#151;or, indeed, other offences such as careless or
dangerous flying, or whatever?</p><p><a name="06101153000169"></a>I am most grateful that the Minister has
offered to look at this paragraph. I am sure we will all be content to
work together to try to get something on Report. Until then, I beg

noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 45 to
48.</p><p><a name="06101153000176"></a>The
purpose of these amendments is to make harassment of one member of the
Armed Forces by another a specific and recognised offence. It follows
from both the Deepcut report and the agreement recently made and
published, with extensive supporting evidence, between the Armed Forces
and the Equal Opportunities Commission.</p><p><a name="06101153000177"></a>Harassment is easier to recognise than
define, and is often more evident from the point of view of the victim
than that of the perpetrator. AmendmentNo. 46 therefore
includes a perception
dimension:</p><ul><a name="06101153000320"></a>&#147;may be
thought to be&#148;.</ul><a name="06101153000286"></a>It
also provides for the minor sentence of a service corrective order to
address repetition. The whole thrust of the outcome of the EOC report
is the need to stop the offence and to prevent repetition.
<p><a name="06101153000178"></a>Amendment No. 45, to substitute
&#147;or&#148; for &#147;and&#148;, makes it clear that this
offence can be committed without it being likely to cause a
disturbance. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06101153000179"></a><a name="spnew_89"></a><b><a name="06101153000424"></a>Lord
Garden:</b> I support the amendments in this group
tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever. After the Deepcut
review, this is an important amendment, and it has our full
support.</p><p><a name="06101153000180"></a><a name="spnew_90"></a><b><a name="06101153000425"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> The offence as drafted, like the offence
which it replaces in the existing service discipline Acts, is designed
to prevent specified types of misbehaviour when they are likely to
result in a disturbance. It recognises that there is a low level at
which such misbehaviour between service personnel should not
automatically be an offence. The clause therefore limits the offence to
where it is serious enough that a disturbance is likely. I understand
the arguments that the noble Lord made as a result of what we learnt
from the reports on Deepcut and so forth, but Amendments Nos. 44 to 48
would make any insult, for example, an offence, even if there was no
risk of a disturbance.</p><p><a name="06101153000181"></a>They would also make
any harassment an offence. Harassment is already covered by the
comparatively new criminal offence of harassment under Section 2 of the
Protection from Harassment Act 1997. The inclusion of harassment in
this clause is therefore unnecessary. Moreover, it would create an
offence which, because it could be committed by a single incident,
would be inconsistent with the 1997 Act, under which harassment depends
on a course of conduct.</p><p><a name="06101153000182"></a>Finally, these
amendments provide that thecourt martial can impose a
restraining order under Clause 228. We believe this is unnecessary as a
restraining order is not a punishment and so is not precluded by 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_272"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the restrictions in the clause on punishments. Clause 228 would already
allow the court to make such an order. Clause 22 highlights the
importance of trust and respect in the relationship between commanders
and those under command. The offence is about the seriousness of
mistreatment by superiors of their subordinates.</p><p><a name="06101153000183"></a>Amendment
No. 49 would extend the offence to ill-treatment by a person who is not
the victim&#146;s superior officer, but is pretending to be. This is
clearly outside what this offence is really about, which is the abuse
of authority. There are other service disciplinary or criminal offences
that would be more appropriately used where the offender only pretends
to be a
superior.</p><p><a name="06101153000184"></a><a name="spnew_91"></a><b><a name="06101153000426"></a>Earl

favour of this clause as we have seen, by virtue of the National Audit
Office, that his own department is sometimes negligent in this
respect.</p><p><a name="06101153000247"></a>My amendment attempts
to try to ensure that this clause is not applied too rigorously. |Given
NAO reports over the years, that would mean that the military justice
system would grind to a halt since waste appears to be endemic. It
involves a more serious point about who we are we trying to catch with
this approach. Let me take a concrete example. We keep discussing the
eight Chinook HC3s, which must presumably fall within the category of
having been authorised to be modified in such a way as to cause a waste
of service property&#151;to the tune of &#163;150 million, or
whatever it is.</p><p><a name="06101153000248"></a>Who does this clause
catch? There is a chain of people, some of whom knowingly do
it&#151;presumably because they have the expertise&#151;and some
perhaps unknowingly. Or is it really aimed at very junior personal
doing minor wastage on units? If so, that would be unfortunate. My
amendments are probing in nature to show exactly where the buck will
stop because it could be an important clause if correctly targeted. I
beg to move.</p><p><a name="06101153000249"></a><a name="spnew_95"></a><b><a name="06101153000442"></a>Lord
Astor of Hever:</b> Although I
accept that these amendments are probing, we support their thrust. We
feel that service personnel should be guilty of a Clause 25 offence
only if they knowingly waste or misapply service property. If they are
ordered to do so, they should not be charged under this clause. If a
serviceman or servicewoman is found guilty of this offence, it will
stay on their record and may seriously affect their
career.</p><p><a name="06101153000250"></a><a name="spnew_96"></a><b><a name="06101153000443"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> Perhaps I may illustrate a situation from
my experience which shows why this amendment is necessary. A senior NCO
condemned a winch on a heavy recovery vehicle. He misdiagnosed the
failure of the winch, but he did not realise he had misdiagnosed it.
The winch was worth &#163;15,000 and we did not have one in stock.
So, if one wanted to investigate what went wrong, one might decide to
prosecute the serviceman for making a technical error. The noble Lord's
amendment would stop that unnecessary and inappropriate prosecution
taking place. Therefore, I support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101153000251"></a><a name="spnew_97"></a><b><a name="06101153000444"></a>Viscount
Slim:</b> I am not too clear on this point. What
happens if on operations&#151;say there is an ambush or
something&#151;a vehicle convoy is going along and everyone has to
take to their feet to get into the hills, but before doing so they
destroy the vehicles so that the enemy cannot have them? Does that
involve &#147;knowingly&#148; wasting? I am not sure how this firms
up operationally. A lot of people destroy things on operations so that
the enemy cannot have them.</p>

Lords focusing on this very important area. The noble Lord, Lord
Garden, raised the point on the Mark 3 Chinook helicopters. He knows
very well the importance of making sure that we do not misapply or
waste public money. This is a difficult area because have to ensure
that we are defining the offence in this clause, such that it takes
into account a reckless or negligent misuse or waste where such
negligence or misuse could have serious consequences for the unit.
Therefore, we believe that it is important for us to maintain that
wider definition, not to have it limited by the wording, &#147;so
knowingly to do&#148;. The important point concerns recklessness or
negligence. It is important for me to point out that an offence under
the clause is not so serious as ever to justify imprisonment. That
penalty is not available under the
clause.</p><p><a name="06101153000253"></a>Amendment
No. 53, providing that a serviceman who misapplies or wastes public or
service money commits no offence if his actions were on the orders of a
superior officer, is unnecessary, because if a serviceman acted on the
basis of an order, he would not have the necessary intent, negligence
or recklessness to commit an offence. On the question of the noble
Lord, Lord Garden, of who this is intended to catch, we intend to be
able to take action where someone has acted in a reckless or negligent
way and, as a result, has led to the misuse or waste of public
money.</p><h5><a name="06101153000332"></a>4.30

in particular with the definition of &#147;minimum height&#148;,
below which an offence is committed. In subsection (3), the minimum
height is the height prescribed by regulations made by the Defence
Council. In practice, when authorising each flight, the minimum height
for the operation will be written in by the officer authorising the
flight. That minimum height may well be higher than the minimum height
prescribed by regulations, taking into account the conditions, the need
for the operational or training requirement, the weather, and a whole
range of other factors. If we are trying to have an offence that wraps
up low flying, it might be worth considering ensuring&#151;I shall be
interested to hear the Minister&#146;s thinking about
this&#151;that it embraces whatever the authorised height is, which
may often be higher than the minimum height. I beg to

Garden, for making a point about the authorised height, because it
occurs to me that from time to time on separate operations, individual
flights, individual days and individual periods of flying that the
regulations or the limit&#151;if I may call it that&#151;on height
may well be altered not every day but with the full authority of those
who are on the ground and know what they are doing. One might need a
degree of flexibility in this, and I hope that the noble Lord&#146;s
amendment, let alone what the Minister proposes in the clause, might
allow this degree of flexibility.</p><p><a name="06101153000277"></a>My mind goes back to the tragic events at
the Mull of Kintyre, which will be familiar to my noble and learned
friend Lord Mayhew, and to the report on those events that referred to
various aspects of a particular helicopter flying at a particular
height. There might well have been, and probably were, specific height
restrictions for that particular operation on that particular day, but
I hope that the amendment proposed by the noble Lords, Lord Garden and
Lord Thomas of Gresford, and any reply given by the Minister, allows
such flexibility for a particular height restriction. I am advised that
there is a general height restriction of 500 feet for aircraft flying
low over my home in Scotland. It might be 250 feet at certain times. I
hope that there is flexibility in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment,

support the amendment. I just want to make it clear that the clause, as
I read it, refers to peacetime flying and training flying. I am not
absolutely clear whether there is any likelihood of such an offence
being brought against someone who is flying not only in wartime
situations but in quasi-wartime situations, whether over this country
or anywhere else. Perhaps the Minister will assure me that it would
not.</p><p><a name="06101153000197"></a><a name="spnew_111"></a><b><a name="06101153000429"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> I recognise the
concern raised by the noble Lord, Lord Garden. He is right. In addition
to the low-flying restrictions in place under Defence Council
regulations, further restrictions are sometimes imposed. Nevertheless,
although we are mindful of the situation, we believe that this
amendment is unnecessary. Specific flight restrictions through local
arrangements will be imposed by specific commands or standing orders.
In either case, disobedience to that command or standing order will be
an offence. Therefore, there is no requirement to bring conduct of that
type within this clause. On the basis of that clarification, I hope
that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p><p><a name="06101153000198"></a>I am able to provide the confirmation
that the noble and gallant Lord seeks. This does not relate to a combat

Garden:</b> I am of course aware
that a number of orders and regulations will be locally provided. My
point is beyond that. A specific height will be written into the
authorisation sheet for every flight operating below normal operating
heights, and it cannot go below that height. It is slightly curious
that we have a clause on low flying. This will be done because the
authorising officer perhaps thinks that the pilot is not yet
experienced enough to go down to the minimum height or that on a
particular day the weather or other conditions are not appropriate to
allow him to do so. If a person disobeys the order written in the
authorisation sheet, there will be the possibility of charging him or
of other disciplinary action. It just seems curious that it would not
be done under this provision, because we have not made it an offence to
fly below the authorised height for the flight, rather than under, as
the Bill currently states, the minima defined by the Defence Council,
which will be different. The Minister may find it worth while to have
another look to see whether there is substance in my
proposal.</p><p><a name="06101153000200"></a><a name="spnew_113"></a><b><a name="06101153000431"></a>Lord

noble Lord said: This amendment would retain the present position under
the Army Act 1955 whereby a person may not be charged with an offence
of treason, murder, manslaughter or rape if that offence was committed
in the United Kingdom. I have followed almost exactly the wording of
the existing provision and the historic provision in the Army
Act.</p><p><a name="06101153000212"></a>Perhaps I may say a few
words broadly. The justification for courts martial for serious
offences committed abroad is entirely accepted. It is in the interests
of a serviceman or a civilian who is subject to service jurisdiction
that, if he is charged with serious offences abroad, he should have
available to him a tribunal where the law of England and Wales is
applied, the proceedings are conducted in the English language and the
procedures are appropriate. I have no quarrel with the present
situation, and the continuing situation under the Bill, that there
should be court martial hearings abroad for serious offences. However,
no proper justification appears to have been put forward for extending
the jurisdiction of courts martial to the serious offences of treason,
murder, manslaughter or rape when a serviceman commits those offences
in the United Kingdom itself and is therefore subject to ordinary
criminal procedures. He will be tried before a jury in the Crown Court,
and that is something that frequently
happens.</p><h5><a name="06101153000330"></a>4.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06101153000213"></a>In the
letter which he has helpfully sent to us on this topic, the Minister
said that we have to recognise that the court martial system is
compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights. Although that
may be so&#151;and I do not necessarily say that it is&#151;it has
been a long struggle to reach that position It is a long struggle which
has been carried out not by the Government but by defence advocates who
on numerous occasions have taken the Government to the European Court
of Human Rights to obtain judgments in their favour. Here I recognise
the sterling work of Mr John Mackenzie, Mr Gilbert Blades and others
who have brought these cases forward. For example, in 1997, in the case
of Findlay, the European Court held that the system of courts martial
was not compliant because the convening officer prosecuted the case,
appointed the panel which tried it, and then reviewed the conviction
and sentence imposed by the panel. He could have, if he had so desired,
reversed it. As a result of that judgment in 1997&#151;when of course
the Government were arguing to maintain the system as it then
was&#151;the Armed Forces Act 2001 was
passed.</p><p><a name="06101153000214"></a>However,
that was not the end of the story. In 2002, in Morris v the United
Kingdom, the European Court again held that the court martial system
was not 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_279"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>compliant on a number of grounds: first, that the junior officers who
formed part of the panel were subject to reports on how they had
carried out their duties; and, secondly, the court was unhappy with the
reviewing authority. The court thought it inappropriate that an
extrajudicial body should decide on the conviction and sentence
subsequent to the original hearing. The Judicial Committee of this
House actually disagreed with that decision in the case of Boyd, but
the Armed Forces Act 2001 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957 (Remedial)
Order 2004 altered the system. All sorts of things have been pressed
not by the prosecution but by the defence, and as a consequence, by
pushing and shoving, the court martial system has come closer to the
sort of system that we are familiar with in the civil jurisdiction in
this country. However, it certainly has not arrived there yet. This
Bill is another step on the way, but there are further steps to be
taken. If the Government were to accept our later amendments to the
Bill, we might reach a satisfactory situation, but the
Government&#146;s present approach appears to be, as it always has
been, to reject with scorn any attempt to try to amend the
system.</p><p><a name="06101153000215"></a>For
example, it is still the case that instead of a unanimous verdict by a
jury of 12 people, or at the very least a majority verdict of not less
than 10 to two, a court martial is decided by a simple majority. If
five sit, three to two is enough for conviction; if seven sit, four to
three is enough. Then, sentencing is by the panel itself. Officers are
brought together for a court martial&#151;and will continue to be so
under the Bill&#151;and upon them, without any training or background
at all, is put the responsibility of sentencing. Of course they can
take the advice of the judge advocate who sits with them but, except in
the case of a tie when I think he has a casting vote, he has only one
vote. That is unsatisfactory. It is also unsatisfactory that panels do
not include a cross-section of service personnel. As a result of
pressure from defence advocates, warrant officers were introduced to
panels, which now frequently include a warrant officer; civilians were
introduced to sit where civilian defendants were before a court
martial, and so on.</p><p><a name="06101153000216"></a>I recall
that one of the last procedures to go went as a result of a Question
that I asked in this House about whether it was right that a defendant
in a naval court martial should be marched in at the point of a
cutlass. Between my tabling of the Question and the Minister of the
day, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, replying to it, that hallowed
custom&#151;which of course the Navy loved&#151;had suddenly
disappeared. In the time I have been involved in courts martial the
swords have gone and the stripping the defendant of his belt and cap,
the marching and the saluting have all disappeared. Indeed,
today&#151;again as a result of pushing by the defence&#151;the
panel sits separately from the judge advocate.</p><p><a name="06101153000217"></a>His honour Judge
Blackett, who is the Judge Advocate General, gave evidence to the
Select Committee on this Bill in another place. His memorandum
stated:</p><ul><a name="06101153000304"></a>&#147;The military
system should be the equivalent of the civilian system in all respects
except where the requirements of operational effectiveness make the
differences impossible&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_280"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><a name="06101153000287"></a>We have an enlightened
Judge Advocate General who has said that he believes the court martial
system should reflect the Crown Court in all respects except where
there are good operational reasons for differences. He is trying to
ensure that a court martial is regarded as on an equivalent footing to
a Crown Court. But we are not there. Unless the amendments that we have
put down&#151;which I believe were suggested by the Judge Advocate
General in his evidence to the Select Committee on the composition of
the panel, on the question of sentencing by a board which has no
experience and on the question of majority verdicts&#151;are agreed,
we will not have a system for trying servicemen in this country which
is the equivalent of a Crown
Court.<p><a name="06101153000218"></a>Why, therefore, should
we have this change to allow courts martial to deal with treason,
murder, manslaughter and rape committed in this country? Who is to
decide? Nowhere in the Bill is it set out who decides whether a
serviceman should be tried by court martial for murder or for rape as
opposed to sending him to the Crown Court to be tried in the ordinary
way by a jury. We have a system proposed which is, in my view,
unacceptable.</p><p><a name="06101153000219"></a>I notice that
Major-General Howell, the head of the prosecuting authority, in his
evidence to the Select Committee, justified the change for the
following reason:</p><ul><a name="06101153000305"></a>&#147;I can
see a situation where if you had a soldier committing murders in a lot
of different countries, one of which is the UK, it may be easiest for a
Court Martial to try the case because the Court Martial can move around
countries and listen to witnesses locally and has that other advantage.
I do think it is something that is going to be very rare, to be frank,
but I can imagine the situation might
exist&#148;.</ul><a name="06101153000288"></a>It has never
happened. There has never been a serial murderer who has been murdering
all round the world who has been tried by court martial. Yet that is
the only justification that the head of the prosecuting service,
Major-General Howell, could put forward for grasping this additional
jurisdiction to the courts martial in this
country.<p><a name="06101153000220"></a>Supposing someone
were to say to a policeman, &#147;You are part of a discipline
service and there are certain things about policemen which are
peculiar. Therefore, it is only right that if you are charged with
murder or with committing a serious offence, you should be tried not by
a jury but by a panel of senior policemen&#148;. Can you imagine the
reaction of the people of this country if such a situation arose? Let
us take, for example, the de Menezes case, where that unfortunate man
was shot on a tube, and suppose that a police officer involved in that
situation were to be dealt with by a panel of policemen. What is the
difference?</p><p><a name="06101153000221"></a>There are practical
reasons for courts martial dealing with serious matters abroad; I have
outlined those and accepted them. But there are no practical reasons,
apart from the far-fetched situation imagined by Major-General Howell
for that jurisdiction to be exercised in this
country.</p><p><a name="06101153000222"></a>I am
sorry to have wearied your Lordships for so long on this topic, but it
is of considerable importance. A principle of trial by jury&#151;a
principle that has always been accepted in relation to
servicemen&#151;is being broken for no adequate reason. We cannot

us have some transparency. We may then accept it but I suspect that
your Lordships will ultimately reject this claim for additional
jurisdiction. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06101153000223"></a><a name="spnew_116"></a><b><a name="06101153000434"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> I disagreed with quite
a lot of the background to what the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of
Gresford, said, but it seems most peculiar to extend the jurisdiction
in the way that the Bill proposes. I shall be very interested to hear
the Minister&#146;s explanation about why it is desirable to make
these
changes.</p><p><a name="06101153000224"></a><a name="spnew_117"></a><b><a name="06101153000435"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> This issue goes to the heart of the
Bill. There are two key principles underpinning the Bill with which I
hope no one in this place disagrees. The first is that our Armed Forces
require a separate system of military justice. The second is that the
system of justice must underpin service discipline at all times,
wherever, geographically, an offence may have taken place and whether
it has been in an operational or non-operational environment.</p><p><a name="06101153000225"></a>The noble Lord has described his concerns
at length and I have responded in a letter to him, setting out our
arguments in some detail. I will not go through those arguments in
detail this afternoon in the interests of brevity. However, I stress
that the fundamental principle that we are aiming to achieve in the
Bill is to ensure that we have a separate system of military justice
which can be recognised by our Armed Forces as fair, effective and
appropriate. We believe that this aspect is important. Perhaps I can
give some background to why the current service discipline Acts
restrict the powers of courts martial to try certain criminal
offences.</p><p><a name="06101153000226"></a>My
understanding is that the reasons for these exclusions are historical
and go back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Those reasons in the modern
context have gone. It would be seen as strange for a member of the
Armed Forces to be able to elect not to be tried by his peers within a
court martial and to go through a civilian system. Nowadays, protocols
exist between the civilian and service police and the prosecuting
authorities. Our aim is to have the same flexible approach apply to
murder or manslaughter as already applies to offences such as grievous
bodily harm and the most serious sexual offences. The amendment, like
the existing restriction, would cause practical
difficulties.</p><h5><a name="06101153000331"></a>5
pm</h5><p><a name="06101153000227"></a>I shall give one example of
where the restriction would lead to unfairness. If a soldier were
suspected of raping another soldier twice, once in the United Kingdom
and once in Germany, the services could deal with the offence in
Germany, but not in the United Kingdom&#151;they would have to be
tried separately. Other examples could be given, and I would be happy
to provide further details to your Lordships, but this is a fundamental
principle of the Bill. It ensures that the Bill provides a separate
system of military justice for our Armed
Forces.</p><p><a name="06101153000228"></a>The

appearances before courts martial. As the Committee knows, we are
extremely careful and cautious in dealing with juvenile offenders, in
how the case is handled in court, how it is prosecuted and decided, and
what forms of punishment or treatment are involved as a result of
appearance in a juvenile court. However, this Bill permits juveniles
who are civilians to be brought before a court martial, when they have
not themselves joined the services but happen to be under the
jurisdiction of that court because, for example, their parents are
service people, or for some other reason&#151;they are serving abroad
with the British forces. I respectfully say that that is contrary to
our whole approach to juvenile
justice.</p><p><a name="06101153000236"></a>I add, for your

where his father had left the services, to be tried under a court
martial. The matter went to the Appellate Committee of this House,
which upheld the conviction, but it has lived with me&#151;we should
not be dealing with youngsters in that
way.</p><p><a name="06101153000238"></a>That is
the motivation behind Amendment No. 60. Grouped with it is the
objection to the whole concept of the court martial dealing with
civilian offences. This broad subject has been addressed on many
occasions, not least before the Appellate Committee. We have given and
continue to give courts martial the right to deal with civilian
offences; that is to say, they are dealing not with disciplinary
matters but with people who have committed ordinary crimes on the
statute book. I know that I will not persuade your Lordships that this
system, which has operated for a long time, should be changed, but what
I am saying is perhaps one step further along the road to confining
military courts martial to what they should be confined to:
disciplining the service men under their control. They should not deal
with civilians, particularly not with youthful civilians and civil
offences.</p><p><a name="06101153000239"></a>I put my focus on
Amendment No. 60, because the Bill does not give proper consideration
to how juveniles subject to service discipline should be dealt with.
The Bill sets up service civilian courts, and the rules proposed and
promoted for those courts should encompass the sort of things that we
have in a juvenile court in this country. There must be enough people
of sufficient experience to sit on the equivalent of a juvenile panel.
I would like to see under-18s dealt with by that service civil court
sitting as the equivalent of a juvenile panel in this country. That
panel should have experience of the way in which we deal with
juveniles. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06101153000240"></a><a name="spnew_122"></a><b><a name="06101153000440"></a>Lord
Borrie:</b> Since the 18th century our law has given
courts martial jurisdiction over civilian dependants and employees but,
until the Army Act 1955, this applied only if our troops were on active
service. Military law was extended in 1955 to cover civilians in peace
time accompanying soldiers in other countries, to bring it into line
with what was supposed to be the position in the United States. But in
1960 the United States Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional
for United States civilian employees and dependants to be subject to
courts martial in peace time. One of the reasons given by the Supreme
Court in 1960 was that court martial procedure does not allow for trial
by jury.</p><p><a name="06101153000241"></a>I have immediate
sympathy for AmendmentNo. 60, proposed by the noble Lord, Lord
Thomas, which concerns under-18s being exempt from the jurisdiction of
a court martial. He has referred to the case in which he appeared as
defence counsel. I am

which a 17 year-old, the son of a British corporal serving in Germany,
was tried by court martial for murder in Germany. As the noble Lord
said, that case came before the Appellate Committee of this House. It
is worth pointing out that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn of
Hadley, who is not present, expressed concern at depriving the young
man of trial by jury, although he accepted that there would have been
&#147;great difficulty&#148; in having the evidence of
some&#151;at any rate, the German witnesses&#151;brought before a
civilian court in England.</p><p><a name="06101153000242"></a>It so
happens that in 1966, in another case, the wife of a British soldier
stationed in Germany was tried by court martial for the murder of her
husband and sentenced to life imprisonment&#151;later it was reduced
twice to five years&#146; imprisonment. The defendant was just over
18 years old. The concerns expressed by the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Slynn, in R v Martin were as relevant in the case of Mrs Clark as
they were in that of the under 18-year-old, particularly the absence of
a trial by jury and allowing a simple majority verdict, which is all
that is necessary to establish guilt in a court
martial.</p><p><a name="06101153000243"></a>When the United States
condemned on constitutional grounds the court martial trial of
civilians in peace time, Justice Black in Washington said that when a
Government reach out to punish a citizen
abroad,</p><ul><a name="06101153000321"></a>&#147;the shield
which the Bill of Rights and other parts of the constitution provide to
protect his life and liberty should not be stripped away because he
happens to be in another land. This is not a novel concept. To the
contrary it is as old as government. It was recognised long before Paul
invoked the right as a Roman citizen to be tried in strict accordance
with Roman
law&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="06101167000145"></a>5.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06101167000001"></a>It is evident that I support
the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, but I would
really like it to go further. Like the noble Lord, I question the
clauses that immediately follow in this debate. I question the
jurisdiction of courts martial over all civilians, whether under or
over 18, except when accompanying troops in wartime on active service.
Of course I accept that when troops and accompanying civilians are
based in peacetime in another country they are <I>prima facie</I>
subject to the jurisdiction of the local courts of the country in which
they are serving or living. The foreign country may be willing, under
an agreement with this country, to give up some of its sovereign rights
and, as in the NATO status of forces agreement, grant some measure of
jurisdiction to the military authorities of the sending state. In
principle, the foreign country should equally be willing to grant
jurisdiction to the sending state&#146;s civil authorities, sitting
as appropriate in the state where witnesses may be more easily and
readily available. In such a situation, a civilian court could be
adjusted in its composition on the lines that the noble Lord has
suggested, so that if the defendant is under 18 it would have an
appropriate panel, as with juvenile courts in this country. I support
the noble Lord.</p>

recognised the need for special safeguards when conducting trials of

apply those safeguards. The matter could be dealt with much more simply

precedents for all this go back to the 18th century, but there were not
too many safeguards in our domestic law in the18th century for
the trial of children under the age of 18. I very much look forward to

that are deeper than perhaps at first we realised. It may be that we

this with some modesty, because I am afraid that I was not able to be

sheepish way&#151;I use an appropriate Welsh image&#151;in which
the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, spoke in opposing Clauses 42
to 49 standing part of the Bill. I am not sure why he did that. Was it
because we had already heard from him at some length on the previous
amendment and modesty overcame him? Or was it because he was not sure
of his ground? I would like to think that it was the latter, because
expunging those clauses from the Bill would tear the heart out of our
traditional approach to the relationship between civilian and military
law. If Clauses 42 to 49 were removed, you would be left with a
statutory disciplinary system for the forces. That would fly in the
face of the fundamental constitutional principle that has always lain
at the heart of our approach to the Armed Forces&#151;that a soldier,
sailor or airman in the services is a civilian who is undertaking such
tasks. He is a citizen in arms, if you like. If we stray from that, we
unravel the approach that we have traditionally taken to these
matters.</p><p><a name="06101167000009"></a>I wonder how this
amendment might apply. Perhaps a way of testing the attempt to remove
Clauses 42 to 49 is to look at what would happen when our servicemen
are abroad. That was touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie. What
happens in relation to the commission of criminal offences when
servicemen are abroad? Currently, the civilian courts have
extra-territorial jurisdiction only for a few serious offences. If you
remove criminal conduct from the scope of the military justice system,
there would be no means of prosecuting a soldier for an offence
committed abroad that fell outside that limited extra-territorial
jurisdiction. The only alternative, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie,
stated, would be to subject the soldier to a foreign local
jurisdiction. In some cases, that would be impossible; in other cases,
it would be highly undesirable, especially now, given the jurisdiction
of the International Criminal Court. With great respect to the noble
Lord, Lord Thomas, I suggest that removing the clauses would be wholly
counterproductive. On this matter, the Government can rely on support
from the
Opposition.</p><p><a name="06101167000010"></a><a name="spnew_128"></a><b><a name="06101167000156"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> I have listened carefully to the points
made on the Floor of this House and my comments on Amendments Nos. 62

by a number of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, in
respect of juveniles, and those points were emphasised by the noble
Lord, Lord Borrie. I shall go away and reflect on these matters, in so
far as they apply to juveniles, and come back to the noble
Lord.</p><p><a name="06101167000011"></a>I
believe that I have to be more robust on Amendment No. 63 because, as
we have heard, it goes to the heart of the Bill. I have already spoken
to the two key principles that we believe underpin what we are trying
to achieve in this very important Bill for our Armed Forces in having a
separate and comprehensive system of military justice. As I understand
it, this amendment seeks to permit service personnel and civilians who
are subject to service discipline to elect trial before civilian courts
in the United Kingdom where those civilian courts have
extra-territorial jurisdiction. I believe that 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_287"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 287</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that would significantly undermine those key principles; it would rip
the heart out of the Bill and have a significantly detrimental effect
on its standing. I therefore ask the noble Lord not to press that
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101167000012"></a>I
should also like to make a point relating to personnel, whether they
are civilians acting in arms, as the noble Lord opposite has just said,
or whether they are taking part in operational or non-operational
activities. In our modern environment, the types of operations that our
forces undergo change very rapidly in a short space of time and can
therefore be hard to define as active service in a warlike situation.
We are seeing so-called &#147;three-block&#148; operations, where
the situation can change extremely rapidly. Therefore, we do not
believe that it would be helpful to make this distinction, as it would
be impractical in defining active service or operational or
non-operational theatre. I would have real difficulty with such a
distinction.</p><p><a name="06101167000013"></a><a name="spnew_129"></a><b><a name="06101167000157"></a>Lord

grateful to noble Lords who have spoken in support of Amendment No.
60&#151;in particular, the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, the noble and
learned Lords, Lord Lyell and Lord Mayhew, and the noble Earl, Lord
Attlee. I also include the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. If I was perhaps
sheepish on my side, he was not exactly bullish about supporting
Amendment No. 60, but I think that he does. Indeed, he says that he
completely supports it. I am grateful that the Minister is going to
think about the problem in relation to civilian juveniles who have not
signed up to the Army, the Navy or whatever but find themselves subject
to courts
martial.</p><p><a name="06101167000014"></a>As to
the objection to dealing with civil offences, the noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, is right. In my view, until the court martial system is
completely consonant with the Crown Court&#151;an aim announced by
the Judge Advocate General, Judge Blackett&#151;it is wrong that a
serviceman should face a different tribunal for an offence committed in
this country. I refer not to the more serious offences but to the
ordinary, run-of-the-mill ones. It is wrong that he should face a
completely different tribunal with procedures that are not as
acceptable as those faced by the ordinary member of the public, who
will be before the magistrates&#146; court or the Crown Court for the
same offence committed in this
country.</p><p><a name="06101167000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Kingsland, was right to point out the difficulties that apply to
offences committed abroad. I agree with him that it is necessary to
have a service disciplinary system that deals with criminal acts
abroad. But it is a different matter when one asks whether it is right
in this country to have a competing jurisdiction for a person just
because he has signed up to the services and whether it is right that
he should be at greater peril if he is charged with offences under one
system than he would be under the
other.</p><p><a name="06101167000016"></a>I am
grateful for the support in relation to juveniles, and I shall pursue
that matter. My opposition to the wider picture is, as I said, part of
a long-running campaign, which I cannot pursue further at this stage. I

heralded during the Second Reading speeches from these
Benches.</p><p><a name="06101167000026"></a>The principle is that
the rules of engagement should become an absolute statutory defence for
a soldier on operations. It must follow, therefore, that the rules of
engagement define the criminal law within which the soldier operates.
We believe that the rules of engagement should take statutory form.
Soldiers have to know where they stand when they are on operations.
They are told that if they comply with the rules of engagement they are
within the law. Why are the Government prepared to say that informally
but not admit it publicly in the Bill? That is the question that the
Minister has to answer. He will have some difficulty in doing that if
his answer is not co-ordinate with the view that we take.</p><p><a name="06101167000027"></a>Article 7 of the Human
Rights Act requires that the criminal law should be composed of rules
that have predictable outcomes. It requires that a
subject&#151;whether a soldier or a civilian&#151;before
undertaking a certain activity should know whether that activity falls
within or outside the criminal law. Precisely the same principle should
apply to a soldier on operations.</p><p><a name="06101167000028"></a>I entirely accept that
the details of the amendment might reasonably be criticised. We have
taken a view about the right approach. We would welcome other views on
how it should be applied; but we are convinced that the Government have
to face up to this and include in the Bill an appropriate statutory
defence. I beg to move.</p>

me:</p><ul><a name="06101167000134"></a>&#147;UK embedded

on certain occasions, people who are subject to our service law are

an extra dimension of problem on how we put rules of engagement on a

basis.<p><a name="06101167000031"></a>Turning
to the broader aspect of rules of engagement, I should be interested to
hear the Minister's reaction. I am not sure whether it is a good idea.
My first reaction was that when they are put on a statutory basis,
there will perhaps be a tendency for them to be less flexible, which
may make life more difficult. I am also slightly concerned that a
subsection (7) of the new clause makes observance of the rules of
engagement an absolute defence. Of course, you are still required to be
proportionate in your response at any stage of warfare. It may be that
you can operate under quite robust rules of engagement, but the
particular circumstances do not mean that you need to go to their outer
edges; you could do something less damaging. We still need to be able
to look at the proportionality argument.</p><p><a name="06101167000032"></a>If we were to put rules
of engagement on a statutory basis, we must consider how we handle
being under those of other nations. I have yet to be convinced that
this is the place to put them, however, and will wait to hear what the
Minister has to say. I beg to move.</p><p><a name="06101167000033"></a><a name="spnew_132"></a><b><a name="06101167000160"></a>Lord

not readily possible to distinguish between orders and rules of

armed combat and peacekeeping recognises realities and, as the noble
and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, put it, can be trusted by the servicemen.
It would serve as a substantive defence on the basis on which the Army
Board rejected the application of DALS for the discharge of the Scots
Guardsmen.</p><p><a name="06101167000036"></a>Here I have to
declare an interest because I represented them before the Army Board on
two occasions and prepared their defence, and called their evidence and
that of their commanding officer, who is now General Sir John Kiszely.
On the second occasion, General Sir Mike Jackson sat on the board and
questioned in depth the three men who gave evidence: the two Scots
Guardsmen and the general. The board came to the conclusion that the
two guardsmen could not be discharged from the Army because the morning
orders of the day for the guardsmen were to stop and search, their
rules of engagement were, &#147;Halt or I&#146;ll fire&#148; and
they were ignored twice. They only had before them a defence of
self-defence, which was rejected by the judge, but there was no
rejection of what was accepted by the Army Board and General Sir Mike
Jackson, which was that they complied with their orders and rules of
engagement. The transcript of those proceedings is lying around in the
MoD somewhere and forms strong confirmation for the type of amendment

produced out of Amendments Nos. 61, 62 and 62A.</p><p><a name="06101167000037"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, said,

Vincent of Coleshill:</b> On Amendment No. 61 I
understand the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Garden, that
rules of engagement becoming part of the Bill itself could complicate
them unnecessarily and make them, in practical terms, less useful. That
issue surely needs to be addressed. However, on the need to incorporate
that amendment into the Bill, in principle I think that there is a case
for it. The reason is that historically&#151;certainly going back to
when I started my military service and in the Second World War before
that&#151;the Geneva conventions and other international agreements
sought to establish the rules of warfare.</p><p><a name="06101167000039"></a>We have moved on vastly. You have only to
look at Iraq and Afghanistan where our adversaries, or our potential
adversaries&#151;however you define them these days&#151;do not see
themselves subjected to any human rights or to any international law
whatever. That is therefore a very important reason why our forces
should have clear direction on the rules of engagement that should
apply. Those should be on a legally sound footing so that if their
interpretation of them is challenged in any way, there is something to
base their judgment on.</p><p><a name="06101167000040"></a>Additionally, after today, after the
conflict phase of an operation, such as in Iraq, the situation is even
more complicated. Very junior ranks indeed on the back streets of Basra
will have to make up their minds in seconds about whether what action
they take is legal. Therefore, I think that in principle Amendment No.
61 is important and should be given careful consideration, but taking
account of the point made by the noble Lord, Lord
Garden.</p><p><a name="06101167000041"></a><a name="spnew_134"></a><b><a name="06101167000162"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> There is no doubt that there is a problem
with rules of engagement, but I have some difficulties with Amendment
No. 61. First, the details on the existing rules of engagement card do
not seem to me to change from operation to operation. I can quote the
exact words. They are engraved in my brain. In every operation the
rules of engagement are the same. Secondly, subsection (8) says that
the Secretary of State may classify the rules, but subsection (9) says
that the cards should not be classified.</p><p><a name="06101167000042"></a>Thirdly, and perhaps
most importantly, the actual rules of engagement for an operation,
which are issued by PDHQ, are contained in a massive and detailed
document. It is not a little card, like my cue cards; it is a big
document, and it is surprisingly precise. It might say that you can
attack electricity pylons but not an electricity substation. The
details would have to be classified because if the enemy knew what was
in the detailed rules of engagement they would not need to defend that
particular infrastructure and therefore could concentrate their
defensive efforts on infrastructure that could be attacked.</p><p><a name="06101167000043"></a>However, I have some sympathy with
Amendment No. 62A. I was very surprised at what the noble Lord, Lord
Garden, said about foreign rules of engagement and the Answer to his
Written Question. I will certainly be talking to him later about
that.</p>

Ramsbotham:</b> I preface my brief intervention by
saying how much I and, I suspect, many of my colleagues have
appreciated the care with which the noble Lord, Lord Grayson, has kept
us in touch with the process of this Bill and has made certain that we
were briefed during the various movements on it. It is highly
appreciated and we are very
grateful.</p><p><a name="06101167000045"></a>I support what the
noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said. As the nature of operations changes
into what General Sir Rupert Smith described in his book as &#147;a
war amongst the people&#148;, it is ever more important that every
member of our Armed Forces committed to such conflicts is absolutely
crystal clear on what are the rules of engagement before they are
committed to those operations. That means that those rules of
engagement must have been considered and worked out in advance by the
Secretary of State and the chain of command downwards to include every
individual. I suspect that some of the problems in Iraq have arisen
because those rules of engagement were not absolutely crystal clear in
the minds of everyone concerned. Therefore, it makes sense that the
requirement to do that should be in statute so that it cannot be fudged
before people are launched.</p><p><a name="06101167000046"></a>I
also support the intent behind AmendmentNo. 62 because one
type of operation on which we are embarked&#151;United Nations
operations&#151;is one in which there is the most complicated
preparation of rules of engagement, which will differ in each operation
and will apply to contingents from a large number of different forces.
Therefore, it is essential, where we are involved with forces from
other nations, that those compromises are reached&#151;again, before
we go on operations. It is essential, although this is not in the
nature of the Bill but in the reform of the United Nations, that we set
up machinery to make certain that the rules of engagement of all those
committed to United Nations operations are sorted out in the same way
as they should be for national operations. That remains
paramount.</p><p><a name="06101167000047"></a>I support Amendment
No. 62A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, because it
seems to me to be part of the glue that ties the three amendments
together. I therefore support the idea that the three should be taken
and considered in great detail before it is decided whether to include
them.</p><p><a name="06101167000048"></a><a name="spnew_136"></a><b><a name="06101167000164"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> I follow the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, in his expression that the rules of engagement should be
crystal clear. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Vincent, also called
for clear direction. My experience relates to the paratrooper trial
that took place in Colchester last September&#151;a year ago. One
problem that emerged in that case was that no one knew what were the
precise rules of engagement. The issue did not arise for several weeks;
in preparing the case, the prosecution had not set out what were the
rules of engagement.</p><p><a name="06101167000049"></a>The
defendants were of the view that they were operating at the
time&#151;which was after President Bush had declared victory and
soft caps were being worn by the British military&#151;on Northern
Ireland rules. It subsequently emerged that the rules of engagement had
not changed and that at the time, 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_293"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they were still operating on the rules of engagement for the invasion of
Iraq, which were far more drastic in neutralising the enemy than
anything that happened in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="06101167000050"></a>There
was no communication to the soldiers, who were simply on patrol in the
Maysan province, as to what they could and could not do&#151;at
least, no direct indication to them. I think that they were operating
on the basis that an officer had said to them, &#147;Okay, boys, now
it's Northern Ireland rules; we can all relax a bit&#148;. That is
about as far as it got. There was no crystal clear direction as to what
they should do.</p><p><a name="06101167000051"></a>Of course, the
rules of engagement change. The FRAGOS&#151;a phrase that will be
familiar to those with a military background&#151;seem to bring in
various additional rules for operations as they progress. The rules of
engagement may shift from time to time, but it is very important, if
there is a change, that the people charged with the
responsibility&#151;the people who will end up at a court
marshal&#151;are aware of the significance of the rules and of the
parameters within which they can act. I fully support the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101167000052"></a><a name="spnew_137"></a><b><a name="06101167000165"></a>Lord
Lyell of Markyate:</b> I, too, rise to support what
my noble friend Lord Kingsland said, including the fact that this is to
some extent a probing amendment. This is a very difficult subject. I
remember being involved in the development of the rules of engagement
when we were involved in Yugoslavia. This included cards&#151;I seem
to remember that they were, perhaps appropriately, yellow in those
days&#151;and getting the exact wording right. The card is what is
handed to the soldier, who is likely to find himself in the law court,
but behind it lie much more complex rules of engagement, to which the
noble Earl, Lord Attlee, rightly referred. It would greatly assist our
future debates on this matter if the Minister would either put at least
some of the rules of engagement into the Library or write to us with
copies of them, for use with appropriate discretion if necessary. I
hope that it is not necessary&#151;I hope that he can put them into
the Library&#151;but if he cannot, surely we can at least be provided
with them in sufficient detail so that we can all apply our minds to
the very difficult questions that can
arise.</p><p><a name="06101167000053"></a>It is essential that each
serviceman should be provided with the guidance and protection that he
needs. It should be remembered that the rules of engagement on the card
with which he is provided will almost inevitably require him to judge
whether his life is in danger and possibly to justify that at some
point. It may be necessary and right that he should do so. I can see
difficulties in putting the requirements on to the statute book, but it
is well worth trying to do so. At the heart of the Bill is a system of
military law that applies to all the services and which provides them
with a proper framework of law and a proper court framework, which is
largely the court-marshal framework, but which does not divorce them
from their position as civilians&#151;or at least as
citizens&#151;and that is part of the normal framework of the law so
far as possible. The rules of engagement are a very important part of
this, and we have a good deal more exploring to do, but I commend the
amendment as a good start.</p>

Craig of Radley:</b> Before I had given a lot of
thought to this topic, I did not think that the rules of engagement
should be in the Bill. Further thought on my part and the debate so far
have strongly reinforced my second view that there is a place for
covering rules of engagement in the Bill. Some excellent points have
been made by noble Lords and noble and gallant Lords, so I do not
intend to repeat them.</p><p><a name="06101167000055"></a>It is,
however, important to highlight the fact that the amendment would make
it absolutely clear that the rules of engagement have been endorsed by
Government and the Secretary of State, and that the military are
operating those rules of engagement, having been given the direction
and guidance of Ministers. Without that, there is a possible danger
that, in the post-hostilities phase, questions will be asked about
whether the military have been following the guidance and the direction
that they had been given. I therefore strongly endorse the amendment
because it brings to the fore the fact that it is a ministerial and
political initiation, which gives the guidance and direction to the
servicemen who will be carrying out the
operation.</p><h5><a name="06101167000148"></a>6

Inge:</b> I, too, support the inclusion of the rules
of engagement. Perhaps I may sound one word of caution: the Bill refers
to the Defence Council agreeing those rules of engagement. In my six
years of experience in London, I think that the Defence Council met
twice. If this is to be in the Bill, there must be a system that allows
the rules of engagement to be amended quickly if the hostilities on the
ground change one way or the
other.</p><p><a name="06101167000057"></a><a name="spnew_140"></a><b><a name="06101167000168"></a>Viscount
Slim:</b> I, too, support the
amendment. It seems that it is the luckless soldier who gets court
martialled if things go wrong, and there may be times when he is to
blame. However, by ducking the issue and not having something on it in
the Bill, the Government are wriggling and not taking
responsibility.</p><p><a name="06101167000058"></a>As I think
noble and gallant Lords have mentioned, responsibility should be driven
right up the chain of command. That is so important. It may be
unpopular, but perhaps a senior officer or a Minister will have to
explain himself in a court case, which would be no bad thing.</p><p><a name="06101167000059"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Campbell of Alloway, made some startling points. We were together on
the business in Ulster when we rehearsed it and explained it in your
Lordships&#146; House. Out of that came one thing that I would say to
the Minister: I understood that about 140 to 150 shots were fired in
that instance&#151;which is quite separate from other
instances&#151;and it was night time. Only one person was hit. I call
that extremely bad shooting and marksmanship. I would have had that
group out very early the next morning for some good battle firing
training. From that, when the noble Lord gives your Lordships&#146;
House figures on casualties in Afghanistan, I hope that the figures of
the Taliban dead are pretty accurate. Have the bodies been counted or
are we still shooting an awful lot of
ammunition?</p>

Drayson:</b> I will write separately to the noble
Viscount on his question relating to the situation in
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="06101167000061"></a>I
have listened carefully to the points made today, which reflect the
central importance of this issue. I will respond in considerable detail
because they are so important. However, before I do so, I should like
to make two points that go to the heart of the issues that we are
debating. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said that he understood that
soldiers who act in accordance with the rules of engagement would
therefore be in compliance with the law. It is important to say that
that is not the case. Soldiers are told that the rules of engagement
mean that the operations that they are undertaking are consistent with
the law, but it is still up to individual soldiers how they carry out
their role in these operations. That reflects the fact that the rules
of engagement are an operational framework, which I will come back to
in some detail in a moment. They are not a legal
document.</p><p><a name="06101167000062"></a>In response to one of
the important points made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, about the
situation where a soldier makes a mistake, it is important for me to
reassure the Committee that if a soldier acts in combat on his view of
the situation, even if it is wrong, he will not be guilty of a crime.
That is a fundamental principle, which we need to keep clearly in focus
as we consider this matter. These are difficult issues. A noble Lord
described the rules of engagement as a Byzantine process. I understand
why there is a feeling that that is the case, which is why I have taken
considerable trouble to give Members of the Committee an opportunity to
understand that process. We had a briefing earlier in the summer about
the rules of
engagement.</p><p><a name="06101167000063"></a>Fundamentally, from
listening to the argument across the Committee, I believe that there
has been, and still is in some quarters, a misunderstanding of the
functions of rules of engagement in the modern situation. The rules of
engagement give a framework for the conduct of an operation, which will
be consistent with the law. They are often extremely complex and are
always confidential. For them not to be confidential would put
information into the public domain; that information would then be
available to the enemy, which would be very prejudicial to the
interests of our Armed Forces. We need to recognise that these rules of
engagement are drafted by our Armed Forces personnel for operational
purposes. They are not drafted as statements of the law. It is vital
that they should not be. To draft them in such a way would make them
much less effective in operational circumstances. It is important that
we keep that very much in the forefront of our thinking. Rules of
engagement are not drafted like law.</p><p><a name="06101167000064"></a><a name="spnew_142"></a><b><a name="06101167000170"></a>Lord
Campbell of Alloway:</b> I apologise for intervening,
but we are coming to a crucial point. Does the noble Lord accept that,
at times in action, it is virtually impossible to distinguish between
rules of engagement and orders, and that you have to rely on a
presumption of compliance, throwing the burden on the Crown to disprove
and to show that there was intent not to comply? In other words, both
have to be carried together. They cannot be
separated.</p>



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_296"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 296</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101167000065"></a><a name="spnew_143"></a><b><a name="06101167000171"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Campbell, raises an
important point when describing the similarity between orders and the
detailed nature of rules of engagement. He has also emphasised the
point to which I alluded at the beginning of my response, which is the
importance of the intent to do wrong. The noble Lord is right. We have
heard on the Floor of this House as we have debated this issue in the
past how in combat this may be a split-second decision made in very
difficult circumstances. I remember vividly the description that the
noble Viscount made to me earlier this year of a soldier going into a
dark room, seeing a person and having to make a split-second decision
that could cost him his life if he got it wrong. We understand those
concerns. None the less, the issue is whether the person acted in
combat on his view of the situation as I have described it and what his
intent was in that situation. It is important to recognise that if he
acts on his view, even if he gets it wrong, he has not committed a
crime. Therefore, trying to use the rules of engagement framework,
which is designed to enable our commanders to carry out an operation
that may be extremely complex, as a document for protection under the
rule of law&#151;and so to combine those two things&#151;would act
in a way that was prejudicial to operational effectiveness.</p><p><a name="06101167000066"></a>It is important for us
also to bear in mind the fact that in some cases we need to leave
important decisions relating to these matters to the operational
commanders in the field. I know that the commanders welcome this
responsibility. The concern has been raised about whether our soldiers
are clear about the rules of engagement. This is a matter that both
personally and as a Minister I have asked soldiers about when visiting
them on operations, and I believe that they are clear. One might say,
&#147;The soldiers would say that to a Minister&#148;, but when one
reads some of the reports of operational commanders coming back from
theatre and their responses to whether they are clear about the rules
of engagement, I believe that they are clear and I do not believe that
we have a fundamental difficulty in this
area.</p><p><a name="06101167000067"></a>If the rules of engagement
were to have the force of law and provide an absolute defence, as is
being suggested, they would have to take away what I have described as
vital operational discretion. They would have to attempt to set out
exactly how each commander and each soldier should respond to every
situation. As the noble Earl said, losing that confidentiality would be
prejudicial. It is also true to say that we would lose the ability to
respond to the situation on the ground. The noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, made the point about the fluidity of situations and how
they may change. That is absolutely true. We have heard also the noble
and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, talk of the frequency with which the
Defence Council meets. We must recognise that we need a process that
enables the framework of the rules of engagement for a mission to be
modified and adapted by commanders as they see fit in the terms as they
find them when on operations. If we had to wait for revised rules of
engagement so as to make them compliant from a legal point of view,
that would of course delay the process.</p>



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_297"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 297</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101167000068"></a>We must also recognise
that the rules of engagement for a particular operation are
supplemented by detailed guidance and are adapted for commanders as
well as for soldiers, sailors and airmen according to their missions.
We heard the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, describe the cards and we
discussed them at the briefing meeting; they used to be yellow, as the
noble Earl pointed out. We believe that commanders at every level well
understand their responsibilities to ensure that those under their
command receive appropriate guidance and training and understand the
nature of their task. Commanders also understand when the cards,
briefings, training and orders are the best way to achieve that. The
cards are issued as guidance. A good example of this was the
aide-memoire issued to personnel deployed to Iraq during the Operation
TELIC war fighting phase, which concerned duties towards prisoners of
war and civilians under the law of armed conflict. I do not believe
that rules of engagement drafted as the amendment proposes would make
the individual any safer from prosecution. Rules of engagement can
never flout the law. If compliance with them gave an absolute defence,
the police, prosecutors and courts would have to analyse and dissect
them to establish whether the individual service man or woman was
guilty of an offence.</p><p><a name="06101167000069"></a>In
conclusion, I genuinely believe that this amendment would be
disastrous. It would tie the hands of our commanders and all our
service people; it would not simplify the law and it would not simplify
the sort of decisions that servicemen will always have to take in the
difficult circumstances and situations that I have described. It would
introduce legal encirclement where it does not exist
now.</p><h5><a name="06101167000149"></a>6.15

would be interested in his views on how this works when another nation

Drayson:</b> I will deal with Amendment No. 62
because it is important. The noble Lord is absolutely right: we have
situations where rules of engagement are provided for our service
personnel operating, using the example that he gave, with the Predator.
The amendment seeks to increase scrutiny of the rules of engagement of
other countries where our forces act under them. These are unusual
circumstances, but they do arise. UK personnel are permitted by the UK
Government to participate in operations while embedded in the forces of
another state. In that case, they may operate under the rules of
engagement of that state&#146;s forces.</p><p><a name="06101167000072"></a>Where UK personnel are acting under the
rules of engagement of another state, we ensure that the legal basis
for those rules and for the proposed targets is consistent with ours.
Embedded UK personnel will be provided with UK guidance to ensure that
they stay within the relevant UK domestic and international law, but
the proposed amendment would require the UK to insist that other states
turn their rules of engagement from an operational document into a

speaking to the previous amendment. As I have explained, the other
state would no doubt object to that process for the reasons that I have
already given. We know of no state in which the rules of engagement
have the force of law as described, so providing an absolute defence
against any charge. In short, for the reasons that I have outlined, I
ask noble Lords not to press Amendments Nos. 61 and
62.</p><p><a name="06101167000073"></a>Amendment
No. 62A would provide that conduct does not amount to a service offence
in three different circumstances: when the person was acting in the
execution of the law; when his conduct was obedient to a lawful order;
and when his conduct was obedient to an unlawful order that he did not
know was unlawful and could not reasonably have been expected to know
that. I touched on some of these issues at the beginning of my remarks
in order to make the central point. I recognise that the new clause
again reflects a genuine concern&#151;in the Ministry of Defence we
appreciate absolutely the genuine concerns over this issue; it is one
that we think about and take a lot of trouble with&#151;that a
soldier might be found guilty of a crime where there was no real fault
on his part. Although these concerns are justified, we believe that, in
the context of the overriding responsibility that a soldier has to act,
where he has acted,</p><ul><a name="06101167000144"></a>&#147;in execution of the
law&#148;,</ul><a name="06101167000122"></a>subsection
(a) provides a defence. I am not clear whether the clause seeks to
excuse a person who acts with a lawful excuse or one who acts because
he is engaged in some form of law enforcement. I think that it must
mean the second of these, because if a person has a lawful excuse for
his action, he is not guilty of a crime. Assuming that it refers to
conduct carried out during law enforcement, I recognise that such tasks
are sometimes dangerous and require quick thinking under pressure, as
is the case on force operations. But in such cases, again, a person
cannot be above the law. The law decides in such circumstances whether
a person&#146;s conduct was lawful on the basis of how that person
viewed the situation. So even if a person misread the situation, the
law would not condemn someone who had responded reasonably to
circumstances as they saw
them.<p><a name="06101167000074"></a>An order will not be
lawful if it requires a serviceman to commit an offence, so I do not
really understand the second case. If an order does not require him to
do anything illegal, but the serviceman decides to carry out the lawful
order in an unlawful way, then it is right that he should be guilty of
an offence. Thus, where a soldier is given a lawful order to capture a
town, for example, it does not mean that he can do anything to capture
it, such as killing prisoners or
civilians.</p><p><a name="06101167000075"></a>The third case
covered by the new clause arises where a person is ordered to do
something that is in fact unlawful but he does not know it and could
not reasonably be expected to know it. I cannot think of any
circumstances where a person charged with a serious offence on these
facts would not have a defence. Serious crimes, including war crimes,
require actual knowledge of the facts that make the act
unlawful.</p>

amendment would put our forces in a worse position than the law
requires. For a war crime&#151;and the same is true under
international law&#151;guilt depends upon actual knowledge. The
amendment suggests that a person should be guilty if he might
reasonably be expected to know the
facts.</p><p><a name="06101167000077"></a>Service
personnel do not and should not operate within a legal vacuum, here or
anywhere else in the world. Indeed, it is a hallmark of the respect in
which our Armed Forces are held around the world that they operate
within the law. But the law that governs their conduct and the defences
that are available to them are, I believe, both clear and reasonable.
This amendment would not help them. On that basis, I urge the noble
Lord not to press Amendment No.

Kingsland:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his
reply and to all noble and gallant, noble and learned and noble Lords
for their contributions. I am particularly grateful to the noble and
gallant Lords, Lord Inge, Lord Vincent and Lord Craig, the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, and the noble Viscount for their support for at least
the principle of the amendment, if not necessarily the detailed
drafting.</p><p><a name="06101167000079"></a>Between them they
raised some very important points about contemporary warfare. The noble
and gallant Lord, Lord Vincent, reminded us that we are dealing with a
very different kind of foe from the one we dealt with in the 20th
century. We are dealing with enemy soldiers who do not respect any
principles of international law, while we are required to do so. This
is a very different world from the one that we had only recently to
cope with.</p><p><a name="06101167000080"></a>The
noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, made an extremely penetrating
intervention in which he reminded us of the importance of political
commitment to our Armed Forces. We have seen some examples recently of
politicians trying to distance themselves from some of the things that
the Armed Forces have sought to do. It is absolutely critical for the
morale of our Armed Forces that politicians are seen to stand
four-square behind everything the forces do. In my submission, that
would be one of the beneficial effects of these amendments.</p><p><a name="06101167000081"></a>Our soldiers are now operating in a world
where we have an international criminal court and an international
criminal convention, and where some other nations might take the view
that we are engaged in unlawful warfare, making each soldier a criminal
in everything he does. These are very uncertain times for our Armed
Services and they need the confidence that we can give them by
including this amendment on the statute
book.</p><p><a name="06101167000082"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Garden, said one of the difficulties about an
amendment like this was the question of proportionality. A lot of
people think that proportionality was invented by the human rights
convention; but the concept has run through our military law for
hundreds of years. The principle is simply that a soldier has to use
reasonable force. If, in any circumstances, a soldier uses unreasonable
or disproportionate force, he contravenes the criminal law. That
applies not only to the black-letter law but also to the rules of
engagement. There is no difference.</p>

Garden:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord for
giving way. My only point is that subsection (7)
states:</p><ul><a name="06101167000137"></a>&#147;It shall be an
absolute defence to any
charge&#148;,</ul><a name="06101167000123"></a>that the
conduct falls within these rules. I wonder how proportionality works
under those
circumstances.<p><a name="06101167000084"></a><a name="spnew_148"></a><b><a name="06101167000176"></a>Lord
Kingsland:</b> The &#147;absolute&#148; refers to
the defence itself. But, of course, if a soldier who operates within
the framework of a rule of engagement acts disproportionately, he will
not have that defence. That must follow, not from anything in the Human
Rights Act, but from a very long-standing principle of the common law.
In any service context the force one uses, whether soldier, airman or
sailor, must be reasonable. That principle can never be removed. I
suppose it is possible that a Government could remove it by statute,
but I cannot think of any Government who would be foolish enough to do
so. It underlies everything and would obviously qualify the application
of any rule, whether it is the criminal law or a rule of
engagement.</p><p><a name="06101167000085"></a>I was therefore
extremely disappointed at the Minister&#146;s response. We accept
that the drafting of these amendments could be improved. Having heard
the points made by noble and gallant Lords, I would probably want to
come back on Report with something much simpler as far as Amendment No.
60 is concerned. In addition, we very much take the point made by the
noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, about the defence cuts.</p><p><a name="06101167000086"></a>The Minister suggested that the rules of
engagement&#151;I am trying to remember exactly what his words
were&#151;provided simply an operational framework. That would seem
to provide no comfort at all to our Armed Forces, and I am very puzzled
by it. Is the Minister saying that, if a soldier operates within the
rules of engagement and uses reasonable force in the circumstances,
that should not be an absolute defence to his conduct? Would the
Minister be prepared to see a newspaper tomorrow morning report him as
saying that, despite the fact that a soldier conforms with a rule of
engagement and exercises reasonable force in the circumstances, he is
capable of being prosecuted for murder? Is that what he is
saying?</p><p><a name="06101167000087"></a>The Minister has not
responded to that so I will leave him to think about it. Meanwhile, I
beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101167000088"></a><a name="spnew_149"></a><b><a name="06101167000177"></a>Earl

the rules of engagement are confidential and we are not in a position
to go through the detail of them with noble Lords.</p><p><a name="06101167000091"></a>In response to what
the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has just said, I reiterate that it is
not just a question of whether the individual soldier has operated in
compliance with the rules of engagement; it is still up to the
individual how he carries out the task. That individual responsibility
cannot be overridden by the operational orders and operational
framework as described in the rules of engagement. Does the noble Lord
accept the point&#151;which I have, perhaps, laboured&#151;that the
purpose of the rules of engagement is primarily to enable our
commanders to operate effectively in the field? We must make sure that
in our wish to provide a framework to strengthen the defence for our
Armed Forces personnel we do not prejudice the whole purpose of the
operation and of the rules of engagement. I would be interested to know
whether the noble Lord accepts that
point.</p><p><a name="06101167000092"></a><a name="spnew_151"></a><b><a name="06101167000179"></a>Lord

noble Earl said: I should like to speak to Amendments Nos. 65 to 68 as
well. The service discipline Acts refer extensively to the term
&#147;commanding officer&#148;. Service people will normally know
who their commanding officer is, but those reading the Bill and the
existing service discipline Acts may not realise that the power of the
commanding officer can be delegated, particularly under the summary
dealing regulations&#151;often, in the Army, to the officer
commanding, who would be a major, or the equivalents in other services.
The orderly officer may have some of the powers of a commanding
officer, particularly to put service persons in custody temporarily,
immediately and maybe in an emergency, when the commanding officer is
not available. It would be helpful if the Minister could explain the
extent of this ability to delegate the powers of the commanding
officer.</p><p><a name="06101167000110"></a>On
Amendments Nos. 65 to 68, the Bill allows the commanding officer to
deal summarily with junior officers. This is a new development. As the
Bill is drafted, the commanding officer&#151;a lieutenant-colonel,
say&#151;can discipline a major, who could be his second-in-command.
Many commanding officers I have talked 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_303"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 303</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to are, to say the least, uncomfortable with the possibility of having
to discipline their second-in-command. Can the Minister assure me that
the summary dealing regulations will not allow the commanding officer
to deal with his immediate subordinate officers and that the
regulations will provide a two-rank gap between the commanding officer
and the officer he is dealing with? If he can, why does the Bill not
provide for that in the first
place?</p><p><a name="06101167000111"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 68
makes it clear that volunteer reservists are subject to military law
whenever they are on military premises. At present, they are no longer
subject to military law after the end of the dismissal parade, which
leaves a bit of a gap in service law. I hope the Minister can reassure
me that the Bill deals with that. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101167000112"></a><a name="spnew_160"></a><b><a name="06101167000188"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> I will deal with Amendment No. 64 first
and then go on to Amendments Nos. 65 to 68.</p><p><a name="06101167000113"></a>Amendment No. 64 seeks to provide that
every person shall readily be able to determine who his commanding
officer is. I understand that, through this amendment and others he has
tabled about the terms &#147;officer&#148; and &#147;superior
officer&#148;, the noble Earl seeks clarity for soldiers, sailors and
airmen. I am pleased that we have a common aim in that
regard.</p><p><a name="06101167000114"></a>As the noble Earl has
said, I have written to him on these issues. I hope that he is
reassured that through the regulations we will be able to achieve the
clarity he seeks. I am willing to meet with him to discuss that
further. I recognise that in the Bill overall, there is a significant
reliance on trust in certain aspects. The regulations that will be
brought forward will meet some of the issues which noble Lords have
raised in a number of briefings. I will be happy to meet the noble Earl
to go through that further.</p><p><a name="06101167000115"></a>The
combined effect of Amendments Nos. 65 to 67 would be to reduce the
highest rank of officers that may be dealt with summarily from
commander and equivalents to lieutenant and equivalents, to remove the
power to deal summarily with warrant officers, and to require the
commanding officer to be at least two ranks above the accused before he
may hear a charge summarily. Perhaps I may explain the position under
the current service discipline Acts.</p><p><a name="06101167000116"></a>For the Army and the RAF, warrant
officers and officers up to the rank of lieutenant-colonel or wing
commander are dealt with summarily by an appropriate superior
authority&#151;that is, a senior officer of one-star or two-star rank
who has powers of punishment over those individuals. In the Royal Navy,
warrant officers and officers up to the rank of commander are dealt
with by the commanding officer if he is at least two ranks above the
rank of the accused and otherwise by the appropriate superior
authority.</p><p><a name="06101167000117"></a>Under the Bill, we
have removed the concept of an appropriate superior authority and
provide instead for these individuals to be dealt with by the
commanding officer. But it will, as now, be possible to appoint a
commanding officer to an individual for a specific purpose in
regulations. So the Bill retains the current power to hear charges
summarily against all 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_304"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ranks up to those of commander and equivalents, but the regulations will
ensure that they are heard by an officer of an appropriately senior
level. Specifically, the commanding officer must be two ranks above the
accused. I trust the noble Earl is reassured on those two
aspects.</p><p><a name="06101167000118"></a>Finally,
Amendment No. 68 would make reservists subject to service law when on a
service base, ship or aircraft. Clauses 360 and 361 set out the
circumstances in which reservists are subject to service law. These
provide that they will be subject to service law when they are carrying
out any activities as
reservists.</p><p><a name="06101171000001"></a>To
extend this in the way in which the noble Lord&#146;s amendment seeks
would be to make it unnecessarily wide. The services have no desire to
extend the times when reservists are subject to service law in this
way, and believe that it is important to link the times when a
reservist is subject to service law to the activities in which he is
engaged, rather than where he is located.</p><p><a name="06101171000002"></a>Additionally, the Bill already provides
that a person is &#147;subject to service discipline&#148; while he
is in one of Her Majesty&#146;s ships afloat or one of Her
Majesty&#146;s aircraft in flight. This applies to a reservist as
well as anyone else who is not subject to service law. On the basis of
this explanation, I ask the noble Earl to withdraw his amendments to
this
clause.</p><p><a name="06101171000003"></a><a name="spnew_161"></a><b><a name="06101171000157"></a>Earl

other amendments in this grouping. They are an odd ragbag and are

designed to be helpful and to clarify what Clause 91 is about. One has
to get to the very last section to discover that it is about commanding
officers and how they are delegated. My amendment would clarify that
from the outset and make the clause easier to
read.</p><p><a name="06101171000042"></a>I have
tabled a number of amendments toClause 100: Amendments Nos. 78
and 82 to 86. They have been grouped together because they all have
something to do with time. Amendment No. 78 would put some limit on how
long a review can be postponed if a commanding officer is not readily
available. I propose 96 hours, although I have no particular 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_307"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>attachment to that figure if there is a better one, but I feel that
noble Lords would want to know that there is a time limit of some sort
for this process.</p><p><a name="06101171000043"></a>Amendment No. 82 also
relates to time periods in the review of custody by the commanding
officer in Clause 100. The word &#147;approximate&#148; is used for
the various time limits. I am not a lawyer, but
&#147;approximate&#148; seems to be a rather strange word to use.
Why can we not define maxima, rather than just leave it up to our
learned colleagues to debate how approximate
&#147;approximate&#148;
is?</p><p><a name="06101171000044"></a>Amendments Nos. 83 to 86 are
rather more serious. They would set a unified cut-off age rather than
have some provisions that apply for age 17 and others for those aged
under 18. Following the Deepcut inquiry, it is clear that we need to
take special measures for under-18 year-olds when the Armed Forces are
dealing with them. Therefore, wherever the age 17 appears in the Bill,
I have raised it to age 18. I do not doubt that the Minister will tell
us that the legislation is merely in line with civil law, but how
under-18s are used in the service environment is a different matter. I
beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101171000045"></a><a name="spnew_170"></a><b><a name="06101171000166"></a>Earl

Drayson:</b> Amendment No. 76 is unnecessary. Clause
91 allows a commanding officer to authorise any member of the Armed
Forces who is not a service policeman to exercise similar powers to
enter and search premises to make an arrest as those afforded to the
service police under Clause 90.  This reflects the fact that
service police are not always readily available.
 </p><p><a name="06101171000047"></a>I
will deal now with Amendments Nos. 78 and 82, which relate to the
regime for custody. These provisions are very little changed from the
current regime under the SDAs, which were introduced in the Armed
Forces Discipline Act 2000, which themselves were based upon provisions
in the Bail Act 1976 and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.
With regard to Amendment No. 82, for example, the provision regarding
timings being approximate in the Bill is identical to the PACE
provision and allows the arrangements to work in
practice.</p><p><a name="06101171000048"></a>Amendment No. 78 could
have the effect of extending the period which the commanding officer
alone can authorise an accused to be kept in custody without charge,
without making an application to a judge advocate. In the interests of
the accused, this should not be a power that applies in all cases. We
have, however, already provided, in Clause 102, for a commanding
officer to be able to do this in extremis where it is not practicable
to get before a judge advocate within the 48-hour period, but this is
subject to tight control. This is already the position under the
current service discipline Acts and we believe that it works well in
practice.</p><p><a name="06101171000049"></a>I hope that with these
reassurances the noble Lord feels able not to press his
amendments.</p>



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_308"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101171000050"></a>Amendments Nos. 83, 85 and 86 together
relate to age. They amendments would raise the relevant age limit in
each clause from 17 to 18. Clause 106 sets out the conditions which a
judge advocate must have regard to when he is considering whether to
authorise post-charge custody. One condition is that the judge advocate
is satisfied that the accused should be kept in service custody for his
own protection or, if he is aged under 17, for his own welfare or in
his own
interests.</p><p><a name="06101171000051"></a>Clause
107 sets out what other factors a judge advocate should consider when
releasing an accused person from custody. Subsection (3) permits the
judge advocate to require the accused to comply with certain
requirements. These are generally the same as those which apply in
civilian proceedings. Among them, at Subsection 3(d) is that a person
who is under 17 may be subjected to certain requirements by a judge
advocate on or after release if the judge advocate considers it
necessary for the welfare of the accused or in his interests.</p><p><a name="06101171000052"></a>Clause 110 deals with the situations,
post-charge, or post-conviction, when a commanding officer may be
permitted to order the arrest of a person who is not in service
custody. Subsection (3) permits a commanding officer to order the
taking of a person into service custody when certain conditions exist.
These conditions are generally the same as those which apply in
relation to civilian proceedings, as the noble Lord has guessed. One
condition is that a person who is under 17 may be taken into custody
for his own welfare or in his own
interests.</p><p><a name="06101171000053"></a>We
do not think that in any of these three clauses there is a case for the
services to have a higher age limit to that which applies in civilian
proceedings. The effect in each case would be to make an accused more
susceptible to custody than would be the case if they were to appear
before a civilian court, notwithstanding the wide range of appropriate
steps short of custody which are also available to the chain of
command. For these reasons I ask noble Lords not to press their
amendments.</p><p><a name="06101171000054"></a>I will finally deal
with the second aspect of these amendments, which is in relation to
Clause 106 only&#151;Amendment No. 84. This clause sets out the
conditions a judge advocate must consider when determining whether to
authorise keeping an accused in custody under Clause 105. Conditions A
to D are generally the same as those which apply in relation to
civilian proceedings. Among them, condition B is that a person who is
under 17 may be kept in service custody for his own welfare or in his
own interests.</p><p><a name="06101171000055"></a>The purpose of
Amendment No. 84 appears to be clarification. Although noble Lords are
of course right to point out that condition D applies only in the
circumstances set out in Clause 109, that is already the effect of
Clauses 106 to 109 when read together. The amendment would not change
the substantive position and the clause as drafted is, I believe,
sufficiently clear. I would therefore ask that these amendments be
withdrawn.</p><p><a name="06101171000056"></a><a name="spnew_172"></a><b><a name="06101171000168"></a>Lord

situation&#151;probably better than I could have done. We were trying
to be helpful with the two amendments that act as clarification without

hard.</p><p><a name="06101171000057"></a>On Amendment No. 78, I
shall look at the Minister&#146;s remarks in <I>Hansard</I>, because
I could not work out what the maximum time was if special circumstances
pertained. If he tells me that it is sufficiently constrained&#151;I
am sure that it is&#151;we can look and see how it is constrained and
decide how we come back on
that.</p><p><a name="06101171000058"></a><a name="spnew_173"></a><b><a name="06101171000169"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> I shall try to be helpful to the noble
Lord. The maximum time that an accused may be kept in custody under
these provisions is 96 hours. The commanding officer can authorise up
to 48 hours and thereafter he must apply to a judge advocate, who can
then authorise continued detention up to a maximum of 96
hours.</p><p><a name="06101171000059"></a><a name="spnew_174"></a><b><a name="06101171000170"></a>Lord

Amendment No. 82, I remain surprised that the word approximate is used,
but if that is how legislation is done, so be it. On the question of
the cut-off for 17 or 18 year-olds, I am afraid that I remain concerned
that the Ministry of Defence does not seem to have taken to heart the
recommendations of the Blake review into Deepcut. Military life is not
the same as civilian life; there is a special duty of care in the
military to those who are under 18. I shall come back to it under later
amendments in the Bill, in a more serious way. But I shall read what

amendment. I speak also to Amendment No. 208, which is consequential. I
am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, who took a lot of
trouble and laid on an informal meeting to try to resolve a little
local difficulty that arose on Second Reading. I am also grateful for
his letter, a long exposition that I received only this morning.
Fortunately, by chance I met the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Goldsmith, in the Guards Chapel and we agreed that he was the
gatekeeper to the citadel, as it were, and would speak to the matter
tonight. I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for
that.</p><p><a name="06101171000109"></a>I say at the outset that
it is accepted that the Trooper Williams fiasco cannot be repeated, as
this Bill removes the power of a commanding officer to dismiss a charge
without any form of hearing and before consideration of the SPA.
Further, an amendment has been tabled to provide that the senior
service police shall inform the commanding officer when a serious case
is referred to the Director of Service Prosecutions. It is also
accepted that only in exceptional circumstances will cases be heard in
the civil jurisdiction. So we have made a lot of progress under the
construction of the Bill. But the process under which resort to the
civil jurisdiction is sought and granted by the Attorney-General by
ordinance <I>ex cathedra</I> in the exercise of absolute discretion
without notice, means of objection or reasons, which may not be
challenged in any court of law, remains in the Bill. There was some
discussion about that on Second Reading but, as I see it, and as I
think the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, sees it, it is in the
Bill. It is not removed. It may be qualified only by statute as
proposed by this amendment. The object of the amendment is to seek to
ensure that this administrative decision is exercised fairly according
to the tenets of natural justice within the law, in the interests of
the service and to alleviate the concern of noble and gallant Lords.
Their main concern is with the cases of murder, manslaughter and breach
of international convention&#151;which is of particular importance to
the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, who spoke about it. The concern
is as to the deprivation of the legitimate expectation of trial by
court martial&#151;of which there was some discussion previously
today&#151;and to its the effect on the integrity and authority of
the chain of command and on morale and discipline.</p><p><a name="06101171000110"></a>This amendment is a measure of safeguard
and would wholly alleviate that concern. The High Court would decide
whether there was a realistic prospect of conviction and whether it was
in the public interest that the trial should take place under the civil
jurisdiction. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, made it plain
to me that this safeguard of the High Court would remove and wholly
alleviate any concern of noble and gallant Lords. The opinion of the
Crown Prosecution Service, if sought, would no longer be relied upon,
and the rules of procedure of the High Court would apply as to any
other application for leave. In all other cases the rules of procedure
under the Bill would provide for notice of the substance of the grounds
on which the decision to ordain trial under the civil jurisdiction was
made and 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_314"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 314</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>would afford means of objection. That is in accordance with the
fundamental concept of natural justice and is as referred to by the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, on a previous
occasion.</p><p><a name="06101171000111"></a>I do not want to take
up much time. It is accepted that it is not the purpose or the province
of the judiciary to decide whether a person should be prosecuted unless
there is an abuse of process. The question arising here is not whether
the serviceman should be prosecuted, but under which jurisdiction and
whether it should be under the civil jurisdiction or by court martial.
The application of the Attorney-General to the High Court for leave to
proceed under the civil jurisdiction is not to seek a prosecution. The
Attorney-General is answerable to Parliament for the conduct of his
functions, but as yet he is not, and perhaps never will be, answerable
to the court of law for compliance with the law in the discharge of his
functions in accordance with natural justice. It may be that some
undertaking could be given to Parliament.</p><p><a name="06101171000112"></a>What should be done? That is a matter for
your Lordships. What is the view of my noble and learned friends and
other noble and learned Lords who have served as Attorney-General? What
should be the response of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith? I
think I know the response of my noble friend Lord Kingsland; he is not
madly enthusiastic about this exercise, putting it mildly. But it is
not a matter for any one person; it is a matter for the consideration
of the Committee. I am not seeking it today; and unless I have a
measure of some support I may well not seek it again. I beg to
move.</p><h5><a name="06101171000156"></a>7.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06101171000113"></a><a name="spnew_184"></a><b><a name="06101171000180"></a>Lord
Mayhew of Twysden:</b> My noble friend beside me has
rendered the Committee a signal service in the tenacity and
perspicacity with which he has ventilated a matter of considerable
anxiety. I do not think that it can really be doubted that in the
notorious case concerning Trooper Williams, the
Attorney-General&#146;s decision to refer the case to a civilian
court caused great surprise. It had not been widely recognised that
such a discretion of the Attorney-General existed, and had existed for
a considerable time, particularly after a commanding officer had, by
virtue of his own decision dismissing a charge, effectively blocked any
further proceedings against the defendant on the same charge in the
military system. So there was a great deal of surprise.</p><p><a name="06101171000114"></a>It also attracted much
criticism partly because, for Trooper Williams, the decision came out
of the blue. He had been, as it were, in lay terms acquitted by the
commanding officer, and he thought that that was that. It came out of
the blue partly because there was no warning and no opportunity for him
to make representations to any authority&#151;the Attorney-General or
anyone else&#151;and partly because it was thought that there really
ought not in fairness be a second bite of the cherry for the
prosecution after the commanding officer had dismissed the charge of
murder on military legal advice&#151;advice which, incidentally, was
later shown to be sound. So it has been a pretty controversial case,
and rightly so, ever since. I agree with Ministers and 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_315"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>others with military experience that the effective blocking by a
commanding officer of any further proceedings in the military system
cannot really be justified. The removal of that possibility is achieved
by the Bill. Obviously, there are considerations of conflict of
interest that arise in a way that could not really justify the
continuance of that arrangement.</p><p><a name="06101171000115"></a>My
noble friend&#146;s amendment raises the interesting and important
question of whether the Attorney-General should continue to have sole
and unqualified discretion to order that there should be processed in
the civilian system and not the military system any charge against a
service person of murder, manslaughter or breach of the Geneva
Convention. That is a very important issue. I am afraid, and my noble
friend knows this, that I cannot go along with him on the proposition
that the Attorney-General must first obtain the leave of the High
Court, on the terms proposed in the new clause or indeed on any terms.
My reason is this. The Attorney-General is the guardian of the public
interest under our constitutional arrangements, and in my view much
depends on no inroads being made into that doctrine and practice. It
may not look as though it can work well, but it does work, has worked
and will continue to work well; and I, for my part, do not think that
it ought to be disturbed. I can see faces all around me who I suspect
are concealing thoughts that go along the lines of, &#147;Well, he
would say that, wouldn&#146;t he? He has been one&#148;. But I do
believe that that proposition stands up to the test of practical
efficiency and
serviceability.</p><p><a name="06101174000001"></a>There
is another difficulty in that the issue that would have to be put to
the High Court might properly and probably not entertain a judge. He
probably would say, &#147;This is not justiciable in a court of law;
it should be a matter for the discretion of the Attorney-General, who
is, rightly, responsible to
Parliament&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101174000002"></a>But that is
not the end of the matter, because my noble friend has done an
important service&#151;he has highlighted the unsatisfactory
character of a power to direct a civilian trial without affording to
the accused any opportunity to make representations on the matter. A
serviceman or servicewoman is in a unique position&#151;we are
talking about offences that can be tried only by court martial and for
which the accused may well have a legitimate expectation that he will
be tried by court
martial.</p><p><a name="06101174000003"></a>I
paid attention in our earlier debates in particular to what was said
more than once by the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, about the importance in
the eyes of the Government of sustaining a separate and comprehensive
system of military justice. All of us understand why that is important.
Therefore, it may well be envisaged that an accused may have a
&#147;legitimate expectation&#148;&#151;in the language of the
law&#151;that he will be tried within that system. Certainly, he may
have a proper desire to be tried by court martial and that should be
respected, even if the Attorney-General ultimately decides within his
constitutional discretion that that desire cannot be
met.</p><p><a name="06101174000004"></a>The way
to achieve that is, surely, to require the Attorney, if he is minded to
go for a civilian process, to give notice to the servicemen and to tell
him that he can make representations on the matter if he so 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_316"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 316</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>wishes. That is a lacuna in terms of fairness and it can be filled. If
my noble friend&#146;s scheme were modified to achieve just that, but
no more, I would support it&#151;and I hope that Ministers would do
so.</p><p><a name="06101174000005"></a><a name="spnew_185"></a><b><a name="06101174000029"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> Perhaps I
may raise with the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General the
much-related point regarding the additional jurisdiction of the court
martial to hear and determine cases involving murder, manslaughter,
rape and treason that are committed in this country. As the noble and
learned Lord will know, and as we were told in our earlier debates,
since the 16th and 17th centuries, those offences could be heard only
in the civil courts. This Bill provides for a dramatic extension of
jurisdiction to enable courts martial to deal with such cases, even if
the offences are committed in this
country.</p><p><a name="06101174000006"></a>Who will decide whether
the trial is civil or for a court martial? If a serious offence happens
overseas, there are arrangements between the local jurisdiction and
British forces as to which should have precedence. In this country,
where there is duel jurisdiction for matters other than the serious
offences to which I referred, the Queen&#146;s Regulations set out
various ways in which the choice can be made. It is usually made by the
chief officer of police for the district within which the offence was
committed and that is a matter of liaison between him the commanding
officer.</p><p><a name="06101174000007"></a>What
happens now? Will the Attorney-General himself determine whether there
should be a trial by court martial for a murder committed in this
country, or should it be decided by the Crown Court, or will someone
else decide this issue? Will it be the Director of Service Prosecutions
or the Director of Public Prosecutions? The mechanism by which that
choice will be made is not spelt out in the Bill and that question is
very much related to the matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell
of Alloway. I hope that he forgives me for speaking to his amendment in
this
way.</p><p><a name="06101174000008"></a><a name="spnew_186"></a><b><a name="06101174000030"></a>Lord
Kingsland:</b> I have been named by my noble friend
Lord Campbell of Alloway as one Member of your Lordships&#146; House
who will not support the amendment. I freely admit that that is the
case. It is not that I in any way decry the ingenuity that lies behind
the drafting. It is a characteristically ingenious amendment and there
are circumstances in which it would be welcome; but I am opposed to it
for a number of
reasons.</p><p><a name="06101174000009"></a>The
first of those is that given by my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew
of Twysden. The constitutional position is that the Attorney-General is
accountable to Parliament, not for the substance of his decisions, but
for the way in which he makes his decisions, for his independence and
for the probity that he brings to bear on his decisions. He is not
accountable for the decision itself. That is a responsibility that our
constitution gives to him alone. It is not right that even a towering
figure in our nation such as the Lord Chief Justice or another senior
judge should be in a position to second guess that
decision.</p>

Lord, Lord Mayhew, raised a related issue: what about the legitimate
expectation of the serviceman himself? If such a serviceman had sat in
the Gallery this afternoon, he would have heard the Minister underpin
the Government&#146;s approach to the Bill as one that integrated
service disciplinarylaw with criminal law. It provides, as the
noble Lord, Lord Drayson, said on a number of occasions, a
comprehensive legal system. It must follow, as my noble and learned
friend said, that a serviceman would have an expectation that if it
were alleged that he had committed an offence, he would be tried within
the military system; and that if a different decision were made, he
should be allowed to have a view about that and to be able to express
it. There is something to be said about having that position reflected
in the Bill; but, with great respect, it should not be reflected in the
way that my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway sought. The
serviceman should be able to make representations, perhaps to the
Attorney-General himself.</p><p><a name="06101174000011"></a>The
other reason why I am not inclined to support my noble friend&#146;s
amendment is that it is unnecessary. At Second Reading, the Minister
made it crystal clear that, in future, all servicemen who are engaged
in operations in circumstances where there is a question over the
legality of their behaviour would be prosecuted by the new services
prosecutor and that all such prosecutions would be heard by a court
martial. The Minister made that statement unequivocally. It follows
that the problem raised by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway,
would not arise.</p><p><a name="06101174000012"></a>I am confident
that the position is now clear and that the logic of the Bill flows
from that position. The Bill clearly provides a comprehensive system
for criminal law in relation to servicemen. If that is so, we will have
a watertight system whereby criminal proceedings would end up in a
court martial. We do not need a mechanism to deal with the transfer of
cases from the military system to the civilian system, because that is
not the Government&#146;s
intention.</p><h5><a name="06101174000028"></a>7.30

Attorney-General (Lord Goldsmith):</b> I thought it
right to speak to this amendment myself because it relates to my role,
it arises out of the Trooper Williams case and I believe that, by doing
so, I would respond to the wishes of the Committee. I made that
decision before fortuitously meeting the noble Lord recently and
telling him that. Therefore, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord
Drayson, who has charge of the Bill in this House, for giving way to me
on this amendment. I do not need to say anything about Amendment No.
208, which is entirely consequential. I may touch briefly on Clause
126, which is in this grouping, but I do not know whether the noble
Earl, Lord Attlee, is intending to oppose the Question whether the
clause shall stand part. He shakes his head, so perhaps I shall explain
it briefly and say no
more.</p><p><a name="06101174000014"></a>Like the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew of Twysden, I acknowledge with
admiration the clarity and energy with which the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell of Alloway, has pursued his concern in previous debates and
today. I suggest, and shall be suggesting to him, 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_318"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that by doing so he has achieved the essence of what he wanted to
do&#151;not perhaps by the route he now suggests, but he has achieved
it in substance. His concern and that of other noble Lords arose out of
the Trooper Williams case. I do not propose to rehearse the facts
again. I am a little tempted to do so by one or two remarks with which
I do not agree, but I am going to issue a very firm ordinance of
self-denial. We have rehearsed the issue in this House fully. There are
some differences of opinion, but what matters now is the future and not
the past.</p><p><a name="06101174000015"></a>The
noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, has rightly acknowledged that the
particular circumstances that gave rise to the Trooper Williams case
will not arise again because of the provision in the Bill, if passed,
under which a commanding officer will not be able to stop the service
prosecuting authority ever considering whether a case should be
proceeded with in the military system. That is what happened. The only
way that a case could then be considered by a prosecutor was in the
civilian system, and that is what took place. The Bill will remove the
power of the commanding officer to dismiss a charge in those
circumstances.</p><p><a name="06101174000016"></a>As
the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, said, there are further
changes which are highly relevant. When the Director of Service
Prosecutions considers a case and decides not to proceed with
it&#151;this is under Clause 126&#151;he will have the power to
give a direction which would, in effect, bar any further service or
civilian prosecution for the same
offence.</p><p><a name="06101174000017"></a>In addition, where the
service police investigate allegations of serious offences and decide
that there is sufficient evidence to charge, they will have to refer
the case to the Director of Service Prosecutions. As an amendment
tabled by the Government makes clear, the service police must, as soon
as reasonably practicable, notify the commanding officer of such a
referral. It is the intention to provide in regulations made under the
Bill rules that enable the commanding officer to put any relevant
factors before the service police and the Director of Service
Prosecutions before the service police refer the case to the director
and before the director decides whether to
charge.</p><p><a name="06101174000018"></a>I believe that those
amendments as a package meet the concerns highlighted by the noble
Lord, Lord Campbell, and by other noble and noble and gallant Lords.
Therefore, I venture to suggest that his concerns have been listened to
and have substantially been
addressed.</p><p><a name="06101174000019"></a>I
have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that I do not deal with
this amendment on the basis that he has put forward&#151;that is,
that the possibility of a case being in the civilian system will not
arise again. That simply is not right. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas
of Gresford, noted and as I have said before, it is a commonplace that
in cases which arise out of conduct in this country, there are
prosecutions in the civilian court. So far as concerns action overseas,
active service and operational circumstances, I have said&#151;it has
been said by others&#151;that I envisage that a civilian prosecution
will take place only in exceptional circumstances. I have not said, and
I do not believe

unnecessary because we have met the concerns. I want to come back to
one point but not for the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord

This afternoon, the Minister has been at pains to
emphasise&#151;particularly in the context of the attempt by the
noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, to remove Clauses 42 to 49 from
the Bill&#151;that the intention is to provide a completely
comprehensive, self-contained system.</p><p><a name="06101174000025"></a>The noble and learned
Lord the Attorney-General was suggesting that there might be
circumstances where this watertight approach is not as watertight as we
all thought. The fundamental issue here is whether that means that the
noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General believes that he has the
constitutional power to remove a case from the military procedure at
some stage after it has started and switch it to the civilian
procedure. I entirely accept that extra-territorial offences such as
murder and manslaughter could be started in the civilian courts. That
is plain. But the situation which has concerned me, and which I thought
the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, had covered at Second Reading, is one
where proceedings are begun by the Director of Service Prosecutions and
are then taken out of the services loop by, I suppose, the DPP under
the superintendence of the Attorney-General and switched into the
civilian loop. I do not believe that the noble and learned Lord the
Attorney-General has the constitutional power to do that, and I want to
be reassured that it is not his intention in future to so
act.</p><p><a name="06101174000026"></a><a name="spnew_191"></a><b><a name="06101174000035"></a>Lord

and I shall tell the Committee in a moment. The noble and learned Lord,
Lord Goldsmith, has got it totally right. It was an outrage to be told

Something has come of it and we have gone some
way.</p><p><a name="06101174000027"></a>I
want to add one point. My noble friend Lord Kingsland asked two leading
questions of the noble Lord, Lord Drayson. They were loaded. You could
see that they were loaded with the art of a really fine
practitioner&#151;my noble friend is expert at it. The Minister fell
into the trap and answered &#147;yes&#148; to them both. So then my
noble friend Lord Kingsland turned round to me and said, &#147;Well,
there it is. There is no object; this is just a nonsense&#148;. I
just smiled because I thought, &#147;What else can you do?&#148;.
That is my side of it and I am very pleased to have been vindicated
publicly.</p><p><a name="06101179000002"></a><a name="spnew_192"></a><b><a name="06101179000051"></a>Lord
Goldsmith:</b> I do like this
place.</p><p><a name="06101179000003"></a>I think that I have been
quite clear with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on what I believe is
the position. I shall say one more thing. The decision on whether
prosecutions take place is not a matter for the Government. Ultimately
it is a decision for the Attorney-General as the senior civilian
authority. If the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, of whose forensics I am
very well aware, has somehow trapped my noble friend, that will not
prevent the responsibilities that I have constitutionally being
exercised. I am going to move
on.</p><p><a name="06101179000004"></a>Why do I
not accept the route that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, has proposed?
It is for the reasons given by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew,
and the first reason but not the second reason given by the noble Lord,
Lord Kingsland. The background is that there are many hundreds of cases
each year in which the UK military and civilian police prosecuting
authorities decide whether offences committed by UK servicemen in this
country should be tried in military or civilian courts. In those cases,
as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said, they decide without any apparent
difficulty guidance set out in Queen's regulations. The noble Lord,
Lord Thomas, asked whose decision was final. I believe that that was
clearly stated by my noble friend Lord Drayson when he correctly stated
on Amendment No. 59A that ultimately the civilian authorities have the
final say. If there is a disagreement between the prosecuting
authorities, ultimately that would mean as the House of Lords has said
a decision by the Attorney-General as the senior civilian authority.
So, ultimately the matter is for the Attorney-General. So, too, in
overseas cases where the United Kingdom civilian courts and the courts
martial have concurrent jurisdiction. That is&#151;I disagree with
the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, as he knows&#151;under the
constitutional responsibility for the enforcement of the law recognised
in the case of Bastow by the House of Lords and as part of my
superintendence as a prosecuting authority. It is not in the Bill; it
is part of our constitutional
arrangements.</p><p><a name="06101179000005"></a>Judges
have a crucial role in safeguarding against any abuse of the court
process. You can make an application for an abuse to stop a case on the
grounds of abuse. Equally you can apply to a court which is trying a
case to say that there is no evidence to support it and no case to
answer. Both of those applications were made to Mrs Justice Hallett.
The first problem in

judge to do what I would respectfully say is making a prosecuting
decision. He is asked to consider two questions: is there a realistic
prospect of conviction; and is it in the public interest to go to a
particular place? That is exactly the decision that the prosecutor has
to make. Not only does that undermine the constitutional position of
the Attorney-General, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, said,
it also undermines the constitutional position of the judges. Some of
the cases are set out in a letter sent by the noble Lord, Lord Drayson,
to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell.</p><p><a name="06101179000006"></a>I shall read only one
reference by Lord Dilhorne, a very distinguished judge and former Law
Officer and Lord Chancellor, who
said:</p><ul><a name="06101179000044"></a>&#147;A judge must keep
out of the arena. He should not have or appear to have any
responsibility for the institution of a prosecution. The functions of
prosecutors and of judges must not be blurred. If a judge has power to
decline to hear a case because he does not think it should be brought,
then it soon may be thought that the cases he allows to proceed are
cases brought with his consent or
approval&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101179000007"></a>What would
happen if a serviceman was being prosecuted in the civilian court
because a judge said it was right to do so? Is there not a risk that
the jury will think, &#147;Well the judge thinks this is a good
case&#148;. Would not the serviceman in those circumstances think
that he was at risk of not getting a fair trial? So I have that
objection as
well.</p><p><a name="06101179000008"></a>I come
to the one point where I recognise the point made by the noble Lord,
Lord Campbell, and others. Looking at the future, does it make sense
that in circumstances where a serviceman may be prosecuted in a
civilian court and might expect if he is to be prosecuted that it will
only be at court martial, he should have some notice of that and an
opportunity to make some representations? I see the force of that. I
would not want to take it too far for several reasons. I would not want
to see great delay, formality or satellite litigation because delay of
that sort only delays it from the point of view of the serviceman.
Sometimes one would not know who all the potential servicemen are. It
happens sometimes that there is a case that once it starts to be
investigated by the civilian or military authorities, other soldiers or
servicemen come into the picture. I would not want to stop and start,
but I am happy to assure the House that if cases in the future are
brought to me in the circumstances referred to in the noble
Lord&#146;s amendment&#151;active service operational circumstances
overseas and the possibility of a civilian proceeding&#151;I will
seek to ensure that the views of the serviceman or servicemen who are
known at that stage as defendants are made known to me. They will have
the opportunity of making written representations as to the venue. I do
not expect it to take long. I do not expect it to result in complicated
legal proceedings. But I hope that the noble Lord will see that by that
assurance I have given to this House, it meets the final part of what
the noble Lord has been seeking to obtain.</p><p><a name="06101179000009"></a>The noble Lord tabled
this probing amendment to obtain assurances for the future. I hope that
he will take the view that he has succeeded substantially,

will remember that shortly before the House rose for the Summer
Recess&#151;on 18 July, to be exact&#151;the new Secretary of State
for Communities and Local Government suddenly announced that the
mandatory provision of the main component of home information packs,
the home condition report, was to be abandoned in favour of the report
being produced on a voluntary basis, if the seller wished. Since that
seemed to raise the question of the viability of the regulations
themselves, rather than praying

Question, which I ask today: what is the Government&#146;s policy now
on home information packs?</p><p><a name="06101179000027"></a>I
will not weary your Lordships with a rehearsal of all the concerns
raised in this House and the other place by me and my colleagues about
the validity of the rationale for HIPs. The rationale was that, by
arming buyers from the outset with information on properties in which
they were interested, the packs would prevent sales from falling
through and save millions of pounds from being wasted. Concerns were
raised about the packs&#146; shelf life. There were also concerns
about the mandatory requirement for a home condition report to be
included in a mandatory pack, which had to be available before a seller
was even able to put their house on the market. There were great
doubts, still not resolved, as to whether a home condition report would
satisfy the requirements of the mortgage companies in terms of a survey
adequate for their purposes, and as to whether the home condition
report surveys would be of sufficient detail to satisfy the
requirements of a buyer. There was a concern that the whole thing would
be a complete waste of time in view of the imminent arrival of
e-conveyancing.</p><p><a name="06101179000028"></a>I will briefly
draw attention to the aspects that have brought this pack of cards
tumbling down, both of which were foreseen and debated <I>ad
nauseam</I> but comprehensively rejected by the Government as an
unnecessary intrusion into their unfettered belief in the viability of
the packs: the number of home inspectors who were in training and would
have been ready for implementation day, and the preparedness of the
home-sellers industry to undertake this wholesale change. Time after
time, the Government were questioned&#151;and I am delighted to see
the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, in his place, because we debated this
together on numerous occasions&#151;on the number of inspectors in
training. The answers were always reassuring: there would be more than
sufficient to undertake the work when D-day came. That fig leaf was
finally blown aside in the Secretary of State&#146;s admission in
July that there were not going to be anything like enough inspectors
trained or in training to entertain a compulsory introduction of home
condition reports for all sales. In fact, we understand that of the
7,000 required, fewer than 250 had been trained, at a cost for each one
of about &#163;7,000. That made implementation impossible.</p><p><a name="06101179000029"></a>Another aspect was that
the Government had agreed, under pressure during the passage of the
legislation, to undertake a pilot&#151;or, as it was termed, a
&#147;dry run&#148;&#151;of the packs prior to their
implementation. That has barely begun. We understand that six area
trials are due to be undertaken shortly, supported by &#163;4 million
of government funding and under the aegis of the Association of Home
Information Pack Providers. The test will include the trialling of
packs funded in different ways: fully funded, paid for by the
Government; the home condition report element funded by the purchaser
and the remainder by the Government; and the Government picking up the
bill if the sale falls through and the consumer pays the full cost. It
does not take the genius of Einstein to see that the only test will be
of the fully funded packs.</p>

reported? Prior to these &#147;dry runs&#148;, the Government
sought to obtain a benchmark of the current selling processes for
comparative purposes by seeking information from estate agents,
solicitors, buyers and sellers by means of a baseline study that was to
take place between 15 May and 9 June 2006. Was that baseline study
completed? How many responses were received from the three-week survey?
What use was the study going to be put to? In her statement on 18 July,
the Secretary of State also referred to the fact that over 14,000 home
information packs with searches had been successfully tested, but that
only 250 of these had been produced with &#147;some sort of
survey&#148;. Those 250 were to be analysed over the summer. What is
the result of that analysis?</p><p><a name="06101179000031"></a>While there has been a complete
<I>volte-face</I> on the home conditions report, the requirement for an
enemy&#151;I apologise; maybe it is indeed an enemy, but I meant
&#147;energy&#148;&#151;an energy performance certificate has
suddenly become the Holy Grail of the home packs. These certificates
are to be mandatory and will contain information and gradings on the
efficiency of heating and hot water systems and the insulation of
properties. However, they will also require technically trained
inspectors. How many of these are in training, and will they require
different qualifications and competencies from those of the home
inspectors that are currently in such short supply? How does the
Minister believe&#151;if she does at all&#151;that it will be
possible for energy performance certificates to be introduced by June
2007 if specially trained inspectors are required for them but are not
even available for home condition reports?</p><p><a name="06101179000032"></a>Does the Minister agree that the only
reason why the energy efficiency audit has become so important is to
implement the EU directive on energy savings in homes, and that that is
already being done perfectly satisfactorily in Northern Ireland, where
it is a stand-alone requirement on sale of property? Does she further
agree that the European directive talks about a certificate having to
be made available on the sale or letting of a property? If so, why are
the Government insisting that that is a condition of first marketing a
property? The reservations about and opposition to home information
packs have been demonstrated to be well judged. Our view, which is
supported by many professionals in the industry, is that the Government
should do everyone a favour and jettison this whole policy.</p><p><a name="06101179000033"></a>I am sure that the Minister will agree
that moving home is one of the most stressful things that anyone can
do. These provisions, even if introduced in their mauled form, threaten
to make that worse, not better. Rather than protecting the public, they
are set to undermine the stability and health of the housing market.
Having reached the decision to delay, the Government would be well
advised to abandon this whole project. It is plain as a pikestaff that
these regulations cannot be allowed to stand. They have been blown
apart as a result of the Secretary of State&#146;s actions. Will the
Minister say when and if they are to be revised and, if they are, can
she clearly deal with the question of what the Government&#146;s
policies are now?</p>

this subject via the indirect route of a member of my family
undertaking the training to implement these packs in time to be told
that the scheme was not happening. I regarded that as annoying to
them&#151;that is an understatement&#151;and as fundamentally
unfair to anybody who had undertaken the training. The Government
brought in the scheme and then the Government took it away. The cost
involved is considerable&#151;more than &#163;8,000&#151;and the
course controls your life for a year. I have figures that show that it
takes 15 to 20 hours per week of home learning over a year. Vast
amounts of effort are required to do that.</p><p><a name="06101179000035"></a>Suddenly, something that you had been
working towards that you thought would bring you career advancement was
taken away at the drop of hat&#151;at least, that is what it felt
like. Then, when the noble Baroness responded to a topical
question&#151;it was the last topical question we had, so perhaps her
reply will be more entrenched today&#151;those people found out that
the energy component will remain. The figures that I have on that
course is that it costs &#163;3,000&#151;as opposed to
&#163;8,000&#151;the maximum total home learning is about 40 hours
and it can be done in about three months. I was given those figures by
one of the major suppliers. So 15-plus times more work and effort over
a year&#151;when your applications for jobs and everything else in
your life are being controlled by that intensive training&#151;was
taken away.</p><p><a name="06101179000036"></a>I
did not get involved in whether the packs were a good idea in the first
place. Initially, they seemed attractive to me, and they still do as a
concept. As the implementation was this badly done, I suggest that the
Government have a duty at least to compensate those people who have
done that work. The junior level of training required for the secondary
qualification for which you are apparently covered does not compensate
for the amount of effort you have put in. A greater number of people
can enter the market to get the training quickly and will thus be
competing with you. There is no compensation for the amount of time
that you have put in.</p><p><a name="06101179000037"></a>No matter what their
reasons or how logical they were, the Government must stand up and say,
&#147;We got it wrong, we will give you a form of
compensation&#148;. Initially, I thought that some repayment of the
costs would be enough, but the longer this goes on, the more it will
rankle. Every time the Government insist on some training to fulfil a
government post, I would be looking over my shoulder for a wee bit,
especially in this field. Surely there is a duty&#151;indeed, a moral
responsibility&#151;on the Government to give some form of
compensation. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply, but the
fact that you have a junior qualification from your much more expensive
training does not cut the mustard. I look forward to the Government

this year I have undertaken three transactions: I surrendered a tenancy

in Essex. I therefore examined those transactions to see whether, if
these HIP proposals had been in force, there was any prospect that they
could have done anything to&#151;I quote from the original news
release from the ODPM in
2003&#151;</p><ul><a name="06101179000046"></a>&#147;ensure
the home buying and selling process becomes more certain, transparent
and consumer friendly, whilst reducing stress and the number of failed
transactions&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101179000039"></a>I
entirely agree with what my noble friend said about the stress of
moving house; my wife and I are getting on a bit in years and that
makes it worse. I have studied the case. I attended a briefing on
Monday and have read the 80 pages of the regulations&#151;80 pages,
what on earth are people supposed to make of that? I have come to the
conclusion that I cannot begin to see how, if the HIP process had been
in force for any of the three transactions that I undertook, it could
have done anything other than increase the costs and multiply the
bureaucracy.</p><p><a name="06101179000040"></a>When
I sold my house, my solicitors had no difficulty in getting hold of all
the information that they needed, including information about title, so
that they could draw up a contract and the conveyance. That included
sufficient information to register the land for the first time, as it
had not been registered before. When the first purchaser whose offer I
had accepted failed to make any progress and I had to put the house on
the market again, I asked my solicitor how much that failed transaction
would increase his costs. He said that, as he had all the documents and
all that he had to do was make other copies and send them off, it would
probably cost about another &#163;20. Is that what this massive
bureaucracy is supposed to save? I cannot believe that the HIP
process&#151;particularly without the house condition survey, which
has now been abandoned, as my noble friend said&#151;could
conceivably have helped me in any way at all. Apart from one
matter&#151;the energy performance certificates, to which I shall
return in a moment&#151;I have identified nothing in this process
that would have made any of the three transactions anything other than
more expensive. I cannot believe that that is what the Government would
be happy
with.</p><p><a name="06101179000041"></a>The
ultimate purchasers quite properly insisted on a fully qualified
surveyor to survey my 150 year-old house. It is inconceivable that he
could have been satisfied by the sort of house condition survey that
the Government originally envisaged. The longest delay in the purchase
of my house in Vauxhall was getting information out of the
freeholder&#146;s agents, and there is nothing in the HIP process
that could conceivably have speeded that up. That was the only delay we
had.</p><p><a name="06101179000042"></a>Where does that leave us?
The energy performance certificate is the only part that is worth
having, and I could be persuaded that that would be worth while. I
believe that the Government ought to withdraw the rest, start again
with their energy performance certificates, and see where they get
to.</p><h5><a name="06101181000021"></a>8.09

bit closer to the problems of tenancy and tenure. But, unlike the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkins, who I envy&#151;and I appreciate the experiences
that he shared with the House&#151;in perhaps 50 years I might have
moved five times. Each time was stressful and filled with anxieties,
which resolved themselves.</p><p><a name="06101181000002"></a>I
first came across the possibility of aiding this generality when the
idea of a logbook was mooted. That was more than 20 years ago when I
was in the other place. So the Government should not be accused of
being too quick in trying to produce a solution to a problem. The noble
Lord, Lord Jenkins, and the noble Baroness have sought to make it clear
that there are no problems to be solved. Now, as far as I am concerned,
there are many problems to be solved.</p><p><a name="06101181000003"></a>On Monday night, at the meeting which the

apologise. I realise that it must be a touchy subject and I will keep
off it. On Monday, on the question of where the opposition was coming
from, the noble Lord said that people were opposing the Bill on
principle. I asked what the principle was. He said that the principle
was interference in the free market. I said, &#147;Well, I am
supporting it on principle&#151;the principle of interfering in the
free market&#148;. If by the operation of the free market there are,
across the whole field, supporters for this kind of action, I believe
that the Government should be commended for at least making the
endeavour.</p><p><a name="06101181000006"></a>I
hear what the noble Lord, Lord Addington, says: that an aspect of his
speech deserves answers and possibly some constructive response from
the Minister when she replies. But no scheme with so many vested
interests&#151;one of them being the consumer&#151;will ever begin
with unanimity. It will evolve. If the Government felt that with the
passage of time there would be difficulty in producing a workable and
viable scheme for the home reports, they did the right thing in
withdrawing them. I am assuming that the Minister will tell us
something helpful about the steps taken to try to come around to the
original suggestion.</p><p><a name="06101181000007"></a>I have
quotes from the Law Society, from estate agents and from the Consumers
Association. It says that of the people it surveyed 80 per cent said
that they were in favour of the scheme&#151;possibly not the detail,
but in favour of the idea that this HIP nexus would be
produced.</p><p><a name="06101181000008"></a>Time, as we all know,
is the essence of many situations. The process that takes place in this
country is far and away longer than it is in other countries. The
Government should take courage and persist in their plans, taking
careful note of the improvements which might be made, but certainly not
abandon them. I wish the Government well in their process.</p>

Earl of Caithness:</b> My Lords, I declare my
interest as a surveyor and as one of those who were conned by the
Government into getting trained, only to have the rug pulled from
underneath me. I cannot possibly comment on the speech of the noble
Lord, Lord Addington, because I might be a beneficiary of it. How we
miss the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, on an evening like
this.</p><p><a name="06101181000010"></a>As we
wade through the mire of the shambles of this legislation, chest waders
are still needed, so I have a lot of questions for the Government. Will
the Minister confirm that from now on and after June, agents will still
be able to offer first-day marketing? In order to allow this, may I
suggest that the energy performance certificate, the EPC, which is the
only new item in the pack, can be made voluntary at marketing but
mandatory before the exchange of contracts? The Government have to
bring this provision in; it is European legislation and it was tacked
on to the Bill to make their commitment to this satisfactory. That
would be one way of making the scheme work.</p><p><a name="06101181000011"></a>Another way to have first-day marketing
is to provide a certificate to the trading standards inspectorate, if
necessary, that a pack has been commissioned from the pack provider.
After all, it is mostly legal documents. So, as an agent, if we get
instructions we can ring up and ask the pack provider or the solicitor
to provide the document. If they have a certificate and it is on the
way, we can start marketing.</p><p><a name="06101181000012"></a>The EPC will require about 1 million
extra car journeys a year because it will be necessary before marketing
begins. That could be deferred by my suggestion of making the EPC
mandatory. It could then be included in the valuation by the purchaser
later on in the process. The EPC is valid for 10 years. It is also
needed at the change of every tenancy. Which takes precedence? What
happens with holiday lets? Are the Government giving us any clear
instructions on that? We do not have long to go.</p><p><a name="06101181000013"></a>The dry run is
another 180 degree U-turn by the Government and &#163;4 million of
taxpayers&#146; money will be spent on it. But some of the home
information packs will be subsidised. That is not a dry run; that is
not testing the market. It gives a completely false impression. This
dry run is already discredited because it will be supervised by the
Association of Home Information Pack Providers, which has a vested
interest in the process. It is exactly the same mistake that the
Government made with the Bristol trial before this legislation started.
Maria Coleman had a vested interest in a home information pack business
and was trying to pose as an estate agent at the same time.</p><p><a name="06101181000014"></a>Where is the industry
now? The RICS has lost credibility on this. The National Association of
Estate Agents started off badly but suddenly got it right and has
gained in credibility. A new organisation has surprisingly sprung up.
It is called SPLINTA&#151;Sellers&#146; Pack Law Is Not The
Alternative&#151;ably run by Nick Salmon. It comprises 1,800 firms of
surveyors, solicitors and estate agents across the whole breadth of the
housing market, covering more than 3,500 offices

organisations&#151;the RICS, the NAEA and SPLINTA&#151;want
improvements in the housing market. Stop, take a deep breath and come
back and talk to us because we want to move just as much as the

disharmony.</p><h5><a name="06101181000023"></a>8.18

Eccles:</b> My Lords, last June the
Home Information Pack Regulations were reviewed by the Merits
Committee, of which I am a member. What has been said already arises
out of the implementation of Section 5 of the Housing Act 2004. I do
not think that a case was made then, nor has one been made since, for
the abandonment of self-regulation and the creation of a new class of
certified inspectors.</p><p><a name="06101181000016"></a>Such a bureaucratic
intervention will not improve the working of the housing market. There
are no reported distortions of substance to the housing market which
call for government intervention and control. The Explanatory
Memorandum and the regulatory impact assessment, which accompany the
regulations, do not claim that there are. The proposed public sector
regime does not follow from the consultation process and the responses
to them. The driver in my view has been political philosophy, a
perceived need to intervene and control, and not from an accurate
assessment of the best interests of buyers and sellers in a market
which in general works well.</p><p><a name="06101181000017"></a>I
will focus now on the energy performance certificates. These are the
remaining mandatory plank on which the Government rely after correctly
ditching home condition reports as mandatory. I cite the Explanatory
Memorandum which came with the Home Information Pack Regulations. It
states:</p><ul><a name="06101181000020"></a>&#147;The Regulations
refer to energy performance certificates as the certificate required by
Council Directive 2002/91/EEC (Energy Performance of Buildings
Directive) whose form and content complies with any enactment which
implements that Directive made in accordance with article 7. Article 7
is expected to be implemented by January 2009. These Regulations do not
implement the Directive, and given that they do not do so, there is no
requirement to provide a Transposition Note&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101181000018"></a>So we are left wondering what is the
future of the energy performance certificate. At first reading of the
directive, it does not look especially onerous or unduly technical. Its
major impact will be not on family houses of different types but on
larger buildings, but we have yet to see how it will be transposed and
how expert the required experts will need to be. In the mean time, as
the Joint Committee asks in its 34th report of July, given the 2009
implementation date, why is there not an &#147;express temporary
exception&#148; from the obligation to include energy performance
certificates or predicted ones in home information packs? Given that
uncertainty, no one in their right mind would rely for regular
employment on becoming a home inspector. The fees earned may turn out
to be nugatory.</p><p><a name="06101181000019"></a>It is also high
time for a second full round of consultation. It is approaching eight
years since the unfortunately titled document, <I>The key to easier
home buying and selling</I>, was issued. Much has happened since then.
Much is happening now. It would be

from the advice that they received. The public deserve
better.</p><p><a name="06101180000001"></a><a name="spnew_211"></a><b><a name="_spnew50"></a><a name="06101180000021"></a>Lord
Selsdon:</b> My Lords, I have
declared my interests in the past. I begin this little
monologue&#151;dialogue, I suppose&#151;by saying that time in
reconnaissance is never wasted. However, the Government have spent an
enormous amount of time in reconnaissance&#151;very costly, very
thorough. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, provided me with a tremendous
number of officials who briefed me thoroughly on everything and I am
now a much wiser
man.</p><p><a name="06101180000002"></a>We are
all looking for a more active, positive and beneficial housing market.
That starts at the bottom end with social housing and ends, at the top
end, with taxing those who spend an enormous amount of money on houses
in London. The problem is that the bureaucracy and costs incurred
unnecessarily in this country are higher than in others. In other
countries they have a simple thing: an estate agent tries to charge as
much as 10 per cent. In Germany, it is the buyer who pays the
agent&#146;s fee.</p><p><a name="06101180000003"></a>Here, our
agents in general take 2.5 per cent, but the added costs can be quite
considerable. A &#163;200,000 house will have costs from transfer of
sale of roughly 5 per cent&#151;&#163;10,000; a &#163;250,000
house will have costs of &#163;17,500&#151;7 per cent; a
&#163;500,000 house will have costs of &#163;37,500&#151;7.8 per
cent. The cost is the rising amount of stamp duty; other costs that
follow are delays, which are
stressful.</p><p><a name="06101180000004"></a>If you seek to
complete the purchase of a house, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of
Roding&#151;to give him his full title, without the
&#147;s&#148;&#151;said, and you are dealing with leasehold, you
then have the problem of having to do extra searches. For example, you
may need to get the memorandum and articles of association of the
company that owns that property to find out whether there is a sinking
fund. Those costs go on and on. Surveys for mortgages are fairly
simple: if the house is in a good area, you have a drive-by survey
whereby someone just goes by and says, &#147;Well, that house is
worth
enough&#148;.</p><p><a name="06101180000005"></a>We
tend to forget that it is not just about the buying and selling of the
house but the importance of the house to the individual. Rather
unfortunately, at least 15 per cent of people who occupy social housing
should not now be there, because they can afford to buy or rent more
expensive properties. When we consider all the joint schemes that are
now advanced&#151;shared schemes and others&#151;one wonders
whether those involved would have to pay the costs of the home
information pack if they were transferred
through.</p><p><a name="06101180000006"></a>I will not try to be
negative, because a real benefit could come out of all this by sitting
down and thinking significantly about the importance of property to the
individual. All political parties have accepted that we seek to be a
property-owning democracy. We can argue about how that should be
distributed. We all believe in regeneration and social housing,
whatever you call it; that may be the move towards shared ownership and
freeing up the letting market so that more people have the right to
let.</p>

per cent of people's assets lie in their home or property and that 80
per cent of their debt is in their property, to which you can add hire
purchases and debts related to the home. Therefore, the home is far
more important than just being the home. It is someone's asset, and
Governments who play around by increasing the cost to the homeowner of
maintaining or trading his asset, or make it more difficult for him so
to do, do so at their
peril.</p><p><a name="06101180000008"></a><a name="spnew_212"></a><b><a name="_spnew51"></a><a name="06101180000022"></a>Baroness
Hamwee:</b> My Lords, the convention is that short
debates of this sort are phrased in the form of a question. If I may
say so to the noble Baroness, this is a very good Question. The
&#147;I told you so&#148;s may be irresistible to some Members of
your Lordships' House, but what really matters is: where now and how do
we get there? On how we get there, there are both legal and practical
aspects. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, once paid me the compliment of
saying that I was not a real lawyer&#151;I think that he meant that I
was not a barrister and did not wear a striped suit&#151;but I think
that it is the lawyer in me that has been unable to understand in
technical terms how the Government are dealing with this. Are we to get
new regulations? Will the Secretary of State use his power to suspend
part of the Act, or what? I asked someone to phone the Department for
Communities and Local Government to inquire about that. Understandably,
the first contact did not know, but was going to phone back, but has
not. If the department does not know, I do not know how the public
can.</p><p><a name="06101180000009"></a>Perhaps a
more important point is what the Government will do now to boost
confidence in home information packs. I must say that those who have
been in sympathy for a long time with what the Government have been
trying to do&#151;if not all the detail and mechanisms&#151;are
finding that position hard to sustain. It has been a long time. The
noble Lord, Lord Graham, said so. When I saw the publications in the
Printed Paper Office with the DETR logo on them, I felt quite
nostalgic.</p><p><a name="06101180000010"></a>According
to the <I>Observer</I> in July, the personal financial industry is
believed to have spent &#163;225 million on HIPs to date. The article
stated:</p><ul><a name="06101180000019"></a>&#147;While you may
not be too bothered about lenders, lawyers and estate agents losing
money, I&#146;m sure you are under no illusion about the fact that it
will be the consumer who ends up
paying&#148;.</ul><a name="06101180000018"></a>My noble
friend Lord Addington spoke vividly about the trainees who have paid. I
hope that the Minister can be clear about how they will be treated in
future. She has been asked about the trials, the dry runs, which are
being undertaken and planned. I am sure that the House will be
especially interested to hear what are the criteria for judging their
success. In June, I read a comment from HBOS that said that lenders had
been insufficiently involved in the dry run, that key elements would be
tested too late and not tested at volume. That has been touched
on.<p><a name="06101180000011"></a>Home information packs are
not the biggest issue in housing. To me, the issue is the supply. If a
local authority got into such a pickle, the district

wonder whether the National Audit Office will take a look at
this.</p><p><a name="06101180000012"></a>In
conclusion, all those in property&#151;there are several in the
Chamber tonight&#151;know the dangers of misrepresentation. With that
thought, I urge the Government to be entirely clear about their
intentions from now on. They represented in a technical fashion to
potential trainees that these schemes were going ahead to a timetable,
and those trainees need to be compensated. The Government cannot afford
another stumble; they need to be clear in order to recover
confidence.</p><h5><a name="06101180000020"></a>8.30

Hunt of Wirral:</b> My Lords, I declare my interest
as a partner in Beachcroft LLP and the other entries on the Register. I
warmly congratulate my noble friend on securing the debate and on her
lucid and penetrating speech. To summarise what has been said in the
debate, the Government have a disastrous policy that is now in a
terrible mess. I therefore want to give the Minister as long as
possible to explain. We do not have to finish until eight minutes to
nine, so she will have a long time to do so, and we are avid to
listen.</p><p><a name="06101180000014"></a>It is never endearing to
say, &#147;I told you so&#148;&#151;I agree with the noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that there is little profit in saying
that&#151;but many of us on this side of the House, as we have heard,
warned Ministers from the outset that their policy on home information
packs was ill-thought-out, intrusive, and expensive nonsense. Much more
important is the fact that many of us warned that the policy was likely
to unravel, and I echo what my noble friend said about the whole pack
of cards coming tumbling down. The fundamental point is surely that
moving home is already one of the most stressful, debilitating and,
above all, costly undertakings. It was generally felt that HIPs could
serve only to add to the general nuisance and woe. My noble friends
Lady Hanham and Lord Jenkin of Roding are right to talk about that
stress. We must bear that in mind. My noble friend Lord Selsdon, too,
is quite right that 80 per cent of the assets&#151;80 per cent of the
debt&#151;is in a person&#146;s home. We must therefore handle this
policy very carefully.</p><p><a name="06101180000015"></a>In their
original form, HIPs would have cost as much as a survey. Indeed, in
many ways they were going to replicate a buyer&#146;s survey but
would in no way obviate the need for one. Numerous headlines in July
said that the Government had seen sense and had backtracked on all this
nonsense, but the truth is not quite so simple or so gratifying. The
statement given on 30 July informs us that the only aspect of the
Government&#146;s policy that has changed will now be an authorised
rather than a mandatory aspect ofthe HIP during the dry run. I
recall exchanges with the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, about the dry run
and the trials. The ominous note in the statement is an implied threat
that mandatory HCRs will remain on the table if the industry fails to
make a success of its roll-out.</p>

attractive that they will take flight majestically entirely
voluntarily, but just in case they do not, the market must now operate
under the shadow of the Government&#146;s power to impose them as and
when Ministers dictate. So the leopard&#146;s spots have not changed
that much after all, although I hope that the Minister will clarify all
this for us. We have already heard from my noble friend Lord Eccles
that the Joint Committee found some defective drafting; no doubt the
Minister will explain all that and speak in her defence. We have also
heard that the EPCs are a very good aspect, and I agree with my noble
friend Lord Jenkin that there is a good case for them; my noble friend
Lord Eccles said the same.</p><p><a name="06101180000017"></a>There are so many questions; the noble
Earl, my good friend Lord Caithness, posed a whole set of them. I would
like the Minister to respond to the point about compensation made by
the noble Lord, Lord Addington, who, with the noble Earl, has instanced
the number of people who took the training and have spent a great deal
of money, only for the Government to move the goalposts. We need as
quickly as possible an explanation of exactly where the Government are
at the moment. That, of course, is my noble friend&#146;s
question.</p><h5><a name="06101183000024"></a>8.36

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My Lords,
the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, has done the House a service by
converting her Question into a debate. I share noble Lords&#146;
frustration that it is a short debate, and I shall try to answer as
many questions as possible. I will certainly write to noble Lords if I
cannot answer all of them in the time
available.</p><p><a name="06101183000002"></a>It has been a very
thoughtful debate, and I know that I face many veterans of this policy
on the opposition Benches. I shall concentrate on where we go now in
order to answer the noble Baroness&#146;s question, but I must say a
little about where we have come from. I thank my noble friend Lord
Graham for his support. I had another supporter, but he became sick. It
is a pleasure to share the Bench with my noble friend Lord
Rooker.</p><p><a name="06101183000003"></a>I start by making it
clear that we are fully committed to making home information packs work
in the interests of consumers and the industry as a whole. We have
agreed on two things tonight: there is nothing more stressful than
buying a home; and the home is our greatest, most valuable and most
emotive asset. We are right to respect people&#146;s passionate
feelings about that, so the need to make the process of buying and
selling homes more predictable, less stressful and less wasteful is as
urgent and as inescapable as ever. I was delighted to hear the noble
Earl, Lord Caithness, say that we should think about the future,
because to accept the status quo is an indefensible position. We still
have the slowest system in Europe, slower than it was in 1998, and it
is horrendously complicated. I very much respect the positive
experience that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, had with his estate agent,
but not all such experiences are so positive. I will return to the
point . I do not think that either party opposite would want to put 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_335"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>themselves on the opposite side to the majority of consumers who find
themselves largely dissatisfied with a process that is so unpredictable
and wasteful of emotional
energy.</p><p><a name="06101183000004"></a>The noble Lord, Lord
Selsdon, made a very good case for home information packs. It was a
very thoughtful and helpful speech in many respects. Noble Lords have
asked about the point of having a home information pack without
including the home condition report. On the evidence that we have
collected, and the evidence from places such as Denmark and New South
Wales, we still rightly believe that a single legal document up-front
that brings together vital information&#151;sometimes elusive
information such as leaseholds that may be scattered in
solicitors&#146; officers or banks or buried in filing cabinets from
where it has to be dug out&#151;can make the system simpler and more
transparent, particularly for the first-time buyer. I do not want to
introduce a personal note into the debate but I am currently in the
process of collecting such documentation. I think that this system can
remove obstacles in terms of speed and complexity in what is a very
uncertain process.</p><p><a name="06101183000005"></a>There are
costs in the system but they will be transferred from the buyer to the
seller, and most sellers are also buyers. What a boon it is for
first-time buyers to be able to look at a house and to know that they
will be given the information they need up-front by the seller. If they
do not buy one house they can find another one and they will not have
to pay for a second set of
papers.</p><p><a name="06101183000006"></a>On
balance, noble Lords have welcomed the energy performance certificate,
which is the other mandatory aspect of the HIP. I am glad about that.
However, I say to noble Lords who questioned why the EPC was brought
forward now&#151;as though it were intended to mask the mandatory
nature of the packs&#151;that we have to tackle climate change in
this country. Our homes emit huge amounts of carbon. We have no time to
waste. We are bringing the EPC forward now because it will contribute
to achieving a target of a 20 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by
2010. It will do so by informing people how to save on energy costs,
how to improve insulation and how to reduce their bills. This is a
win-win situation. We did not have to wait until 2009 and we chose not
to because the situation is urgent. It is something that we could do
something about. The regulations that we will introduce, to which I
shall refer later, will be amended to make stand-alone energy
performance certificates a mandatory component of home information
packs. Finally, I confirm that home information packs will come into
effect, as we have already announced, in June 2007. That is one element
of the answer to the Question raised by the noble Baroness.</p><p><a name="06101183000007"></a>I turn now to the burden of the
debate&#151;which is why we made the change and the implications for
the industry and people in training. The change announced in July does
not in any way imply a loss of faith in the value of home condition
reports&#151;far from it. Why should it be easier to get an MoT on a
car than it is to get a comprehensive account of the state of
one&#146;s prospective home, especially since only 30 per cent of
people get a mid-range survey? Our 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_336"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 336</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>position regarding June was nothing to do with the value that we place
on the home condition report but was to do with our obligation to the
consumer to have the best possible product that would bring the most
effective benefits. Three elements in combination affected our
decision. They have been touched on but I should like to enlarge on
them a little.</p><p><a name="06101183000008"></a>The first element was
the timing, which was dictated by the fact that when we did the dry run
collecting evidence, no matter how expansive the reconnaissance, the
real-world impact of home condition reports proved to be very
difficult. There were 15,000 voluntary packs in operation, only 250 of
which had a home condition element. None of them had a home condition
report and we could not test or trial them because the home inspectors
were not in place. It became clear that we had to test them in a real
world environment. At the same time, we thought that a mandatory
test&#151;and we were well advised on this&#151;would be deeply
unpopular and flawed not least because people who moved from one area
to another would end up by paying twice. In June, we therefore took the
decision that we had to have proper, independently evaluated trials
which would be conducted by home inspectors.</p><p><a name="06101183000009"></a>The second element, which was made clear
to us, was that despite its best efforts, the lending industry did not
have its automated valuation systems in place to the extent that the
information generated by the HCR could be used to make mortgage
evaluations a simpler desktop process&#151;which is where the lending
industry wants to go in many respects.</p><p><a name="06101183000010"></a>Thirdly, I come to the point about home
inspectors. We were confident about the numbers and in the summer we
gave the figure of 7,500. But as the training went through, it became
clear from the pace of qualification that we could not predict with
certainty that we would have that number of qualified home inspectors
in place by next June. People were coming into the scheme either from
the surveying profession or, as was the case of the brother of the
noble Lord, Lord Addington, from scratch. They were progressing at
their own pace and were therefore qualifying at different rates. Taking
all those concerns together, to have pushed ahead with all aspects of
the home information packs as well as home condition reports in one big
bang on a single day next June would have been irresponsible. We could
not take that risk on behalf of the consumer.</p><p><a name="06101183000011"></a>I shall turn briefly to
where we are now. We understand the impact on the industry, although I
was interested to note that membership of the Association of Home
Information Providers has seen a net gain, while the number of early
adopters has increased. But the most important element concerns the
serious personal consequences this has had for individuals, and we do
not minimise that. The Secretary of State was quick to apologise, and
that apology was very sincerely meant. We do not believe that it is
appropriate to offer compensation for reasons I will explain. The
trials and testing involved in the voluntary roll-out will absorb
people in training. Some 470 home inspectors have completed their
training and 177 have been issued with their diploma. The first of
those qualified inspectors will be involved in the trials we are about
to start and 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_337"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the subsequent rollout, and as they roll out more will be needed.
They will also certainly be needed in order to meet the demand for
energy performance certificates because at the moment they are the only
people qualified to issue them. However, by 2009 when the rental market
will become involved by being required to prepare energy performance
certificates, we will need a lot more inspectors. As we are talking
about 1.8 million rental transactions, many more qualified people will
be needed to award the certificate. Not only are we confident that we
will have enough work for the inspectors in that respect, but we are
also putting in place an assessor&#146;s qualification which will
become available next February; it will match the national occupational
standards for energy
assessment.</p><p><a name="06101183000012"></a>We
are now investing in a very serious process of trials and testing. It
involves only six areas, but they are very different and discrete, and
so we think we can achieve a real result. The first of the recruitment
evenings took place last night. Some 200 organisations have shown an
interest in these preparations, and 75 are already involved in the dry
run. Moreover, the private sector will be very firmly encouraged to
take part. Government office staff and time have been committed to
support the trials and regional publicity campaigns will be run. The
trials will examine the take-up and use of both the HIP and the home
condition report. Certificated home inspectors will be involved, as
well as estate agents and so forth. We need to understand the impact
and how useful the pack is not just on the process but also on the
quality of the experience in order to maximise its benefits. Will we
need to change some of the emphases? Will it need to be fine-tuned in
some ways? How can we accelerate the benefits and maximise the impact
of energy performance certificates? Money will be used for
communication and advertising, and we will be offering incentives in
the form of a limited number of free packs as well as packs in which
the mandatory element will be provided to the seller free of charge,
leaving them free to pay for the HCR, and packs provided on a no-sale,
no-fee basis. This is a trial and it will be
empirical.</p><p><a name="06101183000013"></a>What is most
important&#151;and here I respond to the noble Earl, Lord
Caithness&#151;is that the trials will be evaluated by independent
researchers who will monitor them in order to provide an objective
understanding of what is happening. The results will feed back into the
process and will be published in order to inform our decisions. So in
essence our policy is to make a success of the rollout by evaluating
the trials as comprehensively as possible. We will keep Members of this
House as well informed as we can, along with lenders and all those who
go along with us.</p><p><a name="06101183000014"></a>In response to
questions put by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, we will look to see
whether people genuinely feel better informed and more confident as a
result of the pack. We expect these trials to confirm the benefits
which have been found in Denmark, for example, where recent research
found overwhelming support for the positive benefits. I can make that
research available to noble Lords. We will also look at how long
transactions take to complete without packs and whether they prevent
transaction failures. While 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_338"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 338</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it is clear that they will not prevent such failures where people behave
badly or circumstances change, we will be looking at how consumers can
obtain greater protections through the packs. A very rigorous set of
questions will be asked and the criteria will be qualitative rather
than just quantitative because it is the qualitative element that will
be extremely important.</p><p><a name="06101183000015"></a>As for
first-day marketing, we cannot prescribe in relation to that, as these
are trials, but we hope to look at various factors including the impact
of allowing marketing to commence once a home information pack has been
commissioned. I will write further to noble Lords on that
point.</p><p><a name="06101183000016"></a>Finally, we have also
made real progress in the certification process. The first
certification scheme is now going through the approval process. It will
be run by the Surveyors and Valuers Accreditation, which will manage
the registration. It will ensure that each inspector has PI insurance.
As regards registration, a preferred bidder has been found in Landmark
Solutions and that will provide us with the database. The DTI has also
announced the criteria that the Secretary of State will use to assess
the suitability of applicants to run the redress scheme that will be
available to anyone who has a complaint. This will offer protection
against unscrupulous agents.</p><p><a name="06101183000017"></a>The regulations will be amended and we
will come forward with them early next year. The home condition report
will be an authorised document&#151;that is one change that will be
made in the regulations&#151;and the energy performance certificate
will be a mandatory document. We will publish detailed information on
the website. I am very sorry that the noble Baroness did not have a
reply and I will look into it

to Amendments Nos. 93B, 94, 94A, 94B and 139A. Let me set these
amendments in context. Up to now, we have been dealing with the way in
which the military criminal justice system deals with the most serious
offences, including those committed on operations. The integrity of the
system is essential to the confidence in which it is held. At one
extreme, as we have already discussed, a soldier who acts within the
rules of engagement and whose actions are reasonable can be confident
that he will be found to have acted within the law. So if he kills
somebody in those circumstances, he will not be guilty of
murder.</p><p><a name="06101184000011"></a>It is just as important
that a soldier has confidence in the summary discipline system, which,
of course, will continue to deal with some 95 per cent of all service
offences. Part of that confidence comes from knowing that he can
exercise his right to elect trial by the court martial and that there
will be no disincentive to do so.</p><p><a name="06101184000012"></a>These are minor amendments that ensure
that there is no ambiguity in the provisions that relate to where an

quite sufficient. I agree that the Royal Navy has in the past

However, there is no provision for flexibility, so what happens in the
event of a vehicle breakdown or perhaps a fire in the intended
accommodation or some other emergency? The servicemen need to be kept
in detention. The obvious solution would be to put them in a prison
overnight, but to tell the prison authorities to look after them and
perhaps treat them as remand prisoners. I do not understand why there
is no flexibility in the sensible provision prohibiting servicemen who
are in detention from being kept in a prison. I beg to

Nos. 95 and 96 of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. In our discussions with
the Bill team, we have spoken on occasions about the difficulty of
harmonising the various traditional punishments available to the three
services, which have differed over the years. I agree with the noble
Earl that it seems unnecessary in this case to harmonise upwards from
60 days to 90 days to accommodate the Royal Navy, detention being
different from imprisonment.</p>

with the noble Earl on his Amendment No. 162. Given that the offences

Drayson:</b> The powers of punishment that a
commanding officer should be able to impose have been very carefully
considered by the Ministry of Defence. In determining that 90 days
should be the maximum period of detention that a commanding officer can
impose, we sought to balance the needs of each of the services, to
avoid any unnecessary increase in the numbers of courts martial and to
ensure fairness to individuals who face charges. Summary justice has
the distinct advantage of providing a speedy but fair outcome for an
accused
person.</p><p><a name="06101184000037"></a>However,
we have also included significant protections in the exercise of these
powers. In particular, the power to impose any period of detention that
is greater than 28 days will require a commanding officer to get
agreement from higher authority. The accused will know before a hearing
whether the commanding officer has been given such authority. There
will also be a universal right to elect; there will be an automatic
right to appeal; and sentences of detention will not begin until the
time for an appeal has elapsed or an appeal has been heard, unless the
accused agrees to the detention starting before then.</p><p><a name="06101184000038"></a>Under Clause 294, those
sentenced to service detention may be held in service custody, but not
detained in prison. Modern transportation and the availability of
service custody facilities for temporary accommodation mean that it
would never be necessary to accommodate someone in a civil
prison&#151;and there are no longer any military prisons. Amendment
No. 162, which provides for this, is therefore unnecessary. I hope that
the noble Earl feels able not to press his amendments following my
explanations.</p><p><a name="06101184000039"></a><a name="spnew_226"></a><b><a name="06101184000115"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> I am grateful for the Minister&#146;s
response. First, he said that to impose a sentence in excess of 28 days
should need a higher authority&#146;s permission, but that has always
been the case. It is not a new provision, certainly as far as the Army
is concerned. How often has the Royal Navy used a period of detention
in excess of 60 days? Does the Minister have any evidence on that? If
he does not have it to hand, perhaps he could write to me and let me
know how often that has
happened.</p><p><a name="06101184000040"></a>I am grateful for the
Minister&#146;s response to Amendment No. 162, although I can
understand noble Lords&#146; lack of enthusiasm for it. I am grateful
for his assertion that it will never be necessary to resort to putting
servicemen in a prison. If that is his assessment of the situation,
that is fine. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Attlee:</b> I have amendments in this group. The Bill
covers the composition of the court martial. It states that, to be on a
court martial, an officer must have an aggregate of three years&#146;
commissioned service. However, there is a difficulty with that. He
could have had two years&#146; commissioned service several years
ago, a gap in service and then come back into the services and suddenly
find himself on a court martial. I suggest that he should have three
years&#146; continuous service before being on a court martial. I
appreciate that would slightly reduce the pool of officers available
for courts martial but, on the other hand, it would improve their
quality.</p><p><a name="06101182000023"></a>Clause 142(2) states
that,</p><ul><a name="06101182000050"></a>&#147;immediately
before receiving his commission, he was a warrant officer in any of
those
forces&#148;.</ul><a name="06101182000045"></a>The
difficulty here is that sometimes senior NCOs, perhaps a staff sergeant
or equivalent, are commissioned. That person has plenty of military
experience and the qualities to enable him to be commissioned but he
cannot be on a court martial because he was not a warrant officer
immediately before being commissioned. I shall be interested to hear
the Minister&#146;s views on that
point.<p><a name="06101182000024"></a><a name="spnew_233"></a><b><a name="06101182000058"></a>Lord
Garden:</b> I wish to address the
amendments of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee. I support those that look
for continuous service, which seems an entirely reasonable idea.
However, I have a problem with commissioned senior NCOs. The variation
between the services is important here. In the Air Force, and
presumably in the Army Air Corps as well, some senior NCOs have
relatively short service because they have gained professional
qualifications and have come in at senior NCO level. Therefore, they
would not fulfil these requirements when commissioned. The relevant
amendment needs to be looked at more
closely.</p><p><a name="06101182000025"></a><a name="spnew_234"></a><b><a name="06101182000059"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> This group deals with
amendments to the Summary Appeal Court&#151;Amendments Nos. 101 to
105, relating to Clauses 140, 142 and 146. I shall focus on those
amendments first. The Summary Appeal Court was first introduced under
the Armed Forces Discipline Act 2000. The services have therefore had
almost six years of practical experience of it. This has helped us
considerably in drafting the Bill in that regard.</p><p><a name="06101182000026"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 101 to
Clause 140, we think that the 14-day initial period, which currently
applies under the service discipline Acts, is one that sufficiently
balances the interests of the offender, the services and the system
generally. It must be remembered that there is an automatic right of
appeal. So the individual is merely required to give notice of his
intention to appeal and does not need to supply any grounds within this
14-day period. There is provision in Clause 140(2)(b) and (3) for this
initial period to be extended with the leave of the court, 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_344"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>either before the initial period expires or at a later stage. So in
appropriate cases the offender will be permitted a longer
period.</p><p><a name="06101182000027"></a>One
of the most important benefits of the summary hearing process is that
it can deal with cases quickly. As long as this is balanced against the
need for the accused to have a reasonable time in which to prepare his
case, then dealing swiftly with summary cases, and that includes any
appeal, should be the objective. This works in the interests of the
accused, any victim and the interests of the services.</p><p><a name="06101182000028"></a>To extend the initial
period for appeal to 28 days would not assist in the aspiration that
such lower level cases be heard and disposed of as soon after the
original incident as is reasonable. There are no factors that suggest
that the current 14-day period is causing any difficulty for appellants
or unfairness. In those circumstances, I hope that the noble Lord will
withdraw his amendment.</p><h5><a name="06101182000051"></a>9.15
pm</h5><p><a name="06101182000029"></a>Amendments
Nos. 102 to 104 all relate to the period that an officer must have
served before he is qualified to sit as a member of the SAC. First,
they remove the provision that officers with an aggregate of three
years&#146; commissioned service are qualified, so that only those
with three years&#146; continuous experience would be qualified.
Secondly, an officer who was a warrant officer is not subject to a
three-year qualification. The amendment seeks to apply this exception
to officers who were senior non-commissioned officers before they
became commissioned officers. The provisions in the Bill ensure that
those who act as a member of the Summary Appeal Court will have
sufficient service experience, including the experience of commanding
others, to properly undertake their responsibilities as a Summary
Appeal Court member.</p><p><a name="06101182000030"></a>Not all commissioned
officers will have served continuously for a three-year period but will
have over three years&#146; aggregate experience. Some officers will
have left their service and subsequently rejoined, or may have left
their service to join another. The experience level of such officers is
not diminished simply because of a break in their service. The
amendments would have the effect of preventing such officers being
appointed as a member of the Summary Appeal Court and would therefore
reduce the pool of those who might be appointed as a member. It is not
right or sensible to disqualify certain officers who possess the
necessary skills and experience from membership of the SAC.</p><p><a name="06101182000031"></a>On the second point, a warrant officer is
qualified on the basis of the skills and experience that he will
inevitably have acquired. A senior non-commissioned officer will not
always have acquired those, and it would not therefore always be
appropriate for an officer to qualify for membership simply because he
previously held that rank. I therefore ask the noble Lord to consider
not moving his amendments.</p><p><a name="06101182000032"></a>On
Amendment No. 105, I can reassure noble Lords that the clause as
drafted means that the whole period which the appellant has served will
be taken into account when the SAC considers substituting a term of
detention and the length of it. The inclusion of &#147;full&#148;
adds nothing. I trust, therefore, that noble Lords feel able to not
move this amendment.</p>

with the government amendments in this group, which simply change the
reference from the &#147;Supreme Court&#148; of Northern Ireland to
the &#147;Court of Judicature&#148;. The Supreme Court of Northern
Ireland is renamed under the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 as the
Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland. Although that term has not yet
been commenced, it makes sense for the Bill to reflect it. It occurs
first in Clause 142 in relation to membership of the Summary Appeal
Court and then in Clauses 155, 348, 358, 359 and in Schedule 9, where
there is a need to refer to specific legal qualifications including
those of Northern Irish solicitors and barristers. I urge noble Lords
to accept these
amendments.</p><p><a name="06101182000034"></a><a name="spnew_235"></a><b><a name="06101182000060"></a>Lord

He described very well what the Bill is trying to do, but he did not
actually answer our questions. It seems to me that the Minister needs
to respond. I asked what surveys had been done to make sure that 14
days is sufficient. I was not attached particularly to 28 days, so
there was no point arguing against my28 days. I want to know
whether we have done some work to see whether this is
reasonable.</p><p><a name="06101182000038"></a>On the noble

martial and Clause 154 deals with its constitution. We are seeking
drastically to alter the way in which the court martial panel is chosen
and to prescribe the number of people on it. The first amendment in the
group is to subsection (1)(b), whereby the court martial would consist
of a judge advocate and &#147;five or seven&#148; other persons, of
whom,</p><ul><a name="06101186000042"></a>&#147;a prescribed
number must be officers or warrant
officers&#148;.</ul><a name="06101186000032"></a>Then, by
amendment, we seek that the rest may be drawn from all ranks who are
qualified for membership and not ineligible under the
clause.<p><a name="06101186000017"></a>The amendment to
subsection (1)(b)(ii) is to make provision in the court martial rules
that the persons specified in subsection (1)(b) shall be drawn from
each and every branch of the armed services. Then, under subsection
(4), we seek that the members of the court are not to be specified by
or on behalf of the court administration officer but selected by a
ballot from a pool constituted of people eligible to sit as members of
the court martial.</p>



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_347"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101186000018"></a>In the same group, we go on to suggest a
new clause after Clause 156 specifying that to qualify for membership
of the court martial a person should simply be a serving member of the
Armed Forces and subject to service law. It excludes only people who
are, for example, members of the court service, members of the Military
Police or those who have been involved in an investigation. That
important alteration would open up the court martial across all ranks
and not confine it, as at present, simply to officers, usually a single
warrant officer.</p><p><a name="06101186000019"></a>We also seek
to include with these amendments the question of reports. Amendment No.
129 states:</p><ul><a name="06101186000037"></a>&#147;No report
of any description shall be made referring, whether favourably or
unfavourably, to the decisions of any member of the court when sitting
in the Court
Martial&#148;.</ul><a name="06101186000033"></a>Members of
the Committee will recall that I referred earlier to that as being an
answer to the Morris point, where the European court had held that the
court martial system, which enabled junior officers to be reported for
the purposes of files, might affect the future career of those officers
according to the way in which they conducted themselves in the court
martial.<p><a name="06101186000020"></a>Finally, we deal with
the question of unanimity or, alternatively, majority verdicts, but in
a very different way from the present type of majority verdict, which
is a simple majority.</p><p><a name="06101186000021"></a>Therefore,
this is a complete recasting of the composition of the panel and, in
many ways, it mirrors the evidence given by the Judge Advocate General,
Judge Blackett, to the Select Committee when he was asked questions
about it. Members of the Committee will recall that I have already
referred to the fact that he wishes the court martial system to
approximate as closely as possible to the civil Crown Court procedure
in all the circumstances.</p><p><a name="06101186000022"></a>I
shall deal with these points in a number of ways. I turn, first, to the
ability to have on the court martial members of all ranks. This would
be quite different from the present situation. To my mind, one
objection to the court martial system is precisely that the private
soldier who appears before the court martial is appearing in front of
officers or a very senior warrant officer, and that is an intimidating
experience on any view. It does not begin to approximate the Magna
Carta requirement of a trial by one's peers. The only way in which it
can be said to comply with it is that Magna Carta requires a trial by
one's peers or according to the law of the land. It is on that second
part that, in argument in the House of Lords, the Government relied in
the case of Boyd and
others.</p><p><a name="06101186000023"></a>That
this is not such an amazing departure can be evidenced by the Universal
Code of Military Justice, which was adopted in America in about
1952-53, when it was determined that the American system of courts
martial was not compliant with the United States constitution. I am
sure that it has been amended from time to time&#151;certainly, an
amendment is now part of Article 25. Your Lordships will forgive me if
I read it because it illustrates how another common law country with a
great tradition and all the safeguards of due process, which are
contained in the constitution, has interpreted this problem.</p>

states:</p><ul><a name="06101186000038"></a>&#147;Any enlisted
member of an armed force on active duty who is not a member of the same
unit as the accused is eligible to serve on general and special
courts-martial for the trial of any enlisted member of an armed force
who may lawfully be brought before such courts for trial, but he shall
serve as a member of a court only if, before the conclusion of the
session called by the military judge ... prior to the trial or, in
the absence of such a session, before the court is assembled for the
trial of the accused, the accused personally has requested orally on
the record or in writing that enlisted members serve on
it&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101186000025"></a>The first
requirement in the American code is that there is a request by the
defendant. It
continues:</p><ul><a name="06101186000039"></a>&#147;After such a
request, the accused may not be tried by a general or special
courts-martial the membership of which does not include enlisted
members in a number comprising at least one-third of the total
membership of the court, unless eligible enlisted members cannot be
obtained&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101186000026"></a>Once the
request has been made, the second requirement in the American code is
that one third, at least, be enlisted men. The code
continues:</p><ul><a name="06101186000040"></a>&#147;When it can
be avoided, no member of an armed force may be tried by a court-martial
any member of which is junior to him in rank or
grade&#148;.</ul><a name="06101186000034"></a>That provision
exists in this country. Although the defendant may require enlisted men
if he is of the rank of sergeant or whatever, he cannot have people of
lesser rank dealing with it. It
continues:<ul><a name="06101186000041"></a>&#147;When
convening a court-martial, the convening authority shall detail as
member thereof such members of the armed forces as, in his opinion, are
best qualified for the duty by reason of age, education, training,
experience, length of service and judicial temperament. No member of an
armed force is eligible to serve as a member of a general or special
court-martial when he is the accuser or a witness of the prosecution or
investigating
officer&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101186000027"></a>The
authority that convenes has regard to the particular people who are
part of the pool from which the court martial is chosen: a request from
the defendant, one third of the membership, nobody of a rank below that
of the defendant, people chosen for their experience, and so on. Those
are the requirements in America. I see no reason why a similar system
cannot be properly introduced in this country. One of the problems of
the system is that there are class divisions within it. That is
contrary to the temper of the United Kingdom in this day and
age.</p><p><a name="06101186000028"></a>I turn from that
proposition to the one that the court martial, while not having to be
unanimous, must by a significant majority find guilt before guilt can
be established. In our amendment, where there are no fewer than seven
members of the court, five of them must agree on the finding, and where
there are five members of the court, four of them must agree. Where
there is a non-unanimous finding of guilt, the president has to state
in open court the number who agreed and the number who dissented from
that finding. That is the equivalent of the majority verdict that
exists in this country, and no doubt there would be directions by the
judge advocate to the panel along the lines of the directions we are
familiar with in the Crown Court.</p><p><a name="06101186000029"></a>I refer again to the
American experience, just to illustrate that these are not outrageous
suggestions. The requirements in Article 52 of their code are that no
person may be convicted of an offence for which the death penalty is
made mandatory, except by 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_349"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 349</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unanimous verdict; no person can be convicted of any other offence
unless two-thirds agree to that conviction; and no person is sentenced
to life imprisonment or to confinement for more than 10 years unless
three-fourths of the panel agree to those verdicts. The system in the
States is much more conscious of due process. When they have majority
verdicts, it is not just the simple majority that exists in this
country.</p><p><a name="06101186000030"></a>The argument that is
always put for the other side is that magistrates decide by a majority,
as may the Court of Appeal. In those circumstances, magistrates and
judges are trained and experienced in court proceedings. When you are
dealing with a panel of a court martial you are dealing with people who
are not trained or experienced. They are much more akin to the juries
we are familiar with.</p><p><a name="06101186000031"></a>It is fairer and more
within the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights that we
adopt majority verdict along the lines I have suggested in this
amendment. It may be a considerable change from the present, but,
supported by the chief judge of the system, I feel I am in a position
to ask your Lordships to consent to it. I beg to
move.</p><p><a name="06101184000042"></a><a name="spnew_244"></a><b><a name="06101184000116"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> My Amendments Nos. 123
to 125 concern the continuous service of members of the panel. We have
covered that point already, and do not need to go back to it. My
Amendments Nos. 118 and 119 are similar to the points raised by the
noble Lord, Lord Thomas, on Amendments Nos. 117 and 130 about majority
verdicts. The subject has been far better covered by the noble Lord
than I could possibly do.</p><p><a name="06101184000043"></a>I am
worried about the issue of majority verdicts. We do not know how the
panel in a court martial comes to its decision. Does it seek to be
unanimous, or does it vote formally? We simply do not know. My
Amendment No. 131 allows research into the operation of the panel, but
with some restrictions.</p><p><a name="06101184000044"></a>I am
afraid that I do not support the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, on the
&#147;recasting&#148;, as he put it, of the panel. I believe that
it should be composed of officers and warrant officers. If we want to
go down that route, we ought just to go for the Crown Court in the UK
and completely forget about courts martial. We do not want to go that
way, though.</p><p><a name="06101184000045"></a>The noble Lord,
Lord Thomas, said it would be intimidating for a serviceman to come
before a court martial with the panel in front of him. I suspect that
being cross-examined by the noble Lord is a bit intimidating as well.
Another difficulty is that junior soldiers would not be trained and
would not be experienced enough to decide these matters. The noble Lord
touched on that as another difficulty. Sitting on a court martial is a
bit much to ask of junior soldiers. Worse still, they may be a bit too
quick to convict. It is important to remember that the panel is not
supposed to be a jury; it is acting more as a judge. These are
interesting matters to be raised.</p><p><a name="06101184000046"></a><a name="spnew_245"></a><b><a name="06101184000117"></a>Lord
Campbell of Alloway:</b> We are getting ahead of
ourselves. My noble friend Lord Attlee is dealing with Amendment No.
131. I shall not speak to it now, but I oppose it outright. In the
context of the amendment 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_350"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford&#151;as we are going
ahead a bit&#151;if we look at Amendment No. 132, there are two types
of majority. In due course, I shall speak to Amendment No. 132, but not
now. What I am getting at is that these interrelated amendments are
disparate because they relate to disparate clauses, but is it not
possible for the structure to be withdrawn by the Government so that
all these matters can be considered in relation to each other at the
same time without the type of pre-emption we are having at the
moment?</p><p><a name="06101184000047"></a><a name="spnew_246"></a><b><a name="06101184000118"></a>Earl
Attlee:</b> We are all grateful for
the contribution of my noble friend, but this group starts with
Amendment No. 117 and ends with Amendment No.
131.</p><p><a name="06101184000048"></a><a name="spnew_247"></a><b><a name="06101184000119"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> I shall begin with Amendments Nos. 117,
118 and 119 relating to Clause 154. Having listened to the arguments
made by noble Lords in support of these amendments, I accept that there
may be benefits in stipulating the minimum and maximum numbers of lay
members who may sit at a court martial. I am clear, for example, that
there would never be fewer than three members of a court martial,
excluding the Judge Advocate, but I need to look at the implications of
putting that on the face of the Bill. I will review the wording and, if
I can, I shall bring forward an amendment on
Report.</p><p><a name="06101184000049"></a>Amendment No. 122, which
goes to Clause 154, requires those who are chosen to act as lay members
to be selected by a ballot system. I assume that the purpose of the
amendment is to ensure that each member is randomly selected. This
amendment is unnecessary because each service has a broadly similar
system for selecting lay members that embrace the principle of random
selection. That random selection produces a pool of qualified personnel
from which court administration officers appoint members unless they
are ineligible. Personnel who are serving on operational tours are not
selected.</p><p><a name="06101184000050"></a>Under the Bill, the
intention is to continue to select personnel in a similar manner.
Setting out a requirement for a balloting system on the face of the
legislation might place an unnecessary burden on the system or create
unfairness. There must be flexibility in the methods of appointing
court members in order to take into account their services&#146;
organisational and operational
requirements.</p><h5><a name="06101184000106"></a>9.45
pm</h5><p><a name="06101184000051"></a>The main effect of Amendment
No. 120 toClause 154 and Amendment No. 128&#151;the new
clause&#151;appear to be that persons of any rank would be qualified
to act as lay members of the court martial. This amendment would not be
welcomed by the services. Operational effectiveness underpins the
military justice system. We think that court-martial members must have
sufficient service experience, which includes having experience of
commanding others. Those below the rank of warrant officer or newly
commissioned officers will not always have this experience. Clause 155
in the current Bill was drafted on that basis.</p>



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_351"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 351</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><p><a name="06101184000052"></a>On the issue of personnel from different
services on courts martial, it is possible that this new clause after
Clause 156 also seeks to ensure that the lay members of the court
always comprise of personnel from different services. The current
wording of the Bill already allows for this. However, in most cases it
is intended that the defendant will appear before a court made up of
personnel from his own service. This was the preference of the First
Sea Lord and the Chief of the General Staff who in their evidence to
the Select Committee said that there should be a presumption for a
single service board unless there is a good reason for a mixed board to
be appointed&#151;for example, when defendants from different
services are tried
together.</p><p><a name="06101184000053"></a>Amendment No. 121 is,
with respect to the noble Lord, unnecessary. Service personnel
appointed to act as court members are currently drawn from all parts of
their respective services. That will continue under the Bill. I believe
that this matter is better dealt with in
guidance.</p><p><a name="06101184000054"></a>Amendments Nos. 123,
124 and 125 go to Clause 155. I have talked about eligibility for
membership of the court martial and I will not go further on that
matter. In responding to the points made by the noble Earl, Lord
Attlee, and the noble Lord, Lord Garden, relating to continuous or
aggregate service, it may be useful for me to state that we believe
that a person who has been an officer for three years has considerable
command experience, and we do not believe that he will lose this simply
because he has a break in that experience.</p><p><a name="06101184000055"></a>Amendments Nos. 126 and 127 to Clause 156
are unnecessary. As I have explained when dealing with Amendment No.
122, the services have three separate but broadly similar systems for
selecting lay members which embrace the principle of random selection.
Given this selection procedure, although it is not impossible, it is
highly improbable that a person would be repeatedly appointed as a
member of the court martial within an 18-month period.</p><p><a name="06101184000056"></a>I understand the
background to AmendmentNo. 129, but, as I said in my response
to the chairman of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, we do not think
it necessary or appropriate to take one element of the
system&#151;that relating to reporting procedures&#151;and deal
with it in legislation. What we have to ensure is that in practice all
aspects of the system provide the necessary guarantees and impartiality
including, as now, a prohibition on all reporting on the performance of
the relevant participants. It is not necessary to make provision to
this effect in the Bill. As with the decisions of jury members and
others required to decide on the guilt of those accused of offences,
the decisions of the members of the court martial should remain
confidential.</p><p><a name="06101184000057"></a>Currently, all
members of a court swear under oath at the start of the trial not to
disclose the vote or opinion of any of the members unless required
through some legal obligation. Additionally the judge advocate reminds
the members of their duty in this 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_352"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 352</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>respect at the end of the hearing. It is intended that the same
practices will continue at the court martial under the Bill.</p><p><a name="06101184000058"></a>I deal next with Amendment No. 130 tabled
in respect of Clause 159. The part of the amendment which prevents
decisions being made on the basis of a simple majority is
unnecessary.</p><p><a name="06101184000059"></a>I have listened
carefully to the arguments made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of
Gresford, and his helpful description of the US system. I have also
noted carefully the point he made about the fact that magistrates are
trained. I will reflect on that, but we believe that the amendment is
unnecessary. As he described, a summary trial in the
magistrates&#146; courts may be decided on the basis of a simple
majority and most of the cases tried by the courts martial are akin to
magistrates' courts trials, but I take on board his point about
magistrates being trained. I will go away and reflect on
that.</p><p><a name="06101184000060"></a>With his experience, I am
sure that the noble Lord is quite aware that many other jurisdictions
allow simple majority verdicts, so I shall not labour that point here.
I think that it is fair to say that there is nothing irregular or
unsafe about a decision based on a simple majority vote system.
Equally, we believe that it is unnecessary to require that a period of
time must have elapsed before a decision based on a non-unanimous vote
of members can be accepted.</p><p><a name="06101184000061"></a>We
believe that the proposal that the president should be required to
state in open court the number of those who did not believe the accused
to be guilty is inappropriate. As I said, the decisions of courts
martial must be confidential. Disclosing those details would not be in
the interests of justice, as that might influence the decisions of
courts martial members, even if the identity of those dissenting or
agreeing to the guilty verdict was not
revealed.</p><p><a name="06101184000062"></a>I
turn to Amendment No. 131, and take on board the point made by the
noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, about the structure with
reference to Amendment No. 132. Focusing on Amendment No. 131,
forthe reasons that I gave about the amendment
toClause 159, it would be inappropriate to introduce a
provision of this type. Again, I underline that we believe it to be
vital that the decisions made by the members of the court martial
remain confidential. If members of the court martial knew that the
decision that they made might be disclosed, even if only for research
purposes, they might be unduly influenced, regardless of whether those
researching matters are placed under the same duty of confidentiality
as court members.</p><p><a name="06101184000063"></a>The amendment
does not specify which members&#146; decisions might be the subject
of such research, so it might therefore extend to the judge advocate's
decisions. It would be highly inappropriate for the decisions made by
the judge advocate to be disclosed for such purposes and would not
reflect any practice adopted in the civilian criminal justice
system.</p><p><a name="06101184000064"></a><a name="spnew_248"></a><b><a name="06101184000120"></a>Earl

obvious reasons for that. However, how can the accused to be sure that
members of the panel have not been specially selected to get the right
result? How can he be confident of
that?</p><p><a name="06101184000065"></a><a name="spnew_249"></a><b><a name="06101184000121"></a>Lord
Drayson:</b> The noble Earl raises an important
point. I will reflect on that and consider how I can provide him with
reassurances on that matter and write to
him.</p><p><a name="06101184000066"></a><a name="spnew_250"></a><b><a name="06101184000122"></a>Lord
Thomas of Gresford:</b> The
Minister called to his aid the views expressed by very senior members
of the armed services when they gave evidence to the Select Committee.
I hope that he will give more weight to the view of the Judge Advocate
General, who was for many years a serving officer in the Royal Navy and
reached the heights of being Judge Advocate for the Fleet before he
became Judge Advocate General. So his daily experience of the courts
martial system is not to be ignored&#151;I do not suggest that the
Minister is ignoring it, but there is a great deal of weight to his
view. Let us take for example his answer to the Select Committee on the
number of members of the panel. He was asked by Mr Robert
Key:</p><ul><a name="06101184000101"></a>&#147;You say:
&#145;For such a small panel to try more serious matters and impose
long prison terms is objectionable&#146;. Why is it
objectionable?&#148;.</ul><a name="06101184000091"></a>He
replied:<ul><a name="06101184000102"></a>&#147;Because it
is too far removed from the civil system ... A panel of three, ie
three lay magistrates, have a certain limit to their powers of
punishment and this is so far removed that it seems to me objectionable
for those
reasons&#148;.</ul><p><a name="06101184000067"></a>There
is a great deal of weight in that. Magistrates have the power of
imprisonment of only six months, or perhaps 12 months in the case of
consecutive sentencing, whereas the court-marshal system, particularly
if it is dealing with mandatory life sentences for murder cases and so
on, has an almost unlimited power of
imprisonment.</p><p><a name="06101184000068"></a>Judge Blackett was then asked by Miss
Vera Baird, who herself is a very experienced advocate, about
same-service panels. His response
was,</p><ul><a name="06101184000104"></a>&#147;I think the
premise upon which the Act is based is that there is a requirement for
a single system of Service law because of operating patterns and more
operating together and that sort of thing. If that is your initial
premise then the panel membership should be a single system of Service
law as well ... that is the logic of it. If you say no you need to
have solely Army, solely Navy or solely Air Force panels then you are
undermining your own argument for a single system of
law&#148;.</ul><a name="06101184000092"></a>I fully
commend that answer, which seems to make a great deal of sense. We are
putting together a whole system of law, as the Minister has said today,
that is not meant to draw distinctions between the various services. I
put it to the Minister that he is advocating one-service panels only
because of pressure from the 



<notus-date day="11" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_354"></a><b>11 Oct 2006 : Column 354</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>services and their pride in the particular service to which they belong.
That is not a good enough reason for continuing with the philosophy
behind having a single-service legal system, which the Minister has
outlined to us
today.<p><a name="06101184000069"></a>I am
pleased that the Minister will reconsider the question of majority
verdicts. I hope that he does, and if I can contribute by discussing
the matter with him and others on such topics, I shall be delighted to
do so before Report. This is a real opportunity to do something to
bring the whole system up to date and to introduce a system of justice
for members of the services that fits with the legal mores of the 21st
century. There is too much harking back to the past in the
services&#146; opposition to change. It is natural; they are used to
it. But we think that we should be looking at a broader picture to
ensure that no serviceman can feel that he has not had a fair and just
trial if he is convicted of a serious offence. For the moment, and
pending further discussion, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</p><p><a name="06101184000070"></a>Amendment, by leave,

the view that parents are altruistic towards their

children from changes in family
income.<p><a name="06101176000026"></a>Recent research by

12,000 rockets. We have no way of independently verifying this figure,

published on the HMRC website at
www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/tax_receipts/table1-2.xls. The total estimated
receipts for 2006-07 are broadly equivalent to what would be raised by
increasing the basic rate of income tax by 1 pence as shown in the
relevant tax ready reckoner.
www.hmrc.gov.uk/stats/tax_expenditures/1_6_apr06.xls. The results cover
only the direct effects of tax changes on tax receipts. In practice,
changes to the tax regime will affect economic variables which in turn
would have further effects on tax
receipts.</p>
