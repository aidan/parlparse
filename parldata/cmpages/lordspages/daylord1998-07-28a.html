<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80728-01_para2"></a>Why their treatment of English, Welsh and Northern Irish students at Scottish universities was not part of their election manifesto.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80728-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Education and Employment   (Baroness Blackstone): </B>  My Lords, the concession for Scottish students in their final honours year of first-degree courses at Scottish universities was made following a recommendation from the Dearing Inquiry and its Scottish committee under Sir Ron Garrick. The inquiry did not recommend extending the concession to students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We made it clear before the election that we were awaiting the inquiry's recommendations before finalising our policy on support for higher education students. With the support of your Lordships' House, we have now agreed to appoint an independent review.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for that reply. However, there was no suggestion in the manifesto that there should be discrimination against any students in this country. Discrimination apparently now exists in law, but a review is being appointed. Does this mean that the manifesto is negotiable?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, as I said in my earlier response, prior to the election the Labour Party made it clear that it supported the setting up of the <P>


<a name="column_1340"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1340</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Dearing Inquiry into higher education and that it would wait for the results of that inquiry. Given that the inquiry had not reported before the election, the Labour Party could hardly have put in its manifesto that it intended to do anything about making a concession for students in Scotland in the fourth year of their honours degree course.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm whether a migrant worker from the European Economic Area who lives in England for a year before applying to a Scottish university will pay fees for one year less than his English neighbour who has lived there all his life?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, no, I can confirm that there are residence requirements for students who are from overseas but who live in the UK. However, a European Union student from a European Union country rather than from another overseas country would have to be treated under EU law in exactly the same way as British nationals.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, in the run-up to the general election, the Prime Minister said that the Labour Party had no plans to introduce tuition fees. Was that not misleading?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, in the run-up to the election, the Labour Party gave support to the Dearing Inquiry set up by the previous government. We made it clear that we were concerned about the funding crisis in higher education created by the last government and that we were prepared to consider various options which did not rule out seeking a contribution towards fees from those who benefit from higher education.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Glenamara: </B>   My Lords, is not the Scottish anomaly an absurd consequence of the Government's equally absurd and grossly unfair decision to charge fees at English universities?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, no. The Government accepted the recommendations made by the Dearing Committee that those who benefit from higher education should make a contribution towards the cost of their tuition. That has been widely accepted as fair and reasonable. Indeed, an opinion poll survey carried out last year revealed that just under 70 per cent. of parents think it reasonable that they should make a contribution towards tuition fees.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Knight of Collingtree: </B>   My Lords, is it right that membership of the European Union allows students from all other parts of Europe to attend cut-price? Why does not England, as a member of the European Union, have a cut price, too?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, while the EC treaty requires member states not to discriminate on grounds of nationality against nationals of other member states on matters within the scope of the treaty, EC law does not intervene on internal matters. It does not require <P>


<a name="column_1341"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1341</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>each member state to treat all its nationals in exactly the same way. Therefore, under EU law we are not obliged to make precisely the same financial assistance available to students who are ordinarily resident in England, Wales or Northern Ireland as to those ordinarily resident in Scotland; just as we are not required to make exactly the same arrangements for part-time students as we do for full-time students or for further education students as we do for higher education students.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, the Minister quoted the opinion poll figure of 70 per cent. of parents being in favour of contributing towards fees. Will she accept the same figure when it is used with regard to clauses of the Crime and Disorder Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I cannot answer questions about the Crime and Disorder Bill. I am not sure that a survey has been conducted similar to that in relation to parents making a contribution when they can afford it to the costs of their children's higher education.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the Scottish parliament will be allowed to be kinder to English students?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I would not dare to anticipate anything that the Scottish parliament might decide.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Geddes: </B>   My Lords, what will happen to a student of proven Scottish nationality who is resident in England?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the issue has absolutely nothing to do with nationality. There is no discrimination on the grounds of nationality. It is a matter of two different education systems, one north of the Border and one south of the Border, which is why the Dearing Committee recommended that a concession should be made to students educated in Scotland. Students educated in England will have had a different educational background before they go to university.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, has the noble Baroness ever heard of equal treatment?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, yes, of course I have heard of equal treatment. But the purpose of the concession which the Dearing Committee recommended was to allow those students from Scotland who had had only one year of education at the sixth-form level to gain a degree for the cost of &#163;3,000, which is the same as for students south of the Border.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, in relation to the Minister's remark about wealthy parents being able to pay, is she aware that at the Labour Party Conference last year the Prime Minister stated: "No parent will have to pay more"?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-01_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the Prime Minister was entirely accurate in what he said, as we are asking <P>


<a name="column_1342"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1342</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parents to make a contribution towards the tuition costs of their children's education. However, we are in addition providing extra loan finance so that a student can borrow more money and pay it back when his or her income as a graduate makes that possible. Therefore, the parent has to contribute less in maintenance as a compensation for contributing to the fee. That is why the Prime Minister was entirely accurate in what he said.

<P>

<A NAME = "80728-01_para4"></a>The Chief Scientific Adviser issued guidelines last year on the use of scientific advice in policy-making. These advocate obtaining the best available scientific advice from a sufficiently wide range of sources.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-01_para5"></a>As a demonstration of our commitment to communication and to these guidelines, we have re-established the Council for Science and Technology, which is chaired by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and has three additional independent members.

Is he also aware that some of the Answers given in your Lordships' House have about them a wooden and repetitive quality which suggests that a little fresh air let in before they are drafted would be rather a good thing? Can I take it from his Answer that the Government accept that in a fast moving age they cannot be other than right in taking every measure to inform themselves fully about the perils and the opportunities which come from scientific sources?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   My Lords, I can only agree with the noble Lord that we must inform ourselves as best we can and take account of every avenue of scientific advice available to us in order to improve both the science base and our competitive performance in industry, which is vital. If the Answers appear wooden and dismal it is because the Questions appear so repetitive.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew1"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, as the individual to whom the Minister is probably referring, may I ask him whether he accepts that science tends to follow fashions and that different scientists have different ideas? One of the problems with experts is that they <P>


<a name="column_1343"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1343</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>know all the answers so they do not ask the questions. Therefore, will the Minister accept that the Government's latest proposals are very welcome to me? I hope that we shall have a fresh wind blowing through MAFF and the Ministry of Defence.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely glad that there is a supportive comment on the whole question of the way in which we consult and develop policy. I took the noble Countess's comments to be very supportive, particularly in relation to those areas which apply to scientists and the science base. We have a wide range of research councils and extremely good advice on science. Long may that continue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Baldwin of Bewdley: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that there is sometimes a language problem when scientists communicate with lay people and that when, for example, scientists say, as they frequently do--and I am talking about the meaning of the word "evidence" here--that there is no evidence to show such and such, often what they mean is either that they are not yet 95 per cent. certain or else "We haven't actually looked"?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   My Lords, as a modern linguist it has often proved difficult for me to understand some of the submissions from scientists that I have received in my industrial career. It has struck me recently that their ability to give evidence to require the political system to provide answers has been successful to the extent that they have secured an extra &#163;1.1 billion on their spending budget, which was already, in private and government hands, at &#163;14.4 billion. Therefore, it seems to me that there is evidence that their communication is both successful and clear.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, if the Minister has found the noble Countess's Questions repetitive, does he agree that on occasion that may be because they have been answered at the seventh rather than the first time of asking? Do I take it from the encouraging words that I have heard exchanged that that will no longer take place?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   My Lords, I can only speak for my own position in response to the noble Earl. I am now answering for the second time. I hope that I bring wholly good news on a series of repetitive questions that amount to two.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord makes much of the business of repetitive questions. Will he accept an assurance from this side of the House that Questions will cease to be repetitive just as soon as they receive satisfactory answers?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Simon of Highbury: </B>   My Lords, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating. I hope that the noble Lord is satisfied with an increase of &#163;1.1 billion in the science budget over three years and the extension of research councils. I am sure that all noble Lords will look forward to the good news which the Prime Minister may bring about these matters when he makes a Statement later in the day.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "80728-02_para0"></a>What progress has been made since 31st December 1997 in reducing the number of bogus asylum seekers in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="80728-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, provisional figures show that more than 3,000 failed asylum seekers have been removed from the United Kingdom in the first six months of 1998. The White Paper Fairer, faster and firmer: a modern approach to immigration and asylum published yesterday includes measures to minimise further the scope for abuse of the asylum system and to increase our ability to remove those who have no basis of stay in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that reply and for what he is doing in trying to deal with this problem. Bearing in mind that tyranny has greatly increased in the world in recent years and that a very high proportion of asylum seekers prefer to come here rather than to spread themselves elsewhere, perhaps even to other countries within the European Union, has not the time come to renegotiate the 1951 convention on refugees?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, tyranny has certainly spread and that means that the victims of tyranny have increased substantially. One of the reasons that people seek to come to this country is that they hope they will receive a civilised reception. Certainly I bear in mind carefully what the noble Lord said. His namesake made the same point a few days ago. The 1951 convention is now historic but it still has a good deal of underlying validity.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that the proportion of refugees attempting to enter Germany continues to be substantially higher than in this country; and that proportionately, the number seeking to enter Holland--a country considerably smaller in population terms--is higher than in this country? Does he agree that the central dilemma for the Home Office is to distinguish between those seeking to enter this country for entirely economic reasons and those who have great cause to seek asylum because of the positions they have taken in fighting tyranny?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, it is certainly right to observe that Germany and Holland bear an enormous burden of refugees. In many ways, they have discharged their burden admirably. It is a mistake to concentrate always on the pressures on the United Kingdom.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-02_para1"></a>The noble Baroness identifies the dilemma absolutely correctly. We must say no to economic migrants. We have treaty obligations and, I dare say, moral commitments to behave properly to those who are genuinely in need of asylum.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Janner of Braunstone: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend accept that everyone in this House will welcome the steps which the Government are taking to deal with bogus asylum seekers? But will he recognise this country's honourable and ancient tradition of providing asylum for people who are in real danger? Will he give the House an assurance that every step will be taken to try to preserve their right to seek asylum in this land?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I confirm that. Quite apart from treaty and moral obligations, I believe that this country--and many in your Lordships' House are testimony to it--has benefited infinitely from giving an open, generous welcome to refugees, not least in the years before 1939. It is a difficult dilemma. Those who abuse the system, or try to, are causing great damage and distress, which is avoidable damage and distress, for those who have genuine claims.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew16"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that there is no litmus test which makes it possible to distinguish between a bogus asylum seeker and a genuine refugee before their claims are heard? Therefore, will he agree further that the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is one to which neither he nor anyone else can possibly know the answer?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that the absolutist nature of the noble Earl's proposition is absolutely right in every conceivable circumstance. I can think of some instances--I have seen them myself--when it is obvious that people are not coming here on the basis of genuine asylum claims. In some circumstances, one can detect the bogus quite easily. But that is not so in all cases, which is why we must have a regime such as the Home Secretary is about constructing.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that, in the context of the encouraging White Paper published yesterday, it becomes imperative to encourage all those handling detained asylum seekers to remember the overriding commitment at all times to preserve their dignity and to respect their potential rights and not to fall into the trap of being afraid of public opinion whipped up by the use of words like "bogus"?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend makes an extremely important point. Case working is an extremely difficult job. It deserves the admiration of us all. Everyone who works in this area needs to be aware that people are frightened; they come from different cultural backgrounds; they are unhappy in a foreign land; and, very often, their linguistic skills are limited. That is a constant theme of training which the Home Office encourages.

<A NAME="80728-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that many of us who have spoken in this House in the past about the need for provision for asylum seekers to be a national responsibility are delighted that the White Paper is now taking away the burden from particular centres such as London which were carrying that burden? I am pleased to see that there will be one offer of accommodation for people. At present, Westminster Council and other councils arrange for people to go to, for example, Liverpool and Great Yarmouth. Many people who have extremely desirable accommodation arranged for them simply vanish. Only a very small number arrive at their destination or they arrive, and then vanish. How do the Government propose to deal with that problem?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful for the generous welcome that the noble Baroness has given to the White Paper. However, this matter must be dealt with on a national basis. If one has a genuine asylum seeker and accommodation, shelter, food and clothing are needed--in other words, the necessities of daily life--then, by definition, they are likely to be within the accommodation provided. The noble Baroness is quite right: absconders are a very difficult problem to deal with. One then has the further dilemma of using detention, which we want to avoid if we possibly can, as opposed to people coming to this country and simply departing. One of the things that we are looking at is more rigorous reporting restrictions so that a reasonable burden may be put on an asylum seeker without it becoming an unfair burden.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, while I fully understand the problem and appreciate what the Government are trying to do about it, does the Minister realise that, apart from Germany and Holland--which, strangely enough, are not as over-populated as the places here to which asylum seekers come--many other countries just do not bear their fair share of dealing with the financial and social problems that arise through having a large number of asylum seekers?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has made a perfectly legitimate point. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is determined to deal with these matters in a European and international context, rather than simply on a national basis. I revert to what I said in answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby. In many ways, Germany has a pretty good record in this context.

</UL><A NAME="80728-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Jay of Paddington): </B>  My Lords, I can assure my noble friend that the Government appreciate the importance of effective modern hearing aids and how vital they are to millions of people. The NHS has made progress in the past few years in providing more up-dated aids, such as high frequency and mini-aids. However, as I am sure my noble friend is aware, different people have very different requirements and demands to help deal with their hearing difficulties. It has been difficult for the NHS to establish sufficiently broad criteria for successful improvements as regards bulk purchases of any one type of new aid and making them cost-effective. We hope that this kind of assessment of new technology will become easier and improve once the National Institute for Clinical Excellence is established during the next year.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I have no personal interest to declare because I use a cochlear implant. However, despite her Answer, is my noble friend aware that the overwhelming majority of NHS patients using hearing aids--some 99 per cent.--do not have those specially adapted and improved hearing aids; indeed, they have the old-fashioned aids? They lack modern developments such as automatic adjustment, the multi-direction microphone and the reduction of background noise, all of which are important and are all embodied in private hearing aids. Therefore, bearing in mind what my noble friend said about bulk buying and the fact that it is the biggest buyer of hearing aids in the world, why can the NHS not use its strength as a bulk buyer to buy more modern hearing aids at bargain basement prices?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate my noble friend's great interest and expertise in the area. As President of the Royal National Institute for Deaf People, I believe that he will be aware that it is precisely because Ministers in the Department of Health were concerned about the points that he raises that a national working group was set up last September by the NHS Executive. It is now working on the outcome of those deliberations and is to put a ministerial proposal to my honourable friends the Minister for Public Health and the Minister for community health during the next few weeks. It is to be hoped that some of the improvements that my noble friend mentioned will come out of those discussions.

<A NAME="80728-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that many of the problems with hearing aids might in some ways be ameliorated if more attention were paid to teaching people how to use them properly? Indeed, it was brought to my attention that only about 10 per cent. know that they have something called a "T" switch on their hearing aid which can help cut out background noise. Surely teaching people how to use their hearing aids properly would be a much better way of progressing if we cannot purchase the exact up-to-date equipment.

<A NAME="80728-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord makes a most important point. It is the inexpert or perhaps one should say ill-informed use of some of the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>equipment which seems to lead to it not functioning in the way that it might do at its optimum. One of the issues that the NHS has to consider is the expense of specialised training for audiology departments of NHS trusts which may be providing such services. That is an extra expense which must be considered when one is looking at the upgrading of the whole service.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-03_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the RNID has found that about 3 million people who could benefit from having a hearing aid do not in fact have one? Indeed, many people lack awareness of the potential benefits of hearing aids and of their limitations. That also applies to many GPs, who consequently fail to refer people on to NHS hearing aid services. Therefore, will the Government consider how both patients and professionals might become better informed in that area?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I believe that this was one of the subjects discussed in the national working group to which I referred. As the noble Earl may be aware, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People was part of that working group. I am sure that the institute made those points very clear in the discussions with the Department of Health.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Hamilton of Dalzell: </B>   My Lords, I believe that modern hearing aids are a great deal more expensive than the old-fashioned ones. Therefore, can the Minister assure the House that it is not cost which is controlling this service?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, there are resource issues involved, as I said in response to the noble Lord who asked about the knowledge of and training for people using hearing aids. Indeed, there is a wide range of expenses as regards providing hearing assistance to many people. We are trying to achieve the most cost-effective service for a large number of people--I believe several million--who could benefit in this way. Clearly cost has to be a factor; but cost-effectiveness is the most reasonable thing to try to achieve.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-03_para7"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: In the absence of my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish from the Chamber, perhaps I may say what a great pleasure it is to be able to start a Committee day promptly. I am sure that the Ministers are as determined as I am to make good progress in this fullish day that we have before us.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-03_para8"></a>The first group of amendments comprises Amendments No. 228, 229 and 232. I seek to propose amendments to Clause 30 which, falling upon a similar provision in the Human Rights Bill, provides that when a member of the Scottish executive in charge of a Bill brings the legislation before the parliament he shall,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"on or before introduction of the Bill in the Parliament, make a statement to the effect that in his view an Act of the Scottish Parliament containing the same provisions as those in the Bill would be within the legislative competence of the Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-03_para9"></a>The three amendments that I propose are designed to achieve, first, that the statement is made "to the Parliament"; and, secondly--this is a very important suggestion--that the view which the member of the Scottish executive puts forward should not be his own view but that of the Scottish executive. Thirdly, Amendment No. 232 seeks to ensure that the statement should be made in two stages during the passage of the Bill. It should be made primarily during the general debate on the Bill, which is provided for in Clause 34(1)(a), and then it should be repeated during the debate on the final stages, which is provided for in Clause 34(1)(c). Quite obviously, the last amendment is designed to take account of the possibility, as one anticipates will happen with the Scottish parliament--as, indeed, happens with Bills going through this House--that not only opposition members but the minister in charge of a Bill will seek to bring forward amendments on behalf of the Scottish executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-03_para10"></a>In my view it is important that the view which is placed before the members of the parliament is the view of the Scottish executive itself. This is because the issue as to whether or not the provisions set out in the Bill would lie or do lie within the legislative competence of the parliament is a question of law. When a Bill becomes an Act of the Scottish parliament, there are devolution issues which fall to be determined in accordance with the procedures set out in Clause 91 in Schedule 6 of the Bill. The first of these is whether an Act of the Scottish parliament or any provision of an Act of the Scottish parliament is within the legislative competence of the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-03_para11"></a>So the issue is a question of law. And, with the greatest respect to those who will serve as ministers in the Scottish executive, it is not their personal view as laymen that matters, it is the view, on this important question of law, of the Scottish executive.

<A NAME = "80728-03_para12"></a>Anyone who had the benefit of hearing the long Pepper v. Hart statement read into the Official Report last week by the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, will know that that issue is a highly complicated one. If such a statement is made to the Scottish parliament it will be open to members of the parliament to ask questions about the statement, raise queries as to whether it is entirely correct, and no doubt identify particular provisions in the Bill where there may or may not be some doubt as to whether the provision lies within the legislative competence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-03_para13"></a>It is important that the views that are being defended should be clearly identified as the views of the Scottish executive as a body. It is inconceivable that any such statement will have been made without the benefit of legal advice. One suspects that the statement will be drafted or at least revised by those lawyers who are acting for the Scottish executive, whether solicitors within the department which the first minister will no doubt establish, or people advised by the Scottish law officers and the legally qualified staff of the law officers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-03_para14"></a>If lawyers are having an input into the statement on behalf of the Scottish executive, it seems to me appropriate that it is the view of that body which should be made clear. We do not yet know what conventions will apply to the advice given by the Scottish law officers to the Scottish executive. My amendment does not require one of them to come before the parliament and defend the view on behalf of the executive. I do not seek to trespass on that area at the moment. All I seek to establish is what I believe is important; namely, that the Bill should not remain the personal view of the Minister but should reflect the view of the Scottish executive.

<A NAME="80728-04_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   It is undoubtedly correct to incorporate the content of these amendments into the First Reading procedure in the Scottish parliament. I am sure that the Scottish parliament will do that. But, as the question of the vires of the parliament will always be a major component of the scrutiny process in the Scottish parliament, on these Benches we do not believe that it is necessary to incorporate the amendment on the face of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   Amendments Nos. 228 and 232 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, are, in our view, unnecessarily prescriptive. We agree with the views put forward by the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie. We do not believe that we should be trying to prescribe how Scottish ministers should make the statement required by Clause 30. We should leave it to the parliament and Scottish ministers to agree on how the information required by Clause 30 is presented both to the parliament and the public at large.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-04_para0"></a>It is possible, for example, that the statement would be included as part of the memorandum accompanying the Bill when it is introduced, just as at present the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum accompanying a Bill introduced in this House includes information on various matters. On the other hand, if we accepted the <P>


<a name="column_1351"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1351</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendment it could be read as implying that the minister must make an oral statement to the parliament on the introduction of a Bill. I believe we should leave it to the discretion of the minister to decide on the form of the statement as the Bill provides.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-04_para1"></a>Equally, if any member of the parliament decides that it would be helpful to have a view from the executive on the legislative competence of a Bill at some stage after introduction, it would be up to that member to seek the view of the minister during debate. We do not need Amendment No. 232 to allow that to happen, and it seems quite inappropriate to require that such a view must be given in every case at two stages of the passage of a Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-04_para2"></a>I hope that noble Lords will agree that we are right to leave it to the Scottish executive and the parliament to develop its working practices which will ensure that questions relating to legislation, including the vires of legislation, can be revised and addressed as appropriate. It is our intention that the parliament should be allowed, where appropriate, to decide for itself how it should operate day to day.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-04_para3"></a>We also consider that the other amendment in this group, Amendment No. 229, is inappropriate. It is likely that a member of the Scottish executive will want to seek the approval of his colleagues before making a statement about the legislative competence of a Bill before it is introduced into the parliament. But, at the end of the day, it will primarily be his responsibility to satisfy himself that the Bill he is responsible for is within the legislative competence of the parliament. It is therefore appropriate that the statement will record his view. However, there is the safeguard that all the ministers will be legally responsible for any such statement through Clause 48(4) which provides that, among other things, any act of a member of the Scottish executive will be treated as an act of each member of the Scottish executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-04_para4"></a>I therefore urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I was interested in that reply. I expect to an extent that it holds water well. However, I remind the noble Baroness that this matter and others which we are about to deal with are not just questions of the law and legal mechanics. How the public view the progress of the Bill in the parliament, the discussion and so on will matter very much. The reputation of the parliament and the quality of Scottish legislation will hang on the smooth working of the system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-04_para5"></a>The noble Lady said that the Government do not mind whether this statement is made prior to the Bill being laid before the parliament or whether it is in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum. If one thinks this through and tries to imagine how the procedure will work, I think it would be much better if the statement was made before the Bill appeared. Once the Bill is printed, the die is cast and the Bill has to be discussed. People will want to know that it is considered to be intra vires, and why, before they begin to discuss it at all.

Have the Government really considered whether these alternatives are equally good?

<A NAME="80728-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I agree wholeheartedly with the noble Baroness that this is not just a question of legal mechanics. I also agree with her that the workings and the proceedings of the parliament and how they are viewed by the public are matters of the utmost importance. But does not the noble Baroness think that the members of the Scottish parliament would think of that as well? The Government have thought through carefully what the Bill contains on these points and, as always, the amendments that are proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon. The view of the Government is that they are unnecessarily prescriptive, as I have said, and that there is adequate coverage of the basic principles underlying them in the Bill as it stands.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I appreciate what the Minister has said about Clause 48 which asserts collective responsibility within the executive, but so, in my view, does Amendment No. 229. It would have the merit of building in the legal point of view of the Scottish Law Officers at the earliest possible stage. Here I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, that it is desirable that this clarity should be introduced into the proceedings of the parliament at the earliest possible stage in each Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I appreciate the concern of all Members of the Committee to make sure that the best practice is in force in the Scottish parliament. That is something we all agree on. However, if I may say so, I think there is a tendency to try to second guess the members of the Scottish parliament in dotting every "i" and crossing every "t" as to what they should do at all times. The Government trust the good political sense and the good common sense of the members of the Scottish parliament. I stand by our opinion of these amendments which is that they are over-prescriptive and unnecessarily prescriptive.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   I hope the noble Baroness can help me. I, of course, understand the point that she makes about trusting the Scottish parliament and, presumably, the Scottish executive. Can she explain the practice of this clause? She mentioned en passant Clause 48(4) giving rise to some kind of collective responsibility on the part of the Scottish executive. I understand that; but what is the nature of this responsibility? If the statement turns out to be wrong--it has been made for some purpose which I do not quite follow--what is the nature of the responsibility which is being shouldered by the Scottish executive for that statement?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   I understand that. The question is, what is the responsibility which the Scottish executive shoulders by making the statement? Will it become liable for damages to people who have relied upon the statement? What exactly is the purpose of the statement and what is the nature of the responsibility that is assumed?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-04_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   The purpose of the statement--which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, also seeks in his amendment, and which the Government have laid down in the Bill--is that the Scottish executive assumes the responsibility of saying that in its judgment the Bill (or whatever it is bringing forward) is within the vires, the power and competence of the Scottish parliament. I do not think it is any more or any less than that. It would be challenged in the usual way if there was anything wrong. It is not intended to be a legal responsibility on the executive; it is a statement to ensure that the executive has properly considered the issue and made a proper judgment in so far as it is competent to do so--one would hope it would have considerable competence--that the measure is within the power and competence of the Scottish parliament.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving such a full response. However, I have some difficulty with Clause 48(4). As I understand it, it seeks to deal with situations where some form of legal liability or legal rights may arise as a result of the acts or omissions of one member of the Scottish executive which binds the executive and any other member of it. Over the Recess I shall think carefully about the reliance which the Government place on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-04_para7"></a> I began to think that in her closing remarks the noble Baroness was coming round to the view that there may be some merit in the approach that I advocate because she talked of the Scottish executive putting forward a Bill which in its judgment--those were her words--fell within the legal competence of the parliament. I am sure she is correct about that. It is inconceivable that a Bill will be put forward without the Scottish executive as a body being satisfied that the Bill falls within the legal competence of the parliament. If that is so, I have some difficulty as to why it is the personal view of the member that is provided for in Clause 30(1) and not the view of the Scottish executive. I do not regard the giving of the view as an act or an omission. I regard it as an expression of opinion on what I have already suggested is a highly complicated question of law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-04_para8"></a>This matter will benefit from some thought over the Recess, particularly when we consider in detail the long Pepper v. Hart statement about Clause 28 which was made some days ago. On the understanding that this matter may be worth revisiting, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(b) of his view as to the economic, social and environmental impact and sustainability of an Act of the Scottish Parliament containing the same provisions as those in the Bill").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-05_para0"></a>The noble Earl said: This amendment continues the subject of the introduction procedures for legislation in the Scottish parliament. The amendment has the purpose of ensuring that Ministers of the Scottish executive bring forward legislation which is certified to be not just intra vires, as we have just discussed,  but also economically, socially and environmentally friendly and sustainable. Indeed, I wish to extend this amendment to any member of the Scottish parliament who is introducing a Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-05_para1"></a>The amendment has been proposed to me as a probing amendment by the RSPB in Scotland. I believe that the issue is an important one for the Committee as it would give a guarantee that the Scottish parliament will enact only sustainable legislation. The prohibition in effect on unsustainable legislation will save the Scottish parliament a degree of scrutiny time, although it will by no means eliminate the need for scrutiny. While there has been a general desire for a minimum of restrictions on the activity of the Scottish parliament intra vires, I believe that we are allowed to set down some minimum philosophy on the face of the Bill. The complex nature of compliance with existing Scottish, British and Community law will ensure that most enactments are ultimately compliant. I therefore see no reason why they should not be required to be in compliance at the start.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-05_para2"></a>Amendment No. 242 is grouped with this one. It is aimed at ensuring that all Scottish Acts are compatible with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child as adopted by the United Kingdom Parliament. It is important that Scottish Ministers, indeed any proposer of legislation in the Scottish parliament, should have the convention on children's rights firmly in front of them when drafting legislation. For a Bill to be presented in an incompatible state would be a demonstration of incompetence and possibly contempt. The presentation of incompetent legislation is always a waste of parliamentary time. I am absolutely confident that, even in the friendly Scottish parliament, those who form the Opposition will pounce on incompetent legislation and that which is ultra vires. The inclusion of this new clause on the face of the Bill would ensure that the Scottish parliament understood its responsibilities right from the start and that all citizens interested in children's welfare and their future would have confidence in the legislation passed by the parliament. The children's rights "proofing" measure must be seen as an asset to the Bill and to the parliament. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   The noble Earl suggests that Amendment No. 230 would ensure that the legislation coming before the parliament was economically, <P>


<a name="column_1355"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1355</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>socially and environmentally friendly. The amendment does not actually state that. It states that the Minister would be required to give,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"his view as to the economic, social and environmental impact and sustainability of an Act of the Scottish Parliament containing the same provisions as those in the Bill". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-05_para3"></a>Looking back on the history of legislation, I believe that that assumes a degree of wisdom and omniscience that has been sadly lacking in our previous attempts over a wide area of policy. The thought that a Minister would be able to make a full and comprehensive statement of the likely economic, social, environmental and sustainability impact of any single piece of legislation is one that I find quite daunting. However, I have little difficulty in recognising and supporting the sentiments to which the noble Earl wishes to draw attention. I am sure that the noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, would have made a similar case were he in his place today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-05_para4"></a>The difficulty is that this degree of detail, as to the type of introductory statement that should be made and the sort of matters a Scottish Minister should include when introducing a Bill, comes down to minutiae. I wish to see the Scottish parliament and Scottish Ministers continue their commitment to sustainability, which has been well established in the Scottish Office over recent years. However, it is not right for the Bill itself, which sets up the framework within which the parliament and the executive can decide their own policies, to take that step and begin setting out in detail how the parliament should go about its business. I have no qualms at all in fully supporting the noble Earl's wish for the Scottish parliament to move forward on a comprehensive front in terms of economic, social, environmental and sustainability issues. However, I do not believe it right for this Parliament to impose that sort of statutory duty on a Minister.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Linklater of Butterstone: </B>   I support my noble friend on Amendment No. 242 dealing with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is surely only right that every Bill should be considered in terms of its compliance with the convention. The future of our children is one of the pre-eminent issues that we should bear in mind: survival rights, development rights, protection rights and participation rights, all of which are contained in the convention. UNICEF wholeheartedly supports the amendment and the positive impact it sees it having on the lives of children in Scotland. Given that backing, the amendment should be hard to resist.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I thought I would listen to the Minister before intervening. I was puzzled when the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, said on the previous amendment that he did not think a statement should be made as a statement, and he now comes forward with a whole raft of matters on which a statement is to be made. All the noble Earl has missed out is motherhood and apple pie.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-05_para5"></a>This is an instance of where the "trust the Scottish parliament" theme enters into the argument. Any government bringing forward legislation believe that they are doing the right thing. They may not be doing <P>


<a name="column_1356"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1356</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the right thing, but they believe they are. They certainly think they are doing the right thing in relation to economic and social issues. I suppose, in matters of social security, the Government believe the clear-out they have had over the past two days in the Department of Social Security to be the right thing. I am sure all governments believe that the environmental impact of their legislation is the right thing. As for obeying the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, I assure the Committee without giving away any secrets that the L Committee never talked of anything other than these matters. It is certainly advised by the learned Law Officers about EU legislation and conventions and United Nations conventions to make sure that the legislation is correct. We should be extremely careful about going overboard in regard to statements.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-05_para6"></a>After hearing the Minister's reply, I wonder what is the difference between Clause 30 and all the matters that the noble Earl wishes to see included. I believe that they would be unnecessary words on the face of the legislation. Equally, I think that the whole of Clause 30 is unnecessary. Frankly, if the Minister tells the Committee that the Scottish executive and the Scottish parliament can be trusted not to bring forward measures that are environmentally, economically or socially unsound, or disobey a convention, then surely we can also trust the parliament not to bring forward legislation which is against its legal competence. The Minister's answer suggests that the whole of Clause 30 could easily be dropped. Perhaps the noble Lord should move against his own clause. If the Scottish parliament does not need to hear statements about all these other matters, surely it does not need to hear a statement about the competence of legislation. I should have thought that if the L committee exists, as I am sure it will, in the Scottish parliament, one matter about which it will be concerned, and the one question that it will ask is: is this within our legislative competence? The matter will have nothing to do with a statement to the Scottish parliament. It will be a question of whether or not it is hauled before the courts of this country if it attempts to go outside the legal competence. I agree with the Minister's argument against the noble Earl's amendment. But, frankly, his argument convinces me that the whole clause should be dropped.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I cannot resist replying to that point. There is a fundamental difference between Clause 30 as it now stands and the amendment offered by the noble Earl. Clause 30 deals with the basic issue of a statement about competence and whether the proposed legislation is within the competence of the parliament. That is a fundamental issue. The noble Earl's amendment deals with policy content, which can be discussed only after the issue of competence has been decided. So the noble Earl's amendment is very much a second order amendment, while the clause is a first order clause.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   But surely, if one is considering policy, one must look at Schedule 5 where sometimes policy on the same issue is partly reserved and partly not reserved. Therefore, the question of competence will have to run through the whole of the Scottish government's legislative programme. It will <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>have to address the issues all the time as it draws up the legislation. As it will have done that, the idea that the minister appearing before the parliament and saying "We believe this is within the legislative competence" will carry any weight in a court of law is, I suspect, Cloud-cuckoo-land.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80728-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   I hesitate to get in the way of the ping-pong between the two Front Benches on the issue. I support the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, who made valuable points on Amendment No. 230.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para0"></a>I wish to address some of the questions that have been raised in the past few minutes. Recently we have passed Article 3(d) of the Treaty of Amsterdam, which brought environmental protection requirements right to the heart of all Community policies. I assume that the Scottish parliament will be a good European in that respect and perhaps might need a shred of comfort in addressing its environmental and sustainable development duties in all its legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para1"></a>I also wish to pick up the point with which the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, taunted me in my absence last night in terms of consistency. Recently, in the Government of Wales Bill, we had debates in this House and another place on strengthening the clear sustainable development duty that the Welsh assembly will have. We will shortly debate the sustainable development duty of the regional development agencies in England. Last night the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, called for consistency from the three absent noble Baronesses. I should have thought one element of consistency might be some reference to sustainable development on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para2"></a>The importance of sustainable development for Scotland cannot be underestimated. The Committee has heard me speak on many occasions of the economic value of Scotland's environment; it is a hugely important part of its economic future. I hope that the words of support that we have received from the Minister will indicate that not only in its legislative programme but also in all its works the Scottish parliament will put sustainable development at the heart of all it does.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para3"></a> I thank Members of the Committee for being so animated about the point. I hope that means that people are interested in it as a topic, as well as simply part of the machinery of government. It is vital to see sustainable development not simply as another policy area that can be added to a string of policy areas, but as a process and an approach for the future in Scottish legislation.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-06_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   The noble Baroness knows a great deal about such matters but she has forgotten that the procedures of this Parliament include pre-legislative scrutiny. It seems to me that the noble Earl has also forgotten that, and I am not sure that the Minister had not forgotten it. Surely, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, of which the noble Baroness has been such a distinguished office-bearer, will have a tremendous opportunity to influence legislation in <P>


<a name="column_1358"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1358</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Scotland through pre-legislative scrutiny. I believe I am right that that is where such bodies will say to the Scots parliament that a Bill needs to contain this, this and this element. Likewise, in respect of the convention on the rights of the child there are groups in Scotland which are already very assiduous in watching what the Westminster Parliament does. They will watch the Scots parliament. At that stage, before legislation comes to the Scots parliament, they will intervene. They will be good at it and look forward to it. That is the great merit of the system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para4"></a>I do not understand why the noble Lord talks in terms of what should happen when the Bill is presented to the parliament.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-06_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I thank Members of the Committee for their support, wherever it came from. It is interesting to see how those noble Lords who sit on my left are already becoming the guardians of the procedures of the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para5"></a>I am certain that, whenever legislation is introduced, where it will have a harsh impact it will be pounced upon by the opposition in the parliament. We are discovering that the nature of opposition in the Scottish parliament will not just be concerned with the usual test of whether legislation will work--that is, whether it is seaworthy--but will also involve close scrutiny of whether it will contravene other legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para6"></a>This was a probing amendment and therefore I should withdraw it at this moment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Murton of Lindisfarne): </B>  Is it your Lordships' pleasure that the amendment be withdrawn?

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 15, line 34, at end insert (", and shall at the same time secure that a copy of the bill is transmitted to both Houses of Parliament").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para8"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: In speaking to this amendment, I wish briefly to speak to Amendment No. 233. The amendments provide, first, that when a member of the Scottish executive is on the point of introducing a Bill to the parliament and issues a statement of the nature we have already been discussing under Clause 30, he shall at the same time secure that a copy of the Bill is transmitted to both Houses of this Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para9"></a>Secondly, we propose as an amendment to Clause 31, under subsection (1), that in reaching his decision as to whether or not a Bill should be introduced to the parliament, the presiding officer would be entitled to take account of any representations he received from either House of this Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para10"></a>The suggestions incorporated in the two amendments are put forward in the interests of promoting good relations between the Scottish parliament on the one hand and this Parliament on the other. One hopes that it will be possible for the Scottish executive and the <P>


<a name="column_1359"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1359</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>United Kingdom Government to keep in good contact, whether at ministerial level or at official level through working parties of officials. The civil servants, after all, will be members of the same Home Civil Service and, whether or not concordats exist and cover the matters under discussion, it is to be anticipated that at official level there will be good consultation at the pre-legislative stage. One imagines that drafts of Bills, or certain parts of them, to be presented to the Scottish parliament will be widely circulated among members of the Scottish executive and that there will possibly be consultation upon them with officials and Ministers of the United Kingdom Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para11"></a>A different situation applies to parliamentary bodies. What happens in this Parliament will be of interest to members of the Scottish parliament and vice versa. The purpose of the first amendment is therefore to ensure that, as a matter of courtesy, just as in this Parliament numerous documents are presented every day, recorded in the Minutes of proceedings and are available for Members to consult if they are interested, the same procedure should apply to Bills of the Scottish parliament before the presiding officer decides whether they should be introduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para12"></a>Inevitably, from time to time, views may be expressed. It will be for this House and another place to decide how they will respond to Scottish legislation. They may not wish to comment in some instances, but there may be others where they may feel it would be of value for a committee to examine the legislation and communicate its views. That is not in the sense of seeking to interfere, but to inform the members of the Scottish parliament what views are held.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para13"></a>These amendments touch on an important innovation which arises in relation to the Scottish parliament; that is, that the presiding officer--namely, the speaker--will be in a position to refuse to introduce a Bill to the parliament. Indeed, the standing orders require that it should not be introduced if the presiding officer is of the view that the Bill or any provision of it would not be within the legislative competence of the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para14"></a>This is a novel power. It may be interesting for the Committee to hear from the Minister the reasoning that lies behind it. It gives rise to a number of interesting legal questions. If the presiding officer decides not to allow a Bill to be introduced, would anyone have the legal right to challenge that decision? If so, whom? Would it be competent to challenge that in a court? There is a reverse side to those questions. If it was anticipated that the presiding officer was going to introduce a Bill to the Scottish parliament, having formed the view that it would be within its legislative competence, would anyone have the right to challenge such a decision by going to the court and seeking at that stage a declarator from the court that, ex facie the print of the Bill, the Bill lay outwith the legislative competence of the parliament? If such an argument could be successfully advanced, would it be open to the court in Scotland to grant an interdict against the parliament considering the terms of the Bill or some amendment to it?

<A NAME = "80728-06_para15"></a>These are real, live questions which I hope the Committee, in the fullness of time, will be persuaded should not be allowed to arise. A later amendment will address the whole issue of giving the Scottish parliament the privilege which accords to this Parliament. But as we touch for the first time on the role of the presiding officer in these matters, it may be helpful for the Minister to indicate what is the Government's thinking on them. I beg to move.

<A NAME="80728-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   In the latter stages of his remarks, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, was straying on to the next group of amendments. However, I want to deal only with Amendments Nos. 231 and 233 and to indicate that I and my colleagues are strongly opposed to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para16"></a>In sum, the amendments seem to be saying that, when the Scottish parliament is established, it must hang on to nanny's hand and that nanny must be able to say, "Go and find out what little Johnny is doing and tell him to stop it". That appears to be the basic thinking behind the amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-06_para17"></a>The Scottish parliament must be free-standing. Once it comes into being, it should not expect to be second-guessed the whole time by the Westminster Parliament. To suggest that by an Act of this Parliament the Scottish parliament should be required to send any Bills to the headmaster's study before it can consider them, is entirely out of keeping with the spirit of the Bill. We are strongly opposed to the amendments.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80728-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gray of Contin: </B>   I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood. I do not believe that that is the purpose behind the amendment. I support my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Drumadoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para0"></a>We must remember that we are dealing with a completely new parliament which will operate in a completely different way. It will be a single chamber parliament; there will not be anyone at a second stage able to pull back anything that it does wrong. What it finally decides will be there for all time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para1"></a>Whatever those of us who spoke against the Bill on Second Reading may feel about the principle of a Scottish parliament, that stage has passed. We are all now united to try and produce legislation which will make a Scottish parliament as workable as possible. Anything that we can do to prevent a Scottish parliament from getting itself into trouble should be applauded.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para2"></a>I do not take the view that this amendment necessarily makes the Scottish parliament subservient to this Parliament in any definite way; it is a co-operative measure. None of us knows what the pre-legislative arrangements will be and they could vary from government to government. For example, we do not know whether every Scottish Bill, before it ever reaches the Scottish parliament, will be canvassed for comment among United Kingdom Ministries. At the present time, when a department has legislative proposals, other departments are given the opportunity of commenting upon them. Whether that will be the way in which the new Scottish parliament will work, nobody knows.
<P>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1361</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para3"></a>Therefore, the amendment would be, in a sense, a safeguard so that, before the Scottish parliament embarked upon something which might be quite radical and new, other departments would be aware of it. Let us not forget one of the points with which I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Steel, would heartily agree. The Scottish parliament is still going to be operating within the United Kingdom. It will not be an independent parliament and therefore, if it is within the United Kingdom, surely it is right that other departments within the United Kingdom should be allowed to comment upon it and that Members of both Chambers should be kept fully informed as to what it proposes. There will then be no danger of it doing anything that will put the Union at risk.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I support my noble friend Lord Gray of Contin and wish to add one or two points to this rather important discussion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para4"></a>It is essential that the arrangements that we make under the Bill for the proceedings of the new Scottish parliament should avoid delays and uncertainties. If subsection (2) remains and the parliament has to debate whether or not a decision of the presiding officer is to be accepted, such a debate could take up a vast amount of time, be extremely controversial and not help at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para5"></a>The presiding officer in the new parliament will be analogous to the Speaker of the House of Commons. Those of us who served in the House of Commons remember well that when the Speaker made rulings, the House accepted them. It is important that the presiding officer of the new Scottish parliament should be a person with a reputation for independence and one who has the ability to command authority. To have his or her rulings challenged in this way would cause uncertainty and delay and should be avoided.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   Perhaps I may quickly read Clause 31. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Standing orders shall, subject to subsection (2), ensure that a Bill is not introduced in the Parliament if the Presiding Officer decides that the Bill or any provision of the Bill would not be within the legislative competence of the Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para6"></a>Presumably the presiding officer has the benefit of advice from lawyers and would decide properly. The amendments propose extra nannying measures and there are plenty of those on the face of the Bill right now.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hamilton of Dalzell: </B>   The thought passes through my mind that part of the legislative process is the manifesto. What will happen when legislation comes forward as a result of a manifesto commitment and is not found to be within the competence of the parliament?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-07_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Advocate   (Lord Hardie): </B>  In relation to Amendments Nos. 231 and 233, it appears that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, and other Members of the Committee who spoke in support of him--particularly the noble Lord, Lord Gray of Contin--are trying to create an opportunity for the Westminster Parliament to become involved in the <P>


<a name="column_1362"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1362</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>legislative process of the Scottish parliament. They seek to impose a duty on responsible Scottish ministers to send to both Houses of the United Kingdom Parliament a copy of any Bill which is to be introduced into the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para7"></a>It is not clear how either House of Parliament would consider a draft Bill before it was even introduced into the Scottish parliament. The second amendment gives the United Kingdom Parliament the chance to make representations to the presiding officer about the legislative competence of the Scottish parliament's proceedings on a particular piece of legislation, with a view to persuading the presiding officer not to introduce the Bill. The second amendment puts in the words, after "decides":
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"either at his own hand"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para8"></a>so the presiding officer can make up his own mind--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or following representations from either House of Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para9"></a>I agree wholeheartedly with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon. It is essential that there should be good relations between the Scottish parliament and the Westminster Parliament at official, ministerial and executive levels, and, one hopes, at member level. As the noble and learned Lord pointed out, the civil servants who will service the Scottish executive and the Scottish parliament are part of the United Kingdom Civil Service. It is inconceivable that there will not be good relations at official level between the civil servants of Scotland and the civil servants serving the United Kingdom Parliament. It is envisaged that there will be an interchange; and that civil servants will move between one jurisdiction and the other to maintain co-operation and understanding between them. I am confident that at their level Ministers will keep each other advised of what is happening and what they are proposing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para10"></a>I have no doubt that there will be informal arrangements to allow Bills to be considered. Equally, if the Scottish parliament wished to provide copies of its Bills to the United Kingdom Parliament on a formal basis that would undoubtedly be within its competence and would happen. I anticipate, whatever the politicians may decide, that civil servants will make Bills available to their counterparts on an informal basis, as they are drafted, and explain what is happening north of the Border so that civil servants south of the Border can consider what is being proposed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Torphichen: </B>   If a civil servant gives away the contents of a Bill a little too soon, that is a leak. There is a fine line between keeping people informed and going through the normal channels of providing information. It is a very difficult area.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I do not accept that it is a difficult area. If we have got to the stage of a Bill having been prepared with a view to its being introduced, there is no question of it being seen as a leak to provide a copy of the Bill to civil servants in London for their consideration and any input that they wish to make from their own departments.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para11"></a>From my comments so far the Committee will not be surprised to hear that we do not accept these amendments. We share the views of the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood. We are apprehensive that by allowing these amendments there would be accusations, albeit unjustified, that the United Kingdom Parliament was trying to interfere in the internal workings of the Scottish parliament. As the noble Lord, Lord Renton, said, the position of the presiding officer or Speaker is a special one. All parliaments are sensitive about the independence of their Speaker or presiding officer, whatever you wish to call him or her. The Scottish parliament will be no different. It will be jealous about the independence and the position of its presiding officer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para12"></a>These amendments could well be presented as giving an opportunity to the United Kingdom Parliament to exercise undue influence over the presiding officer. I am sure that that is not the intention of the noble and learned Lord but that may well be how it is viewed by others. We must allow the Scottish parliament to enact its legislation without interference by the United Kingdom Parliament. It would not be appropriate for Westminster to have a role in formally commenting on the vires of a Bill before it is introduced or considered by the Scottish parliament. It will be for the Scottish parliament to give careful scrutiny to any Bill. Members of this House and another place should not attempt to prejudge the outcome of the deliberations of the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para13"></a>The Bill already provides a scheme for the resolution of disputes about the competence of Scottish legislation. Once the Bill has been passed by the parliament the Lord Advocate and Law Officers of the United Kingdom Government can refer questions about the competence of an Act to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para14"></a>The noble and learned Lord raised the question of who will challenge a decision of the presiding officer. That is provided for in subsection (2) of Clause 31. It states specifically:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Standing orders may provide for the Parliament to overrule any decision of the Presiding Officer". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para15"></a>So the parliament can challenge the decisions of the presiding officer. We will come to that in the next set of amendments. That is one way of challenging such a decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para16"></a>As to judicial review, I find it difficult to envisage who would have a title to challenge the presiding officer. In any event, as I indicated to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, on a previous occasion, the whole question will be considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para17"></a>If the Law Officers take the matter to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council the Bill cannot be submitted for Royal Assent. Even if it gets through that and becomes law there is another provision. Clause 91 and Schedule 6 enable the Law Officers of the United Kingdom and of the Scottish executive to challenge an Act of the Scottish parliament as being outwith its competence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-07_para18"></a>I hope we all agree that after devolution it will be important for the parliaments to keep in touch with each other. Legislative provisions which could be presented <P>

<P>
<A NAME="80728-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Can the noble and learned Lord answer one question that concerns me? He said that during the drafting of a Bill civil servants of the Scottish parliament might well be discussing points which related to the drafting of the Bill with other civil servants in the United Kingdom. The Bill says somewhere that civil servants in the Scottish Office are part of the United Kingdom Civil Service. Would it be possible for the members of the Scottish executive or the presiding officer to instruct Scottish Office civil servants not to consult United Kingdom department civil servants?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   The simple answer to that question is yes. It would be possible for the executive to give instructions to civil servants not to provide information. However, I hope that we will not reach that stage in our relations between the two parliaments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   I am grateful to the Lord Advocate for a number of the points that he has made, but I am a little puzzled by the basic approach that has been taken to competence in relation to this Parliament. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, appreciates that none of us who is concerned about this has the least intention of trying to introduce a further stage for Scottish legislation which would necessarily bring some part of that legislative process to Westminster. At the very most, we want to ensure--this seems eminently sensible if there is even the risk of challenge as to competence--that those who are engaged in these matters at Westminster should have such legislation drawn to their attention.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para0"></a>As the noble and learned Lord will appreciate from Clause 32, the Advocate General--I understand that he will be a Member of this Parliament, in this House or in another place--would have the responsibility to challenge in certain circumstances. The Bill provides for that at a later stage. However, it seems to me to be appropriate that at the earliest possible stage, if a Law Officer of this Parliament is to mount a challenge--be that the Advocate General or the Attorney-General--he should be aware of that and be able to make his argument about the Bill's incompetence at an early stage rather than having to wait for the whole Bill to proceed through all its stages in that parliament. That seems to me to be a fairly simple and fundamental way to approach this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para1"></a>The most interesting thing that the noble and learned Lord said was that he could not imagine anyone having a title to raise legal proceedings by way of judicial review in respect of the legislative competence of this Parliament. I agree with him that it might be difficult to imagine that, but I would like to be reassured as to whether he is offering the view that nobody, in any circumstances, is entitled to raise issues of legislative competence before the courts other than the Law Officers to whom the legislation refers.
<P>


<a name="column_1365"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para2"></a>What troubles me about the clause is that, first, it is for the presiding officer to reach a view as to whether something is within the parliament's legislative competence. He offers a view; he may or may not be right. We must assume that in certain circumstances he may be wrong. Clause 31(2) then states that the standing orders provide for the parliament itself to override that decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para3"></a>Perhaps I may outline the circumstance that troubles me. Let us assume that I am a member of that parliament. I am in the minority. I have failed to get the majority in the parliament to overrule a decision of the presiding officer, but it is still my view that the Bill is beyond the legislative competence of the parliament. At that point, would it be open to me to take the matter to the courts and to have the issue tested at that stage? If I have missed something and the answer is no, and if at that point there is no opportunity for an individual or a group of persons who might be affected to raise the issue, it would be extremely helpful to have that spelled out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para4"></a>If I have a concern about the totality of the provisions it is that I fear that there is a set of ambiguities that do not reveal--certainly, they do not reveal to me--exactly what the position would be. That seems to me to be a much more important issue to address rather than the essentially ancillary points about how such issues are brought to the attention of Members of the Westminster Parliament, members of the Scottish parliament or, indeed, informed citizens in Scotland or elsewhere. Until I have a clearer understanding of that, I believe that we face the risk of paddling around in confusion and failing to make much progress.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Torphichen: </B>   Perhaps I may answer that point so far as I can. The Government have set their system fairly firmly in favour of review after a possible non-conforming Act has passed through the Scottish parliament. I am sure that it would be much easier to rule out an offending clause or to modify the intention slightly at an early stage rather than wait until that Bill has passed through the Scottish parliament when such phrases as, "It is now the settled will of the Scottish people", will be bandied around.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para5"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, said that this is making another "nannying" rule for the Scottish parliament. The whole of this Bill is a set of rules, established by this Parliament, relating to the future parliament in Scotland. One more or one less rule does not make for nannying. The whole Bill is a nannying process. Given that sooner or later somebody will wish to test the limits of what can or cannot be done, I believe that this is the point at which we can choose between not being independent or going for full independence--and the Scottish National Party will make use of this provision over the years until independence is brought about.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   We have had an interesting debate on a topic which I fully confess has strayed slightly further than the scope of my two amendments. Perhaps I may deal first with the reply <P>


<a name="column_1366"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1366</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which the Lord Advocate gave on the issue of who might have the right to challenge a decision by the presiding officer on whether to introduce a Bill, the premise for such a challenge being that the individual concerned took a different view of the legislative competence of that Bill from that taken by the presiding officer. It may, indeed, be difficult to identify somebody who has a title and interest to challenge, but one of the grounds upon which an Act of the Scottish parliament can be challenged is that convention rights were infringed by either the provisions of one part of that Act or by the whole Act. If legal challenge is competent at that stage, I believe that it is not impossible to envisage somebody qualifying a title and an interest. Therefore, there may be force in making it clear on the face of the Bill either at this stage or later whether legal challenge should be open to anybody.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para6"></a>Perhaps I may make my own position on that quite clear: I do not think that it would be prudent for such a legal challenge to be open. It should be a matter between the presiding officer on the one hand and the parliament on the other hand--that is, if subsection (2) is to remain part of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para7"></a>On the more general issue, the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate was kind enough to acknowledge that it was no part of my argument to try to suggest that this Parliament had some form of supervisory or nannying role over the activities of the Scottish parliament. However, the Scottish parliament will have to learn that a variety of people will be interested in its affairs, in the Bills that it is considering and in the Acts of Parliament that it is passing. Those persons will include not only individual Members of your Lordships' House and individual Members of another place, but quite possibly also the Houses of this Parliament themselves. Therefore, it is not impossible that in the fullness of time, whether as a consequence of a debate in this House or the deliberations of a committee, a decision will be taken to convey to the Scottish parliament the views of, say, your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para8"></a>Only a few days ago we debated whether to present an humble Address to Her Majesty on a matter which was causing considerable concern to a number of Lordships. If views come from here, one likes to hope that the Scottish parliament will not behave as if it is a child being talked to, or talked at, by a nanny. When tabling these amendments, I did not for one moment think that that would be appropriate. I thought it appropriate to set up some form for communication between the two parliaments on the Bills that they will be considering.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para9"></a>We have had a useful debate. I do not intend to press any of these amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   At this stage perhaps I should deal with some of the points raised in the debate. I am advised that there will be concordats, about which we have heard already, to ensure that prospective legislation in both Scotland and Westminster is drawn to the attention of the other side. That will enable points on vires to be raised early, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, was anxious to secure.

<P>

<A NAME = "80728-08_para10"></a>As to title and interest, I apologise if I have not been clear. I was referring to title and interest to challenge the decision of the presiding officer, not to the whole question of the competence of the parliament. There is provision in the Bill for the Law Officers to challenge the title and interest at pre-Assent stage, and in any proceedings other people can challenge the competence of a Scottish Bill. The various Law Officers can intervene at that stage.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980728/text/80728-09.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   I readily acknowledge that the draftsman of the Bill has put together an extremely elaborate and sophisticated set of arrangements for various Law Officers to intervene if the parliament acts beyond its legislative competence. That ties in elegantly with a number of provisions to be found in the Government of Wales Bill. All of that seems to be well settled. But what concerns me is that the whole issue of legislative competence has been approached too singularly from the point of view of the Scottish government, the Westminster Government and the Law Officers. What remains unclear to me is what would happen if an individual regards his human rights as being breached by proposed legislation. Does he have the right to go to the courts in Scotland at that stage and attempt, perhaps by way of interdict, to prevent the legislation proceeding? That is an absolutely fundamental question to which we must have an answer.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   The noble and learned Lord may recall that in answer to a point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, at an earlier stage of the proceedings in relation to interdict I said that the Government were considering the matter and would come back with either a statement or something else.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   I am very grateful to the noble and learned Lord. We should like to see that. If it is of any help to the Government, both I and my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay believe it is desirable, if a solution is suggested, perhaps to prevent individuals at that early stage from interrupting the legislative process, without obviously excluding their right at a later stage to come before the courts and challenge what is proposed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   When consideration is given to this matter I presume that it will include the terms of Clause 6 of the Human Rights Bill which is now being considered by another place. Clause 6(1) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way that is incompatible with a convention right. I presume that the Scottish parliament and the Scottish executive are public authorities for the purposes of Clause 6(1) of that Bill. I join with others in believing that in that situation it is necessary to consider very carefully the position at the interim stage and whether or not there is a remedy open to an individual, who would be a victim within the human rights legislation, if he could put himself into that position, or whatever other case might be appropriate, to challenge the legislation at that stage--in other words, while the legislation is going through the House--on the basis that it was incompatible with human rights and <P>


<a name="column_1368"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1368</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>therefore was unlawful. It may be that in due course we shall see some alignment of the Scotland Bill with the Human Rights Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para0"></a>We have been promised this from time to time but it has not yet come to pass. It will be interesting at that stage to see exactly how much scope there is for such a challenge to be made. Obviously, this is a matter of great importance from the point of view of the courts and the parliament and all those involved in the workings of it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I am quite sure that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate will wish to deal with this matter in writing. I do not put any further questions at this stage. I am sure he readily accepts that there is a genuine concern as to what role, if any, the courts will play at this stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para1"></a>I should like to seek clarification on one matter. In his most recent intervention the noble and learned Lord spoke about concordats on either side. I am not sure whether it is proposed that there should be any concordats involving either this House or both Houses of Parliament and/or the Scottish parliament itself. As I understand it, the concordats are to be between Government Ministers and departments on the one side and the executive on the other. If so, it may well be that concordats would not formally cover the transmission of Bills or proceedings of this Parliament. That is a matter that may be reflected upon before we debate concordats in a day or two. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para2"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<A NAME = "80728-09_para3"></a>[Amendment No. 232 not moved.]

<A NAME="80728-09_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie </B>   moved Amendment No. 233A: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 15, line 42, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para7"></a>The noble Earl said: Amendment No. 233A has the purpose of removing subsection (2) of Clause 31 and in so doing averting the humiliation and resignation of the presiding officer. The Bill allows the Scottish parliament to overrule the presiding officer on a matter of legislative competence concerning a Bill that is about to be introduced. We have had a good deal of discussion about this. I do not see why the power to overrule the presiding officer should be in the Bill at all. In a fixed term parliament the presiding officer has a different and greater statutory role than has evolved in this undocumented Westminster Parliament. I do not see how the presiding officer acting on professional advice and support can be overruled by the parliament and continue in office. A vote based on Clause 31(2) will be a vote of no confidence in the presiding officer. The mere calling of such a vote will weaken his authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para8"></a>There is a further concern about the significance of such an overruling of the presiding officer in the event of later judicial proceedings. A court is likely to be asked to decide upon the significance of such a ruling. <P>


<a name="column_1369"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1369</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Any measure that has attracted Clause 31(2) action will be seen as a highly marginal issue in terms of its vires. I believe that this measure is outwith the bounds of a fixed term parliament which is itself a creature of statute. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I warmly support this amendment. When discussing Amendment No. 231 I referred to the important part played by the presiding officer. I was very much fortified by the confirmation provided by the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate that the position of the presiding officer would be analogous to that of the Speaker of another place. I believe that it would be chaotic if the decision of the presiding officer then had to be debated in the parliament. It would perhaps be a very long debate with an uncertain result. That would seriously diminish the authority of the presiding officer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para9"></a>I hope that the Committee will agree on the need to leave out subsection (2). But with this amendment we are also discussing Amendment No. 234 in the names of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Drumadoon and my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. According to that amendment,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A decision made by the Presiding Officer under subsection (1) shall not be capable of being overruled by the Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para10"></a>It is arguable that from a drafting point of view that is unnecessary, but I believe it would be desirable to have it in for the removal of doubt. I have great faith in the Lord Advocate, but I hope he will keep an open mind on this matter. I am very worried about it and, as I mentioned when discussing the earlier amendment, we must try to avoid uncertainty in the provisions we put forward for establishing this new parliament. We must avoid uncertainty and delay. I believe that subsection (2) of Clause 31 is asking for trouble.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-09_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   I support my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie in his amendment and I very much agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Renton, has just said. The presiding officer--a horrible name, to which we will come later--in the Scottish parliament will have, if I may say so with respect to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, an even more authoritative position than the Speaker of the House of Commons, because this is a whole area with which the Speaker of the House of Commons does not deal. It is important that we get it right.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para11"></a>As a layman, I must confess that I was a little disturbed by the tone of the previous discussion among so many distinguished noble and learned Lords who seemed to be imagining a process, which I find very difficult to contemplate, where legislation in embryo could be challenged in the courts. I am not aware that such a procedure has ever existed. It is highly undesirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para12"></a>Clearly, responsibility should lie with the presiding officer to declare whether something is or is not ultra vires. He will not do that off the top of his head. Presumably, he will take into account all the representations he has received; from his expert advisers within the parliament; from the Civil Service; and, no doubt, from Her Majesty's Government at Westminster. <P>


<a name="column_1370"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1370</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Anyone who cares to give advice can register it. He has that responsibility independent of the executive. That is the important thing. Parliament must trust him. One cannot have a situation where the parliament says, "We have decided to overturn your judgment today, but expect you to remain in office tomorrow". It seems to me that is an inconceivable position.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para13"></a>Moreover, I should like to ask a question of the Government Front Bench. In Clause 31(1) there are these words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if the Presiding Officer decides that the Bill or any provision of the Bill would not be within the legislative competence of the Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-09_para14"></a>I assume from this that the presiding officer would have the job also of declaring whether any amendment that might come forward to a Bill was ultra vires. Furthermore, I wonder whether, in the process of going through the proceedings of the parliament, something might not happen to render the Bill ultra vires. Going back to the previous discussion, does that mean that someone could make a legal challenge at that stage? It seems to me an impossible position. Greater clarity is required here. I believe that we can at least make a start by removing subsection (2) of the clause.<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980728/text/80728-10.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   The noble Lord said that he found the previous discussion somewhat unedifying or alarming. Indeed so, and that is precisely why we have spent so much time seeking to have the matter clarified. In my view, the noble Earl is absolutely right in bringing forward this matter. I believe that the situation could become even more absurd. It may be that the presiding officer--whose title we shall certainly change before we get to the end of this Bill--will reach a view that what has been proposed is not within the legislative incompetence of the parliament. If he has reached such a view it would seem to me to be almost a matter of inevitability that the Lord Advocate would have reached the same view about the legislative incompetence of the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-10_para0"></a>It seems to me to set a new parliament off on a course that is really quite absurd if, as it begins to debate something, the presiding officer says,  "I believe this to be legislatively incompetent" but the Lord Advocate has said, "You can carry on with this, but once it is all over I am going to challenge it." If we want to have a sensible, effective legislative process, it seems to me that the proposal to delete subsection (2) is eminently sensible. I would certainly also suggest that the proposal of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay for a new amendment to put the matter beyond doubt is equally desirable.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Selkirk of Douglas: </B>   Members of the Committee who have just spoken have put forward extremely powerful arguments which the Government ignore at their peril. It is necessary for the Lord Advocate to state what precedents there are for Speakers or presiding officers--not just in this country but throughout the world--having powers to decide over issues of legislative competence. I do not believe that Speakers generally have those powers. In the House of <P>


<a name="column_1371"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1371</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Commons the Speaker has the power to specify a money Bill, but certainly does not have power in areas of legislative competence. I believe that Clause 31(2) is exceedingly unfortunate because it would diminish the standing of the presiding officer. It would make the position of the presiding officer infinitely more vulnerable than the position of the Speaker of the House of Commons and it could very readily bring the presiding officer into direct conflict with both the executive and the parliament. I do not believe that should be the role of the presiding officer. I hope that it will be the role of the Lord Advocate to specify the legislative competence of Bills.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-10_para1"></a>Surely it should be inconceivable for any Bill to be brought forward by any regime or government in Scotland if it is not within legal competence. I do not imagine for a single moment that most presiding officers in Scotland will have the legislative ability of the present Lord Advocate or, indeed, of virtually any Lord Advocate; at least, it would be extremely unusual if that were to be the situation. It is exceedingly likely that the presiding officer would, in reality, follow the advice given by the Lord Advocate because he or she would almost certainly lack the same qualifications; and, of course, if the Lord Advocate were to be wrong, then it would be for the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to sort that out.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-10_para2"></a>The possibility of overruling the presiding officer could not arise in the same way in the House of Commons. This provision puts the presiding officer in a desperately vulnerable position. The presiding officer should not be in such a weak position. He or she should not be brought into conflict with the executive and should not be brought into conflict with the parliament. It is a basic instability in the Bill and it is one which I believe cannot endure.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   Perhaps I may briefly say that the House of Commons or the Westminster Parliament is not a good model for considering this question because there are no limits on its competence that it ever admits. Therefore, the question does not arise for the Westminster Parliament or for the Speaker. However, where there are written constitutions, especially where there is a federation, although we are not here discussing a federation, battles like this frequently have to be settled. This is not an unknown thing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-10_para3"></a>I would modestly suggest that we should not confuse the role of the Lord Advocate with that of the presiding officer. These are two different branches of government. I believe that it is quite likely--and why not?--that they would disagree. In that case the matter would be settled by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This will be an interesting experiment. This is not Westminster politics; these are different politics; and why not?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   Where the presiding officer's view has been overridden, is he or she nonetheless under a duty to submit the Bill for Royal Assent? Subsection (3) is a curious provision. It simply says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Standing Orders shall ensure that the Presiding Officer". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1372"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1372</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-10_para4"></a>It sounds as though it might be goodness knows who, if it were not provided that it were the presiding officer who submits the Bill for Royal Assent. Is that saying also that he is under a duty to present the Bill for Royal Assent? Does that duty apply--this is really where the question comes up--even if he remains of the view that it would be outwith the power of the parliament to pass the Bill--for example, that it would be unlawful in terms of the human rights legislation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   Perhaps I may briefly mention the amendment which is grouped with Amendment No. 233A and indicate my support for virtually everything that has been said. Perhaps I should make it clear to the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, if my noble and learned friend Lord Fraser of Carmyllie has not already done so, that, as lawyers, we believe this is highly undesirable. We may be raising all kinds of issues but we think it is undesirable that the courts should be involved at this stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-10_para5"></a>It is important to bear in mind that however the new parliament goes about its business--I am not in any way seeking to be cynical--if the consensus approach does work on the ground at Holyrood, when issues come before the court I would be very surprised indeed if consensus comes with it. The party acting for individual parties will seek to have the legislation struck down or construed in a way that benefits the interests of their clients. The matter will be raised at this and subsequent stages in the hope that it will assist the Committee to address the fundamental issue: the extent to which the courts should have a greater role in the affairs of Holyrood than they are permitted to have in your Lordships' House and another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-10_para6"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Fraser referred to the Lord Advocate having the same view as the presiding officer. We have to accept that the current drafting of Clause 31 admits the possibility of different views. One cannot imagine a member of the Scottish executive making the statement referred to in the previous subsection unless the Lord Advocate, if called upon to do so in the parliament, were prepared to defend it. Therefore there is a possibility of the presiding officer reaching a different view on a question of law--no doubt with the benefit of legal advice--from that reached by the Scottish executive and the Law Officers when framing the legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-10_para7"></a>In that event two courses seem open. First, the individual member promoting the Bill should consider whether a drafting amendment on his own initiative before the Bill is introduced might take account of the presiding officer's concerns. The second alternative would apply unless subsection (2) is left out: that members of the parliament, many of whom would not have access to legal advice, would be asked to vote on essentially a question of law against the view of the presiding officer backed by his own lawyers. The latter alternative would be highly undesirable and, as the noble Earl said, would tend to diminish the standing of the presiding officer. Therefore I hope that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate or the Minister who is to reply will address the various concerns raised.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   First, I agree entirely with the last comment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon. It is conceivable that the Lord Advocate may take a different view from that of the presiding officer. Although I would anticipate that the presiding officer would take legal advice from his equivalent to the Speaker's counsel and would not act capriciously, it is possible that there could be a difference of opinion. Secondly, the presiding officer will consider all Bills that are being introduced into the parliament and not just government Bills. One may have a Back Bencher's Bill on which the presiding officer will take a view.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-10_para8"></a>A noble Lord asked about the thinking behind this unusual power given to the presiding officer. It is not a power enjoyed by the Speaker in another place although the Speaker has certain powers in relation to a money Bill. But so far as I am aware, the Speaker in another place could not prevent a Bill being introduced into the House. The thinking underlying Clause 31 is to provide a first check so that if the presiding officer takes the view that something is ultra vires, he can say so. If that is accepted, it is an end of the matter. Again, one would hope that in the majority of, if not all, cases, it would be acceptable. However, one has to anticipate that the presiding officer may on a rare occasion get it wrong; and if he or she gets it wrong what happens? If no remedy is afforded to the parliament to overrule that decision, the presiding officer is acting effectively as the adjudicator and is almost usurping the ultimate function of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the body given the task of adjudicating upon legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-10_para9"></a>If the presiding officer gets it wrong and subsection (2) is omitted, what alternative remedy is available to the parliament? I do not anticipate that any executive would act without the advice of its law officers. If the parliament, on advice, believes that the presiding officer has got it wrong, what is to be the remedy? If subsection (2) is deleted, there is no remedy.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80728-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hope of Craighead: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. A series of rhetorical questions have been asked. But it occurs to me that one should not entirely disregard the fact that the parliament is made up of individual members. One of the problems that may well arise is that a private member has an interest in a Bill which is then declared by the presiding officer to be outwith the legislative competence. If I were asked what his remedy is, my advice would be to seek a judicial review in the court of the presiding officer's decision. That takes us back precisely to the argument we discussed previously. The two provisions are very much interrelated on that aspect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-11_para0"></a>We should not ignore the fact that the individual private member may want to take those remedies in order to make progress on a Bill about which he feels strongly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   Before the noble and learned Lord resumes, we need to consider this issue the other way round. It is not just that the presiding officer may <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>be wrong. As the clause is drafted, the presiding officer may be right but under subsection (2) none the less the parliament has the right to set his opinion aside. That seems to me exceedingly dangerous. If I am right, amendment must be required.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   Perhaps I may deal with the noble Lord's point. Just as the presiding officer may be wrong on occasions, the executive or the parliament may be wrong in challenging his decision. The noble Lord is correct; the parliament could overrule that decision. However, if that were to happen, the protection is the entitlement of the Lord Advocate or the Attorney-General to challenge the legislative competence of the Bill and to make a reference prior to the Bill obtaining Royal Assent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-11_para1"></a>If the executive, having been involved in a decision of the majority of the parliament, overrules the presiding officer it is inconceivable that the Lord Advocate would be involved in that challenge. One imagines that the Lord Advocate would have advised the executive. But it is conceivable that the executive might be in a minority in deciding to overrule the decision of the presiding officer. If that were the case, the Lord Advocate undoubtedly would challenge the competence of the Bill at the appropriate stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-11_para2"></a>However, if the executive were in the majority, it is inconceivable that the United Kingdom Law Officers would be unaware of that exercise and the Lord Advocate or the Attorney-General would take action in accordance with Clause 31(4). Therefore the fear that legislation which had overridden the correct view of the presiding officer would be passed without proper scrutiny is unjustified.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-11_para3"></a>I should like to turn to the question relating to the effect on the standing of the Speaker. The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, stated that the presiding officer would be brought into conflict with the parliament or the Scottish executive. I do not necessarily share that view. The provision simply enables the parliament to allow a Bill to proceed in the knowledge that once it has passed through the various legislative stages, if there is any uncertainty about vires, the Bill can be referred to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Therefore the parliament and the executive would be in no doubt that there could be a reference if the presiding officer took a considered view that it was ultra vires.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-11_para4"></a>I feel that the presiding officer would command the respect of the parliament and his decision on legislative competence would usually be upheld and respected. However, as I previously indicated, it is important to make provision for the exception.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Will the noble and learned Lord give way? I regret to say that the noble and learned Lord is not right. Subsection (2) is perfectly plain in its statement that parliament may overrule any decision of the presiding officer. In practice parliament may agree <P>


<a name="column_1375"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1375</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on most occasions but if it decides to overrule it may only do so after a vote, and it would be very unusual for a vote to be taken without a debate having taken place. For the presiding officer to be the subject of a debate in the Chamber, frankly, to divert attention away from that situation to the possibility of the matter ultimately being referred to the Judicial Committee avoids the difficulty that is certain to arise.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   Will the noble and learned Lord allow me to reply? The Bill allows the executive or one of the Law Officers to take the Bill to the Judicial Committee before it goes for Royal Assent on the grounds that it is ultra vires. That is a sensible provision. However, to refer the matter to the courts before then, even allowing for the suggestion made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, to challenge the decision of the presiding officer in the courts is highly undesirable, just as the reference in the Bill is undesirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-11_para5"></a>The ultimate remedy of the Scottish parliament if the presiding officer mucks about and gets it totally wrong is to do what is done in another place; namely, to table a substantive motion of no confidence in the Speaker. That provision is very familiar. It is a remedy that can only be used once, but it does exist.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   With respect to the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, that would be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Suppose that the presiding officer genuinely made a mistake. Would it be appropriate for the parliament to table a vote of no confidence and to have the presiding officer removed? It would be less severe for parliament to consider the matter and overrule the presiding officer in that situation. The protection the public has is that if parliament is wrong and the Speaker is right, then the ultimate adjudicator is the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-11_para6"></a>If the provision is not allowed to enable the presiding officer's decision to be reviewed, then, subject to the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, the effect is that the ultimate arbiter of the competence of proposed legislation is the presiding officer rather than the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. That is only subject to whether the executive or an aggrieved member has the right of judicial review of the decision of the presiding officer. As I indicated, this matter is being considered in detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-11_para7"></a>The question of the executive judicially reviewing the presiding officer would undermine the presiding officer more than if parliament considered whether or not the presiding officer had got it right. To drag the presiding officer through the courts would be quite inappropriate. The noble Lord, Lord Steel, is nodding in agreement that it would be quite inappropriate. If that remedy were not available to the executive or to an aggrieved member, what would be the remedy where the presiding officer got it wrong and effectively prevented legislation from being considered?

<P>
<A NAME="80728-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord for giving way. The answer is that we are living in the real world of politics as well as law. If the presiding officer got it wrong on a Private Member's Bill it is open to that private Member to reintroduce the Bill in the next Session, having made a great row in public and in the press, through agitation, to amend two lines in it. The presiding officer would then get it right. We have to live in a practical world as well as a legal world.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   The noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate is far too reasonable a man. He advanced his argument carefully on the basis that if anyone enters into a dispute about the limits of the legislative competence of this parliament, they do so in good faith. It is not impossible to envisage circumstances where the majority in the Scottish parliament when it is first established do not accept the limits placed on the legislative competence of the parliament and may take every opportunity to test it further. Having looked at the framework, they may appreciate that it would be a legally futile gesture to make because, sooner or later, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council would knock it out. However, it is not difficult to envisage 18 months of political turmoil. A majority group, having overridden a presiding officer who had looked at the law, taken the best advice and reached a view, and a Lord Advocate, who had looked at the law and offered a view, could nevertheless spend a considerable time trying to establish that what fell within the legislative competence of the parliament was inadequate. It might wish to take the opportunity to spell that out. That seems to me to be the real role of politics which the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, referred to. For those reasons we wish to have as precise and clear a set of arrangements as possible, allowing the least possible opportunity for mischief.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   Since the presiding officer will enjoy a very difficult and lonely role, will the Government consider giving him the kind of right that the Advocate General, the Lord Advocate and the Attorney-General are given in Clause 32(1) to refer the matter to the Judicial Committee? That might provide him with a back-up. I fully accept that 99 times out of 100 the Advocate General will take the point but it might bolster his standing when he is given the role of taking decisions on the competency of legislation if he too could refer the matter to the Privy Council at an appropriate stage.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-11_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   Committees of this House do not normally take so long to discuss amendments that I put forward. The truth will always out! I have received a considerable amount of support for the amendment. I still believe that Clause 31(2) is unsustainable as regards the position of the presiding officer; that is, unless the provision is one of those quaint devices whereby one calls for a resignation or it is a means of introducing a vote of no confidence in the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>presiding officer. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate has told us that that might well be a routine procedure and not a major and last-resort means of getting rid of an errant presiding officer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-11_para8"></a>I agree with my noble friend Lord Steel of Aikwood, about the opportunity to reintroduce a Bill believed to be ultra vires after some discussion with the presiding officer and his advisers. I believe that we should pursue the amendment and therefore I wish to test the opinion of the Committee.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon </B>   moved Amendment No. 235: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 16, line 5, leave out (", the Lord Advocate or the Attorney General") and insert ("or the Lord Advocate").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para1"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: In speaking to this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 238 and 239. In the light of observations which have been made, I do not intend to speak to Amendments Nos. 240 and 241.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para2"></a>These three amendments deal with the provisions of Clause 31(4) and Clause 32. They raise a number of issues relating to the making of a reference to the judicial committee on the question of whether a Bill, or any particular provisions of a Bill, would be within the legislative competence of the parliament. It can be seen from Clause 32(1) that that power is proposed to be given to the Advocate General, who will be a member of the United Kingdom Government, the Lord Advocate, who will be a member of the Scottish executive and the Attorney-General who will also be a Member of the United Kingdom Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para3"></a>The first question which this amendment addresses is why the reference should be initiated by a Law Officer as opposed to the Secretary of State in relation to the United Kingdom Government or the first minister in relation to the Scottish executive. Clearly, the issue which the judicial committee will require to address will be a question of law. However, the decision as to whether or not to seek such a reference may well have a political element to it. In those circumstances, it is inconceivable that either a Law Officer of the United Kingdom Government or the Lord Advocate, as the Law Officer of the Scottish executive, would initiate such a reference unless he did so on behalf of and with the full consent of the executive members of the executive body of which he was a member.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para4"></a>The second question is why both the Advocate General and the Attorney-General should be given such a right. They will both be members of the same government; namely, the United Kingdom Government. I would like to think that it is inconceivable that one would seek to initiate such a reference if the other was not content that that should happen, and vice versa. That <P>


<a name="column_1380"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1380</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is why one of the amendments seeks to delete the Attorney-General from any involvement at that pre-legislative stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para5"></a>It is extremely important to bear in mind that such a reference can be made only prior to the Bill becoming an Act of parliament. The suggestion that the Attorney-General, who has responsibilities for England and Wales and, to a limited extent, for Northern Ireland, should have a role to play in initiating such a reference seems somewhat bizarre.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para6"></a>Thirdly, it raises the question as to whether or not the Bill should make it clear whether, in initiating those references, the Lord Advocate, if it be he who initiates a reference, or the Advocate General, if it is he, is acting in the public interest or on behalf of the executive body of which he is a member.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para7"></a>It seems to me to be difficult for the Advocate General and the Lord Advocate both to be acting in the public interest if appearing on different sides of a case. It is not impossible but it is certainly difficult. In all probability, they will be on different sides and they will be arguing the issue of law as to whether or not it falls within the legislative competence of the parliament. That should be done in the name of a Minister rather than a Law Officer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para8"></a>I raised this matter on the Second Reading and in response the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the exercise of that function the Lord Advocate is acting as a Law Officer, and Law Officers do not act other than in an independent fashion at present. They act independently of the Government. They give independent advice. If they think at any stage that a Minister is about to transgress the proper boundaries of activity, it is the function of the Law Officer to pull back the Minister and to advise him or her accordingly. For the Lord Advocate to have the power to intervene and to refer a Bill independently of the executive is consistent with the actions of the Law Officer".--[Official Report, 18/6/98; col. 1782.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para9"></a>Therefore, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate was explaining that provision on Second Reading, he was clearly of the view that that power was to be exercised in the public interest but, as I say, the difficulty that I have is that the Advocate General may be on the other side.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para10"></a>At a recent seminar which I attended, a speech was made on this issue. Views were expressed to a contrary effect. In particular, it was suggested that realistically, there is bound to be a political element in any decision to refer a question to the judicial committee, particularly in the early stages of devolution. Therefore, it will be important to ensure that there is agreement within the United Kingdom Government that such a challenge should be mounted. The speaker therefore envisaged that the Advocate General, in exercising that power, would act only with the agreement of his ministerial colleagues.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para11"></a>Such references are bound to attract a measure of controversy, referring back to what my noble and learned friend Lord Fraser of Carmyllie said a few moments ago. It is not unrealistic to expect that some members of the Scottish parliament may well seek to test, on a fairly regular basis, the limits of the legislative competence. Let us suppose that a Bill gets half way <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>through its parliamentary passage and then either the Advocate General, as a member of the British Government, or the Lord Advocate, acting as a Scottish Law Officer, seeks to stop the Bill in its tracks by initiating a reference to the judicial committee and it is argued that the Bill does not fall within that legislative competence, it is not difficult to envisage the political fall-out which that may generate. In those circumstances, I propose Amendments Nos. 235, 238 and 239. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I find it very difficult to understand what the division of function is to be, not only in relation to Clauses 31 and 32 but also in the general administration of the law and the advising of parliament in Scotland in the years to come. We have great respect for the present Lord Advocate as we have had, if I may say so, for his predecessors in this House in recent years. Indeed, there was even a former Attorney-General present in the Chamber a short while ago, but that is no longer the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para12"></a>The Attorney-General normally has jurisdiction only in England and Wales. However, we now have a new person of legal eminence--namely, the Advocate General--as proposed in the Bill. I have looked carefully through the "Notes on Clauses" as well as trying to study the Bill itself, but I am at a loss to understand how the Advocate General is to be appointed and exactly what his functions will be. As a background to these two clauses, it would be most helpful if we could be told what is to be the division of function between these three learned people.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-12_para13"></a>In relation to the particular function in Clause 31 of reference to the judicial committee, I wonder what would happen if the three learned people did not agree with each other. Let us suppose, for example, that two of them say, "Yes, this should be a reference to the judicial committee", but the other one disagrees. What would happen in that event? Indeed, could any one of them use his own initiative, whatever the others might feel, and decide whether to refer the matter to the judicial committee? This is a complex matter on which the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate must enlighten the Committee. It will be very difficult for us to understand the position unless he does so.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80728-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hope of Craighead: </B>   I should like to add something to the points made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, about the relationship between the Lord Advocate and the Ministers. If I may be so bold, I make such comments from the point of view of the judicial committee of which I am a member. If these issues about legislative competence are brought before the judicial committee for decision, questions will arise from time to time which are questions of fact or questions about which information may be necessary in order to enable the committee to reach its decision. Indeed, that happens quite frequently in our proceedings and, sometimes, in the relatively informal way that these hearings are <P>


<a name="column_1382"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1382</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>conducted, we put questions to counsel who have the advantage of having with them people from the relevant jurisdictions who can provide answers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para0"></a>If such references are to be conducted with expedition, which is essential if the parliament is to be assisted to do its job, the less opportunity there is for delay and confusion the better. Indeed, if someone appearing in a reference is not representing the true originator of the issue or has no immediate access to the information which the committee needs to resolve the point, the more unfortunate the position will become. It seems to be very important to identify correctly the true initiator of the decision to bring the matter before the judicial committee. Broadly speaking, it is for that reason that I would be inclined to support the amendment moved by the noble and learned Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   Perhaps I may deal, first, with the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead. While I can understand that the judicial committee frequently deals with factual matters, it is difficult for me to understand how that would arise in this situation. The noble and learned Lord will be aware that the reference in terms of Clause 32 relates to the question of whether or not a Bill, or any provision of a Bill, would be within the legislative competence of the parliament. That strikes me as being purely a legal question. I give way to the noble and learned Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hope of Craighead: </B>   I am much obliged. Perhaps I may just elaborate on what I said. One only has to look, for example, at the contents of Schedule 5 and the reservations listed therein to understand my point. Indeed, I happen to be looking at the section relating to medicines on page 81 of the Bill which says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Regulation of prices charged for medical supplies", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para1"></a>and so on. Indeed, it does not seem very far fetched to suggest that issues of fact might arise to which the judicial committee would like to have a quick answer to enable it to get to grips with the true issue of law which needs to be decided. The problem is that the whole idea of the reference to the judicial committee is written into the Bill in about one line, without really establishing the nature of the jurisdiction which the committee will have to exercise at that juncture.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I understand the point raised by the noble and learned Lord. However, even if a question of fact should arise, I do not understand the point about the title of the person appearing. For example, if the Lord Advocate were appearing in his own right in such circumstances, I would be surprised if he did not have the ability to answer factual questions relating to medicines, and so on. I am sure that it would be within the ability of the Lord Advocate to obtain the necessary information to enable him properly to instruct the committee. Before taking the reference, no doubt the Lord Advocate, the Advocate General or, indeed, the Attorney-General would have considered such factual issues if they related to a particular matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para2"></a>I turn now to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, as to the relative functions of the three Law Officers. Of course, the office of Lord Advocate <P>


<a name="column_1383"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1383</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be devolved, so he will be the senior Law Officer to the Scottish executive and the Scottish parliament. He will have no role in relation to acting as a Law Officer for the UK Government. As far as concerns the Attorney-General, he will of course retain his present role.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para3"></a>As the noble Lord will appreciate, at present the Lord Advocate has certain functions in respect of the UK Government as regards giving advice on Scots law in relation to UK departments, and has an input into UK policy and its Parliament. Therefore, by taking the Lord Advocate north and confining him to Scotland and to the Scottish parliament, we have created a gap which the Advocate General will fill. He or she will be a Scots lawyer of standing who will assume the roles which the Lord Advocate presently exercises in relation to the UK Government and the UK Parliament.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-13_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I thank the noble and learned Lord for his explanation as far as it has gone. I bear in mind what he has said about the Lord Advocate and that the Lord Advocate will continue to have his United Kingdom responsibilities--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-13_spnew5"></A><B> Noble Lords:  </B>   No!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-13_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Well, who will have them in respect of Scotland because Scotland is to remain part of the United Kingdom.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-13_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I am sorry. I obviously have not made myself clear. After devolution the Lord Advocate will not have the responsibility to the United Kingdom Government which he has at the present time. That is why the new office of Advocate General has been created. He will take over the responsibilities of the Lord Advocate in relation to the United Kingdom Parliament. The Advocate General will be a senior Scottish lawyer appointed by the Prime Minister to perform the roles relating to the United Kingdom Parliament and Government which the Lord Advocate presently exercises.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_time0"></A><H5>5.45 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-13_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   Can the noble and learned Lord say what is the position of the Attorney-General in this case?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-13_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   As I sought to explain, the Attorney-General will be in exactly the same position as he is at the moment. He is the English Law Officer for the United Kingdom Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para4"></a>I turn to the group of amendments which we are considering at the moment. Amendments Nos. 235 and 239 would have the effect that the Attorney-General could not refer matters about the legislative competence of Bills of the Scottish parliament to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Government do not think that it would be appropriate to remove that right from the Attorney-General. If one goes on through the Bill, one can see that in terms of Part III of Schedule 6--that is, after legislation is in place--the Attorney-General has a specific role to play in <P>


<a name="column_1384"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1384</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>proceedings in England. If, in the course of proceedings in England, there is a challenge to the question of the vires of a piece of Scottish legislation, it would be for the Attorney-General to raise the matter or, indeed, he could institute the proceedings themselves. In that situation the Lord Advocate would defend them.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para5"></a>It is envisaged that the Attorney-General will have a specific role in relation to legislation which has Royal Assent. We think that it is illogical to remove from him the role to challenge legislation prior to Royal Assent. There may be issues of English law and issues with which he is concerned which he wishes to raise at the pre-assent stage. That is why we are leaving the Attorney-General with the right to challenge legislation prior to Royal Assent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para6"></a>Amendment No. 238 effectively removes the question of reference from Law Officers and hands it over to Ministers. The position which was outlined in the White Paper is that the Government recognise that the Scottish executive and the United Kingdom Executive may take different views of the Scottish parliament's legislative powers. In providing that references to the Judicial Committee should be made by a minister--whether it is the Secretary of State for Scotland or the first minister--noble Lords would run the risk of politicising the process and shifting the focus away from the determination of the legal argument. Essentially, whether it is competent or not is a legal issue and should not be a political issue. For that reason it was decided that the Law Officers were the appropriate people to raise proceedings about the competence of a Bill which had passed through its stages but was awaiting Royal Assent.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para7"></a>It is important to realise that the Judicial Committee will be concerning itself with technical questions of law and not matters of politics, although there may be issues of fact, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, has pointed out. In our view, in that situation it is appropriate that the references should be by the Law Officers rather than by other Ministers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para8"></a>To deal with the point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, we do not see the Law Officers acting in a representative capacity here. If the Law Officers consider that the Act is ultra vires, then they will intervene and raise proceedings in their own right.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-13_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   Before the noble and learned Lord sits down, will he address this question? Does he envisage that before initiating such a reference, the Law Officer would consult his political colleagues and act in accordance with their views as to whether a reference should be made?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para9"></a>I fully take his point that the issue for the Judicial Committee to decide is a legal issue. But I do not demur from the suggestion I made earlier that the decision as to whether to initiate a reference could have a highly political content. The problem about the Law Officer initiating this reference, particularly if he is the Lord Advocate, is that a few months or possibly a few weeks earlier, as a member of the Scottish executive he would have been involved in the formulation of a view, which <P>


<a name="column_1385"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1385</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>would have been given to the parliament by the Minister in terms of Clause 30, that the Bill is in accordance with the legislative purpose of the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para10"></a>However, a few weeks or a few months down the line there may be uncertainty as to whether he is still acting in his capacity as a member of the Scottish executive or in an independent role representing the public interest. Traditionally, over the years Lords Advocate have been called into cases, such as the Law Hospital case in which I appeared. In the application by the Law Hospital as to whether or not feeding should be withdrawn from a patient in a permanent vegetative state the court required the Lord Advocate to represent the public interest. He did so in his own right. How he goes about working out what is the public interest is a matter for him. But there is no suggestion in that event that he is representing the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-13_para11"></a>I have a concern that there is an element of confusion here. I should be grateful if the noble and learned Lord would confirm whether he envisages that this would be the decision of the Lord Advocate, the Attorney-General or the Advocate General alone, or would it be one in which he took on board the views and acted in accordance with the wishes of his political colleagues?<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980728/text/80728-14.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I should like to draw a distinction, first of all, between Acts of the Scottish parliament which are initiated and introduced by the executive as part of the government's programme of legislation, and the legislation introduced by others such as Back-Benchers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-14_para0"></a>In the latter case the Lord Advocate would not have been involved in any statement in terms of the legislation by the person who is introducing the Bill. It is understandable in that situation how the Bill could go through. The Lord Advocate would say, "Well, I am not happy with this. It is outwith the competence and I am raising proceedings".
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-14_para1"></a>I turn to the situation where we are talking about government legislation. Of course, ultimately the workings of the executive will be for them. But I would envisage that the Lord Advocate, as Law Officer, would have a role similar to the one which he exercises at the moment in advising the executive about the legality of proposed legislation, and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-14_para2"></a>If the Lord Advocate has advised the executive that he or she considers that the proposed Bill is within the competence of the parliament, and then it goes through the parliament, it is inconceivable that the Lord Advocate will take a different view just before Royal Assent. Therefore I do not see that difficulty arising.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-14_para3"></a>If the Lord Advocate is minded to raise proceedings challenging the competence of legislation which is about to be presented for Royal Assent, I would certainly anticipate that the Lord Advocate of the day would advise his ministerial colleagues that he had taken this view and that he was proposing to intervene and to present the necessary application to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. I do not anticipate--and I would not myself accept--that the executive would be able to discourage the Lord Advocate from that course because, if he has taken the view that this <P>


<a name="column_1386"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1386</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matter is ultra vires and outwith the competence of the parliament and has decided that he will proceed, clearly he ought to explain to his ministerial colleagues why he considers the matter is ultra vires. However, that would not be a political decision and he ought not to be influenced by any political consideration not to proceed in that situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-14_para4"></a>As I said, this may be an interesting academic exercise or discussion because at the earlier stages, if it is a government Bill, the Lord Advocate will have expressed a view about the competence of the legislation. If he has taken a view at the earlier stages that it is not lawful, he ought to make that clear to the executive and, if need be, consider his own position if that advice is not accepted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-14_para5"></a>I hope that it follows from what I have said that I see this as a public interest issue. The Government consider it important that the making of the reference should be left in the control of the independent Law Officers because of the constitutional significance of this matter and bearing in mind the desirability of having harmony between Scotland and the United Kingdom. It should not be left to politicians to decide whether or not they will challenge legislation. I take up the point that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, alluded to earlier. If there were extreme people in power who wanted to push the parliament to extremes and to challenge Westminster, the independent Law Officers may well be seen (I hope they will) as a protection against such excesses. I hope it will be considered that the independent Law Officers would not simply accept instructions from a group of politicians who were clearly acting outwith the competence of the legislation. With that explanation--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-14_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am concerned not so much about the political aspect but rather about the mechanics of the matter which I do not understand. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, pointed out that the judicial committee would need to ask various questions and to be able quickly to acquire the facts that were needed to enable it to reach a decision. According to Clause 32(1) the Attorney-General could make the reference right from the start. However, he is an English Law Officer. Would he have been in Edinburgh while all this was going on? Is it right that he should be included in that clause at that point? The noble and learned Lord said that at a later stage there may be an English dimension to all this. Obviously the politics of that would be fairly tricky. One can understand there may be occasions when the Attorney-General would be involved. However, if a measure has come from the Scottish parliament and it concerns Scottish legislation and decisions to be made by that parliament, why is it possible for the Attorney-General to make the reference? I should have thought that that would be pretty unacceptable and not an easy matter for the judicial committee. However, I may be quite wrong.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   We are concerned with the legislative competence as to whether the parliament has exceeded its powers and encroached on the powers of the United Kingdom Parliament. By the word "encroached" I mean <P>


<a name="column_1387"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1387</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>encroached in an unacceptable way because there will always be certain overlaps. The Attorney-General may well have an interest if the effect of the Scottish legislation is to encroach to an unacceptable extent upon his jurisdiction.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-14_para6"></a>As regards the ascertaining of facts, the Attorney-General will, of course, have that within his power, just as much as the Advocate General. The Advocate General will essentially be concerned with United Kingdom issues. The Attorney-General will have the ability to obtain the necessary factual material, just as much as the Advocate General. I refer to the example given by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead. Medicines are a United Kingdom matter. It would be easy for the Attorney-General to obtain the necessary factual material for the judicial committee. I am bound to say I still feel that the likelihood of the judicial committee requiring factual evidence is probably more remote in this kind of case than in the other kinds of case that the noble and learned Lord is accustomed to deal with.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I wish to ask the noble and learned Lord another rather vital question. He has made clear that the Advocate General is to be a member of the Scottish executive.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-14_spnew4"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am sorry. I made a slip of the tongue. I meant to say that the Lord Advocate will be a member of the Scottish executive and his first loyalty will be to the Scottish executive. Therefore he is unlikely ever to refer to the judicial committee a complaint about the Scottish executive's legislative intention. In those circumstances, if the Advocate General thinks that a complaint should be made, will he be able to overrule the Lord Advocate?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-14_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I am sorry. I should have picked up the point the noble Lord made earlier about what happens if two out of the three agree. With respect, that may be due to a misunderstanding on the part of the noble Lord. Any of these people may take proceedings. The Lord Advocate could take the decision himself to challenge legislation. Equally, the Attorney-General could take the decision himself to challenge legislation. If legislation had been challenged by the Attorney-General, which the Lord Advocate had advised the executive was perfectly competent, I would anticipate the Lord Advocate being on the other side of the litigation. Similarly the Advocate General may, on his or her own account, take the decision to raise proceedings. Therefore all three do not need to agree; anyone can decide that he or she thinks that the legislation is outwith the competence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-14_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hope of Craighead: </B>   Perhaps I may return to the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour. It relates to a question of procedure which is not clear from this clause but may be provided for under the Orders in Council referred to in Clause 94. The judicial committee would be in grave difficulty if it did <P>


<a name="column_1388"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1388</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not have two parties before it--a contradictor to the argument put forward by the party initiating the proceedings. I should welcome a comment from the noble and learned Lord. Does he envisage that if, to take an example, the Attorney-General were to raise an issue, the judicial committee would have power to order the proceedings to be served upon a Scottish Law Officer, or possibly a Scottish minister, in order that a proper contradictor can be presented to the committee before the case is heard?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-14_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I believe that this matter may be dealt with by orders. I will write to the noble and learned Lord to confirm that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-14_para7"></a>As I understand it, proceedings against the parliament or the corporate body will be served upon the Lord Advocate. Therefore, if the Attorney-General raised a question as to the competence of the legislation, that would be done in the form of an initiating writ, which would then be served upon the Lord Advocate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-14_para8"></a>As I indicated to the noble Lord, Lord Renton, if the Attorney-General raised proceedings and the Lord Advocate had advised the Scottish executive that the matter was within its competence and had supported the legislation through parliament, then the Lord Advocate would undoubtedly enter the process and argue the case for the Scottish parliament as to the legality of the legislation. Similarly, if the Advocate General raised proceedings, again they would be served on the Lord Advocate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-14_para9"></a>The only question might arise when the Lord Advocate initiated proceedings as to the legality of legislation. As I said, the most likely situation would be if legislation were introduced by a Back-Bencher or someone other than the Scottish executive, if the Lord Advocate had taken the view all along that that was not within the powers of the parliament, then the Lord Advocate would raise the matter. I will examine the question as to who should be the contradictor in that situation. Clearly, in that situation I should not anticipate the Attorney-General or Advocate General entering the proceedings. I shall certainly consider that matter and come back to the noble and learned Lord.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   Perhaps the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate will consider one other matter. I should have raised it had I been present during discussion on Clause 28(8). It arises also in relation to Clauses 30 to 32. Subsection (8) of Clause 28 gives a direction as to how,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Any provision of an Act of the Scottish Parliament is to be read"; </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para0"></a>and it is to be read,

<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para1"></a>Therefore I presume that if there were proceedings in relation to an Act, that is the way it would be read.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para2"></a>If, however, one were the lonely presiding officer, or the accompanied members of the judicial committee of the Privy Council, acting under Clause 32, in that situation would one read the provisions in such a way, if possible, so as to be within the legislative competence <P>


<a name="column_1389"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1389</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the parliament; or would one, since there is ample time to put the matter right if it is outside the competence, not use that presumption? In other words, at the pre-legislative stage would one use a different test from that which would be used in terms of Clause 28(8)? Perhaps the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate will respond to that matter during the course of our debates this evening.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I may be able to deal with the point now. The noble and learned Lord has far greater experience and expertise in statutory interpretation than I. However, I should have thought that the reference in Clause 28(8) to an Act would refer to an Act that has passed through all its stages, including Royal Assent; whereas when it comes to scrutiny under Clause 32, one is looking at a Bill. The question before the judicial committee is whether a particular provision of a Bill, or the Bill as a whole, is within the competence of the parliament. I should not have thought that those arguing for legality could rely upon Clause 28(8). The whole question would be whether this provision would apply. If I am wrong, I am sure that the noble and learned Lord will correct me.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   Anyone who doubted that lawyers might make some money out of devolution will have had those doubts dispelled by the discussion of the last half-an-hour.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para3"></a>I was interested to hear the remarks of the noble and learned Lord about the fact that, as a Law Officer, he would be able to obtain all the information he required from his political colleagues. Looking round the Chamber as he uttered those words, I did not feel that they struck an overwhelming chord with his three predecessors who are present. However, I am sure that he will pay attention to the points raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope. What is clear is that, if references to the judicial committee take place at a pre-legislative stage, speed in determining a matter is of the essence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para4"></a>I do not intend to press these amendments to a Division. However, I invite the Government to think again as to the politics of allowing the Attorney-General to intervene at this stage. I can readily accept that some questions of English law might arise; but if those have to be debated before the judicial committee, it would be perfectly possible for the Advocate General, if he were appearing, to be accompanied by a lawyer qualified in the law of England if the Advocate General were not so qualified. The politics of allowing the Attorney-General to intervene at this stage might go down very badly in Scotland. As he will be a member of the same government as the Advocate General, I hope that it might be possible to restrict the right to the Advocate General.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para5"></a>I am interested to hear the noble and learned Lord's remark about the role of the law officers acting independently of their executive bodies, albeit having advised them in advance as to what they propose to do.

<A NAME = "80728-15_para6"></a>Finally, to take up another point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, about information, I invite the Government to consider whether a provision such as Clause 93(4) or paragraph 5 of Schedule 6 might be written into the procedure at this stage to ensure that the appropriate contradictor has information given to him so that the judicial committee has the benefit of a full debate on the legal issues that arise. I seek leave to withdraw Amendment No. 235.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 16, line 10, leave out ("Standing orders shall ensure that,").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para8"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Amendments Nos. 236 and 237 are small drafting amendments. They seek to amend Clause 31 to delete the reference to standing orders in subsection (5). If the judicial committee has decided that a Bill or any provision of a Bill is not within the legislative competence of the parliament, that should be the end of the matter. It should be on the face of the Bill that the presiding officer shall not submit a Bill before Royal Assent. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-15_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, indicated, Amendments Nos. 236 and 237 would prescribe on the face of the Scotland Bill, that the presiding officer must not submit for Royal Assent a Bill, in its unamended form, if the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council decides that the Bill or a provision of it would be outwith the legislative competence of the parliament. As currently drafted, the Scotland Bill provides that standing orders must make the detailed provision to ensure that this does not happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para9"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that it is important that in such cases unamended Bills are not submitted for Royal Assent. However, I believe that the Bill in front of us already makes appropriate provision for this. It essentially places a duty on the parliament to provide in its standing orders for the procedures under which the presiding officer may and may not submit Bills for Royal Assent. These procedures must include procedures to prevent a Bill being submitted if the circumstances in Clause 31(5) apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para10"></a>I also accept that the end result of the noble Lord's amendments is likely to be the same as what is provided for in the Bill. But how we achieve that end is important. As I have indicated, the detailed procedures about the submission of Bills for Royal Assent will, quite rightly, be set out in standing orders, not on the face of the Bill. It will also be necessary in these procedures to build in the safeguards to ensure that Bills which have been declared to be ultra vires do not go forward unless they are amended. Clause 31(5) ensures that that will be done. I therefore believe the approach chosen by the Government is the correct one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para11"></a>As I have explained on other occasions, we believe that it is important and indeed necessary that detailed matters concerning legislative proceedings in the parliament should be a matter for the Scottish parliament. That is why the Bill provides for this matter <P>


<a name="column_1391"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1391</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be dealt with through standing orders. It is consistent with the approach we have followed throughout this particular clause, which prescribes the framework within which standing orders will cover detailed procedures dealing with the presiding officer's duties in scrutinising Bills and in submitting Bills for Royal Assent, as well as being consistent, with the general approach we have taken throughout the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para12"></a>I therefore invite the noble and learned Lord to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   The sweetness of the noble Baroness's smile becomes greater, but her generosity remains at a fairly low level. This is not a matter which I intend to press, but it brings to mind a question which I asked some days ago and to which I still await a reply. What happens if the standing orders passed by the parliament do not comply with the provisions of the Bill? Who has the right to challenge it? No doubt I shall receive a reply to the question over the Recess and, if necessary, we can return to the matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 16, line 34, after ("obligations") insert ("or the interests of defence or national security").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para21"></a>The noble Lord said: I am speaking to Amendments Nos. 243 to 247 and 262 to 267. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that there are adequate safeguards for those matters which the White Paper intended should be reserved. I spoke to related amendments to Clause 28 and Schedule 4--I am advised that it was last Tuesday, but it is all rather a fog at the moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para22"></a>While for the Scottish parliament to have a workable legislative competence, its legislation for devolved purposes needs to be able to have ancillary effects upon reserved matters, the Government recognise that there need to be safeguards in cases where Acts of the Scottish parliament could have adverse effects on the law as it applies to reserved matters. For example, legislation about housing or local taxation could possibly have an impact on the operation of social security legislation. Clause 33 therefore empowers the Secretary of State, by order, to prevent a Scottish Bill from being submitted for Royal Assent in certain circumstances. Clause 54(4) provides a complementary power to revoke subordinate legislation. Under Amendments Nos. 243 to 247 these powers would be available to a Secretary of State if the Bill contains <P>


<a name="column_1392"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1392</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provisions which make modifications of the law as it applies to reserved matters and which the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe would have an adverse effect on the operation of the law as it applies to reserved matters. The change from the current wording in the Bill is necessary to take account, first, of the amendments to the tests of legislative competence in Clause 28 and, secondly, of possible adverse effects on the operation of any aspect of the law, whether statute law or the common law, as it applies to reserved matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para23"></a>Clauses 33 and 54(4) also enable the Secretary of State to intervene to ensure that the United Kingdom's international obligations are met. Amendments Nos. 243 and 263 provide for the interests of defence and national security to be treated on a similar basis. These powers would be available, for instance, where the Secretary of State considered on reasonable grounds that a Scottish Bill dealing with planning which affected defence establishments would be incompatible with the interests of defence or national security.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para24"></a>Amendment No. 247 would enable the Secretary of State to use his power of intervention in a four-week period after a decision by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council that a Scottish Bill was intra vires. Without this amendment, the Secretary of State would have to use his power of intervention before the vires of a Scottish Bill had been established.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para25"></a>These powers of intervention are of course meant to be long stops. Their use would require to be justified and would be liable to be scrutinised by judicial review. The amendments establish a series of tests which limit the extent to which legislation by the Scottish parliament can affect reserved matters. But the powers of intervention provide essential balance to ensure that there is a sensible outcome in relation to reserved matters. Their existence should be sufficient to ensure consultation between Whitehall and Edinburgh so that there may be no need for them to be used. But there should be no doubt that this Government will be willing to use the powers of intervention if it became necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para26"></a>We have also taken the opportunity to make a number of clarificatory amendments to Clause 54. Amendments Nos. 262, 265 and 267 correct the wording of Clause 54 by making it clear that the Secretary of State's power to revoke subordinate legislation applies to existing legislation and that the requirement for the Secretary of State to state his reasons for making orders under that clause applies to orders made under all subsections, not just that under the power to revoke subordinate legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-15_para27"></a>I hope that this explanation of the amendments has been helpful. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80728-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lang of Monkton: </B>   I believe that I understood the explanation that the noble Lord gave of the amendments he has tabled to Clauses 33 and 54. Since, as I understand it, this is the first time that there has been any reference of substance to the powers of the Secretary of State in the Bill, I wonder whether we might explore a little more fully the role and function of the Secretary of State in future in the context of the amendments to his powers that the Government have tabled.
<P>


<a name="column_1393"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1393</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para0"></a>Formerly, the position of Secretary of State for Scotland was powerful because he presided over a complete range of domestic areas of government, a substantial department and a substantial budget. He was therefore able to act with some authority within Scotland and to defend Scotland's powers within government at Westminster and in Whitehall. One can think of many examples--Tom Johnston and Willie Ross spring to mind--of those who have done this. But now there is to be something of a role reversal. We are all familiar with the constitutionally illiterate challenge of any Secretary of State: "Are you the Government's man in Scotland or Scotland's man in Government?". As I see it, under this Bill that question need not be asked. It is quite clear that the role of the Secretary of State for Scotland can in future only be that of the role of the Government's man in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para1"></a>Clearly, from a position of strength, the Secretary of State is now moving to a position of considerable weakness. He will no longer be at the centre of government. He will be an outsider but with power to intervene to prohibit a Bill of the Scottish parliament after it has passed through the Scottish parliament. Indeed, through Clause 54 he will have power to intervene to control and prohibit action by the Scottish executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para2"></a>If I read the Bill correctly, that does not bode well for the future relationship between the parliament in Edinburgh and the Parliament at Westminster. Therefore I ask the Government how they see the role, function and status of the Secretary of State. In the context of this clause and subject to the amendments as tabled, to which Secretary of State are they referring? Is it the Secretary of State for Scotland or another? I looked at Clause 112 for enlightenment on interpretation and found it silent. In the context of the amendments it may be the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of State for Home Affairs or the Secretary of State for Defence who will be the relevant Secretary of State. As most Secretaries of State these days seem to be Scots, that may not be perceived as being a problem at the present time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para3"></a>I suspect that the answer I will receive is that it is the use of the generic term "Secretary of State", which is normally used in legislation. But it is all the more important, therefore, to clarify precisely what the role of the Secretary of State for Scotland will be. It is he who is most likely to find himself dealing from Westminster with the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para4"></a>Will there be a Secretary of State for Scotland? Will he be a Secretary of State for Scotland alone or might he be grouped together with other territorial parts of the United Kingdom as a sort of revived and some may think insulting concept of Colonial Secretary? Will he have a seat in the Cabinet? What roles would he have other than those that might--and only "might"--arise under Clauses 33 and 54? What would be his powers and authority?
<P>


<a name="column_1394"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1394</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para5"></a>I assume that the Secretary of State will have no department and that in itself will underline the weakness of his position--something on which Mr. Jack Cunningham may care to reflect in the days ahead. Will he have junior ministers to assist him? Will he receive advice from officials and, if so, from which officials? Will they be from the Scottish Office? If so, how will that reflect the advice that those same officials will be giving to the Scottish executive whose actions the Secretary of State might then be advised to overrule?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para6"></a>I am not seeking to raise artificial hurdles, difficulties and problems; rather, I am trying to anticipate the kind of problems that will arise once the legislation is in force. The argument may be better raised at Clause stand part, at which time I may be tempted to return to the charge. But I should like the Government's views and thoughts on how they see the role of the Secretary of State.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para7"></a>I suspect that the Government have given little thought to this matter. Their preoccupation has been so entirely with the role, powers and functions of the Scottish parliament that they have regarded the Secretary of State's function as something that will just wither away into irrelevance. If that is the case--I hope that the Minister can reassure me that it is not--it is an extremely dangerous posture to adopt. Links between Edinburgh and Westminster will be vital if we are to retain the integrity of the United Kingdom following the creation of this parliament. There is a possibility that the role of the Secretary of State will be pivotal in sustaining and nurturing that relationship. Therefore, we should be told where the Government stand in relation to the powers of the Secretary of State.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Kirkhill: </B>   Before the noble Lord resumes his seat and before I make one point, I want to say that his remarks are pertinent, important and certainly demanding of specific reply. I am sure that it is my own stupidity, but I did not understand the point he made in relation to various Secretaries of State. Perhaps he could elaborate a little on that point so that I can fully understand his comments.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lang of Monkton: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving me the chance to try to make myself more clear. Under subsection (1)(a) of Clause 33, the Secretary of State may take certain action to prohibit the presiding officer from submitting a Bill for Royal Assent, where he has reasonable grounds to believe that such action,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"would be incompatible with any international obligations". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para8"></a>The Government's amendment added to that criterion the further consideration that he should intervene where the interests of defence or national security are concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para9"></a>I imagine that the Secretary of State who would be in the lead in such intervention would be, first, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; secondly, possibly the Secretary of State for Home Affairs and, thirdly, the Secretary of State for Defence. That may be <P>


<a name="column_1395"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1395</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>so, in which case the Minister and I understand each other. But it still does not answer the question in relation to what powers the Secretary of State has.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Perhaps I can deal with those issues now, if it is convenient to the Committee.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lang, will receive the reply he anticipated. Reference in the Bill to "Secretary of State" is a generic reference. It is applicable to any Secretary of State. If we move on to the broader point, it comes up elsewhere in the Bill on the future role and function of the Secretary of State. We must remember that everything to do with the Secretary of State--the future role and function of the Secretary of State--is largely a matter for the Prime Minister of the day. We imagine that there will be an important task to be done, particularly in the early stages of the parliament's life, in terms of establishing and cementing good relations between the UK Government and the Scottish executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para11"></a>Clearly, this is an area where everyone recognises that the role of the Secretary of State in a devolved context is likely to change and evolve over time. It is difficult at this juncture to be prescriptive or precise in terms of how the relationship between the Secretary of State for Scotland and the UK Parliament, the UK Government, the Scottish parliament and the Scottish executive will change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para12"></a>We are in a situation where, although we are establishing the framework for devolution, much of the relationships and practices are of a dynamic nature. There will be change; and there will be evolution. I am not confident that I can predict at this stage what that will look like five years down the road.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hope of Craighead: </B>   Perhaps the Minister will explain a little more the thinking behind Amendment No. 247. That is the provision which creates a relationship between the Secretary of State and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Clearly, some provision has to be made to deal with a situation where a reference has been made to the Privy Council and to provide a timetable within which the Secretary of State takes the step provided for in Clause 33.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para13"></a>From the way in which Amendment No. 247 is presently worded, it seems to me that, even if the Secretary of State decided that in the interest of defence or national security he should make an order under Clause 33, nevertheless, the Judicial Committee would have to go through the process of hearing the application or deciding it, or otherwise disposing of it before the period of four weeks began. Perhaps it would make more sense if the period of four weeks were to run from the date of reference to the Judicial Committee. It seems unfortunate, if the Judicial Committee is to have other things to do, that it should have to go through and decide an issue which will be immediately rendered academic by the decision of the Secretary of State.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Fraser of Carmyllie: </B>   Before the noble Lord responds, perhaps I can intervene briefly. I can reassure the Minister that I welcome Amendment No. 244. The Bill as it stood made my head throb and this amendment makes it somewhat simpler to understand. It is therefore <P>


<a name="column_1396"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1396</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to be welcomed. However, we will want a fuller reply at some point about the role of the Secretary of State for Scotland--whether combined or however it is to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para14"></a>It seems to me that the only thing one can say with confidence about the Secretary of State for Scotland under these new arrangements is that his first task will be to see whether the Advocate General is free for lunch every day; he has so little else to do. Otherwise all that he would be doing on an annual basis is adjusting the seating plan for the annual visit of the Moderator of the General Assembly before he delivers his customary sermon in the Palace of Westminster. I wonder what his role would be. The only prediction one can make with any certainty is that he will not be residing in the splendour of Dover House for much longer from what one reads about the intentions of the Prime Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para15"></a>I do not expect an answer from the noble and learned Lord at this time but I would be grateful if he reflects on it and writes to me. In Clause 33 he is proposing after "international obligations" the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or the interests of defence or national security". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para16"></a>What exactly are "international obligations?" Before the Minister leaps to his feet, I am aware that international obligations are defined in Clause 112(10). They are defined there in the context of separating out from international obligations those obligations which are to be treated as Community law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para17"></a>If this Parliament wished at any time in the future to remove from the Scottish parliament the powers that have been devolved--to increase again the extent of the reservation--as I understand it this Parliament could do so under Clause 29 by way of an Order in Council. Am I correct in understanding that if the Government of the United Kingdom entered into international obligations--and they could achieve international obligations without reference to this House; the obligations would already be in place--it would allow the Westminster Government by, as it were, a back route to impinge upon those matters which had been devolved to the Scottish parliament?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-16_para18"></a>This is not simply to raise an exceptionally arcane point; although it may appear to be such. It is my understanding that the device has been used by the Federal Government of Australia when wishing to restrict the activities or the powers of the states. As a consequence of entering into international obligations, what had been within the remit of the states was necessarily limited. I am not sure what the answer is but it is something we ought to be alive to. It would be helpful, if not now, then during the long Recess, if the Minister would reflect on it and write to me.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I shall try to respond to the points made by noble Lords. I am enormously gratified that the amendment has helped the throbbing head of the noble Lord, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie. His comments have added to my throbbing head. He invited me to write to him over the Recess and that is an invitation that I take up with alacrity. If he does not mind, I will leave the point there.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para0"></a>As to the point of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, I accept the commonsense attraction of what the noble Lord said. Again, it is a matter upon which I would like to write to the noble and learned Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para1"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, asks why Clause 54 does not require or prohibit executive action in relation to the interests of defence and national security. We consider that it is appropriate to have powers of intervention in order to protect the interests of defence and national security from the possible adverse effects of Acts of the Scottish parliament or subordinate action made by Scottish Ministers. That is what the amendments set out to do. The powers therefore match those in relation to the possible adverse effects of legislation on the operation of the law as it applies to reserved matters. We do not consider that it is necessary to provide the Secretary of State with powers to prevent or require action in relation to the interests of defence or national security to match those which are available for international obligations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para2"></a>Clearly, a judgment has to be made about the extent of the powers of intervention. We have concluded that it would go too far to extend the power of the Secretary of State in relation to defence and national security to executive action by the Scottish Ministers. It is a matter of judgment. I take the noble and learned Lord's point. I would like to revisit the matter and give it another round of judgment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   While the Minister is doing so, he may wish to consider Amendment No. 263. As I read it, the amendment seeks to eliminate the anomaly to which the noble and learned Lord drew attention. As I construe it, it seems to write certain provisions into Clause 54. I may be wrong about that.
<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 248 is grouped with the amendment of my noble friend Lord Balfour, Amendment No. 249. The Committee will remember that on the first day of Committee we had an interesting debate about the second Chamber. The Government indicated very firmly, including in the Division Lobbies, that they did not want a second Chamber. They also indicated--as they have done all along when we have discussed these matters--that somehow or other the Scottish parliament would deal with its business, especially its legislative business, in a different way. The implication was, of course, in a better way than the House of Commons. Therefore the need for a second Chamber would not be there and a case could not be made for one.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para8"></a>We see in Clause 34 what the standing order shall provide as regards the procedures dealing with a piece of legislation, a Bill. It is interesting that we keep on being told that all such details should be left to the parliament to work out for itself. However, every now and then--on every other clause, I suspect--up come some details which are not to be left to the Scottish parliament, but to be set out in legislation. This is one of those occasions when the Government's usual line has been stood on its head.

<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para9"></a>The proposals in Clause 34 sound remarkably similar to the way in which the House of Commons deals with Bills. There is first to be a general debate on the Bill. That is to be followed by detailed consideration of it. There is then to be a final stage at which the Bill can be passed or rejected. That sounds awfully like Second Reading, Committee stage, Report and Third Reading. Furthermore, there is to be no second Chamber for the Scottish parliament. I was under the impression--I was continually told--that there would be different procedures in the Scottish parliament. Even if the Scottish parliament wants to have different procedures, Clause 34 ties it down to a system that looks remarkably like that in the House of Commons.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para10"></a>As we all know, even if the House of Commons is not hurrying through the legislation, a Bill takes on average about three months to complete all its stages. One of the advantages of your Lordships' House is that a Bill also has to take roughly about the same amount of time passing through. Often by the time a Bill reaches this House, various outside organisations with an interest in it have caught up with what the Bill actually does and they then lobby Members of your Lordships' House to change the Bill. That is certainly what happened on some of the major legislation in which I was involved at the Department of Social Security.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para11"></a>In my amendment I suggest an alternative to what I might call "the House of Commons pattern" as outlined in Clause 34. In Amendment No. 248 I suggest that there should first be a general debate on the principles of the Bill--a bit akin to Second Reading. Then, as the amendment states in, I hope, reasonably plain English, there should be a stage during which a committee of the parliament goes out to take evidence, to meet people who are interested in the subject matter of the Bill, and generally to listen to what is being said. That is not dissimilar to procedures that have been used in your Lordships' House on one or two occasions when a committee of your Lordships' House has held hearings, not just here in London, but also in Scotland. It is certainly true as regards one piece of Scottish legislation. I meant to check before the debate, but I believe that certain deer legislation went through that procedure and that some of my noble friends went to the Highlands to take evidence from the people directly involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para12"></a>I envisage a similar sort of operation, except that it would apply to every Bill. I believe that we have attempted to apply such a procedure only to Bills about which there has not been a great deal of political controversy. In some ways, however, I believe that it is more important that it is done for politically controversial Bills. During that stage, outside bodies could make representations to a committee of the parliament and suggest amendments. At the end of the period, the committee should report to the parliament on the evidence and the representations it has received.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para13"></a>At that point, there would be considerable input from outside the parliament. That suggests to me that the parliament would be "inclusive". I now come to some buzz words so beloved of government Ministers. The Bill would "involve" the people of Scotland. It would be "non-confrontational." Given those words, so beloved of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Ministers, I hope that the Government will accept my amendment, at least in principle. I accept that it could probably be worded better, but it is the principle with which I am really concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para14"></a>There would then be a further general debate, a kind of Second Reading mark two, when members would have before them the evidence and representations made to the committee. That would give members of the parliament the opportunity for a better informed debate than may have been the case the first time round. We would then move to a Committee stage in the normal way. I have teased out that the final stages might look more like those in your Lordships' House than in the House of Commons. There would be a Report stage, at which any amendments suggested subsequent to Committee stage, could be considered. There would then be a final debate and vote on the Bill--a sort of Third Reading--when the parliament could either pass or reject the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para15"></a>I have made clear in what would be new subsection (1A) that there should be a period of time between those two events so that the parliament is not rushed in its consideration of legislation, given that it is unicameral, and to ensure that Bills should take the same amount of time to go through the only House of the Scottish parliament as they do to go through both Houses of this Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-17_para16"></a>I suspect that many Members of the Committee will offer variations on the theme of how the Scottish parliament ought to legislate as a unicameral legislature. I gather that unicameral legislatures around the world deal with such problems in different ways. However, it seems to me--as I am sure that it must to many Members of the Committee--that Clause 34(1) does not sound at all innovative. It sounds and reads very like the House of Commons procedure translated to the Scots parliament in Edinburgh. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-18_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I agree very much with what my noble friend on the Front Bench said. On my reading of Clause 34 it appears to offer only one opportunity for a Bill to be amended. In my amendment I suggest two stages as a means of winning at least a tiny slice of the cake. I support my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish in his amendment, although I feel a little unhappy about what will be the new subsection (1A). I believe that the delay would be rather trying for the parliament in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para0"></a>I have never been a Member of another place, but I do not want amendments to be "chosen" in the Scottish parliament. I understand that that is done by the Chairman of Ways and Means in the other place. That is because--I say this quite loosely--I know of <P>


<a name="column_1401"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1401</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments which were never called in another place but which were accepted in this House. I believe that that leads to defective legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para1"></a>Without making a long speech, I should like to refer to what happens in this House and why I think it is so good. Your Lordships' House goes through Bills properly, from end to end. That does not appear to happen often in another place. We also have a total of three bites at the cherry. I feel that there should be at least three opportunities for legislation to be amended although I have set down only two in my amendment. I say that on this principle. It is extremely difficult for a noble Lord from any corner of this House to table an amendment--obviously, it must not contradict the principles of the Bill--which is legally correct and in language that the parliamentary draftsman is likely to accept.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para2"></a>As so often happens, the Government have accepted the principle of the amendment and agreed to table an amendment of their own at Report stage. Even when that happens, occasionally a consequential amendment should be taken into consideration. There is then an opportunity for the Government to tidy up any loose ends at Third Reading in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para3"></a>Referring to my noble friend's proposed subsection (1A), there is a rather nice rule in this Chamber that there should be an interval of two weekends between the stages of a Bill. That is sensible. I hope the Government accept that back-benchers of the Scottish parliament should have every opportunity to discuss Bills and table amendments in the same way as Members of this House. I have the executive very much in mind. I want to make quite certain that when a Bill has gone through parliament it does not have defects. Occasionally Bills have had defects, with disastrous results. Sometimes the courts have found that legislation is not as good as it should be. That leads to complications. One of the difficulties is that primary legislation is required to alter primary legislation. The Scottish parliament should be given every opportunity to get legislation right in a reasonable time with a reasonable opportunity for debate so that every clause is discussed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am sure that the Committee will be told that this matter should be left to the Scottish parliament and that it is wrong for us to interfere. The main element of my noble friend's suggestion is that the public in Scotland should have time to absorb what the Scottish parliament is trying to do and to react to it before legislation proceeds too far. There are examples of what happens when the Government decide in the course of a Bill to make a hurried change which does not work. This is a sensitive matter at the present time. We have the example of the proposal to lower the age of consent where there has been a last-minute change. The public have not properly absorbed what is proposed. Noble Lords had to take a view on it rather quickly. Public opinion is still developing on the subject. It was a pity that that happened so quickly.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para4"></a>Another example is Scottish student fees. One understood how the issue arose. A decision was taken hurriedly on the basis of the Dearing Report. A mistake occurred and another hurried decision was made by the Scottish Office to put it right. That turned out to be another doubtfully convenient decision. That is what happens when governments decide matters too quickly without public opinion having time to make itself heard.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para5"></a>It is quite wrong that this Chamber, which has enormous experience of how public opinion develops during the passage of legislation, should not insert into this Bill an extension of the period of time during which the parliament legislates so that public opinion can develop and react properly. It is very important for Scotland. If that does not happen many beginners who have not before dealt with legislation will become very disappointed with the process. They may let down their constituents and the country as a whole. The parliament may have been unduly influenced by Civil Service advice and not enough by public opinion. I believe that that will occur in a number of ways. The Scottish Civil Service is a marvellous body of men and women who do their utmost. However, it is not their job to test the opinion of people about legislation; it is the job of politicians.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para6"></a>On one or two occasions this afternoon the Government have said that they will look again at certain matters. I hope that they will either accept this or look at it again. It will be the greatest possible mistake if they do not.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   I have great sympathy with what has just been said by the noble Earl and the noble Baroness. I should like to explore other possible alternative procedures for the Scottish parliament. If Clause 34 is accepted as drafted, do the Government believe that it would be possible for the Scottish parliament to consider Bills while still in draft and before they had been finalised by the executive or by private members? If so it would allow for the taking of evidence from interested parties and either specific or broad pressure groups on particular Bills.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para7"></a>I understand that there is already in existence in the other place a special standing committee procedure whereby evidence can be taken. I believe that when Parliament resumes that procedure will be adopted for certain Bills. I am trying to elucidate the idea of scrutiny in advance of the terms of legislation becoming fixed. Anything that the Government can say to throw light on that matter is most welcome.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   I understand the purpose of Amendments Nos. 248 and 249. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, have done a lot of very useful work in considering a possible procedure. I quite like it but I will not have it, in that I do not believe that this amount of detail is a matter for us. Good work has been done on this. There is no disagreement with it as far as concerns my party. It provides a chance for a proper examination of legislation in a unicameral parliament. I cannot say the same about the efforts of the Government in Clause 34 <P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para8"></a>The Government appear to adopt an attitude that is contrary to what was said in the debate in the House of Commons when Mr. McLeish gave the following reply:

<A NAME = "80728-18_para9"></a>Why on earth are we now putting on the face of the Bill detail in the form of recommendations that simply form parliamentary procedure?

<P>
<A NAME="80728-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I appreciate that in Amendments Nos. 248 and 249 noble Lords want to ensure that the parliament will have sufficient opportunities to consider and vote on Bills in front of it. I agree with that wholeheartedly. I also agree that it is important that the parliament is able to hear and consider the views of bodies interested in a Bill. However, the Government believe that it is not for us to prescribe the working practices of the parliament. We cannot accept these amendments because they would intrude too far into the legislative processes of the Scottish parliament. I am afraid that I am not disappointing the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, in saying that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para10"></a>We consider that the Bill prescribes the three minimum stages of parliamentary scrutiny. This is a very minimal and generalised laying down of three stages of parliamentary scrutiny--not with capital letters. It is not unique to Westminster to have a general debate on a Bill with an opportunity for members to vote on its general principles, then consideration of, and an opportunity to vote on, the details of the Bill and a final stage at which the Bill may be passed or rejected. One could not get a much more generalised description of what most democratic legislatures go through when they are trying to get a Bill through. Of course, it does not mean that the detail of how then to proceed is in any way curtailed by what is in this Bill. Everyone has their own way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-18_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, immediately saw Westminster and another place in the way that we have done that. But these are very generalised principles. It is very difficult to work out other ways that one could get a Bill through.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-18_spnew5"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I am sorry to interrupt the noble Baroness in what she is saying. But she did refer to three stages? Would the Scottish parliament be able to make its procedure enter four stages if it so wished?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-19_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   Yes. I thank the noble Earl for making that point. If I said "stages" that certainly was an error; I did not mean stages, I meant <P>


<a name="column_1404"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1404</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>three points. I will not go through the points again as I have already stated them. It does not mean that consideration of, and an opportunity to vote on, the details of the Bill needs to be at one stage. There could be as many stages as the Scottish parliament wanted to make it. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the parliament from considering a Bill in draft form--before it was introduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, said that he has been told that there are many variations on a theme. That is true. These principles are very generalised and very basic; and on that basic theme the Scottish parliament could produce any variation it wanted. All could be possible within the framework we have laid down. Working procedures for the parliament may well be different from those of this and another place. Personally, I rather believe that they will be. They may or may not be. That is for the Scottish parliament to decide.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para1"></a>We should not assume that Bills will be developed and introduced exactly as they are at Westminster. Ultimately, it will be for the parliament to decide on its own procedures, including arrangements for the scrutiny of legislation. These will be governed by its standing orders.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para2"></a>We have recognised that it would be unrealistic to expect the parliament to be in a position to put in place standing orders on day one of its operation. That is why my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Scotland established the all-party consultative steering group which has been mentioned. This group is chaired by my honourable friend Mr. Henry McLeish. This group will prepare a draft report recommending what the standing orders should cover. It is expected to report by the end of the year. Initial standing orders will be included in a transitional order to be made by the Secretary of State in good time to be in place from the outset. I remember giving an identical answer earlier in the Committee stage to the noble Lord, Lord Selkirk of Douglas, who is not in his place at the moment. It will then be for the parliament to develop and adapt the standing orders in due course, as it sees fit.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para3"></a>The consultative steering group has already begun to consider how the legislative process might be handled by the Scottish parliament. It is very likely to recommend a vigorous pre-legislative process so that proposals for legislation which come before the parliament have been subject to rigorous scrutiny and participation and that the effects of the proposed legislation have been well considered. The group is looking at the form in which legislation might be required to be presented and at the details of the various stages of scrutiny which the Bill should undergo in the parliament. The results of the group's consideration will inform the parliament's eventual decisions on the legislative process. I am sure that the parliament will want to establish a system of legislating which will deliver well thought out, quality legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para4"></a>I can assure the noble Earl, Lord Balfour, that there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the parliament from including in its standing orders appropriate opportunity for detailed consideration of a Bill. For example, it <P>


<a name="column_1405"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1405</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could even include a Report stage in our terms if it considers that necessary. Personally, I would agree that there are advantages in allowing a second stage for dealing with the detail of a Bill, if only to allow the proposers of the Bill to respond to points raised in earlier debates. However, I believe that we should leave it to the parliament to decide about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para5"></a>The amendment would impose a very detailed and time-consuming process on the parliament which I think we should hesitate to impose. There are certainly interesting elements in the proposal and I agree that consultation with outside bodies will be a necessary feature of the parliament's work. However, I repeat yet again that we should leave it to the parliament to decide precisely how to do that. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   The noble Baroness has told us that the consultative steering committee will probably report at about the end of the year. What we do not know is whether its recommendations will have to be accepted by the Scottish parliament, quite apart from the fact that we do not know what its recommendations are going to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para6"></a>In scrutinising the Bill we have a duty to do all we can to make sure that legislation passed by the parliament which this Bill brings into being will receive thorough and adequate scrutiny. That is our duty to the people of Scotland.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   As the noble Lady said, the group will prepare a draft report recommending what the standing orders should cover. It is expected to report by the end of the year. The initial standing orders will be included in a transitional order to be made by the Secretary of State in good time to be in place from the outset. But it will then be for the parliament to develop and adapt those in due course as it sees fit. It will be for the Scottish parliament then to deal with the standing orders.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   I am baffled as to why we are discussing this matter. Perhaps I may refer back to what Mr. Henry McLeish said in another place and continue the quotation which my noble friend read. He said:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is useful to stress the work that is being done by the consultative steering group, which involves representatives of all parties, who are all making an excellent contribution.

When I read Clause 34, I had the impression that the clause will give the parliament only one chance to amend a Bill. I am glad to have that impression corrected, but that is how I read the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   We have had an interesting debate on the amendment. I am grateful to noble Lords who have spoken and those who supported my idea. The noble Lord, Lord Mackie, liked it but would not accept it. Perhaps I may say this to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. My stages one and two could easily be achieved on the basis of a draft Bill. I think that that would be a good idea. But as my noble friends Lord Balfour and Lady Carnegy said, it is important that we have proper scrutiny of legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para9"></a>The Minister spent half her time watering down Clause 34 and the other half trying to tell me that it did not mean what I think it means. I noted she said that Clause 34 does not go through three stages; it makes points. With all due respect, it does not make points. Clause 34(1)(c) states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Standing orders shall include provision for a final stage at which a Bill can be passed or rejected". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para10"></a>That implies that Clause 34(1)(a) and (b) were also stages.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para11"></a>We have three stages in place of the six stages in this Parliament. There is no getting away from that simple fact. It cannot be said that what is provided here is a minimum, generalised approach. It is in the legislation. If the Scottish parliament did not have standing orders which included those three things and someone were aggrieved, it could possibly find itself in court.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para12"></a>But the most ridiculous factor is this. It is not for us to prescribe working practices. While I shall withdraw my amendment, will the Government withdraw their prescription of what working practices should be? They are hoist with their own petard. If I am at fault because I am prescribing working practices, I should have thought that the Government were at fault. Clause 34 need only provide that, "Standing orders shall include provisions for the procedures to be followed for the passage of a Bill". We can then allow the consultative steering group to put forward its proposals and, after the parliament starts, it can amend them as it sees fit.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-19_para13"></a>I have found the debate unsatisfactory. I am glad that I started it off because I hope that the Government, the people on the steering committee, and those who will be in the new parliament are at least listening to the point we are making: that in a unicameral parliament it would be a mistake--I think a serious mistake--to reflect, as does Clause 34(1), the procedures of the House of Commons, which has this House to back up and revise its legislation, and to give outside bodies a second bite at the cherry of campaigning and lobbying against a piece of legislation.

It is the Bills of political controversy that most need good scrutiny and good provision.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para0"></a>However, as I indicated, for the moment I beg leave to withdraw the amendment, but I hope that the Government will reflect on their argument and will consider withdrawing Clause 34.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   rose to move, That this House approve the Government's assessment as set out in the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report 1998 and Comprehensive Spending Review for the purposes of Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-20_spnew3"></A><B> The noble Lord said: My </B>   Lords, this debate is being held to satisfy Section 5 of the Maastricht Act. Parliament has to approve the government reports on economic policy that contain the information that is sent to the Commission or the Council for the purposes of Articles 103 and 104c of the Maastricht Treaty. The Act requires that Parliament approves an assessment of the medium-term economic and budgetary positions, including public investment expenditure as well as social, economic and environmental goals. These are the aspects of the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report and the Comprehensive Spending Review upon which I will focus.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para12"></a>This will be the second Section 5 debate this year. After the Financial Statement and Budget Report was published, a Section 5 debate was held in the House of Lords so that we could send the information in the Budget to the Commission. However, the public finance projections are now out of date. The Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report and the Comprehensive Spending Review are a major statement on fiscal policy, setting out the Government's latest fiscal projections based on new spending plans. It is appropriate that these form the basis of submissions to the Council and the Commission. We must have Parliament's approval before we send information taken from these documents to fulfil our obligations under Articles 103 and 104c, the broad economic guidelines and excessive deficit procedure respectively.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para13"></a>The Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report outlined a new regime in public spending control and the Comprehensive Spending Review set out new priorities for public spending and investment. This strategy combines prudent and stable public finances with investment and reform in public services.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para14"></a>The Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report also helps to pave the way for the introduction of resource accounting and budgeting, which represents a landmark change in the <P>


<a name="column_1410"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1410</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>way that the Government undertake financial planning and reporting. The first set of resource accounts are on track to be published in 1999-2000. These will be accruals-based accounts similar to those prepared for private sector companies but with two additional features--a statement showing use of resources approved by Parliament, and a statement analysing spending by objective.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para15"></a>Resource accounting and budgeting will underpin the Government's golden rule by making a clear structural distinction between current and capital spending, which will no longer be treated as though they are equivalent economic categories. It will also lead to improvements in the efficiency of public spending and underpin the drive towards better stewardship of public assets so that they are used as productively as possible. Thus RAB is integral to the strategy of investment, reform and modernisation that underpins the Comprehensive Spending Review.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para16"></a>Within a stable fiscal and macroeconomic framework, the Government can fulfil their objectives of promoting growth and employment, enhancing opportunity and fairness, tackling social exclusion and providing an efficient and modern public sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para17"></a>The EFSR shows that public sector net borrowing is expected to fall from 1 per cent. of GDP in 1997-98 to zero in 2000-01 and net debt is projected to decline to below 40 per cent. of GDP over the Parliament. Nonetheless, net public sector investment is projected to rise from less than 1 per cent. of GDP in 1997-98 to stabilise at around 1&#189; per cent. of GDP per annum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para18"></a>This public investment will allow the renewal and modernisation of the United Kingdom's infrastructure and public services by increasing the level of public investment within the fiscal rules. It will be used in the most cost-effective way, with departments having to set out in detail how the resources will deliver the Government's objectives, provide the best value for money, and ensure positive social returns.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para19"></a>The CSR and EFSR, especially the increase in public investment, show how the Government will tackle their social objectives. This investment will help the Government fulfil their manifesto commitment of reducing class sizes to 30 or less for children between five and seven. The past under-investment in council housing will be alleviated by extra investment of &#163;3.6 billion.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para20"></a>In the year of its 50th birthday, the NHS is being allocated an extra &#163;21 billion over the next three years. Spending in England will increase by an average 4.7 per cent. in real terms over this period. This will provide real improvements in services, including a reduction of 100,000 in the waiting list that we inherited.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para21"></a>The CSR will help us meet our environmental objectives. A doubling of resources for the revised home energy efficiency scheme, and an increase of 300 per cent. of resources for local authority public transport to tackle car congestion and pollution will help us to meet our legal obligations under the Kyoto Protocol to cut UK emissions of greenhouse gases by 12&#189; per cent. on 1990 levels by 2010.
<P>


<a name="column_1411"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1411</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para22"></a>Sending details about our economic policies set out in the EFSR and CSR to the Commission and the Council is not merely an obligation under the Maastricht Treaty. The Government are committed to the sharing of information. And we support this type of multilateral surveillance in different organisations such as the IMF and OECD.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para23"></a>Sharing information will help to promote the adoption of sound economic policies throughout the Community. Only if we play our full part in these discussions can we influence the way Europe solves its economic problems which will be particularly important at the launch of the single currency.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para24"></a>Our achievements during our presidency show what can be done by working closely with the other member states of the European Union. We have established a new European way for economic reform, examining how to improve labour markets, product markets and capital markets. We have begun to address the reforms necessary for successful enlargement to the east. In our presidency the single currency was successfully launched.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para25"></a>As your Lordships know, the Government have decided not to participate in the single currency at its launch in 1999. However, we want the single currency to be successful as we will be affected whether we participate or not. Most of our trade is with the EU, and our economic future is bound up with Europe. Sharing information will help ensure that the single currency is a success.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para26"></a>Approving this Motion will enable the UK to meet our treaty obligations, to provide information and to participate fully in the important process of multilateral surveillance and economic co-operation as provided for in Article 103 and 104c of the treaty. I hope that the House will support the Motion. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para27"></a>Moved, That this House approve the Government's assessment as set out in the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report 1998 and Comprehensive Spending Review for the purposes of Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993.--(Lord McIntosh of Haringey.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-20_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Dartmouth: </B>   My Lords, first, I should declare an interest to the House. I have the honour to be standing for my party in my home area of Yorkshire in the Euro elections next year. Of course, I doubt whether the electors have as strong an interest in the Government's assessment as set out in the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report 1998 and Comprehensive Spending Review for the purposes of Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act as I have. However, as the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, has ably demonstrated, this seemingly innocuous proposal addresses some of the key issues which face our country in the years to come: namely, the Maastricht criteria; our adherence to the criteria; cycle convergence; and the possibility of our entry into the euro. These are issues of great importance for the House, for the electors of Yorkshire as well as elsewhere, and I crave the indulgence of the House to address them for a few minutes.
<P>


<a name="column_1412"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1412</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para28"></a>I should like to start from the proposition that it is a very tall order for a central bank to achieve the correct interest rate, however correctness is defined, for 11 countries with 11 differing economies. By way of illustration, Mr. Eddie George and his very able advisers at the Bank of England find it hard enough to come up with the right interest rate for only this economy in this country. Perhaps I may give your Lordships a further illustration. The reality is that the current level of interest rates in Britain is probably about right for, let us say, the housing market in SW1. But arguably--and I believe it--interest rates are much too high from the point of view of manufacturing industry in the North West, the Midlands and in Yorkshire.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para29"></a>The 11 countries joining the euro on day one have set themselves a massive task. I should like to make it clear--and in so doing I echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh--that we wish them well. We want the euro to work. It is in our national interest that the euro should work. However, confidence in the eventual success of the euro is hardly helped when one observes the way in which the politicians of continental Europe have systematically evaded treaty obligations and the Maastricht criteria have been comprehensively fudged as the British president stood by. That is why the fact of this submission to the European Communities has an almost Salvador Dali surrealist quality.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para30"></a>I wish to make the important point, which is hardly ever made, that the British economy is different both in cycle and in structure from the continental economies. It is different in cycle precisely because it is different in structure. I do not wish to impose too much on your Lordships' patience, but perhaps I may give four lightning examples of how our economy differs in structure from the continental economies. We have a bigger services sector; we have a much bigger financial services sector; we have a housing market financed almost entirely by variable mortgages as opposed to fixed-rate mortgages; and we are an oil exporter while continental Europe is not. I could continue. Our economy significantly mirrors the economic cycle of the United States. If one had to choose a country for Britain's economic cycle to mirror, the objective choice would have to be the world's largest, most dynamic, most job-generative economy; that of the United States.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para31"></a>Furthermore, the current exchange rate of the pound and our interest rates, to which I alluded earlier, are much more aligned with the dollar and interest rates in the United States than with the deutschmark and the current level of interest rates in continental Europe. How bizarre, therefore, that so many of the political establishment regard it as a desirable aim in itself, needing no logical justification, for Britain's economy to converge with the stagnant, high-employment economies of continental Europe. The material problem facing the 11 countries entering the euro in phase one is not the number of currencies but the number of unemployed. That is very largely because of high taxes, high costs and unnecessary regulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-20_para32"></a>My final and most substantive point is that in the Thatcher/Major years, Britain painfully restructured and began to become competitive in the world economy. Until and unless the 11 follow that example, whatever <P>


<a name="column_1413"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1413</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the convergence may appear to be and whatever this government assessment may purport to give, it will be folly for this country to enter the euro.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80728-21_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Earl sits down, since he pointed in my direction at some point in his speech, perhaps he will answer a small question. When he talks about continental Europe, does he exclude Eire from membership of the European Union or does he look both ways?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-21_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Dartmouth: </B>   My Lords, I should be delighted to answer a very large question from the noble Baroness, not just a little question, which she asks with her customary charm. I am conscious of imposing on the good will of the House. I could have listed all 11 countries, 10 of which are in continental Europe and one of which is not. Continental Europe is simply a shorthand term for all 11 countries. But on another occasion, if the noble Baroness is in the Chamber, I shall enumerate all 11 countries, mentioning Eire first.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Alli: </B>   My Lords, I rise during the dinner hour to make my maiden speech on the Motion standing in the name of my noble friend Lord McIntosh about the Government's Economic and Fiscal Report and their Comprehensive Spending Review. I shall speak in support of the Government's actions in respect of those matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para0"></a>I was offered two main observations about your Lordships' House before being introduced last Tuesday. The first was that your Lordships' House is a friendly and extremely courteous place. I am pleased to say that I have found that to be so. The second observation was that your Lordships' House is a quiet place. Since I was introduced, it has certainly not been that. We have debated the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Bill, the National Minimum Wage Bill, the Scotland Bill and the Commons amendments to the Crime and Disorder Bill, which contained at least one issue of great interest to the press. I do not complain; I feel honoured.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para1"></a>As many of your Lordships will know, I cut my teeth in business. I run a large media company which I founded with two partners several years ago. I welcome the Government's stated economic objectives of,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"high and stable levels of growth and employment, and sustainable public services, built from a platform of long term stability". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para2"></a>As a businessman and company director, I can say that a stable economic environment helps long-term planning and avoids short-term decision-making. I strongly endorse the measures which the Government have outlined towards achieving those objectives, some of which have already been implemented, particularly as many of those measures have been standard practice in business for many years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para3"></a>As your Lordships know, the process of reform outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer took place through a two-stage process. I should like to pay particular tribute to the Chancellor for his achievements in relation to those reforms and both his Budgets.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para4"></a>First was the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report, which was published on 11th June. That report set out the Government's four main objectives for fiscal and monetary reform: first, prudence and responsibility and the golden rule that over the cycle, current spending will be covered by revenues--for all business, that is an essential principle and for the business of government it is a good principle that is well heeded; secondly, redefining the role of government through spending priorities so that, where the Government should act, they do so vigorously and, where government interventions are unnecessary or restricted, they do not act at all; thirdly, not taking a dogmatic or ideological stance on publicly-owned assets but applying a new test to meet the public interest; and finally, investing for reform by linking departmental spending to the Government's modernisation and reform programme.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para5"></a>The report outlined also the underlying principles which underpin the Comprehensive Spending Review; namely, breaking the short-termist climate. Short-term decisions made by government or in a board room lead inevitably to long-term problems. I welcome the abolition of the annual spending round and its replacement with departmental plans and fixed budgets for three years. I welcome also the division between revenue and capital budgets, which for many companies has been standard practice for many years. I welcome also the promotion of new public/private partnerships to pay for the Government's investment programme. There are many people in the private sector who can help the Government to achieve their objectives while furthering their own commercial aims.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para6"></a>I welcome also the review's commitment to promoting opportunity and fairness and to providing efficient and modern public services. I also welcome the announcement of a substantial investment programme for our public services--&#163;19 billion for education. Before the general election, the Prime Minister made clear that his top priority was education. As a board member of the Teacher Training Agency, the government organisation responsible for the recruitment and retention of teachers, I welcome the Government's commitment to education. Investment in education is not only an investment in our young people; it is an investment in the future of us all. Our young are our future. However, I accept that education is not only for the young.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para7"></a>Another area which I am particularly keen to highlight is investment in the arts, media and sport. I am also a member of the Government's Creative Industry Task Force. I welcome the extra &#163;290 million announced last Friday by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. I pay particular tribute to the Secretary of State for securing that investment when so many before him have failed. All that extra investment in our public services is to be welcomed. The Government are to be congratulated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para8"></a>Since this is my first opportunity to comment on the Government's economic policy, I should like, with the indulgence of your Lordships, to comment on one other reform. I welcome most strongly the Government's decision on independence for the Bank of England. Given that one's maiden speech is not supposed to be <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>controversial, I think it particularly appropriate to mention independence for the Bank of England since that courageous decision took the politics out of monetary policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para9"></a>To conclude, I strongly support the Motion, for the reasons that I have outlined. I am gratified to have made my maiden speech. I can now get on with the job that I was appointed here to do. No, that is not to vote in the Lobby which the Government Chief Whip tells me to, although I shall certainly expect to, but my job is to call to account the executive, to scrutinise legislation and to contribute to the very high standard of debate in your Lordships' House.

<A NAME="80728-21_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, it falls to me to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Alli, which I do most warmly. It was an excellent contribution. I can think of scarcely anything in it with which I disagree. That means that it must pass the standard test of non-controversiality, although one must always read the small print nowadays to work out exactly what is controversial. That is not the same as it used to be. The noble Lord speaks with great authority on these matters. He will be a huge asset to our debates. As he rightly said, the issues that we are discussing this evening in the two government documents--the Economic and Fiscal Report and the Comprehensive Spending Review--are matters which have been common practice in business almost forever. Some of us have been campaigning over many decades to see those perfectly sensible ideas incorporated, so far as possible, in the vastly more complex area of government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para10"></a>Therefore, I repeat my sincere congratulations to the noble Lord. What I say to him is not just the natural form of words, although, as he will discover, everyone is quite uncannily polite to each other in this place most of the time. He has spoken a lot of excellent good sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para11"></a>I cannot resist commenting that it is a little odd that we should find ourselves debating such gigantic strategic issues in the dinner hour and not in "prime time", as in the world of television scheduling. I do not quite understand why. However, it is one of the features and consequences of the Maastricht Treaty that the Government have to gain the approval of both Houses for these proposals. I suppose that that is a small mercy and one of the better outcomes of the much-criticised and, in my view, deeply flawed Maastricht Treaty. It is very hard to cover these colossal issues in a few minutes. My remarks will be directed mainly to the technicalities of trying to lock in public spending for some years ahead and create what is called "a platform of stability", a "tough new regime", or all the other nice phrases with which one could not disagree. Indeed, they are like motherhood: they are excellent aspirations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para12"></a>However, having said all that, I must strike a critical note. If one examines all the statements in the two documents, while the aspirations are excellent there is, in my book, a slightly old-fashioned tone about the whole approach and some signs of inexperience or, shall we say, total unawareness of what has happened in the past. This is not the first time that government have <P>


<a name="column_1416"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1416</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>attempted to cover this ground and produce such solutions to meet the ambitions which businessmen share by trying to bring more certainty into an uncertain world.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para13"></a>The first criticism that I have to make is that extrapolating from the recent past is at the best of times a dangerous business, as indeed is assuming that things will always go on in the future as they have in the past. We must think of our economy operating in a global and not just a European context. It is operating under global forces which are very complex and very volatile. One can safely say, with no more controversy than that contained in the excellent maiden speech that we have just heard, that there never was a more dangerous time to assume that what went on before will go neatly on in a straight line into the future. It is never more likely that one will draw the wrong conclusions than if one attempts that sort of extrapolation and concludes that, because the economy has grown at such a rate during the past two or three years, it will carry on in exactly the same way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para14"></a>The general argument against that kind of approach and that kind of economic modelling is now very strong and it arises from the globalisation of the economy. The predictability that economists used to need to make those models and make such assumptions and projections is just not there any more. Indeed, not even a market can absorb the vast complexity and quantity of information in the global economy in order to make safe judgments. Certainly planners in a national economy cannot do so. That really explains why no models are safe and why public interest in all this modelling--for example, the Swedish, the Japanese, the German, the French and all the Anglo-Saxon models--has declined and the credibility of economists (of whom I used to be one) has also slid down to zero. Economists are really not able to make sense of these conditions in the global economy. People sense that, when they try to predict such outcomes for even a few years ahead, they are not really on very sound ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para15"></a>That is one reason why I would question whether this is the right time to start locking in public expenditure plans for three years ahead as a government, however much businessmen may want it and however sensible it may sound. My second reason is more immediate; namely, the Asian turmoil. I know that there is a fashion for saying that it is all right here in Western Europe and in the transatlantic area--in other words: "We are all right as regards the Asian turmoil. After all, we don't export very much to Asia when all is said and done and, anyway, they are getting themselves straight again". That is a total and complete underestimate of what is happening in both the South-East Asian economies and on the Pacific Rim.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para16"></a>I have tried not to bore the House, but I did suggest to your Lordships some months ago--in fact, well before Christmas--that the Asian turmoil had only just begun; that it would get worse and would last for many years. I believe that more strongly today. Indeed, we are just about to enter a new and more horrific round of instability in the Asian economies which will have a far greater effect on the Western economies and on the British economy than mere export or import figures may <P>


<a name="column_1417"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1417</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>suggest. The yen will go down; the Chinese bubble which, in a way, is as bad as the Japanese bubble, will burst. The Chinese economy will get into increasing difficulties and be dragged down. There will be political difficulties there, which I believe will undermine the Hong Kong situation. All the economies struggling to get off the floor, without success at the moment--like Malaysia and Indonesia, which is on the verge of civil collapse--will fall back into the quagmire out of which they have been trying to struggle.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para17"></a>Those developments will have colossal effects on our GDP projections; indeed, much greater than people realise. It will not only be a question of no export markets because they are already shrinking, as the poor Chinese are finding as their markets wither away; at the same time, there will be a considerable amount of cheaper imports coming in from Asia, although there is a constraint, in that many of the excellent, competitive Asian firms cannot get export finance or working capital at present. However, that may change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-21_para18"></a>The flow of capital and the savings coming in from Asia will wither, as has already begun to happen. However, more than that, investment and growth are about confidence and the sort of psychology of the promise and possibilities ahead. The Eastern promise has evaporated. The whole glittering hope of the past 10 years of growth and investment--in other words, the hope that, at the end of the corridor, even if it had risks, there was this shining area of the new Asia which could produce colossal returns for the more adventurous and those not too averse to risk-taking has gone. I give way to the noble Lord.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80728-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that what goes down must come up?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   Yes, my Lords, but when? We are talking about timing and about a situation in which the Government of this country have tried in response to perfectly legitimate business interests--the kind that we have just heard about--to plan three years ahead. Let us suppose that what goes down comes up in 10 years. Let us suppose that what went down in Japan in 1989, and has not yet begun to come up eight years later, has another six years to go. I believe that timing is everything. Those are some of the reasons why I believe that the three-year plan is well meaning but full of dangers. It may be simple in business, but it is very complicated in government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para0"></a>In this short debate I have only one other point to make about the dangers of extrapolation and in support of my, I hope not too dismissive, comment about the slightly old-fashioned nature of the documentation. The claim in the documents is that new forms of performance control are to be installed to ensure that, even if the world remains uncertain, public expenditure plans will somehow remain on the railway tracks. A great deal is made of the fact that this is a tremendous break with the past--a tough new regime--and that it has never been tried before. Indeed, I believe that it actually says somewhere in one of the documents that nothing like this has happened since 1961. I find the <P>


<a name="column_1418"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1418</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>latter worrying because it is not true. It has obviously been written by people who either have very short memories or who are perhaps rather young. There is no criticism of that, except that, if you are not fully informed about the past because you did not live through it, it sometimes pays to read the history books.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para1"></a>All this has been tried before. In 1970, the government of the day learned from the American programming, planning and budgeting systems (PPBS) and decided to instal throughout Whitehall a gigantic system of programme analysis and review with precisely the intention of forward planning expenditures in the spending departments so as to remove some of the uncertainties. The same problems that damaged that cause then, and eventually undermined it, are still extant today. I hope that those who are carrying out this planing and devising these new ideas in the Treasury here in London are at least aware of some of the snags. However, I must say that the document shows little sign of awareness that they are treading a very dangerous path and one full of traps.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para2"></a>When we installed programme analysis and review in the early 1970s, which was intended to deliver performance in return for expenditure allocations by the Treasury and to secure analysis by outputs rather than inputs--in other words what we were trying to achieve rather than the resources needed to achieve it; for example, not how many paperclips you had been using but how many were needed and why they were needed at all--we did so with very high hopes. We were full of good intentions; but the project failed. Why did it fail? It failed because it became absolutely impossible in the political milieu, unlike the business milieu, to analyse how to define the outputs. Was an output really just a question of how many more houses were built or how many more miles of road were built? Or was an output some political achievement, some gain in the political and social sphere? Such gains are legitimate for governments and yet cannot be measured as outputs as businessmen would. We rapidly got into a quagmire of disputes in those days on how you define the outputs and whether they are just managerial or political as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para3"></a>The second difficulty we ran into--and these papers run straight into it again--was that of defining what is capital and what is current spending. A great deal is made in these papers of the golden rule. It is proclaimed as a gigantic new insight, something that has sprung up from the brow of some Treasury guru or even from the Chancellor himself.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para4"></a>We have all been thinking about the golden rule for four decades. Everyone has been saying, "Why can't the Government somehow define capital and current spending, just cover the capital spending with borrowing and never borrow for current spending?" That sounds simple common sense to a businessman. However, I have to say to your Lordships that in the government sphere every aspect of that proposition is under constant and continuous dispute. No one will ever agree on what are the capital spending items and what is current spending. Is capital spending that goes wrong and does not produce a return, current or is it capital? Nobody knows.
<P>


<a name="column_1419"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1419</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para5"></a>The situation has been made worse by the attractive device--but it is pure "spin doctoring"--of calling all spending investment, or nearly all public spending, investment. Of course it is not; a great deal of it is consumption. Nobody has ever managed to establish whether even issues like building hospitals or army barracks are capital spending and investment, or current spending. That debate will go on and will drive a coach and horses straight through this golden rule which is paraded as such a virtue. That is really all I wish to say.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para6"></a>I leave aside the other points that have been made in another place and are fair game. So far, the hope that one could reduce part of the welfare budget to pay for other excellent things such as education does not seem to have worked too well. The Minister concerned seems to have walked out on the whole project, which is a pity.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para7"></a>I leave aside the reflection that the public sector unions, once they see that there is talk about locking in and money certainly coming, will say, "Let's have substantial wage increases to overcome the disparities with other earnings in the private sector". I am quite sure that we shall see enormous erosion of the benefits of this public spending--even if it can be sustained and even if the GDP projections are right--by union pressures.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para8"></a>The real hazard is that we are now at the classic point of the trade cycle where deterioration begins. It is perfectly normal that it should, and the economy will slow and probably shrink over the next two years. That is even if we did not have the Asian turmoil, which, to my mind, will make it certain. The trade cycle is deteriorating, revenues will be lower than the estimates in these books and public spending will be higher. That is what happens when the economy slows down. It is not just a question of the revenues falling away; all the social expenditures increase, so the gap widens at a geometric pace. The platform of stability which we all hope for, and which the noble Lord as a businessman of authority has just spoken about, will turn out to be a platform made of quivering jelly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para9"></a>I believe that if the Chancellor and some of his advisers had the kind of business experience of the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and others, they would realise that it is not that simple. Although these are good aspirations, it is dangerous to raise hopes too high for things that cannot in practice be achieved.

Many of the issues which might otherwise have been appropriate to comment on in relation to the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report or the other major public expenditure strategy reviews are perhaps more appropriately made tomorrow when the House will have the opportunity of debating the Finance Bill, rather unusually, I understand, on a Wednesday. For the last three years, at least, it has been on a Friday. So I hope the House will understand if I do not go into any great detail.

<A NAME = "80728-22_para10"></a>I should like, first of all, to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Alli. We shall look forward with great interest to his expert comments on various aspects, particularly of the micro-economic situation, in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para11"></a>I hope my noble friends will forgive me if I do not comment on either of their extremely cogent and knowledgeable speeches. I should like to put a couple of simple questions to the Minister, who rightly pointed out that this matter is before the House in relation to the commitments under the Maastricht Treaty and in particular to Articles 103 and 104.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para12"></a>The object of the exercise is, in effect, to reassure our Community partners that all is well in the British economy, in particular with regard to public borrowing. In that context, it seems to me to be appropriate that one should consider carefully what is in the figures and particularly, perhaps, to enclose with the covering letter, which presumably is written with these documents, a health warning.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para13"></a>I had occasion on 14th July to ask the noble Lord who is due to reply to this debate whether or not the extraordinary use of the so-called "accounting adjustment" had the approval of the Office for National Statistics. He said that its views had been taken into account. However, my understanding is that it does not approve of the way in which something like &#163;5 billion of expenditure on social security--in particular the working families tax credit--suddenly disappears into a black hole of the accounting adjustment. In total, I think that something like &#163;15 billion is disappearing into it. That is not merely a margin of error; that is really quite important.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para14"></a>Can we have an assurance that if it is indeed the case that the Office for National Statistics does not like the way the figures are presented, at least our European Community colleagues will have that drawn to their attention?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para15"></a>The other relevant point is that the documents seek to assure our community partners and other members of the European Union that the level of borrowing, and so on, is appropriate and not something about which we should be concerned. The Minister provided a particular set of statistics. But he also said that we are debating these matters this evening--they have been debated once before--because the figures have been overtaken by events; the figures are out of date. He can certainly say that again. There has been a very significant change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para16"></a>At the time when the figures were last produced we were told in the Budget Red Book, for example, that there would be a budget surplus over the period covered by the Red Book. Is it not the case that this is no longer so? If that is so, surely the Chancellor, at least, ought not to be satisfied with the way in which the public finances are going.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para17"></a>Secondly, we were told at that time--and presumably that is what the House debated in that context--about a reduction in national debt. My understanding is that, again, that will not be the case. The figures, as the Minister has rightly said, are out of date. Thirdly, we were told that there would be a reduction in the percentage of national income taken by the state.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para18"></a>I understand that in many ways the figures which the Minister quoted may well give our friends elsewhere in Europe a feeling that all is well. But surely it cannot be the case that the Chancellor is as happy with the situation now as he was at the time when the House last debated the matter. That is surely a matter of considerable concern.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para19"></a>I hope therefore that on each of these two points which I have made we can have a response from the Minister. I shall certainly look forward to going into the matter in greater detail tomorrow, should I have the opportunity.

<A NAME="80728-22_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Alli, on his excellent maiden speech. I know that in only 10 days in this House he has had the opportunity of seeing it at its worst, at its least generous. But I am pleased that he has also experienced its more customary generosity of spirit. I have to say that when his appointment was announced I felt a slight twinge of jealousy. I believe that until he was appointed I was the youngest Life Peer in your Lordships' House. I rather enjoyed this completely meritless distinction. However, I have enjoyed it only for a few months. We on these Benches warmly welcome the noble Lord to our debates and look forward to hearing him speak regularly in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para20"></a>The debate this evening is really about the medium-term prospects for the British economy. In our view the Government have quite rightly placed great importance on moving from the boom and bust approach towards a more stable and sustainable economic environment. The Government have undertaken a range of measures which have moved us in that direction. I refer to the operational independence of the Bank of England, the institution of the golden rule and the sustainable investment rule, and the code of fiscal stability. All these measures are welcome, as indeed is the Government's more positive attitude towards Britain's EU membership.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para21"></a>However, we believe there are two areas where more needs to be done. The first relates to environmental goals in relation to sustainable growth, which is still very much in the embryonic process. The documents that we are discussing tonight refer to the ongoing work to produce environmental accounts and indicators and to produce a sustainable development strategy before the end of the year. In our view such a strategy is long overdue. I agree with the conclusion of the Commons Environmental Audit Committee that, reviewing the Government's leadership as a whole, there appears to be some failure to grasp the overarching nature of sustainable development and apply it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para22"></a>The value of such a strategy is that it will not only give us a much better assessment than the current accounting conventions of the environmental sustainability of economic performance, but it will also help decide on medium-term taxation priorities. We on these Benches have for some time advocated shifting the balance of taxation towards environmental "bads" and <P>


<a name="column_1422"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>away from employment. Having a more credible set of environmental indicators will assist in this process. I welcome anything that the Minister can say about the likely timing of the publication of that sustainable development strategy.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-22_para23"></a>The second area where we believe further action is needed relates to the exchange rate and EMU membership. It will come as no surprise to the House to learn that. After inflation the one variable which has caused British governments most grief in the past 30 years is the exchange rate. It continues to do so today. Since the equivalent debate last year, the large majority of our EU partners have committed themselves to joining EMU at the outset for the stability it will bring in the exchange rate with their principal trading partners. We, along with all our EU trading partners, trade about 60 per cent. of our goods intra-Community. There may be differences but that single vital fact remains at the heart of our trading position. This is of crucial importance in looking to our medium-term prosperity.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80728-23_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Dartmouth: </B>   My Lords, I submit that the fact of greater importance is that our cycle mirrors that of the United States and not the continental economies. I suggest that the noble Lord might address that point.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, in looking at the progress of economic variables over any time period, rather too much is often made of the past than of what is desirable in the future, or indeed what is likely to happen in the future. If one had said to the noble Earl last year that there would be so many EU member states joining the single currency at the outset, I am almost certain he would have said that was impossible. If he had looked at the debt ratios of member states and their inflation performance, I think he would have said that the likelihood of 11 being able to get within a mile of joining was negligible. However, economies change. The nature of our trade has changed fundamentally since we joined the EU. Simply to project forward from the past is a misleading approach to economic analysis.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-23_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Dartmouth: </B>   My Lords, I bring to the noble Lord's attention the fact that the whole point about the debt ratios is that they were systematically fudged.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-23_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, it is common practice in this country that when another EU member state does something which one did not expect it to do, but which is in itself desirable, instead of saying, "There is joy in the sinner that repenteth", one may say that he has not repented at all and he is really on the bottle behind the arras. The assumption that all this is fudged is, in my view, a gross exaggeration.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-23_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that the markets have judged that, whatever the fudging, they value the debt in such a way that there is a convergence in the bond yields across the 11 countries? That is a true test of convergence.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-23_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. I agree with his comments. I think that what the <P>


<a name="column_1423"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1423</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>markets are doing is judging the extent to which those governments who have made those strides--which, fudge or not, have been extremely painful in some cases--have shown a commitment to the kind of fiscal rectitude which underpins the Maastricht agreement. The markets are judging that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para0"></a>I return to the position in the United Kingdom. I think that, given the uncertainty with which the Government are approaching this issue, it is hardly surprising that many firms in the United Kingdom are still unprepared for EMU. Whatever happens with regard to current policy, we shall not join for at least four to five years. We obviously welcome attempts by the Government to disseminate information about the euro, but we hope that when we have this debate again in a year's time the Government will have made real progress in telling us how they intend to move from the current unsatisfactory position towards a clear process and timetable of entry.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para1"></a>I have talked about two areas where I believe that more action is needed on the part of the Government. However, the one area of major uncertainty which in a sense hangs over all our economic debates is whether the Government will hit their targets on inflation and borrowing. The Chancellor is gambling that the level of inflation will hit his target, even though for the first two years of this Government it will clearly overshoot that target. Of course higher inflation would wipe out much of the big increases promised by the Chancellor in real terms for health and education and leave the Government with a record on public services which will be significantly worse than that of the previous government, and certainly will not correspond with the impression that the Chancellor tried to portray last week.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para2"></a>Borrowing depends crucially on growth rates which, according to the Government's projections, already look decidedly optimistic. By setting firm spending plans for the next three financial years, which in reality takes us to March 2002--a long way ahead on any view--the Government are committing themselves far into the economic future. The degree of uncertainty in forecasting is acknowledged in the Government's own economic and fiscal strategy report which states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"over the past 10 years, the average absolute error for year ahead forecasts of the PSBR was 0.9 per cent. of GDP. Forecasts further ahead were considerably less accurate". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para3"></a>The report argues that by adopting a prudent approach in relation to the golden rule and the level of public debt, such errors should not accumulate to the point where they constitute a threat to the fiscal position. I hope very much that the Treasury is right. But even within a matter of weeks of the production of the report, the projections are already looking rather shaky. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research suggested last week, for example, that a fall in profits and slower than predicted economic growth could lead to a deficit on the current balance which would drive a coach and horses through the golden rule. Research undertaken by the House of Commons' Library for my colleagues in another place also shows the vulnerability of the Government's plans to the economic cycle. A <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>slowdown in the economy of the scale of the early 1990s, for example, would send public borrowing back to the &#163;50 billion per year level.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para4"></a>No one should take any pleasure from such gloomy forecasts. We certainly hope that they do not become a reality. We do, however, believe that the Chancellor has made life unnecessarily difficult for himself by failing to tighten fiscal policy on the consumer last year, by having a negligible contingency reserve--much lower than his predecessors--and by ruling out as a matter of principle any possibility of income tax increases during the lifetime of this Parliament, whatever happens to the economy. His scope for manoeuvre is now tightly circumscribed and his ability to stick to the golden rule is thrown into question by his own actions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para5"></a>We shall debate the Government's fiscal stance in more detail tomorrow in our debates on the Finance Bill and therefore I do not propose to detain the House any longer this evening. However, as I have made clear, we have concerns about the Government's economic assessment and we shall watch with great interest to see the extent to which it is realised in the coming months.

<A NAME="80728-23_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to all noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate. I wish to add my tribute to my noble friend Lord Alli. He made a most impressive maiden speech. He is only starting on his business and political life. I spent 40 years in business with nothing like his financial success. I recognised in his remarks the kernel of business success, and I admire it without having any hope whatever at my stage in life of emulating it. I am grateful to my noble friend for the contribution he made to our debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para6"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Dartmouth, made a very effective pre-election speech in his campaign for the European Parliament. I hope that he will use Hansard appropriately in his election material next year. I am sure that he will. I was very interested in the noble Earl's remarks about our relationship with Europe and the United States. It occurs to me to ask a rather naive question. If the noble Earl seriously thinks that in 1998 or 1999 we should be tying our economy to the dollar rather than the euro, there are a large number of questions to be asked to which he did not refer. If that had been possible, perhaps it should have been achieved a long time ago.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-23_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Dartmouth: </B>   My Lords, my point is that, de facto, it is already. In order to tie it to the euro, the economy has to be put in a straitjacket, as it was during the years when Britain was in the ERM.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-23_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I admire the noble Earl's adherence to the tenets of his party. I do not think that he will find much reassurance from business or economists in relation to such a policy. You do not have to like it but it is the case that our economy and our fiscal and monetary policies are closely linked <P>


<a name="column_1425"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1425</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to Europe, and will be more closely linked. Whether or not we join EMU, it will be there. The noble Earl will have some difficulty next year in his election campaign in the face of a single currency which works, as I believe it will.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para7"></a>My noble friend Lord Alli made reference in his excellent maiden speech to the fact that the Chancellor has abjured short-term decision-making. As one who lived for 30 years running a company, for most of the time not knowing where the wages bill would come from three months hence, I very much appreciate the force of his remarks. It is possible--indeed, most governments have done so--to panic at short-term changes in economic indicators. One of the reasons why we delegated decisions about short-term interest rates to the Bank of England was the danger of the kind of panic that is perfectly possible when those who are assiduous, as some of us are, in reading financial and economic comments in the broadsheet press are too inclined to listen to the wise men or women and pay attention to what they say. One of the great things about the British people is that, on the whole, they listen to the wise men, pay due obeisance to them, and then go away and do something else. That is what I hope we shall do. I hope that we shall not respond to day-to-day pressure. It is certainly my impression that the Chancellor has a steely determination to adhere to long-term policies and that he will not be swept aside by short-term pressures.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, in a typically thoughtful speech, gave a welcome for which I am most grateful to the introduction of accounting practices in government. As he said, they have been common practice in business for many years. The noble Lord was right to say that it is a dangerous time to assume that we can extrapolate from the past to the future. However, if the noble Lord does not mind my saying so, when has there been a time when it was not dangerous to do so? It has always been the case that past experience cannot be taken as a guide to the future. If the noble Lord is asking for predictability in economic policy, he is asking the impossible. There is no such thing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para9"></a>I detected in the noble Lord's resistance to three-year budgeting, which we are determined to introduce and shall be introducing, a Civil Service attitude; namely, he does not like the commitment we are making to the medium-term or longer term future, and he is afraid that there might be changes which would make our predictions over a three-year period unsustainable. That may be the case. We may be wrong about all sorts of things. But the public service, like private business, needs a degree of security in relation to the way in which it will be treated by government. What we have achieved by moving towards research accounting and budgeting is exactly that degree of security. There may be marginal adjustments to be made, and there will be possibilities for such adjustments. But proper investment decisions are not made on a 12-month basis. Anyone who has ever been in business knows that that is the case.

<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para10"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, seemed to back up the fears of the noble Lord, Lord Howell. I was disappointed to hear that from the Liberal Democrats. I thought that they were just that much more adventurous in relation to public finance policy. The noble Lord quoted the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. I read the NIESR comments very carefully. Although they differ marginally from our forecasts, on the whole they come to the conclusion that, even if the result is a deficit in GDP of 1 per cent. rather than the break-even which is involved in the forecast, none of that affects the validity of our fiscal projections and therefore none of it affects the validity of our expenditure projections. There have been perhaps 45 independent economic forecasters' predictions of the future of the various indicators in the economy. I do not claim that the Government are the most cautious. That would be absurd. However, I am certainly claiming that we are in line with the general trend of independent economic forecasting and that therefore our predictions for growth, public expenditure and revenue are prudent and cautious rather than what the most pessimistic, doom-laden predictions would lead us to expect.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, also referred to the difficulty of distinguishing between capital and current spending. That is a counsel of despair. It has existed for something like 50 years, during which the Treasury insisted--it does not now insist--that &#163;1 of revenue plus &#163;1 of capital equals &#163;2. Of course there are difficulties at the margin. But the determination to make that distinction--which is made year by year, week by week and day by day by every public business--is an essential determination. I do not for a moment resile from our determination to do that. If from time to time we get the difficulties of definition wrong, the independent Office for National Statistics is there to put us right. It will simply not allow us to say, for example, that expenditure on skills training is an investment. Although we all know that in one sense it is, we are not allowed to count it in the accounts as an investment; we have to include it as current expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, made a brief warning intervention and I know that he will speak at greater length and to equal effect tomorrow. But he talked as if the objective of the exercise were to reassure our European partners about the economy. It is no such thing. In this debate and in the submission we shall make to our European partners, our intention is to share information about our economy with those who share information with us. That in turn will be valid. If it is called "multilateral surveillance" so be it. I do not care for the long words, but it is legitimate. We are not trying to put anything over on our European partners.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-23_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, asked about accounting adjustments and gave warning that he would raise the matter tomorrow, so perhaps I should deal with it tomorrow. The Government have provided the Treasury Select Committee in another place with further detail on the category of accounting and other adjustments, to be published in due course as part of the Treasury Committee's report.

The noble Lord, Lord Newby, talked about the timing of the sustainable development strategy. That interesting report--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for intervening again. The point is that we need to know, either tonight or tomorrow, whether or not the figures in the accounting adjustment which are large are approved by the Office for National Statistics to which I referred. We welcome the answer, "Oh well, it will eventually appear in the report of the Treasury Committee" but it does not help us at all as regards tomorrow. If it is not possible to publish it because it is still confidential to the committee, can the Minister at least ensure that we are made aware of whether it approves of what is done?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-24_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I shall respond to the noble Lord when he makes the point tomorrow, to the fullest extent possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, rightly referred to environmental issues because they are referred to in Section 5 of the Maastricht Act. If the noble Lord turns to page 8 of the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report, he will see that there is specific recognition of environmental issues in line with our obligations under the Maastricht Act. We shall publish a sustainable development strategy later this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para1"></a>I suspect that behind these more specific comments lies a general fear that the economic situation is deteriorating and that our projections for public expenditure and revenue will not be realised. We have examined our projections against all the possible alternative objections, the alternative ways of running the Treasury model. We are convinced that what we have done has been cautious, rather than adventurous. If there is any risk it is the risk that we have underestimated revenue and overestimated expenditure, rather than the reverse. The average of the Treasury's latest survey of independent forecasters shows growth expected to be 2.2 per cent. in 1998 and 1.7 per cent. in 1999. The Government's fiscal projections based on growth of 2 per cent. in 1998 and 1&#190; per cent. in 1999 therefore seem to us entirely reasonable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para2"></a>I understand what the noble Lord, Lord Howell, says about the dangers from the potential collapse in Asia and I do not underestimate the seriousness of it for us. It is essential that the Japanese economic management should take control of its economy and should revive demand in a way that has been discussed in your Lordships' House within the past few days. It is true that the effect of any default in the Japanese economy on Asian economies generally would be serious on <P>


<a name="column_1428"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>economies in this country. I can only say to the noble Lord that we have taken serious account of it in the way in which we have made our projections for the future. We have not allowed for a complete meltdown in the world economy, but we have allowed for everything that it is reasonable and proper for us to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Newby, talked about sustainable convergence which provoked a response from my noble friend Lord Desai. My noble friend rightly pointed out that if the markets had not rejected the Government's thinking, then perhaps for capitalists there is no good reason to suppose that we have got things wildly wrong. I am not sure whether my noble friend Lord Desai would extrapolate his comments for all aspects of economic policy. I do not think he would, but he had a valid point because the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report was published more than a month ago. It affected the decisions of the Monetary Policy Committee last month and it is clear that our most important decisions, about the way in which we handle, understand and present our public accounts, have been subjected to the scrutiny of the Monetary Policy Committee and of the markets. They have been supported both by the MPC and by the markets.

<A NAME = "80728-24_para4"></a>We have been entirely open about our economic and fiscal strategies on the basis that we are saying realistically and soberly to the European Community, to the Commission and the Council, what is our understanding of the economic situation in this country.

<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para8"></a>On Question, Whether Clause 35 shall stand part of the Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-24_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I momentarily seek to oppose Clause 35. First, I wish to set down my disappointment about the state of the treaty between Scotland and England which in practice we are in the process of modifying. Half the treaty's articles are abandoned and it cannot be said to be a working document any longer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para9"></a>This failure to keep the treaty up to date leads me to call for its renewal. A new treaty would be constitutionally healthy in a diverse and voluntary multi-national state. Not to describe the United Kingdom as such would be to accept the fact of annexation.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para10"></a>Secondly, I am concerned that the two Acts mentioned in Clause 35 are both largely not in force. Thirdly, the Union with England Act, passed in the Scottish Parliament in 1707, is not available on the Lexis computer system, whereas the Union with <P>


<a name="column_1429"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1429</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Scotland Act is. If the Union is as important as I keep being told it is, then this foundation Act should be electronically recorded and widely available.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para11"></a>Fourthly, I must say to the traditional Unionists that at present they are failing to explain to people in Scotland the benefits of the Union. This is exemplified by the failure to teach in schools the formation and purpose of the United Kingdom and its constitution. For example, out on the streets the treaties of 1536, 1706, 1800 and 1921 mean little, if anything at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para12"></a>I said that I shall not delay the Committee for long, and I shall not. I conclude with the statement that that all needs to be remedied before Clause 35 can be seen as a useful clause of the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Perhaps I may just make clear what is the effect and intention of Clause 35. The Government may be held responsible for many things, from natural calamities to the weather and the awful summer we are having, but I do not believe that we can be held responsible for which Acts and treaties appear on Lexis.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para13"></a>The intention behind Clause 35 is to make it clear that the provisions of the Bill should be given effect notwithstanding anything in the Acts of Union. That sends a clear signal that the provisions in the Bill are to take priority in the event that it may be alleged that there are inconsistencies. The Government are satisfied that there are none. That will reduce the potential for any uncertainty or legal challenge in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para14"></a> I am aware of cases that have been brought in the past based on the Act of Union, not with great success. This provision will remove that possibility. That is the simple, straightforward reason for including the clause in the Bill. I do not accept the invitation from the noble Earl to go down the road of discussing whether or not we need a new treaty. I leave that to others.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-24_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Perhaps I can intervene briefly and ask the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, a question. Does that mean that the two Acts of Union will not be amended by this Bill and that, therefore, when I look at Statutes in Force, I will not find them with the amendments, deletions or whatever that are consequential on this Bill?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-24_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Let me repeat what I said. The provisions in this Bill are to take priority in the event that it is alleged that there are any inconsistencies between this Bill and the Acts of Union. I said that the Government are satisfied that there are none.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-24_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Does that answer mean that no changes will be made to the Acts of Union and Statutes in Force? It is a simple question and I should have thought it deserved a simple answer.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-24_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I gave the noble Lord a simple answer. There is a difference between a simple answer and an abrupt and abbreviated answer. I hope the noble Lord will accept that I answered his question.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 35, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Council of Ministers of European Union: accountability to Parliament </B></center><BR>
(" .--(1) Before any Minister of the Crown attends a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the European Union at which consideration is to be given to any issue related to devolved matters, the Secretary of State shall consult the Parliament and seek its views on the issue.
<BR>
(2) Following a meeting of the Council of Ministers at which any issue related to a devolved matter has been discussed, the Secretary of State shall forthwith make a report to the Parliament on the substance and the outcome of the meeting and shall respond to any questions that members of the Parliament may put to him.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para16"></a>The noble Lord said: In this amendment we return again to the subject of the relationship between the Scottish parliament and indeed Scotland, and the Council of Ministers of the European Union. We discussed this rather late on the night of the fourth day of Committee when we debated the relationship between the Scottish parliament and the executive and the European Union. As far as I can gather, the Government have no clear view as to how that relationship will be developed, other than that it will be via the UK Government and, in some mysterious way of which I am not entirely sure, the Scottish executive will play a part in the UK government delegations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para17"></a>On the night of the fourth day--this becomes a little like Genesis--I discussed my amendment specifically in relation to agriculture and fisheries. I do not want to repeat what I said then, though I do not believe that the answer I received was in the least satisfactory. However, in the light of the answer I received, I have tried, in Amendment No. 249A, to firm up the arrangement; to build a bridge between the Scottish parliament and the Scottish executive and the European Union and its Council of Ministers and make that bridge the Secretary of State. In fact I mean the Secretary of State for Scotland though, in the conventional manner, I did not specify that. If it were related to agriculture or fisheries matters, it could be the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. But I am not specifying that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para18"></a>I am looking at the reality, which is that members of the Scottish executive will not be able to attend the Council of Ministers and lead and speak for the United Kingdom. I am still left with the two examples sent to me by the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, after our debates on the Government of Wales Bill. They were supposed to satisfy me as to the attendance of ministers of governments--not the member states' governments--at meetings of the Council of Ministers. At the risk of being accused of repetition, I should like to read out the important parts of the letter I received from the noble Lord, Lord Williams. I asked him to give examples of where members of German Lander or provisional governments elsewhere in Europe, like Spain, actually attended the Council of Ministers and <P>


<a name="column_1431"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1431</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>spoke on behalf of their countries on subjects like agriculture and fisheries where serious decisions are made and policies taken. The letter of the noble Lord, Lord Williams, said this:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The more obvious instances which have been identified relate to the German Lander. Because of its particular expertise, Bavaria, for example, has represented the German government at EU meetings where cultural issues have been the main agenda item. Similarly, members of the Catalan autonomous government have attended meetings on behalf of the Spanish, where language issues were under consideration. I trust this information goes some way to removing your scepticism that in practice it would not be possible for an assembly member to be part of a UK government delegation, nor indeed to lead such a delegation, if that was the view reached by the UK government".--[Official Report, 1/7/98; col. 736.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para19"></a>I am afraid my scepticism remains. I see that there may be some issues in a European Union meeting which are specifically Scottish and the UK Government may decide to send a minister from the Scottish executive. But the issues that worry me do not relate to culture and language where no hard policy decisions are taken which are binding on all the member states of the European Union. My concerns relate more to agriculture, fisheries, transport, Department of Trade and Industry matters, assisted area status and all those subjects which are important to the economic life of our country. Those are the issues that bother me and on those issues it is almost inconceivable--I go further; it is inconceivable--that there will be a policy item for a whole Council of Ministers meeting which will be only of relevance to Scotland and not relevant to any other part of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para20"></a>I am afraid, therefore, that I am as unconvinced as I have ever been about these rather vague statements that Scottish ministers, members of the Scottish executive, will somehow be able to play a full part as though Scotland were a member state of the European Union in meetings of the Council of Ministers and the peripheral meetings which are so important. I have therefore devised Amendment No. 249A. I accept that is not the most satisfactory arrangement but, short of reserving some major issues to the United Kingdom Parliament, which I know the Government will not do, my amendment makes the Secretary of State the bridge. It proposes that before meetings of the Council of Ministers, in addition to the usual round-robins which circulate in Whitehall,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State shall consult the Parliament and seek its views on the issue". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para21"></a>It will therefore be the direct responsibility of the Secretary of State for Scotland to seek views on those issues. Then he would be able easily to represent them to his colleagues and, if necessary, he could accompany a colleague to a meeting of the Council of Ministers in order to speak on behalf of Scotland as a Minister of the United Kingdom Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para22"></a>I see that my noble friend Lord Lang of Monkton has returned to us. I have no doubt that he, as Secretary of State for Scotland, attended Council of Ministers' meetings. I know that I did. I know that my noble friend Lord Sanderson of Bowden--who I also see in the Committee--attended meetings on agriculture and fishery matters. I certainly did, especially on fishery matters, which are so important to Scotland. That is the first part of the amendment.
<P>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1432</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para23"></a>The second part is that after the business is done in Brussels, in which any matter relating to Scotland and a devolved issue has been discussed and perhaps resolved, the Secretary of State should report to the parliament and should be available to answer questions from members of the parliament. "Answerability" is also important.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para24"></a>I still have not had an answer to my question. If a negotiation takes place in Brussels, on any subject, and the Minister comes back to the House of Commons, and it is a devolved subject, and the Minister makes a statement and answers questions, what does he do when a Scottish Member of Parliament pops up and asks a question about Scotland on a matter which has been devolved? Does the Speaker of the other place rule that out of order because the subject has now been devolved in the legislation we are discussing? Does the Minister--especially if it is a difficult question--simply duck it and say, "That is not a matter for me. It is a matter for the Scottish parliament and for the Minister there"? I do not know the answer to that question. I have failed miserably to get out of the Government any positive indication of what will happen in those circumstances on the question of answerability.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para25"></a>I am saying here that the Secretary of State would report to the Scottish parliament and would answer questions that any members of the Scottish parliament might put to him. That would lead to the kind of accountability that is essential if Scotland is to be properly represented at the Council of Ministers and in the councils of the European Union.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-24_para26"></a>Brussels is no longer some sort of peripheral place where people go for a nice day out and the business does not matter terribly much. It matters hugely over a whole raft of policies. I am deeply concerned, whether it be Wales--and I see the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, in his place--or whether it be Scotland, that one of the results, unintended I grant the Government, of these devolutionary proposals will be that Scotland will lose its direct representation, its clout and influence at Council of Ministers' meetings in Brussels. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80728-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   I wonder whether it will be convenient to discuss Amendments Nos. 268 and 269 at the same time because they are on the same topic. If I may say, modestly, to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, our amendment is rather better than his. It is on the same subject and I do not see why we should debate it twice.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   With enormous respect, there is a difficulty. The opportunity to group was available earlier and they were not grouped together. It would be more appropriate to take them as they are presently grouped.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sanderson of Bowden: </B>   Perhaps I can intervene on this amendment. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, that there is not much difference in the sentiment behind what my noble friend is suggesting <P>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1433</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>here and the amendment of the Liberal Democrats. They refer to the very difficult situation that arises as a result of this Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-25_para0"></a>Those of us who have had experience in Brussels know only too well--and I said this at Second Reading--how difficult it is to get government departments, whether north or south of the Border, whether Irish or Welsh, to agree on matters even when they are of the same party. We are passing this Bill when we do not know in the future whether the party in government in Westminster will be of the same colour as that north of the Border. We have to be particularly careful when we are dealing with the situation in relation to the European Union.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-25_para1"></a>There is no easy answer. I have no doubt that the Minister will tell us that there will be a very sensible concordat between Ministers in Westminster and the Scottish parliament. I am afraid that this will be a very difficult situation, particularly in agriculture and fishing, which rely so very heavily on good relationships between Brussels and the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-25_para2"></a>My noble friend is taking a step in the right direction. As he said, it is not an ideal step because it is a very difficult situation to resolve. As I said at Second Reading, I am very concerned about one aspect. Unrepresented though it is in this Chamber, the Scottish National Party will look at this very closely indeed. If it sees the president of the National Farmers Union of Scotland and the chairman of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation deciding that there is absolutely no point in discussing matters with the Minister in the Scottish parliament with responsibilities for agriculture and fishing and that the best thing they can do is go straight to London to see the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who has the clout in Brussels, that is doing no good service to the new Scottish parliament. It will weaken the whole thing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-25_para3"></a>These issues that the House must consider most carefully before the Bill is passed. They are capable of undermining the good sense that I hope to see, although I have reservations, from a Scottish parliament. These are the aspects of the legislation that worry me intensely. Those of us who have had experience know how difficult negotiations in Brussels are; how long they take; and how much give and take there has to be. The Minister knows that; he is doing it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-25_para4"></a>There is perhaps a note attached to the Minister's briefing which says, "Resist these amendments". He may well resist today but perhaps over the summer holidays he will consider the matter more closely. I do not believe that concordats are necessary. They may be good but they do not get to the root of the problem. If agriculture and fishing are to be devolved, the Scottish parliament must have some say, somewhere, in the chain of command.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I recognise that many noble Lords regard this as a very important issue, as I do myself. A number have direct experience of representing Scotland in negotiations with colleagues in UK departments and <P>


<a name="column_1434"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1434</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>then as part of the UK team in Brussels. I freely recognise that this is a sincere attempt to try and "protect" Scotland's interest in Europe in the context of the devolved settlement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-25_para5"></a>In an attempt to build a bridge, as he described it, the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, has created something of a constitutional mishmash; a failure to recognise that UK Ministers are accountable to a UK Parliament and Scottish Ministers are accountable to the Scottish parliament. Those are the two direct lines of accountability. Nothing is to be gained by trying to blur the structure by saying that a UK Minister is required to consult the parliament and then subsequently that a UK Minister has a duty to report to the parliament on the substance of the outcome of the negotiations and to answer the questions of the parliament. That is a significant blurring of the lines of accountability between Ministers and Parliament. As I have said, the basic line is between the Scottish Minister and the Scottish parliament and between the UK Minister and the UK Parliament. I believe that that should be preserved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-25_para6"></a>Scottish ministers and UK Ministers will agree the UK line on negotiations in Brussels. That is the whole point. It is the responsibility of Scottish ministers to report to the Scottish parliament and of UK Ministers to answer to the UK Parliament for the conduct of EU negotiations even when they affect devolved matters. If the Fisheries Council were deciding questions of TACs and quotas--many of us have been involved in long nights of macho negotiations on quotas--it would be perfectly proper for a Westminster MP to ask the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food a question on TACs and quotas, perhaps on how they affected Scottish interests. Similarly, a question on dairy quotas and the Agriculture Council could quite properly be asked of the Minister by a Scottish Member of Parliament at Westminster.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-25_para7"></a>We have consistently made it clear both in the White Paper and during the passage of this Bill that Scottish ministers will be closely involved in the formulation of the UK position as presented to our EU partners at Council meetings. They may also attend the Council and, where appropriate, speak on behalf of the UK. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, tends to mock that formulation. I ask him not to do so because it is offered in good faith as a way forward and as a way of ensuring that Scottish interests are properly represented. The noble Lord quoted back to us the figure from his letter from the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn. It has to be said that the right of members of regional parliaments to attend Council meetings was obtained only as recently as the Treaty of Amsterdam. I understand that the noble Lord is not awfully keen on that treaty at the moment. However, that is something on which we can build because it now provides the European framework in which this type of representation can be accommodated and expressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-25_para8"></a>Throughout the whole European process Scottish ministers will be accountable for their actions to the Scottish parliament. That is how the Scottish parliament will be able to call the executive to account in its handling of EU business--not by trying in some rather <P>


<a name="column_1435"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1435</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>strange way, which I do not understand, through questioning and report to make the Secretary of State accountable to the Scottish parliament, but by directly making Scottish ministers accountable to the Scottish parliament for their conduct and involvement in negotiations.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-25_para9"></a>If we keep it like that, the lines of accountability are clear and easily understood. I see nothing to be gained by muddying the waters. I should point out in addition that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish--drawing upon his experience, which I recognise, as a former agriculture and fisheries Minister in the Scottish Office--consistently warns that the position of Scottish agriculture in relation to Europe will be undermined as a result of the Bill. That is not my view. That is not the view of the president of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, who enjoys the support of his members. His electors clearly knew his position on this. He believes very strongly that the way forward that we have indicated means that Scottish agricultural interests will have a much more clearly focused forum in which to be debated and that what we have set down provides a means by which the Scottish voice will be heard more consistently in Brussels, particularly through the informal regional organisations.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-25_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I notice that the Minister is praying in aid the president of the National Farmers Union of Scotland. Is it not a fact that, unusually for presidents of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, he has taken a party political role and is a candidate for the Liberal Democrat Party for the Scottish parliament? I simply ask: can a man serve two masters, the Liberal Democrats in the Scottish parliament and the NFU? I am not alone in wondering about that. Many senior farmers wonder exactly the same thing. I am afraid that praying him in aid increases, rather than decreases, my concern.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   On the business about serving two masters, I believe that the convener of the hill livestock committee is trying to do the same thing. He is seeking nomination in the Conservative interest for the Scottish parliament while serving the National Farmers Union.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Does the Minister have it in mind to accept Amendment No. 268 when we reach it? If not, why is he not reading out his reply to that amendment when dealing with this grouping, because it is on precisely the same subject? I do not know what the Minister's ploy is in knocking down this amendment when we do not know what he will say about the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Steel, who said that he wants his amendment to be considered in this group and who asked whether he could speak to it now. Is the Minister going to accept Amendment No. 268?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   That is a false accusation if ever there was one. I offered the view that the opportunity was available earlier in the day for amendments to be grouped by agreement. I received no requests--I do not believe that the usual channels received any requests--<P>


<a name="column_1436"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1436</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for Amendment No. 268 to be grouped with this amendment. Members of the Committee may wish to speak to the later amendment, but not to this earlier amendment. We have our arrangements. Amendments are grouped and we work through the groupings.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   When noble Lords want amendments to be grouped, unless the Government have major difficulty in turning the page and referring to another brief, they are usually allowed to do it. I would have been very greatly helped had that occurred in this case. This is one of the major faults of the Bill to which we want to find a solution. We have heard everything that is thought to be wrong about my noble friend's amendment, which I believe is a possible solution. However, I see that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, has another good idea. Can we not deal with it now?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   The Government are responsible for grouping amendments. I believe I am right in saying that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, was tabled after my amendment which appears later in the Marshalled List. I did not immediately notice that it dealt with much the same subject. They should have been grouped together. But I believe that my amendment which comes later offers a much more logical solution and does not trespass on what the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, has rightly referred to as the blurring of responsibilities as between Scottish and UK Ministers. I do not know whether the noble Lord wishes me to pursue my amendment now. I am quite happy to wait until later.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-26_para0"></a>I do not agree with the strictures of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, about the president of the National Farmers' Union of Scotland. Both he and the chairman of the hill livestock committee are perfectly entitled to stand as candidates. It is not without precedent. I suspect the reason why the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, is annoyed is that the people of Argyll and Bute have decided to dispense with his services and are likely to embrace the services of Mr. George Lyon. That appears to be more down to his temper than anything else.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Since the noble Lord has referred to precedents, can he name a former president of the NFU who while in office has become a candidate for a political party?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   I shall check but I am fairly certain that I am correct in what I say. I do not want to name names and get it wrong. I have someone in mind who is also a member of my party. The fact is that he was elected president by his own members, who knew of his political allegiance. Some of us believe that Scottish Ministers attending European Council meetings will enhance the voice of Scotland in Europe, not detract from it. They will not be tag-end Charlies to UK delegations but will have their own status as Ministers of the Scottish parliament. I believe that that is a better solution. I shall reserve my fire until I come to my own amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   Does the noble Lord agree that a man can serve two masters if both are benign?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I see that the Minister has completed his remarks. I shall sum up and decide what to do with my amendment. I believe that there is little difference between the president and the chairman of the hill livestock committee. Mr. Scott, as chairman of the hill livestock committee, considered very seriously whether or not the two offices were compatible. A year ago he would not have considered that they were compatible and would have resigned as chairman. He did not resign as chairman simply because the president had already introduced politics into the senior offices of the NFU. This is a serious matter and I look forward to hearing about the precedents to which the noble Lord has alluded. I have spoken to the immediate past three presidents, none of whom was in any doubt that they should not be members of or be active in any political party while they held the presidency of an organisation whose constitution said that it should be non-political. But that is another matter. Perhaps the Liberal Democrats are not political.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-26_para1"></a>Interestingly enough, the Minister has helped me, and for that I am grateful. He appreciates that this amendment does not seek to wreck anything. Like my noble friend Lord Sanderson, as someone who has been involved in these negotiations I am extremely concerned that the important role that Scottish fisheries Ministers, agricultural Ministers and other Ministers--for example, industry Ministers--play in these issues should continue after devolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-26_para2"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for answering a question that the Government failed to answer in relation to the Government of Wales Bill both in the other place and in this Chamber; namely, whether it would be in order for Members to ask UK government Ministers questions on devolved matters. The Minister has made an interesting revelation which I failed to extract from the two Ministers who dealt with the Government of Wales Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   For the avoidance of doubt, I was very careful in what I said. It would be perfectly proper and reasonable for a Scottish Member of Parliament and a Member of this House to ask a UK Minister questions on the outcome of Council meetings; for example, in relation to tax or dairy quotas.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   We discussed this matter when considering Clause 29. I believe that at that time the noble Lord, Lord Molyneaux, gave us the benefit of his reminiscences of the period during which the Stormont Parliament was in operation. He recounted how the Table Clerk next door would tell Northern Ireland Members what questions they could and could not ask. I thought that the Government had given us an assurance that that would be the convention with regard to the devolved parliaments. Therefore, the vast majority of questions, and certainly all questions with regard to devolved matters, would be, by convention, ultra vires in this Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Viscount for renewing my concerns about this issue, as he has just done. The Clerks in the other place and, indeed, the Clerks here are mindful of the vires of questions. The Speaker is also mindful, as seen the other day when someone was pulled up for asking the Prime Minister a question about the Scottish National Party, for which the Prime Minister, of course, has no responsibility. The Speaker actually asked the questioner to resume his seat and said it would be a long time before he was called again, so it did not do him any good being "on message" with the Labour Party; he will not be "on message" for some considerable time, I gather.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-26_para3"></a>The noble Viscount re-emphasised my worry. In fact, the Minister has not helped me either. The point is that before Ministers go to Council meetings there are often debates. After their return there are debates and there are questions. What I am concerned about is whether Scottish MPs and, indeed, Members of your Lordships' House will be able to take a full part in those debates and questions on matters relating to any subject which has been devolved but which comes within the ambit of one or other of the Council of Ministers of the European Union. Agriculture and fisheries are key subjects. For a while I had thought that the Minister was helping me. However, I am not sure that the noble Viscount has not dashed the lifebelt away from under me. I am still as concerned as I was.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-26_para4"></a>I shall read what the Minister said. Perhaps he can read it as well and, if he cares, we have an opportunity for clarification later this evening, which means that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, is useful, and we also have the long Summer Recess during which the Minister can correspond with me. He can also, perhaps, correspond with me about the Treaty of Amsterdam, because that argument was not used by the two Welsh Ministers. The question, therefore, is which Ministers are giving the correct steer. Perhaps I can have a letter about that; some noble Lords might be interested.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-26_para5"></a>With later amendments in mind, I shall withdraw my amendment. However, the Minister will not be surprised to know that I shall be thinking about the matter during the Summer Recess.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Perhaps I can help finally to put this particular matter to bed. It starts from the basis that the conduct of foreign relations, including EU negotiations, is a reserved matter. That is the starting-off point. UK Ministers, therefore, can properly be made accountable to the Westminster Parliament for that, even when the content affects devolved matters. They are answerable to all Members of the Westminster Parliament.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-26_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   Before the noble Lord sits down, I asked him a specific question and he did not answer it. I completely accept what he has just said in relation to foreign affairs. That was not my question. My question was whether the summation I gave and the <P>


<a name="column_1439"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1439</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>answer I thought he gave the other day was correct in relation to devolved matters. If he can confirm that, I shall be most grateful.

<A NAME="80728-27_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   We have made some serious progress in the last 34 minutes, and in the last minute. I am grateful to the Minister. I understand the point he made. He has discussed philosophically the different heads from which matters come. I can understand that if matters relating to the European Union are reserved to the United Kingdom Government, the United Kingdom Ministers are answerable to this Parliament on any matter which is debated and discussed or negotiated in the European Union, even if it is a devolved matter. I believe that that will be of considerable interest to many of the Members of the other place, Members of your Lordships' House and to many people in the world outside. That has not been very clear up to now. I am grateful to the Minister. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="80728-27_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour </B>   moved Amendment No. 250: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 36, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Role of Secretary of State for Scotland </B></center><BR>
(" .--(1) The Secretary of State for Scotland shall be entitled to attend and participate in any proceedings of the Parliament.
<BR>
(2) Subsection (1) does not confer on the Secretary of State for Scotland--
<BR>
(a) any right to vote, or
<BR>
(b) a right to attend or participate in the proceeding of any committee of the Parliament or sub-committee.
<BR>
(3) The standing orders shall include provision for any documents which--

(a) contain material relating to any proceedings of the Parliament which have taken place or are to take place, and
<BR>
(b) are made available to the members of the Parliament,

to be made available to the Secretary of State for Scotland no later than the time when they were made available to members of the Parliament who are not members of the Scottish Executive.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para2"></a>The noble Earl said: None of us can forecast which will be the major political party in the Scottish parliament. It has already been clearly stated by my noble friends Lord Lang of Monkton and Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish that the position of the Secretary of State is vague in the Bill. We shall be setting up a new parliament in Scotland. Many members may not have had much political experience. I believe that the amendment gives the Secretary of State, who is bound to be an experienced politician and a Cabinet Member, the opportunity to guide the new Scottish parliament in its first few years of existence.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para3"></a>After the first few years, the proposed amendment on the role of the Secretary of State could be repealed as being unnecessary. Some provision needs to guide the new parliament in its brand new functions and activities. I believe that the amendment is one way to achieve that. It would give the Secretary of State an opportunity to guide and assist the parliament to start off on the right tracks. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   After the turmoils in the Welsh Bill on this issue, I support the amendment moved by the noble Earl. It is interesting to consider paragraph 4.12 of the White Paper Scotland's Parliament. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The role of the Secretary of State for Scotland will be to secure the passage and implementation of the legislation to establish the Scottish Parliament; and then to support its initial development". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para4"></a>That is the point the noble Earl made. Once the Scottish parliament is in being and the Scottish executive established, the responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Scotland will change. The focus will be on promoting communication between the Scottish parliament and executive, and between the United Kingdom Parliament and Government on matters of mutual interest, and on representing Scottish interests in reserved areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para5"></a>It follows that the plan behind the legislation is that there should be easy communication between the Secretary of State and Scotland, and, through the Secretary of State, between Scotland and Westminster. No machinery exists in the Scotland Bill to facilitate that. The noble Earl's amendment is taken word for word from the original clause that was contained in the Government of Wales Bill. (I am still campaigning for a Welsh parliament, notwithstanding the concessions that the Government have made on the issue).
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para6"></a>It was laid down originally in the Government of Wales Bill in the terms of this amendment that the Secretary of State for Wales should have the right to attend and participate. But as the Bill passed through your Lordship's House, an amendment was accepted by the Government, who phrased it in their own way, that the Secretary of State for Wales could be required once a year to attend the Welsh assembly in order to discuss with the members of the Welsh assembly the legislative programme that the Government had in mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para7"></a>Of course it is a matter for the Scots themselves to determine what communication they want. But a machinery of the nature which the noble Earl proposes in the amendment, and which follows the machinery in the Welsh Bill, facilitates that essential communication. The Secretary of State is the person who links the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments together. Whether he represents Scotland in London or London in Scotland is a matter which experience will show.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para8"></a>I go further than the noble Earl and ask the Government to introduce at Report stage not simply this amendment but the amendment that was introduced into the Government of Wales Bill which would require the Secretary of State for Scotland to attend the proceedings of the Scottish parliament at least once a year.

I am sure that I know the answer that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, will give but I am not going to give it for him. I do think that there is a point here, whether or not it is along the lines of my noble friend's amendment. No one is sure of the role of the Secretary of State for Scotland. The noble Lord, Lord Lang, earlier asked some penetrating questions about the future role of the Secretary of State for Scotland, but largely about his role here at Whitehall. What will his role be when his whole power base, which is a large government department with a budget of &#163;14 billion, is removed? In my view, he will not sit in the same prominent position around the Cabinet table as he does today and he may well find himself below the proverbial salt.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para10"></a>The amendment addresses his relationship with the Scottish parliament. I can understand the difficulty of allowing him to be a participant and an attender. While this Parliament would not countenance any such arrangement by an outsider, I remind the Government that we are setting up a new parliament which must not be tied by all the traditions of Westminster. This is a brave new world where we can reinvent and change things. Noble Lords accuse me of doing this, but we should not get tied down to the Westminster model on all occasions and, dare I say it, neither should they. There may be something in my noble friend's amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para11"></a>As my noble friend stated, none of us can forecast who will form the largest party, and he felt that that added to the importance of the Secretary of State being allowed to attend and participate. I have to say to my noble friend that the Prime Minister has forecast which party may become the largest party, and he does not like the forecast, hence the side shift of Mr. Brian Wilson and the fact that Mrs. Liddell has been sent to restore the position in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para12"></a>I always thought from the nursery rhymes that it was the knight who was sent to help the damsel in distress but in this case the damsel is being sent to help her benighted party in its distress in Scotland. As I am a confirmed Unionist, I suppose that I ought to wish her well, but I do not think that I would have sent the honourable lady to defend the Union, given some of the things that she has said in past years from the Opposition Benches. However, that is another matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para13"></a>Whichever is the major party in the Scottish parliament, it is right that we should establish a proper line of communication between that parliament and the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Secretary of State for Scotland and the United Kingdom Parliament. My noble friend may not have got it entirely right but the Government have accepted the importance of this link in the Welsh Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said, and it is included in the legislation. The Government should consider something like that for the Scottish Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Earl for explaining that the intention in moving the amendment is to ensure that the new parliament in its early years will be able to benefit from the guidance and assistance of an experienced politician. I have to say that I do not believe the parliament will be short of politicians, some of them considerably experienced--at least if some Members of your Lordships' House have their way.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para14"></a>Having listened to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, I do not believe that there is a great deal of difference between us. We both recognise that there is a need to establish good lines of communication, but we have reservations about the right to attend and the right to speak.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para15"></a>I also believe that it would be a little patronising to say to the Scottish parliament, "Look, you are so inexperienced and immature that in those first few years you need someone to show you the ropes". I do not believe that that would go down well and I believe that any possible advice and guidance that a Secretary of State could give would tend not to be accepted for that very reason.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para16"></a>I am also conscious of the comparison that has been made with Wales, because the wording of the amendment is drawn from the Government of Wales Bill. As we have tried to explain during the passage of the Bill, there is a fundamental difference between the Welsh assembly and the Scottish parliament. There was an interesting slip of the tongue when the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred to the Welsh parliament. The difference is that the Welsh parliament--there we are, be careful! The difference is that the Welsh assembly does not have primary legislative powers, so it is quite understandable that the Secretary of State for Wales will be required to attend the Welsh assembly and describe the legislative programme of the United Kingdom Government in relation to Wales. That situation simply does not arise in the context of the Scottish parliament. The Scottish parliament has primary legislative powers. It is very much master in its own house in terms of primary legislation. Therefore, the Welsh comparison is not well founded.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-27_para17"></a>Although the amendment's objectives are perfectly laudable in trying to establish a sound basis of communication, it runs into troubles such as blurring the lines of accountability and setting up a relationship which in itself will lead to the kind of advice which the noble Earl wished to be transmitted actually being discounted. The comparison with Wales is wrongly based.

<A NAME="80728-28_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   I am obviously happy to withdraw the amendment. One of the reasons I tabled it was that the position of the Secretary of State once the parliament is set up appears to me to be so very vague. That was one of the reasons why I felt that it was worth while to bring the amendment forward. However, after hearing what has been said, I beg leave to withdraw it.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para2"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This amendment raises a very short point; namely, whether the provisions in Clause 37, which extend the concept of absolute privilege to statements made in parliament and publications made under the authority of the parliament, should also be extended to written or oral communication by members of the parliament to the various persons set out in my amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para3"></a>It is important that members of the new parliament should be able to discharge their duties both within and without the chamber vigorously and responsibly without the fear of being sued. That is recognised in the clause as presently drafted. My amendment would take it one stage further. I hope that a constructive response will be forthcoming from the Minister. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-28_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I find this a most interesting amendment because it raises a matter of historical and constitutional importance. The privileges of this House have long been protected. I hope that the Committee will forgive me, in the absence of my noble friend Lord Russell, for going back to the 17th century. In 1621 the other place declared that the privileges of parliament were the birthright and inheritance of the subject. Those ancient privileges were enshrined in the Declaration of Rights of 1688, which was given statutory form in the Bill of Rights of 1689, Article 9 of which stated that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any Court or place out of Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para4"></a>Notoriously, Members of both Houses abused their privileges in the 18th century in respect of immunity from civil actions and from arrest. It was said that many Members of Parliament had to flee when Parliament was not sitting and spend their time in France rather than <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>face the bankruptcy court. And so by the Parliamentary Privilege Act of 1770, Members were rendered liable to ordinary proceedings for their normal private behaviour, together with their menial and other servants.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para5"></a>The question then arose as to the extent of their privileges and what was meant by the term "proceedings in Parliament" in Article 9 of the Bill of Rights. A resolution in 1837 stated that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by the law and privilege of Parliament, this House has the sole and exclusive jurisdiction to determine upon the existence and extent of its privileges and that the institution or prosecution of any action, suit or other proceeding, for the purpose of bringing them into discussion or decision before any court or tribunal elsewhere than in Parliament, is a high breach of such privilege and renders all parties concerned therein amenable to its just displeasure, and to the punishment consequent thereon". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para6"></a>But did it extend, as this amendment seeks to do, privileges to correspondence with Ministers? That was a matter which came before the other place on 8th July 1958. Your Lordships will forgive me for this tour through history but it helps to illustrate the extent to which the noble and learned Lord's amendment goes far beyond anything that we have ever known before.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para7"></a>On 7th July 1958, there was a debate in the other place which was concerned with a letter that Mr. George Strauss had written to the then Minister of Power concerning the London Electricity Board and its manner of dealing with scrap. That was passed by the Minister of Power to the chairman of the London Electricity Board, who then threatened a libel action, and the matter went to the Committee of Privileges and also to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. It was a most unusual proceeding that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council became involved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para8"></a>The Committee of Privileges said, yes, there had been a breach of privilege because that letter to a Minister--which is what this amendment is about--was privileged; it was part of the proceedings of Parliament; but that no action should be taken. Those are the circumstances in which the debate then took place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para9"></a>The view was hotly contested, not least by the then Attorney-General, Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller, as he then was, who said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The conclusion of the Committee of Privileges in this case that there was a breach of Privilege depends on the conclusion that the action of the right hon. Gentleman [in sending a letter to a Minister] was a proceeding in Parliament, within the meaning of the Bill of Rights". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para10"></a>He went on to say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Bill of Rights is a Statute, and the meaning to be attached to the words in that Statute, 'proceedings in Parliament', is a question of law. This House, of course, can put its own interpretation upon those words, but ... that will not be binding on any court of law, and it is because the courts may reach a different conclusion as to what are the Privileges of Parliament from what this House may reach that a conflict may arise. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>We are not here concerned with any Privilege based on any custom or usage, but with a Privilege enshrined in a Statute. In my opinion it would be wrong if this House sought to give a meaning to a Statute which that Statute does not and cannot have. I feel bound to advise the House, as I advised the Committee of Privileges, that in my opinion there cannot be the slightest doubt that the answer to the question whether the letter written by the right hon. Gentleman [to the Minister] was a proceeding in Parliament is 'No'". <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para11"></a>He was supported in that conclusion by Mr. Dingle Foot, who was, of course, from the Labour Party, and construed the statute in the same way. He said that the Bill of Rights was concerned with interference by the Crown, and added:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I imagine that they had in mind particularly the case of Sir John Eliot who died in the Tower as a victim of Royal vengeance for the words he had spoken in this House".--[Official Report, Commons, 8/7/58; cols. 250, 251 and 299.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para12"></a>He came to the firm conclusion that correspondence by a Member with a Minister could not, save in the sort of circumstances where the draft of a Parliamentary Question was sent forward, be considered as a document entitled to absolute privilege, which is what this amendment seeks to secure for the Scottish parliament. After a lengthy debate and on a free vote, the House of Commons resolved that the letter of Mr. Strauss was not a proceeding in Parliament and was of the opinion, therefore, that the letters from the chairman of the London Electricity Board threatening libel constituted no breach of privilege.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para13"></a>So far as I am aware, the next thing that happened was what one might call the "Neil Hamilton Act 1996"--in other words, the Defamation Act 1996, which contains further definitions of what are "proceedings in Parliament". I shall not weary Members of the Committee with the various matters which were considered to be proceedings in Parliament. However, what the 1996 Act does not suggest is that a written or oral communication by a Member of Parliament to a Member of the Cabinet, to the Speaker or to a Minister of the Crown can be absolutely privileged. Of course it has "qualified privilege"; that is to say, a communication between a Scottish member to the Scottish executive, and so on, will be entitled to qualified privilege in a libel action, which means that an aggrieved plaintiff would have to prove malice. I see nothing wrong in the proceedings being challenged if there is malice, but I do not believe that we should have the absolute privilege suggested by the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para14"></a>I apologise for taking Members of the Committee so far through constitutional history. However, it seems to me that the amendment goes way beyond the privileges of this Parliament. I am sure that, on reflection, the noble and learned Lord will decide not to pursue it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-28_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hope of Craighead: </B>   I should like to add just a few points to the very interesting comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. It seems to me that the amendment raises a practical problem and an issue of principle. The practical problem arises in the following way. Written communications are subject to the modern disease; namely, proliferation by means of the photocopier. Although the amendment is carefully drawn to restrict itself to communications from a member of the parliament to certain persons, it is quite possible that copies of such documents may pass to other people by various means.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para15"></a>Similarly, in the case of oral communications, they may form the basis of a memorandum or a note which may then, in the same way, pass outside the files of the recipient. Recent experience I have had indicates that in <P>


<a name="column_1446"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1446</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>various ways, either by discovery under the English civil process or by the disclosure rules which apply in the criminal process in England, substantial numbers of documents may pass well beyond the confines of the files to which they were originally consigned. It is quite possible that communications which the Member of Parliament thought would be personal to him and the person to whom he has written will find their way far beyond the original communication into the hands of someone who may feel aggrieved or defamed by what is contained in it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para16"></a>That is the scale of the problem. There is certainly an issue to be addressed. I am bound to say that I take the same view in principle as the noble Lord. To give absolute privilege to these communications, whatever the circumstances--whether the communications are made outside Parliament or whatever else--goes further than is necessary. As has been said, there is the protection of qualified privilege. English law at least, and maybe Scottish law as well, is developing other mechanisms to protect people who are or may be affected by the release of documents by discovery and also by the release of documents in the criminal process. Those protections are available too.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para17"></a>On balance, I think that the amendment goes further than is needed despite the scale of the practical problem to which I referred.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   Perhaps I may say, with respect, that I agree with what has been said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead. Nonetheless, I am aware, because I was summoned to give evidence before it, that there is a joint committee of this House and the House of Commons under the chairmanship of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, which is considering many of the issues concerning parliamentary privilege.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para18"></a>When I gave evidence I was struck by the fact that that committee was amazed that in considering questions of privilege, and so on, in relation to the parliament in Scotland, little consideration appeared to have been given to all the various pieces of evidence received about exactly the same matters in relation to the Westminster Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para19"></a>Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, I rather think that the amendment goes too far. I wonder what thought has been given to the possible recommendations--I do not think that any have yet been made--of the committee which has been set up. The committee has considered in great detail the complicated issues which arise, for example, in relation to communications between Members of Parliament and Ministers in relation to privilege. What consideration has been given to these issues in relation to the Scottish parliament?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-28_para20"></a>It seems to me that although there is no reason why the Scottish parliament should ape the Westminster Parliament, equally there is no reason why the Scottish parliament should ignore all the experience which has been built up over the years and, in particular, all the consideration which has been given in recent months by <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>a distinguished committee under the chairmanship of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls, which has great experience, both as regards the position in the Commons and the position in this House.

While, of course, I appreciate what he says, namely, that the committee has done a great deal of work, it is some little distance from reporting, as he knows. In those circumstances it would be difficult for the Government to give consideration to its conclusions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-29_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   I fully accept the caveat which the noble and learned Lord puts because I think he is a member of the Committee. Nonetheless, I think he may have been struck, as I was, by the fact that we seemed to be going down one road when the committee was considering these matters in relation to Westminster. Here we are taking decisions in connection with the parliament in Edinburgh which seem not altogether to be synchronised.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I am grateful for the comments of noble Lords and noble and learned Lords. I particularly enjoyed the exposition of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, with regard to the history of the question of privilege. I am also grateful to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, for moving this amendment, as it gives me an opportunity to explain why we have included Clause 37 in the Bill. This may go some way towards answering the question posed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-29_para0"></a>I think it is important to understand the thinking behind the way in which we have approached the issue of defamation. As noble Lords and noble and learned Lords have acknowledged, it is quite proper that we should provide the parliament's proceedings with some shelter from the risk of actions of defamation. Absolute privilege is, of course, the strongest form of legal protection from defamation proceedings. It confers a powerful protection in any circumstances in which it applies.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-29_para1"></a>For that reason we need to be clear about why that protection is conferred and to be sure that we have applied it no more widely than is justified. I believe that was the thrust of some of the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead. For that reason we have deliberately framed Clause 37 so that absolute privilege applies only to any statement made in the proceedings of the parliament, and to any publication made under the parliament's authority. This is deliberately done to ensure that the work of the parliament is not hindered or inhibited by fear that actions for defamation may be raised, while at the same time restricting the areas which are protected.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-29_para2"></a>I hope it will be helpful to the Committee if I clarify that we intend that the same broad construction should be placed on the term "proceedings of the parliament" <P>


<a name="column_1448"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1448</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in this Bill as applies in relation to the equivalent privilege at Westminster. Therefore we are going no further than the Westminster privilege but we would hope that the same approach would be taken. The words "proceedings of parliament" have not been defined in statute for the purposes of Westminster. However, their meaning has been established by convention and case law over many years.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-29_para3"></a>We are aware that attempts have been made for some purposes to make explicit what activities the term "proceedings of the parliament" may include, albeit not in an exhaustive way. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred to the Defamation Act 1996. Section 13(4) of that Act sets out a range of activities which are to be construed as falling within the definition of things said or done,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the course of, or for the purposes of or incidental to, any proceedings in Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-29_para4"></a>These include, for example, communications with the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards or with any person having functions in connection with the registration of members' interests.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-29_para5"></a>In this Bill we are deliberately choosing to make a simple reference to "proceedings of the parliament". However, I recognise that there is an element of judgment being exercised in taking this approach. As I have mentioned, we intend that this reference should be taken to have the same broad scope as it has in the case of this Parliament. By relying on this general term, we also leave room for the development of new ways of working in the parliament which may not be easily foreseen at present, and we ensure that the privilege conferred by this clause need not be limited only to the particular types of parliamentary activity we are able to identify at the present time.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-29_para6"></a>We cannot accept this amendment. We have deliberately drawn the line around parliamentary proceedings. Provided that a particular statement can be construed as being made in that context, we think it right that it should benefit from this broad protection. The amendment, by contrast, seeks to protect in general terms communications between members of the Scottish parliament and particular types of person. Many of those may well in practice fall within the boundaries of parliamentary proceedings. For example, communications between a member of the Scottish parliament and the presiding officer may well fall within that category in certain circumstances. However, where for any reason such a communication does not fall into that category, we do not see that we could justify conferring this privilege upon it. Absolute privilege absolves a person from having to defend his statements on grounds of truth or absence of malice. Accordingly, the protection must be restricted.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-29_para7"></a>I do not think it is helpful to speculate on the circumstances in which the types of communication mentioned in the amendment might, or might not, be deemed to fall within the definition of being made in proceedings. Members of the Scottish parliament will have to judge where the boundaries lie in any particular case--as indeed do Members of this Parliament at present. We see no good reason for introducing any kind of blanket exemption on the lines proposed--that would <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>not be in line with the thinking behind this clause, which is properly concerned with the context within which statements are made.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-29_para8"></a>Finally, perhaps I may deal with the point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry. Once the Nicholls Committee reports, the contents and recommendations of the report will be taken on board and will be given proper and full consideration. With that, I invite the noble and learned Lord to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   This has been a useful debate arising out of what I originally saw as a comparatively small amendment. I fully accept the force of what the noble and learned Lord, the Lord Advocate, says about not wishing to extend to members of the Scottish parliament greater protection than might be available to Members of this House or another place. Equally, it is important that we raise the issue. As I understand it, the Nicholls Committee is seeking to examine the whole issue thoroughly. We may well return to some of the matters discussed by the committee in the taking of evidence when we consider Amendment No. 219G. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

I am pleased to say that Amendments Nos. 252A and 253, in the name of both the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, and my noble friend Lord Sewel, seek to address a minor defect in the Bill. We are in the happy position of accepting the suggestion put forward by the noble and learned Lord. My only regret is that the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, did not put her name to these amendments, in view of the discussion that we had outwith the Chamber.

<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para11"></a>Amendments Nos. 271R and 271S are of a fairly consequential nature.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para12"></a>The real issue is to seek to establish that the Scottish Law Officers should be independent of the Scottish executive and also independent of the United Kingdom Government. As the Committee will be aware, the Law Officers of the UK Government have separate departments. The Attorney-General and Solicitor-General are Ministers in the Law Officers' Departments in London and the Lord Advocate and Solicitor-General for Scotland are Ministers in the Lord Advocate's Department, which has offices in Edinburgh and London.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para13"></a>While the Law Officers' advice is regularly sought on policy development and in the planning and programme of Bills and discussions of major policy initiatives, and while they play an important role in taking Bills through this House and another place, they are in departments which are physically, administratively and constitutionally separate from the departments that contain the political Ministers. In my view, that separation is extremely important. It means that there is a separation between policy making and responsibility for such policy on sensitive and important political issues and, on the other hand, the role of the Law Officers, which is primarily involved in giving legal advice to government Ministers and assisting them with their parliamentary work.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para14"></a>Constitutionally, a veil has been drawn over the role which Law Officers play in giving advice to Government Ministers and their departments. The convention is that, in this Chamber and in another place, it is improper--I believe I use that word correctly--for a Minister at the Dispatch Box to acknowledge the existence of such advice, let alone the contents of it. I do not in any sense demur at the view that those are sensible conventions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para15"></a>However, the giving of such advice is not just a casual part of the everyday work of government. When a Minister or his department require advice, civil servants in his department--possibly working with their own solicitors--prepare instructions for the Law Officers which are then sent to the Law Officers' department to provide that legal advice at arm's length.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para16"></a>I have a number of reasons for suggesting that the Law Officers of the new parliament should not be members of the Scottish executive. First, it is not normal for a lawyer to give advice to a body of which he is a full member. That is not just the position within government; it is also the situation in private practice. When one looks at Clause 48(3) and (4), on which we have already had some discussion, it will be seen that not only are the Law Officers full members of the Scottish executive, but that the statutory functions of the individual Ministers can be exercised by any member of the executive, whoever that person is--subject of course to how the first minster may allocate individual responsibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para17"></a>Secondly, there is the role which the Government seek to give the Law Officers on devolution issues. We have already discussed that. Reference is made to the judicial committee prior to a Bill becoming an Act of <P>


<a name="column_1452"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1452</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Scottish parliament and it is obvious from the provisions of Schedule 6 that such role will continue after the Acts receive Royal Assent. I do not intend to rehearse what was said earlier, but the importance of the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General, if they are to be the Scottish Law Officers, taking an independent role cannot be overstressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para18"></a>A third reason why I believe it to be inappropriate for the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General for Scotland to be members of the Scottish executive is that the Lord Advocate will continue to discharge the role of independent public prosecutor. In exercising that role and discharging his duties, he will have to have regard to the public interest, not only of the people of Scotland, but also on occasion to the interests of the whole population of the United Kingdom. A number of the cases he has to handle are not necessarily just high profile ones, but the more routine cases which will involve the prosecution of people in England and working with UK bodies such as Customs and Excise.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para19"></a>A fourth reason for the view I hold is this. We are heading towards a parliament elected by proportional representation. That must increase the prospects of an executive having to be formed by some coalition or other. If members of more than one political party form the Scottish executive, there is a strong argument that the Lord Advocate should be outwith the executive. Whether he be a member of one political party or another, in a situation where he was a full member it might be much more difficult for him to be perceived to be acting in the independent way in which Law Officers are expected to act; a way in which anyone who holds a post as a Scottish Law Officer would wish to act.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para20"></a>I shall be interested to hear what the noble and learned the Lord Advocate and other noble Lords have to say in response to my amendments. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   With the noble and learned Lord's experience of office as a Law Officer, he will know that one of the responsibilities--and it is perhaps the least desirable and least enviable responsibility--is from time to time to advise the Government that they cannot do what they would like to do. As I understand it, the convention which applies within the United Kingdom system is that where a Law Officer so advises in firm terms--in particular terms--the Government do not act against that advice. Can the noble and learned Lord say whether anything in this Bill--or anything at all--indicates that in the context of devolution the same convention will apply to advice given by the Lord Advocate? That is a matter of considerable importance in connection with the various matters that have been discussed in relation to vires and so on. It has a bearing on the kind of issue that has been raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, in this amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I shall answer the point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry. <P>


<a name="column_1453"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1453</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>There is nothing specific in the Bill which would mirror that convention. It is expected that the convention would continue. Certainly I would be surprised if it did not.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   Why is it expected? We have heard a good deal about how the parliament will have a new convention. Everything will have to be redevised. In that context, why does he expect that it will be reflected? I hope it will be reflected. I share the noble and learned Lord's view that it should be reflected. If that is so, why are the Government not putting that on to the face of the Bill? If that is what they expect, if that is the way in which the parliament and the executive should behave, why is it not in the Bill? On what basis is it expected that the convention which exists will be applied? On a number of occasions, in this House and elsewhere, I have raised the point that there is nothing to replicate the conventions upon which the whole system works at present. If it is not replicated, upon what basis other than optimism does the noble and learned Lord believe that that will be replicated in this context?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_time0"></A><H5>10.15 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   If by "optimism" the noble and learned Lord means "confidence in the parliament", I accept that it is optimism and confidence that I have that the politicians and the executive will behave in a responsible manner. It is inconceivable that with the creation of Law Officers with the independence enshrined in the Bill that politicians would not follow this well-known practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para21"></a>The policy which the Bill reflects was summarised briefly in the White Paper. It recognised that the Scottish executive would require the services of Law Officers to provide it with advice on legal matters and to represent its interests in the courts and that the role and responsibilities of the Lord Advocate as prosecutor were to be devolved with his traditional independence maintained. The Bill delivers that policy and safeguards the Lord Advocate's independence in a number of its provisions. I do not propose to rehearse those in any detail.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para22"></a>The effect of Clause 45(3) is that the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General will cease to be Ministers in the United Kingdom Government and to be the United Kingdom Government's Scottish Law Officers. It is envisaged that that will take place shortly after the first appointment of the first minister so that the Scottish law officers will be part of the Scottish executive from the beginning and will be able to influence and to shape the working practices of the executive even before the principal appointed day when the Scottish ministers will acquire their full powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para23"></a>Clause 45(1) provides for the appointment and removal from office of the Scottish law officers. When the Lord Advocate ceases to be a member of the United Kingdom Government and becomes a member of the Scottish executive, it is proposed that he should retain his existing and traditional functions as head of the systems of criminal prosecution and investigation of deaths in Scotland. Those functions are to be retained <P>


<a name="column_1454"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1454</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by him in his own name and will be capable of being exercised only by him or, when he is unavailable, by the Solicitor-General for Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para24"></a>The Lord Advocate will be entrenched in that role by Clause 28(2)(e), which prevents the parliament from removing him from his position as head of those systems. This does not prevent the parliament from amending those systems, but Clause 45(2) confirms the continued independence of the Lord Advocate in his capacity as the head of those systems by providing that any decision of the Lord Advocate in that capacity,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall continue to be taken by him independently of any other person". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para25"></a>Those provisions secure the protection that the Lord Advocate requires to fulfil his responsibilities in a way that will uphold his traditional independence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para26"></a>As I explained previously in answer to a question from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, it is proposed that all the other functions currently exercised by the Lord Advocate which do not relate to his Law Officer functions will be transferred from him before he ceases to be a Minister of the Crown and becomes a member of the Scottish executive. That is important. As the noble and learned Lord will be aware, the Lord Advocate has functions which are executive in nature in relation to, for example, certain functions which are the responsibility of the Scottish courts' administration. Those functions, and involvement in the recommendations for appointment of industrial tribunal and other tribunal chairmen, are executive functions. Three other transfer of functions orders will be needed in order to effect that and, for the information of the Committee, I have laid working drafts of those transfer of functions orders in the Printed Paper Office.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para27"></a>One of the transfer of functions orders proposes to transfer to the Secretary of State functions which the Lord Advocate currently exercises in relation to devolved matters, apart from the functions which he is retaining. Those are executive functions. They will then be transferred to the Scottish ministers on D-day under Clause 49. All functions conferred on the Scottish ministers will be capable of being exercised by any of them. It will be for the first minister to determine the portfolios of individual Scottish ministers. The Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General will be Scottish ministers and the first minister could allocate some of those functions--or, indeed, additional functions--to them as Scottish ministers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para28"></a>In the light of that background, I turn to the amendments proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon. At present, because the Lord Advocate has certain executive functions--as a Law Officer, he gives legal advice to the Government--what is proposed is not incompatible with his present role in that regard. Nor is his involvement with the executive and these other executive functions incompatible with his role as an independent public prosecutor. The noble and learned Lord will be aware that throughout the centuries the Lord Advocate has been very jealous of the independence of his role as public prosecutor and has continued to act in the public interest both for the people of Scotland and for the <P>


<a name="column_1455"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people of the United Kingdom. That will continue after devolution. There is no inconsistency in his role as independent prosecutor and his role in performing certain executive functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para29"></a>Amendment No. 257B would prevent the Scottish law officers from exercising any of the statutory functions of a member of the Scottish executive other than those that are specific to a law officer. The Government cannot accept this amendment. It goes against the general approach in the Bill, which is to make all the functions transferred to or conferred upon Scottish Ministers capable of being exercised by any of them in accordance with whatever allocation of functions is decided upon by the first Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para30"></a>The amendment would also prevent the Scottish law officers from exercising any of the functions which are transferred to Scottish Ministers under Clause 49 or 59. It would deny them the opportunity to exercise the administrative and policy functions which are currently exercisable by them, for example, in relation to civil jurisdiction and procedure, diligence and the law of evidence and which will be transferred to Scottish Ministers. In practice it is likely that these kinds of policy functions which relate to the Scottish judicial system will be exercised by the Scottish minister responsible for civil justice matters. At the present time that is the Lord Advocate. There is no reason to deprive a future Lord Advocate of the opportunity of performing these functions if the first minister considers that it is appropriate that he should do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para31"></a>That will also be the case with regard to a number of functions which are currently exercised by the Lord Advocate or the Secretary of State in relation to tribunals concerned with reserved matters which it is proposed should be transferred to Scottish ministers by an order under Clause 59. These functions involve making, or being consulted about, appointments, procedural rules and other procedural matters. We also expect the first minister to allocate these functions to the Scottish minister responsible for civil justice matters. At present that is the Lord Advocate. Why after devolution should the first minister not be allowed to allocate that function to the Lord Advocate again if he considers that to be appropriate? In exercising those functions, the role of the relevant Scottish minister, whether it is the Lord Advocate or any other minister, will relate to his involvement in the civil justice system rather than any other policy interest of the Scottish executive in the matters concerned.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-30_para32"></a>It is appreciated that it may not be appropriate for the first minister to allocate certain of the functions of the Scottish ministers to the Scottish law officers, such as those which impinge on the criminal justice system, in view of their present prosecution responsibilities. That is observed at the present time. It is inconceivable that any Lord Advocate would accept any responsibility which conflicted with his independent function of prosecutor. However, the reasons given by the noble and learned Lord do not seem to be sufficient grounds to prevent certain appropriate policy functions from being allocated to the Scottish law officers if the first minister wishes to do so.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   It is with some trepidation that I venture into this field in the presence of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate and former holders of that office. It is not entirely clear why the Lord Advocate and Solicitor-General should be Scottish ministers within the Scottish executive who do not necessarily exercise law functions. Under Clause 26 of the Bill it is not necessary for the Lord Advocate or the Solicitor-General for Scotland to be a member of the Scottish parliament. In all probability the law officers will not be elected members of the parliament. They will no doubt be appointed under Section 45(1), and the traditional role, certainly of the Attorneys General in this jurisdiction and in Commonwealth jurisdictions, is to give independent advice to government on legal issues which that government have to consider. But making them members of the Scottish executive suggests to me that the doctrine of Cabinet collective responsibility has to be dented. The Scottish executive cannot have in its number the Lord Advocate and Solicitor-General for Scotland, who may be charged with other duties beyond their normal functions, and yet expect them to be bound by Cabinet collective responsibility or anything of that nature. Yet, if it is suggested that they should be, they are the people who, under Clause 32, for example, may refer questions as to whether a Bill or any provision of a Bill is within the legislative competence of the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para0"></a>They have to stand away from the decision of the Scottish executive if they consider that the Scottish executive is acting outside its powers. I can see the practicality of having Scottish law officers within the executive from the beginning to guide the new body, as the noble and learned Lord explained. I can see its practical utility; nevertheless, it seems to me that there cannot be collective responsibility for the decisions of the Scottish executive if they are part and parcel of that Scottish executive. I should be grateful if the noble and learned Lord can tell me whether I am entirely wrong in that assumption.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   The noble Lord is wrong. The position, as I sought to explain, is that at present the Lord Advocate has certain executive functions which are separate from the Law Officer functions and separate from his functions as a prosecutor. In exercising those functions, such as the responsibility for civil law, civil evidence and procedure, the Law Officers, in exercising those functions, are exercising an executive function as part of the executive. To that extent they would have collective responsibility in that regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para1"></a>On the other hand, when they act as Law Officers they do separate themselves from the executive and they give advice independently; similarly, when they act as prosecutors. The law is quite different from that in England in relation to the prosecution function. That is quite separate from the executive and there is no executive interference in the prosecutorial role and that would not be accepted or tolerated by any Lord Advocate, nor would the executive seek to interfere in that.
<P>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1457</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para2"></a>At present, the existing Law Officers, both Scottish and English, are part of the UK Government, so why should the position be different for the Scottish parliament? Why should the Scottish Law Officers not be part of the Scottish government and part of the Scottish executive, able to perform executive functions which are not incompatible with their functions as Law Officers or their functions as prosecutors, just as they perform certain executive functions now which are not incompatible with these functions?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para3"></a>As I said, it would be inconceivable that the first minister would allocate any of the responsibility for criminal procedure or anything of that kind to the Lord Advocate. That might well conflict with his role as a prosecutor. It might be seen to be influencing the prosecution by undertaking that. That is allocated to a different Minister, not the Law Officers in Scotland. I hope that that will have reassured the noble and learned Lord.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   Before the noble and learned Lord sits down--I should know the answer to this question--is there to be any form of parliamentary scrutiny of the first minister's allocation of duties among the members of the Scottish executive, in particular as to which functions he allocates to the Lord Advocate?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-31_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I, too, should know the answer. My recollection is that there is not. The parliament will be involved in the approval of the appointment of Ministers, but the allocation of duties as between Ministers would be a matter for the first minister.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   That accords with my understanding of the Bill, unless the function came from a Minister of the Crown through a Section 59 order. That might be an exception to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para4"></a>This debate has been useful. I do not believe that there is anything between the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate and myself about certain important parts of the future role of the Scottish Law Officers. First, if the Lord Advocate is to be devolved then his independent role as public prosecutor has to be protected. I fully acknowledge that in provisions in the Bill, as he says, his independence is enshrined.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para5"></a>Beyond that, I still have some uneasiness that the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General will be members of the Scottish executive and not part of a separate government department, as the UK Law Officers are. It is true, as the noble and learned Lord said, that the Lord Advocate has certain executive functions. I have a copy of the draft order and the briefing guide with it to which he referred. A long list of Bills sets out where his powers are to be found. Most of them relate to the making of appointments and the laying down of certain procedures to be followed by different tribunals. But, as the noble and learned Lord said, he has responsibility for civil procedure. He also has considerable responsibilities under the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987. It is appropriate that fully paid <P>


<a name="column_1458"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1458</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Law Officers should have responsibility there. He also has responsibilities under the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1997.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para6"></a>I am not against the Scottish Law Officers having executive functions of a non-political nature. My concern is as regards the provisions of Clause 48 which may make it possible, however unlikely, for more political responsibilities to be handed over in a situation where, as the noble and learned Lord said, it would be for the Law Officers to give advice which he is optimistic would be followed in accordance with the conventions applying at Westminster.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para7"></a>This is not an appropriate matter to press to a Division at this stage of the evening. However, I hope that over the Recess the Government will reflect on whether it may be possible to work out some means of establishing greater independence not just in the prosecutorial functions but also the other functions of the Lord Advocate. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, indicated, it is important that everyone is clear about the role of the Law Officers. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "80728-31_para11"></a>There are a number of reasons for the view I hold, which I shall endeavour to place briefly before noble Lords. The principal function of the Lord Advocate is to act as the independent public prosecutor in Scotland. He is in charge of the investigation of sudden deaths and in complete control of the prosecution system by which those accused of criminal conduct are brought before the courts. He has certain statutory powers to direct the police in their investigations, and his staff, the procurators fiscal and advocate deputes from time to time give instructions in individual cases.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para12"></a>In exercising that function the Lord Advocate and those who work under him act in the public interest. As I have observed, that public interest is not limited to the interests of the people who live in Scotland, nor is it limited to devolved matters.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para13"></a>Assessing the public interest requires taking account of much wider considerations, not least the national issues which arise relating to the misuse of dangerous drugs, firearms, health and safety at work considerations, et cetera. As we were scrutinising Schedule 5 to the Bill it would have been abundantly obvious that in those fields the legislative power is not being devolved because they are all reserved matters. Many of the offences currently prosecuted in Scotland in the name of the Lord Advocate are for breaches of legislation made in this Parliament, and that will remain the position when the Scottish parliament comes into existence.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para14"></a>In considering this issue I thought it would be helpful to look back at what happened in 1978 when the Scotland Bill was promoted by the Labour government of the day. The decision reached by the constitutional team, which formed part of the government and which included John Smith, who was a very successful Queen's Counsel in Scotland as well as being a highly respected politician, the then Solicitor-General for Scotland, the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, and the Lord Chancellor of the day who took part in certain of the debates in the Bill, was that the Lord Advocate's position should not be devolved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para15"></a>It is interesting to see what was said in the White Paper at that time. At paragraph 144 the separate character of Scottish law and the Scottish legal system was described, being especially recognised when the Union between Scotland and England came into being. It was said that in this distinctively Scottish field the government believed that extensive evolution was particularly appropriate. There were paragraphs dealing with Scottish private law and civil law and the role of the Law Commission. In paragraph 147 the White Paper dealt with the question of the criminal law. The Scottish administration and the devolved executive would also be given responsibility for the general criminal law including the right to create new offences, to redefine or abolish existing offences, to determine penalties and to regulate the treatment of offenders. However, it went on to point out certain exceptions, such as the misuse of drugs, explosives, firearms and so forth.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para16"></a>The important paragraph states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The enforcement of the criminal law through the police and the prosecution system, which in Scotland is not in any way under the control of the police, is part of the responsibility of the Government for the maintenance of law and order and the security of the state and will extend to offences within both devolved and other fields. It would not be right that responsibility for law enforcement should rest with members of an administration not directly answerable to Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para17"></a>I have to say that that summarises my concern most succinctly. It would not be right that responsibility for law enforcement should rest with members of an administration not directly answerable to Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para18"></a>Once devolution comes along and if the Lord Advocate becomes part of the Scottish executive, he will no longer be answerable to this Parliament for prosecutions which may be of concern to Members of Parliament for a variety of reasons; whether it be because the prosecution involves a major national interest or whether it be because it involves the prosecution of someone who resides in England but is <P>


<a name="column_1460"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1460</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>prosecuted in Scotland and whose MP is in England and who has no representative in Scotland. For whatever reason, from time to time cases will arise in respect of which Members of your Lordships' House and of another place will wish to question why a prosecution took place. They will no longer have that right. I believe, as the authors of the 1978 White Paper believed, that that would not be correct.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para19"></a>Although it is a lesser point, I also believe that it is important that the Lord Advocate, because he has to prosecute for contraventions of legislation passed by this Parliament, should have direct access to this Parliament and be a Member of the Government who have the responsibility of putting legislation through this Parliament. That right will be lost, even if it is possible, as may well be the case, that future Lords Advocate, if they were to be devolved, could be appointed Members of your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para20"></a>Finally, and again it is a lesser consideration, it would no longer be possible for the Lord Advocate to represent the United Kingdom whether in the courts of Luxembourg or Strasbourg or at any other international and Commonwealth conference which over the years Lords Advocate have attended.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-31_para21"></a>I fully accept that there will be an Advocate General who will do so, according to the Government's proposals. I fully accept it is possible that he will be able to discharge some of the roles. But he will not be capable of being answerable to this Parliament for the prosecution of crime. I believe that that is a serious flaw in the Government's proposals. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80728-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   I wish to ask the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate about the point raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon. Does he anticipate that the Lord Advocate, in carrying out his role as head of the prosecution service and dealing with a crime under, say, the Misuse of Drugs Act, would have to adopt the public policy interest as defined in the United Kingdom legislation, even though he was not a member of the United Kingdom executive? In other words, would he have to take the view that it was public policy as laid down in that statute rather than, for example, the view which he as a member of the Scottish executive might take on the issue of drugs, which would have a bearing on whether in any particular case a prosecution would be mounted?

<A NAME="80728-32_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I have one small point to make from a completely lay point of view. Scotland is a very small place. When the Lord Advocate is appointed, the first thing that will happen is that the elected members of the Scottish parliament will have to approve his appointment before the first minister can make a recommendation to Her Majesty. I believe that is right.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-32_para0"></a>There may be a squabble. We do not quite know how the whole thing will work out. The public will know that there has been a squabble. At the moment, they respect the system. They do not question it at all. They never wonder whether Her Majesty has appointed the <P>


<a name="column_1461"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1461</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>right Lord Advocate. Other lawyers may, but members of the public do not. It seems to me that his status will be very different as a result of this change. That is part of the problem which my noble and learned friend raises.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-32_para1"></a>I look at this matter as I believe the public will see it. They would discover, if there was a problem, that the Lord Advocate can be dismissed by the first minister and that that has nothing whatever to do with this Parliament. It will be very different. The Lord Advocate will be a much more local figure in the public view. Consequently, he will be more vulnerable to criticism. That is very important. I hope that the Government have thought this out carefully.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, that we have thought carefully about this. It follows on, to some extent, from the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, about the position in the 1970s when one was speaking about a Scottish assembly as opposed to a Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-32_para2"></a>Since the 1970s, a lot has changed. There has been the Scottish Constitutional Convention which deliberated long and hard on the question of the devolution of the legal system. I am sure that the noble Baroness and noble Lords will accept that one of the peculiarities and specialties of Scotland is its independent and separate legal system. Therefore, if one is devolving power to a Scottish parliament, one of the particular functions that is an obvious candidate for consideration is the legal system.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-32_para3"></a>As I say, that was considered at great length and in some considerable detail by the constitutional convention. The decision was that it should be devolved. Thereafter, the Government considered that matter and accepted that. That was reflected in the White Paper, which was the basis for the referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-32_para4"></a>The logic of the position adopted by the noble and learned Lord is that the legal system and, in particular, the peculiarly Scottish criminal legal system, should not be devolved. That is the logic, and can only be the logic, of his position because the Lord Advocate is head of the prosecution system. If you retain or reserve the Lord Advocate in London as a Law Officer in the United Kingdom Parliament, it is inconsistent with devolving the prosecution system, unless you are going to say that the whole system should change and that the Lord Advocate, after several centuries, should no longer be head of the prosecution system and that that should be passed, perhaps, to the Solicitor-General for Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-32_para5"></a>But there is another flaw in the noble and learned Lord's approach. He is seeking to separate the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General, leaving one in London with the United Kingdom and one in Scotland with the Scottish parliament. But that just will not do. As the noble and learned Lord will be aware, having held the office of Lord Advocate, the Law Officers Act 1944 provides that the Solicitor-General will be in a position and is empowered to discharge any functions of the Lord Advocate where the office of the Lord <P>


<a name="column_1462"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1462</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Advocate is vacant; or where the Lord Advocate is unable to act for any reason; or where the Lord Advocate authorises him to act on his behalf in a particular case. So, by splitting the two Law Officers, is the noble and learned Lord suggesting that the provisions of the 1944 Act should be cast aside? If that is the position, it will have very serious implications for the prosecution service in Scotland. I give way to the noble and learned Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I am much obliged. In moving the amendment I was proceeding on the assumption that, if the Committee was with me in principle, the Government would follow the normal convention of carrying out any necessary amendments to implement the wish of this Chamber. I fully accept that one could trawl through various Acts of Parliament and no doubt find provisions which might, on one view, be inconsistent with the principal amendment that I seek to make. I do not for a minute demur to the suggestion that the Scottish parliament will need Law Officers. However, I seek to raise the simple question as to why--and, indeed, it is suggested that my reasoning in this respect is flawed and my logic incorrect--if it was considered to be sensible in 1978, it is illogical, flawed and, quite frankly, a nonsense in 1998. I find that difficult to follow. That is the issue which I hope the noble and learned Lord will address.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-32_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I thought that I had done so. The position is that 20 years have passed since that time and the intention then was to have an assembly. However, that did not work out and it did not come into being. It may be that the noble and learned Lord and others regret that fact and wish to turn back the clock, but that is not possible. Since then we have had the constitutional convention and there has been much thought about the future governance of Scotland. It has been decided that the proper form of devolution, which the Government have adopted, is to devolve the criminal justice and the civil justice systems. The logical consequence of that is that the Lord Advocate will be devolved.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-32_para6"></a>If one is arguing for the retention of the Lord Advocate in London, then the logic behind that is that one is arguing for not devolving the criminal prosecution service. The reference by the noble and learned Lord back to the 1970s and the original arrangements of 20 years ago, where the Lord Advocate and the criminal prosecution service were not being devolved, suggests to me that what he really wants is the retention or the reservation of the criminal justice system. In my respectful submission, that fails to recognise the fact that it is sensible to devolve to Scotland the system of law and the system of prosecution, both of which are peculiar to Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-32_para7"></a>Perhaps I may attempt to answer the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Rodger. The Lord Advocate will, of course, have to take account of legislation, whether it is passed by the Scottish parliament or by the UK Parliament, and will have to decide whether it is appropriate to prosecute under it. As the noble and learned Lord will be aware, the simple fact that a piece of legislation creates an offence does <P>


<a name="column_1463"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1463</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not automatically mean that prosecution follows in every case. The Lord Advocate of the day and local fiscals exercise discretion and operate certain policies in relation to what may be considered to be less serious breaches of the legislation. The policy of the United Kingdom Parliament, in creating an offence, will be an overlay of the policy of the Lord Advocate himself in determining whether to prosecute.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-32_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   I accept, as the noble and learned Lord would readily understand, that anyone who has held the office knows that in the case of minor breaches or breaches involving young people, particular factors come into account. Leaving all these things aside, is it the position that the Lord Advocate would be bound by the public policy, as stated by the United Kingdom Parliament, for example in the case of drugs, in precisely the same way as he would be bound by the policy he has expressed in an act of the Scottish parliament in some devolved matter giving rise to a criminal offence? That is the issue which I am seeking to identify, leaving aside the particular factors which might of course apply in any given case.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   The short answer to that is yes. The question that I should like to propose to the House is why should noble Lords go against what was decided in the referendum which followed upon the White Paper, where it was quite clear that the question of the criminal justice system would be devolved and that the law officers would also be devolved?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-32_para8"></a>It is flattering to think that the noble and learned Lord wishes to retain me in London. I am flattered by the obvious affection in which he holds me. I regret that the legislation is such that, if I am fortunate enough to be appointed Lord Advocate, I would not remain in London, although I would hope to visit this Chamber on occasions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-32_para9"></a>So far as concerns Amendment No. 257A, I am not sure whether the noble and learned Lord spoke to that. The position there is that this amendment is unnecessary. The Lord Advocate will remain responsible for the appointment of staff within his office--namely, the particular legal staff that form the procurators fiscal--and would have a say in the appointment of senior members of the Civil Service serving in his staff.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80728-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for explaining the position. If he is devolved, I know that he will be welcomed back in this Chamber, although, like the rest of us, he will be on more modest pay and rations than he currently enjoys. He will also be in the fortunate position of not having to stand at the Dispatch Box and answer questions which, from time to time, Government Ministers find difficulty with.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para0"></a>I am not entirely convinced that a great deal has changed over the last 20 years. The office of Lord Advocate goes back for many centuries. To suggest that there has been such a sea change in thinking over the last 20 years or so is not a convincing argument. Equally, I am not convinced that the role of the Scottish <P>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1464</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>constitutional convention in this matter is of crucial importance. I may be wrong, but I was not aware of the convention carrying out detailed consultation with those who were actively involved in the criminal justice system. Jim Wallace, who is of course a Queen's Counsel, was an active member. I am not suggesting that there were not others but I have some doubts as to whether this important issue was as fully thrashed out as it might have been to give the decision of the convention, as it is described, quite the significance that the Government appear to have accorded to it.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para1"></a>I acknowledge, however, as I did at the outset of my remarks, that this was in the manifesto. For that reason, I do not think it would be constitutionally appropriate for me to seek the opinion of the Committee. But I have to say, quite frankly, on my own behalf, that long before I read the 1978 White Paper I considered the decision to be wrong. I am reinforced in that conclusion by the views which are set out there. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 19, line 5, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) The Parliament may change the terms "Scottish Executive" and "First Minister" to such other terms as it considers appropriate.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: In this amendment we are getting away from the heavy water of legal matters to rather simpler issues which I think I can deal with quickly. I hope that I shall receive a positive reply from the Minister, who will accept my amendment without hesitation! The Committee will recall that we discussed the, in my view, rather odd names that have been selected for the principal people in the Scottish parliament. The "top guy" is to be called the presiding officer and the "top political guy"--if I may call him that--is to be called the first minister. The government, so to speak, is to be called the Scottish executive. As always, when I suggested we might make the names more user friendly, I was chastised by the Minister, who said these were matters for the Scottish parliament. However, in this case I do not think I was told that. I should have been told that if the Government were being logical as regards their usual arguments; namely, that whenever we propose any change to Standing Orders or to anything else we are told that we should not attempt that here and that we should trust the new parliament. That is exactly what my amendment proposes to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para4"></a>In case the Committee thinks this is not a sensible amendment, I should say that I do not think the term "first minister" will be accepted, any more than the title "presiding officer". At the risk of a little laughter at my expense, I have mentioned another title created by government in the mid '80s which was not accepted for long either. However, I shall not let that title cross my lips this evening. I draw the Committee's attention to a Children in Scotland factsheet No. 41, which I read with <P>


<a name="column_1465"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1465</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>my usual interest. I could not avoid a double-take when I read the following paragraph describing the Scottish parliament,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Members of the Scottish Parliament will be elected by general election every four years. The parliament will have a Presiding Officer (the Speaker), Ministers, a Clerk and a First Minister (effectively the Scottish Prime Minister)". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para5"></a>The simple fact of the matter is that whatever this Chamber decides, the popular press--I am not sure whether you call the other lot the unpopular press--and the heavyweight press, as it were, will use these shorthand titles which people understand. I have been round this course before. My amendment does not state that the first minister should be called the premier or the prime minister. It does not state that the Scottish executive should be called the government of Scotland or anything like that. It states simply that the parliament should be able to change the terms to any other terms it thinks appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para6"></a>Let us start off with what the Government want in the Bill, as I have learnt that what the Government want they will jolly well have, like spoilt children. So let the Government have what they want, but let us give the parliament--in the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay of Cartvale--the power to change that, so that we stand by what we believe to be the good sense of the parliament and do not second guess what titles the parliament or the people concerned will be given. It seems to me this is an amendment the Government ought to accept to give the parliament the power to make changes to these titles as it thinks fit. If it thinks what we have handed down from this Parliament is appropriate, it will adopt those terms. Let us trust the parliament as Ministers here have said. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   My noble friends and I strongly support this amendment. It is akin to my Amendment No. 256, which we have already debated but to which we shall return in the running order of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para7"></a>Not only do I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, that these words will not survive; they are thought to be rather ridiculous. To me, a presiding officer is a person sitting at my village polling station, and I know of no other use for the phrase. I could go on, but do not want to be repetitive.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para8"></a>I wish to make one important point. I distinctly recall that, when the White Paper was published and presented in the other place, the Secretary of State for Scotland made it clear that these names were not set in stone and that they were simply there as handy guidance since some words had to written into the Bill. I hope that that will be the attitude of the Government. What a splendid relief it would be to us all if, just occasionally, a Minister would come to the Dispatch Box and say, "You have a point, we'll accept it. Let us move on to the next subject".
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I support the amendment moved by my noble friend. Many years ago, as an Under-Secretary at the Home Office, I had the responsibility of maintaining liaison with the "government of Northern <P>


<a name="column_1466"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1466</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ireland" as it was called. It was not called an "executive"; it was called a "government". The head of that government was known as the Premier.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para9"></a>It is only right that we should have some flexibility in this matter to enable the Scottish parliament/government in years to come to choose those expressions that it thinks most appropriate. The amendment deserves support.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-33_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   The amendment would allow the Scottish parliament to change the titles of various officers in the parliament and of the executive. It represents a course that we have been over before in Committee, rather thoroughly as I remember it, on one of the early days which have all merged into one in a haze in my mind at this stage. We went into the details at some length.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para10"></a>I am afraid that I shall be consistent, in that I can only repeat my earlier remarks. I appreciate the noble Lord's arguments, which have not changed since our earlier discussions on the subject. I give way to the noble Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Baroness. Before she goes on to develop this argument, I must remind her that my previous amendment stated that "First Minister" should become "Premier". This amendment does not say that; it says that the term should remain the same, but that the parliament should be allowed to change it if it wishes. It is quite a different argument. I hope that we are not to hear a repeat of the previous argument advanced by the Government.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-33_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord for pointing that out. We were aware of it. He could not possibly be moving the same amendment as he proposed earlier. The principle is the same. While we appreciate the noble Lord's argument that the parliament should be able to decide for itself the titles of its executive, its Ministers and its key officers, we believe that the certainty and consistency achieved by prescribing the titles from the outset is essential. The prescription is necessary to maintain a consistency in references throughout the Bill and in future legislation, as well as in other formal documents through successive sessions of the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para11"></a>We are well aware of the speculation as to other titles that might be used. Incidentally, I did not see the significance that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, seemed to give to a factsheet for children explaining that the first minister in a Scottish parliament would be what they knew as a Prime Minister in the Westminster Parliament. That does not seem any great argument for changing the title of first minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para12"></a>The titles used in the Bill are clear and unambiguous and suit their purpose. "First Minister" describes the role and avoids confusion with office holders in Westminster--a not unimportant point which noble Lords opposite never seem to accept. It is consistent with the Northern Ireland Assembly. The noble Lord, Lord Renton, mentioned Northern Ireland, but I must point out that that assembly here and now has a First Minister. That seems to have been readily accepted <P>


<a name="column_1467"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1467</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>across the media in respect of Northern Ireland, and I do not see why it should be different when it comes to Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para13"></a>The Welsh assembly is to have a first secretary. Generally, the titles were used throughout the White Paper and therefore they were the titles that the people of Scotland became familiar with during the referendum campaign. During that campaign, of which I was very much a part, as were some other Members of your Lordships' House, those titles were used all the time. I do not think noble Lords opposite are suggesting that the referendum meant that everything to do with the parliament did not have a good airing in Scotland. As the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, was good enough to mention more than once, the results were a resounding victory of "Yes" to both questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-33_para14"></a>The titles have been carefully chosen to avoid confusion with the Westminster Parliament and Whitehall Ministers. No doubt people will develop their own way of referring to them, and I do not want to speculate on that. Different titles might be used in the day-to-day operation of the parliament. For example, people might want for working purposes to add to the titles of Scottish ministers so as to distinguish them according to their portfolios. That would mean people would refer to a particular Scottish minister as "the Scottish minister for health", "the Scottish health minister", "the Scottish education minister" and so on. But the titles would have no legal status. By prescribing simple, straightforward titles, we hope to ensure that there is no confusion between officers and positions so that everyone knows where they stand and what their responsibilities are. I ask noble Lords to withdraw their amendment.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I have to disillusion the noble Baroness. I know she does not have much time to go to Scotland at the moment. We all understand that. But there is enormous confusion about who these people are. The fact that the referendum was a resounding "Yes" has not sorted out in people's minds who the first minister is and who is the presiding officer. There is much confusion; people do not know what is what. Some laugh about it when you explain. So the die is not cast and I do not believe the Minister should use that argument, whatever other argument she uses.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I am afraid that the noble Baroness will have to allow me to choose which arguments I use. As for my presence in Scotland, since the referendum I have been much more in Scotland than <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para0"></a>I do not want to get into a competition about how many hours one clocks up in Scotland or England. It is not relevant. However, I have no reservations about believing that I am just as much in touch with the people of Scotland as any other Member of your Lordships' House.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   Perhaps I may press the noble Baroness as to what she meant when she said that, although the titles would not have statutory effect, parliament could decide to call those in the parliament what it liked. That would square with what the Secretary of State said in answer to questions in the House at the time the White Paper was published.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para1"></a>Perhaps we may be clear. The Minister is not saying that anything in the Bill prevents the Scottish parliament deciding that its first minister should be called the premier or that the presiding officer should be called the speaker. That would square with the undertaking given by the Secretary of State at the time of the publication of the White Paper.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I shall make two points. First, that is not what I said. I said that what people might develop as their own way of referring to the office holders was something on which I would not speculate. They may well decide to refer to people in different ways. I was not talking about the parliament changing the title.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para2"></a>Secondly, what my right honourable friend the Secretary of State was indicating when he spoke was that at the time this was still going to be looked at. We have looked at it. This is the Bill; not the White Paper. This is what the Government have decided is the best way forward on these titles. I made that very clear earlier in Committee. I am being consistent. It is still the view of the Government. There is no contradiction in what was said by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State then and there is no other meaning to what I said just now.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   Is the noble Baroness saying that this Bill, if passed into legislation in its present form, will prevent the Scottish parliament from choosing better names than it contains? If that is what she is saying, we shall have to come back to this matter at Report stage.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I am saying that in statute these are the titles.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Clyde: </B>   On another occasion we passed an amendment to Schedule 4 which provides, among other things, that the Scottish parliament may amend,

<A NAME = "80728-34_para3"></a>What is the consistency in allowing the alteration of names of judges--as it is delightfully put--but not the names of senior Ministers?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale:  </B>   In fact, to put it bluntly and in layman's terms, because they are different jobs.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   The real answer to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Clyde, is that there is no answer to that. The noble Baroness ought sometimes to score out the word "resist", because it sounded as though we were attacking one of the pillars of the whole devolutionary settlement, such was the vigour of her resistance.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para4"></a>To be fair to the noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, I confirm to my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour that the Minister does indeed spend most weekends in Scotland. I know this--I suppose I had better be open about it--because I meet her on the aeroplane, though nowhere else.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para5"></a>In relation to my quote from the Children in Scotland fact sheet, that is a serious organisation. It is in fact the Scottish all-party parliamentary group for children whose convenor is Maria Fyfe MP. So it was not a kind of child's guide to the Scottish parliament; it was a serious guide for people--grown-ups--who are interested in the family policy of the Scottish parliament. I drew the attention of the Committee to that paragraph because it is an indication of what inevitably is going to happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para6"></a>I must say that I felt that the resistance of the noble Baroness was about the worst piece of resistance we have seen. I cannot believe that the instructions from on high are such that they will not allow any give and take--as the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, said--on a subject which seems to be not at all peripheral to the whole project of devolution. My suspicions are that it has got "Downing Street" stamped all over it and there must be nobody else in the United Kingdom who is called "Prime Minister" or anything vaguely like that. It is amazing how other countries in the world with federal constitutions are able to cope with having people of the same name. I am so appalled at that answer that I shall seek the opinion of the Committee.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   moved Amendment No. 255D: 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 19, line 5, at end insert--
<BR>
("( ) No Minister of the Crown may be appointed as a Scottish Minister or as a Scottish Law Officer.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: Those Members of the Committee, such as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, who were keen on the Welsh Bill will readily recognise this amendment. It deals with the subject of the interrelationship between this parliament and the Scottish parliament. I am one of those who think that if people wish, and if the electorate is willing, they should be allowed to be Members of this Parliament and of the Scottish parliament, of this Parliament and of the European Parliament, and of the European Parliament and of the Scottish parliament. One could throw local government into the combination as well. It seems to work reasonably well on the Continent and I do not see why it should not work here.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para10"></a>However, there is a difference when it comes to people holding responsible office in either this Parliament or the Scottish parliament. This amendment deals with the question of whether somebody could be a Minister of the Crown here at Westminster and a minister or a law officer in a Scottish parliament. That assumes that that person was elected to both bodies.
<P>


<a name="column_1471"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1471</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para11"></a>We have had some problem with this question in the Welsh Bill because Mr. Ron Davies actually and actively thinks that he can be both Secretary of State and first minister of the Welsh assembly. The position is different in Scotland. Mr. Donald Dewar thought that he could be both--that is, for about 10 minutes. He then realised that the position was untenable and indicated quickly that, as he wished to stand for the Scottish parliament and wished to be considered as first minister, he would not keep the office of Secretary of State in those circumstances. I am not too sure whether he said that he would resign the office of Secretary of State before he stood for the Scottish parliament. I rather suspect that that is, indeed, what he did say, but in any case he made it clear, as far as I can recall from the press reports, that he did not think that it was consistent to be Secretary of State for Scotland and first minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para12"></a>This has been debated in some detail in the course of the Welsh Bill and I believe that it will be debated in your Lordships' House again tomorrow when the Welsh Bill makes a reappearance here along with the Commons amendments. Last week, on 22nd July, Mr. Peter Hain, one of the Ministers at the Welsh Office, was discussing this and said at col. 1181 of Commons Hansard:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Nobody seriously argues that the same person can be the Secretary of State for Wales and Assembly First Secretary in perpetuity. It would be politically unacceptable and constitutionally undesirable". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para13"></a>To be fair to Mr. Hain, he believes that for a short period to begin with it may be possible but that in the long term it is not. Mr. Hain is nearly right, by which I mean that he should not qualify his comment; namely, it is not possible in the short term or long term. How can someone who is a Minister along the corridor or here--perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, not necessarily the Secretary of State--be elected to the Scottish parliament and be a Minister in that parliament?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para14"></a>I ask those noble Lords who have had ministerial office to remember the guidance for Ministers, in particular about collective responsibility. At nine o'clock this evening the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, in replying to another debate, gave a certain answer. I wrote it down and might not have recorded it exactly. He said that UK Ministers are accountable to the UK Parliament and Scottish Ministers will be accountable to the Scottish parliament. How can the same person be accountable to both? They are different parliaments and governments. Such a person cannot be part of the collective responsibility of one parliament and part of the collective responsibility of another. He will break the collective responsibility of one or the other. Even if it is the same party in government--frankly, there is some doubt about that on the basis of Scottish opinion polls--there will be times when inevitably there will be differences in emphasis or priorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para15"></a>There is no point in devolution if the Scottish parliament and executive always adopt the same policies as the UK Government. Obviously, those differences will be greater if there is a coalition government in the Scottish parliament, as is perhaps inevitable, and a single party government in Westminster, even if there is an overlap of parties. The differences will be greater still <P>


<a name="column_1472"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>if there are governments of different parties here and in Scotland. If there were a coalition in Scotland one could envisage that a minor partner in it might be the main party in the House of Commons down the corridor. Therefore, if a Minister in the one could be a Minister in the other the position would be almost impossible.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para16"></a>I remind the noble Lord, Lord Sewel--if it is he who is to reply--of his answer at nine o'clock this evening. I do not believe that, as Mr. Hain said the other day, it is possible to be a Minister in both parliaments, aside from the fact that it appears to be taking greed for ministerial office to the nth degree. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_time3"></A><H5>11.30 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-34_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   It is quite clear that the concept of a person being a Minister in the Scottish parliament while also being a Minister in the UK Parliament raises some constitutional niceties. The question is whether we need to deal with that expressly in the Bill or leave it to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the first instance and the First Minister in Scotland to decide if there are any quite exceptional circumstances in which perhaps for a short period there is merit in one person being a Minister in both governments.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para17"></a>I fully recognise the concept of collective responsibility and how that concept strains the constitutional convention. But it is a constitutional convention. Constitutional conventions have the ability to evolve, change and adapt to circumstances at the time. It is quite possible that this particular constitutional convention will be capable of an evolution and an adaptation in the way that makes an accommodation to the particular circumstance to which the noble Lord is referring.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para18"></a>There may be a case. Let us take an example. Let us look forward, say, 25 years. I use 25 years because by that time we may have a Conservative government, if things go badly wrong; there may be a Conservative government here at Westminster and, who knows, a Conservative administration in Holyrood. Let us suppose that there has been a long-running crisis on the common fisheries policy and there is one man in Britain who everybody clearly sees and identifies as the man who can actually square the circle and deliver a proper settlement, not only for Scotland but for the United Kingdom. That man is, of course, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish. Lord Mackay steps forward for a short period of time to deal with this major crisis, this major disrupting influence in the politics of Europe and in the politics of the United Kingdom; the Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish carries the heavy burden. As Cincinnatus was called from the plough, Lord Mackay is called from the salmon, and he delivers this signal service to his fellow countrymen by being, for that short period, able to represent the interests of the Scottish administration and the interests of the United Kingdom Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-34_para19"></a>Of course, that is very far fetched, but there is an element of truth in the situation that could arise. It would arise only in exceptional circumstances, only for a very limited period of time when, in the initial judgment of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the First Minister in Scotland one person could do <P>


<a name="column_1473"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1473</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a particular job in very exceptional circumstances. At this stage I would not like to rule that possibility out. I believe that it is something that is extremely unlikely, but we do not have to rule it out by putting the prohibition in the Bill.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   Having listened very carefully to what the noble Lord has said, I wonder whether he can clarify his argument by giving us a single example of any devolved or regional government anywhere in the world in which a minister of the central government was also a minister of the devolved or regional government. Is there the slightest precedent anywhere?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   If my memory serves me correctly, there have been cases in the French regions where people-- I do not know whether the term "minister" is used, but I believe so--where ministers have been used while serving as ministers in the central government. I am not absolutely certain on that, and I shall try to make that clear and shall write to the noble Lord.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   With the greatest respect, in France, which I heard the noble Lord mention, the only example that one can find is not really this example. There has been more than one case of a Prime Minister of France having been the mayor of one of the cities, but that is quite different.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My noble friend Lord Renton is right. The only merit in the noble and learned Lord's answer is that he at least tried to cover the total inadequacy of the answer with some amusement and in that way hoped to divert the Committee's attention from the total vacuum at the centre of the ministerial argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para0"></a>I think that the Minister failed to convince any Member of the Committee. I suspect that he even failed to convince himself. My noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Drumadoon said that in 25 years I should probably have to be called from the grave. I thought that that was rather unkind, especially with the excellent example of my noble friend Lord Renton who at this deep hour of the night, at long past 85 years, is still here and asking penetrating questions. Frankly, on this amendment my noble friend may agree that he did not have to be very penetrating to get through the Government's guard.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para1"></a>That was perhaps the Minister's poorest argument. When he awakens in the morning he might reflect on his worst argument in the Bill. I suspect that this is it. If he and his officials cannot conjure up a better argument than that, they had better bring forward an amendment of their own at Report stage to ensure that we cannot have this double ministerial office. If they do not do so, I shall return to the matter at a time of day when I might have a better chance of winning. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon </B>   moved Amendment No. 255E:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 19, line 15, at end insert ("or persons").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para6"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: Amendments Nos. 255E and 255F are two small amendments to Clause 42. They deal with the situation where there is a vacancy in the office of first minister. Subsection (4) provides that in such situations the functions exercisable by him shall be exercisable by a person designated by the presiding officer.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para7"></a>Such a situation could arise after the parliament had been dissolved and voters and potential members were awaiting the next general election. It could arise where parliament for whatever reason had failed to agree on a first minister and an extraordinary general election required to be called. In circumstances far less remote than those we have been discussing, it might be desirable to have more than one person involved in the discharge of the first minister's duties. For example, if the only way in which an administration could be formed were by some form of coalition, the presiding officer might take the view that it would be sensible to involve members of political parties who were standing for election to the parliament as the persons who should discharge these functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para8"></a>I hope that this will be accepted as a constructive suggestion. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-35_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   I accept that the intention underlying the amendment is constructive but I regret to say that I do not think that the amendments are appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para9"></a>With Amendment No. 255E, the noble and learned Lord is attempting to provide that the presiding officer is able to appoint more than one person to carry out the role of the first minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para10"></a>The provisions in Clause 42 are intended to ensure that there is always someone able to perform the functions of the first minister and act as head of the administration. In practice, it is expected that each first minister will hold office until replaced by a successor. But there could be circumstances where the post falls vacant, for example on the death of a first minister, or where the first minister is unable to act temporarily. In that situation the presiding officer is authorised to designate someone.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para11"></a>However, it is a single office and we think that it would be inappropriate to enable more than one person to be designated to perform the duties of that office. If more than one person were designated, two or more people would come within the category of first minister; and how would it be decided who would do what in these circumstances?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para12"></a>With Amendment No. 255F the noble Lords would introduce yet more inappropriate words into the Bill. It is already quite clear that the person designated to act as first minister would be doing so in the capacity of a caretaker. It is not necessary to require the presiding officer to specify how long such arrangements will be in place, nor, on purely practical grounds, would it be reasonable to require him to do so. In the case of illness <P>


<a name="column_1475"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1475</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it would not be known how long the first minister might be incapacitated, and accordingly it would not be appropriate to fix a determinate period.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para13"></a>With that explanation I urge the noble and learned Lord to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-35_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I am disappointed that my suggestion has not been accepted, but it is clearly not a matter of any great importance. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "80728-35_para18"></a>The noble Earl said: In speaking to this amendment I speak also to Amendment No. 255H. Amendment No. 255G is a drafting amendment. Its purpose is to sharpen up the language of the opening sentence of Clause 43, which deals with the choice of the first minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para19"></a>I contend that the word "when" is more appropriate than "if". The first sentence in Clause 43(1) gives the wrong impression. It is not a case of "if" in regard to the choice of a first minister after a general election, a death in office or some other event; it is a case of when one of these events has occurred.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para20"></a>Apart from the insertion of one other condition, that of mental ill health as in Amendment No. 255H, there are no other opportunities for a first minister to be chosen. The word "when" is therefore correct, that is, unless a first minister does not have to be chosen. I do not believe that that is an option open to the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para21"></a>The more substantive amendment, Amendment No. 255H, introduces a further example of when a first minister would have to be chosen. The amendment describes the situation where a first minister will stand down because of admission to hospital under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 or in the event of him or her becoming subject to a guardianship order or having a curator bonis appointed to supervise his or her affairs. These would clearly be very sad occurrences, but they could happen, for example after a bad road accident in which the injuries sustained rendered the first minister permanently and legally incapable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para22"></a>There are two points to raise in this connection. The Mental Health Act 1983, an English Act, is not only a reserve matter within the Bill but the reservation ties members of the Scottish parliament and the presiding officer into Section 141 of that Act. How can this be? The Mental Health Act 1983 does not extend to Scotland. Surely a reservation should be made introducing an amendment to the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. I hope that on Report the Government bring forward a suitable amendment to deal with that.

<A NAME = "80728-35_para23"></a>My second point relates to the urgent need for a Scottish Bill to modernise and overhaul the legislation relating to incapable adults. I believe that this should feature in the first session of the Scottish parliament--it is that important. When that incapable adults' legislation is passed by the Scottish parliament, it will be necessary to approach the Westminster Parliament to update Section 141 of the Mental Health Act 1983.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para24"></a>I believe that this issue is in need of amendment and further thought. How can this English Act run with any credibility in Scotland? I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-35_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   Although it would be extremely tragic, the first minister could have an accident. Provision was made in the Government of Wales Bill in case the first minister became incapable of doing his job properly. I was under the impression that the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, intended to make a similar provision in the Scotland Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-35_para25"></a>It would be tragic, but it could happen. Will the Minister consider that point, because the Scotland Bill makes no such provision?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-36_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I am most doubtful about these two amendments. The word "when" indicates that various events to be mentioned later are inevitable, but not all of them are inevitable. They may never occur. One may occur during the poll at a general election while the first minister is in office. Frankly, in this context, "when" and "if" are virtually synonymous and I do not see the need for the change.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para0"></a>As for adding to the Bill references to the first minister being in hospital for mental reasons, or becoming subject to a guardianship order, or having a curator bonis appointed, they are sad events and if any of them occurred the first minister would inevitably be required to resign. I believe that it is over-zealous of us to try to write it into the Bill.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-36_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Clearly, my efforts at defending the Government's position on the last but one amendment have been recognised and rewarded and I am left with the job of dealing with the mad first minister!
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para1"></a>As regards Amendment No. 255G, I am at a loss to understand how the substitution of "if" with "when" leads to any greater precision. I am tempted to the view that if we explore that at any great length we might finish up falling under the auspices of Amendment No. 255H. I shall not detain the Committee any longer on that business. I do not understand the argument that in this context "when" is of greater precision than "if". I do not see that at all. Furthermore, I do not believe that the Government need to accept Amendment No. 255H, which we consider inappropriate and unnecessary, partly for the reasons which the noble Lord, Lord Renton adduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para2"></a>The noble Earl argued that there is no provision in the Bill to take account of the incapacity of the first minister. That is not the case on a proper reading of the Bill. I suggest that the Bill makes more than adequate provision to deal with cases where the first minister is unable to act. For example, if at any time it appeared to <P>


<a name="column_1477"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1477</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the presiding officer that the first minister was unable to act for whatever reason, including mental illness, it would be open to him, under Clause 42(4) to designate an MSP to exercise the function of the first minister. That provision is sufficiently wide to enable the presiding officer to deal appropriately with every eventuality.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para3"></a>Should it become clear that the first minister's inability to carry out his function was not merely temporary, we should expect the first minister to resign, as the noble Lord, Lord Renton, indicated. But should he not resign and should it be a particularly grave mental illness, the Scottish parliament could effectively remove him and his executive through a vote of no confidence, which would have the effect of bringing about the resignation virtually automatically. In turn, that would lead to the appointment of a new first minister. That would be a fairly drastic turn of events but it would operate in a way which would allow as much dignity as possible to be maintained with the need for effectiveness. Therefore, I do not believe that these amendments are necessary and on that basis, I ask the noble Earl to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-36_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I do not wish to continue the argument about "if" and "when" except to say that I believe that "when" sounds more definite.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para4"></a>With regard to Amendment No. 255H, we have now established that the presiding officer may have to relieve the first minister of his command. That is always tricky because if you are wrong, you are guilty of whatever is the political equivalent of mutiny by relieving someone of his command when he did not deserve it. I shall say no more. I continue to hope that the Government will think further about the issue. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: Perhaps I can offer the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, and the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, some advice on "if" and "when". If we think about finishing this Bill, it sometimes becomes not a matter of "when" but "if" we finish the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para10"></a>This group of amendments deals with the appointment of Ministers and junior Ministers in Clauses 44 and 46 respectively. The amendments address the same points in both clauses. If I pair the amendments, that may be the quickest way in which to probe and ask the Minister for his advice on a number of matters.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para11"></a>First, I deal with Amendments Nos. 255J and 255T. Both amendments deal with the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with the approval of Her Majesty". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1478"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1478</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para12"></a>Let us take just one of the clauses because they are mirror images of each other. Those words are in the very first line of Clause 44. When I became a member of the Privy Council and when I was elevated to the House of Lords, I was aware that Her Majesty's hand was somewhere in the background. When I became a junior Minister at the Scottish Office and even a Minister of State at the Department of Social Security, I was not aware of the approval of Her Majesty being sought or being granted. Therefore, I wonder whether we have similar arrangements here at Westminster other than for the great offices of Secretaries of State who, I know, must trot up to Buckingham Palace when they leave and take up office. I just wonder how that approval will be sought and how it will be indicated.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para13"></a>In the same vein, Amendments Nos. 255M and 255W relate to Clause 44(3)(a) and Clause 46(4)(a) respectively and deal with the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"shall hold office at Her Majesty's pleasure". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para14"></a>But what exactly does that mean in practical terms? Amendments Nos. 255L and 255V deal respectively with subsection(2) of Clause 44 and subsection (3) of Clause 46 which say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The First Minister shall not seek Her Majesty's approval for any appointment ... without the agreement of the Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para15"></a>I wonder what the latter words--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"without the agreement of the Parliament"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para16"></a>actually mean. In other words, how is that to be achieved? Is there to be a vote on every appointment of a Minister or a junior Minister? That would be rather unusual. In this Parliament, if the Prime Minister appoints people and he has the approval of the House of Commons, everyone else follows in his wake, so to speak. If that were not the case, we would be having quite a few votes over the next few days given all the changes that have recently taken place. Indeed, we might be voting to keep some of the people who have gone and also voting to get rid of some of them who have not gone.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para17"></a>Amendments Nos. 255N and 255X seek to introduce some new words to the two clauses. For example, subsection (3)(c) of Clause 44 currently says that a Minister,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may at any time resign and shall do so if the Parliament resolves that the Scottish Executive no longer enjoys the confidence of the Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para18"></a>I understand that if the whole executive does not enjoy the confidence. But what if that applies to one Minister? My amendment would make the paragraph say that a Minister,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may at any time resign and shall do so if the Parliament resolves that either he or the Scottish Executive no longer enjoys the confidence of the Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para19"></a>It would deal with the situation where the parliament loses confidence in an individual Minister. I do not believe that this Chamber has ever become involved in such matters, but, in the other place, there is a Motion to reduce a Minister's salary, which is a vote of no confidence in that particular Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para20"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendments Nos. 255K and 255U which deal with the number of Ministers to be appointed. In Clause 44, I suggest that we should have <P>


<a name="column_1479"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1479</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>up to six Ministers, and in Clause 46 I suggest that we should have up to six junior Ministers. That makes a total of 12. Currently--at least this morning--there were six Ministers in all in the Scottish Office. I am not sure whether that total has been kept because my recollection is that there were only five Ministers in the Scottish Office before the last election. I suspect that the Government needed another one because of this Bill, so I make no complaint in that respect. It means that six Ministers are doing this work. Therefore, I think that I am being pretty generous when I limit the number of Ministers in the Scottish executive doing, by and large, the same work, to 12. In fact, I am being more than generous, but I am trying to look after the interests of the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, who, if he manages to get to the Scottish parliament and if his party manages to win, may want a ministerial job. So the more Ministers I create the better his chances will be, although I am not entirely sure that the noble Lord is terribly appreciative of my efforts on his behalf.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para21"></a> However, seriously speaking, I believe that up to 12 Ministers is sufficient. I should like to know how many Ministers the Government envisage. On the face of it, they will probably tell me that I ought to leave this to the good sense of the parliament. But, as I have not been allowed to leave much to the good sense of the parliament this evening, I do not think that that argument will do. As I said, I should like some indication of how many Ministers the Government envisage in this respect. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-36_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   I wish to refer only to Amendment No. 255J, which proposes to leave out the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"with the approval of Her Majesty". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para22"></a>Those words raise a rather important constitutional matter. The constitution is, to some extent, flexible and, to some extent, obscure. However, as far as we know, the broad principle, or perhaps I should say, the usual practice is that Her Majesty acts only on the advice of the Prime Minister and is normally required to accept that advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-36_para23"></a>It is suggested in this amendment that the first minister of the Scottish executive should seek the approval of Her Majesty before other members of the executive are appointed. That introduces a new constitutional concept. One wonders, is the Queen expected to obtain the advice of the Prime Minister before giving that approval? How do the Government envisage that? We really must get it right. Our constitution is something for which we should have great respect. We should not alter any broad principle of it unless there are strong reasons for doing so. Where Her Majesty is concerned, I should have thought that we needed to have Her Majesty's approval before doing so.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-37_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   The noble Lord gives us a package of amendments which seek to rewrite the machinery for the appointment, approval and removal of ministers and junior ministers of the Scottish executive. We cannot accept them.
<P>


<a name="column_1480"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1480</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para0"></a>What the Government propose in this Bill is a carefully thought out set of arrangements which build on the provisions of the White Paper. Before turning to the detail of the amendments, I think it might be helpful to explain why Clause 44 and Clause 46, which deal with junior ministers, are framed in the way they are.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para1"></a>We propose that it will, quite properly, be for the first minister to select whom he wishes to serve in his ministerial team from among the members of the parliament. We have provided that the appointment of ministers and junior ministers must be approved by Her Majesty, as we promised would be the case in paragraph 9.6 of the White Paper. However, we have also built in a formal role for the parliament in approving the appointment of ministers. We are giving discretion to the first minister to remove ministers from office and we are ensuring that if the executive loses the confidence of the parliament, then all ministers shall cease to hold office. That is the framework that we are providing.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para2"></a>I must say that I find the amendments put down by the noble Lord to be an interesting but curious bunch. I am grateful to the noble Lord for his explanation of what prompts his proposals, but I am not attracted by his solutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para3"></a>Taking each proposal in turn, Amendments Nos. 255J, 255M, 255T and 255W in effect remove the involvement of the Crown in the appointment and removal of ministers and junior ministers of the Scottish executive. As the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, observed, the appointments of UK Government Ministers are of course all approved by Her Majesty and UK Ministers hold their office at Her Majesty's pleasure.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para4"></a>Some of us have been poring over the recent press release from No. 10, which contained the words, "Her Majesty has approved the appointment of" and then lists them all.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para5"></a>Does the noble Lord wish to argue that after the establishment of the parliament the status of a minister carrying out significant duties, say, in relation to education in Scotland, should be different from what it is at present and will continue to be elsewhere in the United Kingdom? I think that that sort of gesture sends completely the wrong message, particularly from someone who wishes to maintain the strength of the Union.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para6"></a>It seems to me that it would be completely wrong to say that, although a UK Minister is appointed by the Crown and holds office at the pleasure of the Crown, that is not the case for a Scottish minister. It would clearly give the impression of some sort of second-class citizenship among Scottish ministers. I do not think that is advisable.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para7"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 255K and 255U. I am not surprised to see an attempt to impose a limit on the numbers of ministers who may be appointed. However, I think it is quite wrong to impose such a limit. I was interested to hear about the magic number six. It seems to be a case of using what one already has, and that is considered sufficient. I think we must accept that we <P>


<a name="column_1481"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1481</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cannot make an assumption about how the first minister will want to organise and distribute the various ministerial portfolios.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para8"></a>Those of us who have been involved in the debate and the discussion in Scotland are fully aware of a small kind of sub-market in pamphlets, as it were, that have been doing the rounds which indicate how a Scottish executive should be structured. I am not saying any one of these is the right structure. I am saying that different structures of different degrees of attractiveness are being discussed. However, I think it would be extremely constraining to put a limit of six on the number of ministers whom the first minister could appoint.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para9"></a>Are we trying to prevent excess? I think the best guardians against excess are the Scottish people themselves and the Scottish parliamentarians. If they see a bloated executive, they will reach their own conclusions and they will deny it support either within the parliament or at the subsequent elections. Therefore it is not just a matter of leaving it to the Scottish parliament, it is a matter of leaving it to the judgment of the Scottish people too.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para10"></a>I turn now to Amendments Nos. 255L and 255V. These would remove from the Bill the provision that the parliament should agree the ministers and junior ministers whom the first minister wishes to appoint. As I understand it, the Opposition object to what they see as some kind of constitutional novelty, but I am afraid I think they have failed to understand the way in which the role given to the parliament in the appointment of ministers has been constructed. This is a provision which we regard as vitally important in terms of the ability of the Scottish parliament to hold the executive to account. Indeed it links with the provisions to which I have just referred and provides a balance with the powers of the first minister. The first minister appoints ministers, but subject to the approval of the parliament. I think that is particularly important in the context of a parliament which may well--as has been alluded to on more than one occasion--be more delicately balanced than is usual under the first-past-the-post electoral system. The fact that the executive as a whole has received the endorsement of the parliament--in a parliament where there may not necessarily be overall majorities or stable majorities--will lead to a greater degree of stability. That is something that should not be lost sight of.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para11"></a>I turn now to Amendments Nos. 255N and 255X. These would allow individual ministers to be forced to resign as the result of a vote of no confidence. Again, I think that fails to recognise the way in which the doctrine of collective responsibility will apply to the Scottish executive. Ministers will exercise their responsibilities as part of the executive, and it is right that Clauses 44 and 46 should reflect that position. As the noble Lord has already said, these clauses provide that only a vote of no confidence in the executive as a whole would formally compel resignation, and in that case it should be the executive as a whole that resigns. To put it another way, the Bill is properly concerned <P>


<a name="column_1482"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1482</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the relationship between the executive and the parliament, and not with the relationship between individual Ministers and the parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para12"></a>Of course there will be nothing to prevent the parliament resolving that it has no confidence in an individual. But that will be a matter to be dealt with as part of the normal political processes and not through the formal machinery set out in the Bill. The Bill is about establishing a proper relationship between the parliament and the executive as a whole. It does not, however, prevent the parliament taking a view in terms of confidence or no confidence, passing judgment on an individual Minister. But that is not a matter for the Bill; it is a matter for the politics of the parliament. In all reality, it would be virtually impossible for a Minister who had received a vote of no confidence by the parliament to carry on. The political pressures would be too great.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para13"></a>The amendments proposed are an attempt to recast the whole basis of the appointment, nomination and removal of Scottish Ministers and the number of Scottish Ministers who are available to the first minister. I believe that that would disturb the relationship, structure and framework that we have tried to establish through the Bill. We are providing a more coherent and defensible structure for the making of ministerial and junior ministerial appointments. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for his reply, although he started out in a rather "crosspatch" mood. As I indicated clearly, I tabled these amendments in order to ask why the words were there, what they meant and what were their implications. If the noble Lord had not used the prepared speaking note, whereby it looked as though I merely wanted to knock them out of the Bill, perhaps we might have got to the essence of the matter more quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para14"></a>I absolutely accept that new Ministers in the United Kingdom are appointed with the approval of Her Majesty. I must check how that worked in my case. I think that will probably come as news to most lay people--by "lay" I mean those who are not great constitutional experts. As I said, I know that great Secretaries of State are appointed in that way, and I suspect that important people such as Law Officers are appointed in that way; however, it never seemed to me that junior Ministers like myself were appointed in that manner. However, I accept entirely the answers given by the noble Lord on those points and I am quite content.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para15"></a>On the limit of 12, I knew that the noble Lord would tell me to leave it to the parliament. During the long Recess I shall count the number of times that he tells me that, and when we come to Report we shall not allow him to complain when we suggest to him that he should leave it to the parliament when we propose that certain matters should be taken out of the Bill. I thought I should receive that response.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para16"></a>I do not think that I looked at the figure six and said that six Scottish Office Ministers is enough. I am far more generous: I doubled the number and proposed 12. <P>

<A NAME = "80728-37_para17"></a>I understood the noble Lord's answers about the parliament's approval.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   For the avoidance of doubt, I certainly did not mean to say that it would necessarily be approval of each appointment; it could well be approval by an en bloc slate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I understand that; it probably would be. But if someone in the parliament or a group in the parliament did not like one of the appointments, they would use the procedures to tease that one out and look at it individually.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para0"></a>On the point about the vote of confidence, I accept collective responsibility and was pleased to hear the Minister accept that if the parliament found a way to propose a vote of no confidence in one individual, then he or she would probably be sacked by the prime minister or feel obliged to resign. Dare I say it, I do not think my three words to be added, "either he or" would have made all that difference to the Bill. However, in the spirit that these were probing amendments to ask exactly how the two clauses were worked and why they were put together in the way they were, I am reasonably satisfied with the answer. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>

<BR>
("(1A) The Lord Advocate and Solicitor General for Scotland shall be qualified as either--
<BR>
(a) an advocate, or

(b) a solicitor under the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para6"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This is a very small amendment. I may be wrong but I believe it was suggested at some stage by the Law Society of Scotland. I am well aware that mentioning that support does not always meet with approval on the Government Front Bench, but on this occasion there is no reason why it should not. All it seeks to provide is that both the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General for Scotland should be qualified either as an advocate or as a solicitor under the Solicitors (Scotland) Act 1980. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate qualifies under the first branch of the amendment; he would formerly have qualified, the last one being, like myself, a struck off <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>solicitor. It seems eminently sensible that this should be on the face of the Bill and I hope that for once the Law Society's suggestion might prove acceptable to the Government. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   As a member of the struck off solicitors' club, I also support the amendment. It seems to me that if a solicitor today can appear in the High Court, the Court of Session, the House of Lords and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, he ought to be qualified to be the Lord Advocate or Solicitor-General for Scotland. I support the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rodger of Earlsferry: </B>   There is just one matter which does not directly arise out of the amendment. I wish to ask the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate whether he could help with this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para7"></a>Clause 44(3)(c) envisages that a minister appointed under that clause may resign. Clause 45 envisages, so far as I can see, only that the first minister may recommend the removal of a person as Lord Advocate. It is not unknown for Lords Advocate to adjourn from time to time to resign their office. Is it possible, under this legislation, for the Lord Advocate to resign? I ask that because, as the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate will know in general terms, although he will not have studied it from his point of view, the Lord Advocate's resignation or, as it is put in the more genteel language of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995, the demission of office, has certain important consequences from the point of view of the prosecution of crime, the office of advocate's depute, indictments and so on.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para8"></a>In that situation, it is important that the question as to the resignation or demission of office of the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor-General should be dealt with. Because under the Bill they become creatures of statute, if one looks at Clauses 44 and 45 together, one might wonder whether the Lord Advocate could resign.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para9"></a>Perhaps the Government could look again at the terms of Clause 45 and consider whether an amendment to deal with the resignation or demission of office of the Lord Advocate might be appropriate.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-38_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   There is some force in what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Rodger of Earlsferry, says. I shall look at the matter and come back to him either in writing or at a later stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para10"></a>In relation to the amendment proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon, which is supported by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, apart from the debate in the other place, so far as I am aware, the last time that this issue seems to have been considered was in 1924 when Ramsay MacDonald formed a Labour Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para11"></a>It is said that it was a radical suggestion that a solicitor should be appointed as Lord Advocate. The Lord President of the day--Lord President Clyde--wrote a memorandum to Downing Street, which was published. That memorandum states clearly that it is part of the unwritten constitutional law of the land that the <P>


<a name="column_1485"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1485</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Advocate and Solicitor-General for Scotland are appointed from among the members of the Scottish Bar. That springs, in the same way as other parts of the law, from long custom. It has not been felt necessary in the past to prescribe the qualifications for office of the Scottish Law Officers and it is not clear why that should be necessary now.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para12"></a>To deal with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, although certain solicitors have rights of audience in the supreme courts, they may only have rights of audience if they satisfy certain criteria, and even then they only have rights in the civil courts, the criminal courts or both. It is my understanding that few solicitors in Scotland qualify for rights of audience in both. It would not be appropriate, therefore, to have someone who did not have a right of audience in both the civil and criminal supreme courts to hold office as Lord Advocate or Solicitor-General.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para13"></a>Again, this is not something which ought to be enshrined in statute and I invite the noble and learned Lord to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-38_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   I regard that reply as unsatisfactory because it seems to me that it is against the grain of how things are moving both in England and Wales and in Scotland. I note that the Law Society of Scotland suggested that the first appointment of a King's solicitor in 1587--Mr. William McCartney--was of a man who was regarded as a King's Clerk, writer and special agent, which suggests he was a solicitor in those days. It was later that the office became the preserve of the members of the Faculty of Advocates.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para14"></a>We are moving forward with rights of audience. I should have thought that the Lord Chancellor might have a word with the noble and learned Lord on this topic. I know that he is concerned to advance the rights of audience of solicitors and is making proposals to that effect. I do not believe it is enough to leave the legislation as it stands; there should be specific provision in the Bill for solicitors to hold those offices.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-38_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Drumadoon: </B>   I too find the reply of the noble and learned Lord a disappointment. He said that he did not consider it appropriate that the positions of the Lord Advocate or the Solicitor-General should be held by anyone who was not a member of the Faculty of Advocates. But we have to be clear what the Government's view is on this issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para15"></a>It is quite possible that solicitors will be elected as members of the Scottish parliament. Equally, it is quite possible that members of the Faculty of Advocates will be elected as members of the Scottish parliament. If it falls to the first minister to say to a potential law officer, "I am sorry, I cannot make you a law officer because you are a solicitor", then whether or not rights of audience are extended is neither here nor there. If he says, "I cannot make you one", I can see that that will create considerable unrest both within the parliament and within the profession. I hope, therefore, that before we come to Report this matter can be looked at more fully.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para16"></a>My understanding is that the Lord Advocate can appoint as one of his deputes, to act in his name and to prosecute in the High Court of Justiciary, someone who is neither a member of the Faculty of Advocates nor holds extended rights of audience. As some Members of the Committee will be aware, that understanding followed from advice from the committee which examined the issue. As we move forward to a new parliament, it would be a retrograde step to be apparently moving backwards to 1926. I do not expect the noble and learned Lord, Lord Clyde, to seek to defend his grandfather's views but he would acknowledge that they might fall to be reconsidered some 70 years on.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-38_para17"></a>For reasons which will be obvious to many noble Lords, this is not a matter to press to a Division at half-past twelve, but we shall return to it unless there is some change of heart. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(b) facilitating communication between Her Majesty's Government and the Scottish Executive.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-39_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak to the amendment quite briefly. It seeks to insert into the Bill a new clause regarding the establishment of an interparliamentary consultative commission. The White Paper Scotland's Parliament, in paragraphs 4.12 to 4.14, made proposals regarding liaison machinery. This included meetings between officials and United Kingdom Ministers and Scots Ministers. The Bill does not make provision for any formal exchange to take place between the United Kingdom Parliament and the Scottish parliament or between the United Kingdom Government and the Scottish executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-39_para4"></a>There is need for a body along these lines for a variety of reasons: first, to ensure exchange of information; secondly, to provide an accountable framework in which communication can take place; and, thirdly, to ensure that there is adequate co-operation on the matters listed at subsection (3)(a) and (b). In such important issues it is inappropriate to rely on any informal machinery. There has to be some adequate mechanism to ensure that the Scottish executive and Westminster Ministers speak to each other, especially if they are not of the same party.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-39_para5"></a>If it is good enough for Northern Ireland, why should it not be good enough for us? In the Northern Ireland Bill there are arrangements laid down in Clause 66 to the effect that the first minister and the deputy first minister acting jointly should ensure that there is participation in the north/south ministerial council. Clause 67 lays down that certain reserved matters relating to Northern Ireland are to be discussed at a meeting of the British-Irish intergovernmental conference. So there is a precedent for setting out mechanisms to ensure that the necessary co-operation takes place.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-39_para6"></a>If there is an obvious need for co-operation in the context of Northern Ireland, surely there is every bit as strong a need when the issue does not involve two separate states but different nations within a unitary state. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-39_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   I think that we would all agree that, post-devolution, it will be important for the parliaments to keep in close touch with each other and to share ideas and experience in areas of common interest.

<a name="column_1488"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1488</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>themselves to decide what arrangements might be appropriate. Further legislative provision is not required in order to enable them to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-39_para7"></a>The amendment refers to
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"facilitating communication between Her Majesty's Government and the Scottish Executive". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-39_para8"></a>I can assure the noble Lord that the Government intend that all the devolved administrations should be as fully involved as possible in discussions with the UK Government about the formulation of their policies on all issues which touch on devolved matters. Indeed, a great deal of thought has been given to how the UK Government and the devolved administrations should interact on matters of communal interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-39_para9"></a>The Government intend that there should be standing arrangements for the devolved administrations to be involved by the UK Government at ministerial level when they consider reserved matters which impinge on devolved responsibilities. It is envisaged that this would be achieved through the establishment of a joint ministerial committee of which the UK Government and the devolved administrations would be members. The joint ministerial committee will be an entirely consultative body, supported by a committee of officials and a joint secretariat. Further details of the standing arrangements will be announced later. Where there is agreement between the parties that it should do so, the JMC could also discuss the treatment of devolved matters in the different parts of the UK.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-39_para10"></a>These standing arrangements will run in parallel with and underpin the bilateral concordats between the Scottish executive and departments in the UK Government. These arrangements would be non-statutory. The Scottish executive cannot, of course, be committed in advance to any particular form of liaison. That said, however, the UK Government believe that there will be strong mutual benefits from such liaison arrangements and we would expect the devolved administrations to recognise this also. The Government believe that these non-statutory arrangements, together with the provisions in the devolution Bills, will enable the United Kingdom to work more effectively in future, giving due and appropriate weight to each of its main components. In the light of what I have said, I hope that the noble Lord will not press the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-39_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Linklater of Butterstone: </B>   I rise to say that we on these Benches feel that this amendment proposes something which is both unnecessarily large and bureaucratic. There will be a need for liaison and a facilitator for discussion and co-operation and communication. The joint ministerial committee, which the noble Baroness suggested, sounds ideal, but surely the Secretary of State would also have a central role to play. What is proposed is not only large and cumbersome, but also would put more control in the Westminster Parliament than would be desirable. It would also create a greater level of bureaucracy between the two parliaments than we would wish to see. Therefore, we do not support this amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Before my noble friend decides what to do with his amendment, perhaps <P>


<a name="column_1489"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I may explore something which is almost certainly not in the Bill; if it is, I have missed it. I refer to the concept of joint ministerial committees between the Scottish parliament and the UK Parliament. Perhaps the noble Baroness can tell me whether that is in the Bill. If it is not, is it just a hope that the two parliaments will agree to those joint ministerial committees, and have we any indication of what they will do and how that relates to the idea of concordats? Perhaps we shall explore that later, but it is a bit of a mystery to me. Are the JMCs in the Bill, and do we have any papers which explain to us how the Government envisage they will be set up and how they will work?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-39_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   There will be one joint ministerial committee. The idea is that the devolved administrations will be represented on it, plus representatives of the UK Government. There will be representation of each administration. That representation will vary according to the specific issues under consideration. Fisheries Ministers would be involved on fisheries matters, for example. As to the joint ministerial committee, I do not believe that I can add much to what I have already said. The detailed arrangements are still being developed and will be announced later in the year, well before the devolved administration starts work after the elections next year.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-39_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   Presumably, based on the reply by the noble Baroness, the arrangements will be announced after this Bill has completed its passage through Parliament. It might be better if the announcement were made before October so that these proposals would be to hand in looking at issues such as those raised by my noble friend Lord Selkirk of Douglas.
<P>

But I respectfully suggest that the issue be looked at before the next stage of the Bill in case it is necessary to make a suitable provision concerning the arrangements now being worked up with regard to a joint ministerial committee, bearing in mind that the Northern Irish legislation sets out specifically such arrangements. With that thought, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(b) an assessment of how effective those arrangements were in promoting equality of opportunity.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para4"></a>The noble Earl said: The amendment seeks to provide equality of opportunity. This appears to be a very good measure in the Government of Wales Bill. I tabled the amendment to see how such a provision would apply in this Bill. I believe that the intention of the amendment is clear and I shall not say any more. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-40_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   The new clause reflects a concern to support equal opportunities which I wholly share. I have already spoken to this in Committee. Equality of opportunity will be fundamental to the Scottish parliament both in the way it conducts its business and the policies it adopts through legislation. Our White Paper made this clear. The matter of equal opportunities, as noble Lords will recall from an earlier debate, is generally reserved: it is right that there should be common standards across the Border. However, the Scottish parliament will be able to encourage equal opportunities generally. The exceptions to the reservation are designed to ensure that the parliament can exercise a role in respect of equal opportunities such as by supporting advertising campaigns and developing non-discriminatory policies in all devolved areas. The parliament will also be able to improve duties on certain public bodies to make arrangements to secure that their functions are carried out with due regard to the requirements of equal opportunities law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para5"></a>The new clause would impose new duties on the Scottish executive to observe equal opportunities in the exercise of its functions and would require an annual report. It seems to me that it should be for the Scottish parliament, not the Bill, to impose such duties on the Scottish executive. This is one of the reasons for which provision is made in Section 2, Head 11, in Schedule 5 for the Scottish parliament to impose duties on certain public bodies to make arrangements with a view to securing that its Scottish functions are carried out with due regard to the need to meet the requirements of equal opportunities law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para6"></a>Amendments Nos. 222B to 222E which we debated yesterday clarified what the Scottish parliament would be able to do in this respect. It will be able to impose this duty on any member of the Scottish executive, so the Scottish parliament will have the power to impose duties on the Scottish executive to make arrangements with a view to securing that its functions are carried out with due regard to the need to meet the requirements of equal opportunities law.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para7"></a>We believe that this is an area in which the Scottish parliament can be expected to take the lead. I hope that I have said enough to convince the noble Earl that the amendment is unnecessary and that he should seek leave to withdraw it.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para14"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 259AA would extend the scope of Clause 51(1) so that it would disapply non-statutory as well as statutory requirements for functions transferred to the Scottish ministers under Clause 49 to be exercised after consultation with, or with the consent, of another minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para15"></a>At present the clause disapplies only statutory requirements. However, the case for disapplication applies as strongly for non-statutory requirements. For example the Royal Charters of Scottish Sports and Arts Councils provide for the form of annual statements of account to be determined by the Secretary of State with the approval of the Treasury. After devolution the function of determining the form of accounts will be exercisable by the Scottish ministers, as would the function of approving their own determination. That clearly makes no sense, and so Clause 51 as amended will remove the unnecessary approval requirement.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para16"></a>The Scottish ministers can be expected to develop their own internal mechanisms for financial control and, as they will be accountable to the Scottish parliament, it would generally not be appropriate for the requirement for the Treasury's consent to be retained, except in a few special cases which we have provided for in the Bill.

This was labelled the "Margaret Beckett amendment" when it was in the House of Commons.

<A NAME = "80728-40_para20"></a>As it stands, Clause 51(2) of the Bill excludes two paragraphs of Schedule 32 to the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 from subsection (1), which states that,

<A NAME = "80728-40_para28"></a>The power conferred here does not include,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Power to alter the boundaries of an enterprise zone; power to designate a different enterprise zone authority for the zone; or power to reduce the period for which the zone is to remain an enterprise zone". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para29"></a>I have read out those parts of the Act to emphasise how important these powers are with regard to enterprise zones.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para30"></a>Enterprise zones are an important part of the way we attract industry and commerce to areas of Britain where unemployment is high and employment prospects are poor. There are some criticisms of the enterprise zones. Those criticisms can come from other parts of the kingdom where it is felt that the special provisions of an enterprise zone can poach a company from one place to another. If my recollection serves me aright, an issue was raised in this House recently about a company that <P>


<a name="column_1493"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1493</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>left, I think, Berwick and moved to an enterprise zone. It was said by those worried about Berwick's position, understandably in the light of subsequent closures by Dawson, to be unfair. I have some sympathy when enterprise zones are used like that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para31"></a>When my noble and learned friend Lord Fraser of Carmyllie was MP for East Angus, he had a similar problem, although I believe that he was the recipient of the move from one area of Scotland to an assisted area. It can cause difficulties. But those difficulties are as nothing compared with the advantages an enterprise zone can confer on an area when inward investment is sought.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para32"></a>What worries us about this clause is that it is clear to us--it is why we have nicknamed it the "Margaret Beckett amendment"--that the Government are planning to end Scottish control over inward investment matters by centralising those powers in the DTI. This clause centralises those powers in the DTI. Indeed, Mr. Ian McCartney, a DTI Minister (I am not sure whether he is still a DTI Minister; I suspect that he is) confirmed last November that the department had plans to strengthen Whitehall's control over Scottish aid packages aimed at wooing major job creation projects by multinational companies. That was reported in the Scottish newspapers too.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para33"></a>I have already raised this matter in relation to other issues. But it is related to assisted area status which is very important indeed. Locate in Scotland, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise have been successful in bringing new jobs into Scotland, in particular into assisted areas, and in safeguarding jobs there. In 1995-96, the number of new or safeguarded jobs associated with inward investment was at a higher level than at any time since Locate in Scotland was set up in 1981. Indeed, 10,136 of 12,500 jobs were new jobs; and that was the highest figure ever. It was an increase of 1,000 on the corresponding figure for 1994-95. These jobs are important. Over the five years to March 1996 there were 400 inward investment projects with an investment total of &#163;3.4 billion and 50,000 jobs associated with them. We are talking about something that is of huge importance to the Scottish economy. Everyone in Scotland knows how successful we have been in attracting US investment, and the United Kingdom as a whole has been very successful in attracting Japanese investment. This is particularly important in Europe's semi-conductor industry. In Scotland, what is called Silicon Glen now produces 13 per cent of Europe's semi-conductors.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para34"></a>I have indicated, as briefly as I can in view of the serious nature of the subject, the importance we attach to aspects such as assisted area status and how suspicious we are of the Department of Trade and Industry. That suspicion is increased by the arrival of Mr. Peter Mandelson at that department. I refer to the proposal in Clause 51.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para35"></a>My honourable and right honourable friends in another place and my noble friends here are extremely suspicious that this power will be taken away from the Scottish parliament and placed here where the defender of Scotland's interests will be a Secretary of State for <P>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column 1494</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Scotland who, frankly, will not have nearly as much clout as the Secretary of State has had to date, for reasons we have touched upon today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para36"></a>If the Minister tells me that I need not worry because Mr. Brian Wilson has been sent to join Mr. Peter Mandelson, I have to tell him that my worries merely increase because, after the incident of the student fees at Scottish universities, I would not depend on Brian Wilson to defend any Scottish interest at all, and against Mr. Peter Mandelson I suspect he would not even be in the game; if he could not defend Scotland's interests against the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, what chance would he have against Peter Mandelson?
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-40_para37"></a>Even if he were to be successful in the short term, he is not always going to be the Minister at the Department of Trade and Industry, nor will there always be a Scottish Member at the Department of Trade and Industry. I just feel that this is a very difficult position for the Scottish minister, some of the Scottish executive and the Scottish parliament. Here is a power that is important to Scotland: it relates to the designation of assisted areas, the changing of assisted areas, increasing the time during which the assisted areas can operate, yet the Scottish parliament will not have anything to do with it. I find that situation very worrying. I hope that the Minister, even at this late hour can give me an answer which relieves a worry of mine and of some of my noble friends, who, had they been here this evening, would have gone into this matter in greater detail. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Thurso: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, for that comprehensive explanation because I spent most of this afternoon trying to work out what this meant. I even went so far as to go to the Library and photocopy both the paragraphs. I can confirm that, with one very small exception, the noble Lord read them out perfectly.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-41_para0"></a>I would like to comment generally on the issue of assisted area status and enterprise zones. In this I concur with the noble Lord; these are a very important tool in Scotland, one which is much appreciated and which has been responsible for bringing in much needed jobs in areas with a particular need. I suspect that we are all in agreement on that matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-41_para1"></a>I shall be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say. I had read the combination of Clause 51 and Clause 49 differently and put a slightly different interpretation on it. If these matters are taken away from Scotland to be dealt with by the UK Parliament, that will be a retrograde step. I hope that the Government will look at devolving these matters.

<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I shall try to deal with the fears and perhaps unwarranted nightmares of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, just by pointing out that Clause 51 is about Treasury control of enterprise zones. It has nothing to do with the DTI or whoever happens to be the President of the Board of Trade. We can remove the DTI from this debate entirely.
<P>


<a name="column_1495"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful for that piece of comfort. But I have to say that, after all my years of dealings with the Treasury, I am not sure that I would not prefer the DTI.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I am only trying to help the noble Lord to get a good night's sleep. Clause 51 disapplies generally any requirement to consult or act with the agreement of a Minister of the Crown in respect of functions which are within devolved competence and which therefore transfer to the Scottish ministers under Clause 49. In general, it would not be appropriate for the UK Government to have a veto over action by the Scottish ministers within devolved competence. Rather, it should be for the Scottish ministers to develop their own control mechanisms.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-41_para2"></a>The noble Lord's amendment would delete the exception to this general rule--the requirement to obtain the Treasury's consent prior to exercising powers under paragraphs 5 or 15 of Schedule 32 to the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980. These powers relate to the designation of enterprise zones. As Members of the Committee will be aware, perhaps the most distinguishing characteristic of enterprise zones is the considerable tax advantage which designation brings. It is because of that reason there is a proper need to seek Treasury approval.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-41_para3"></a>The Treasury consent requirement is essential for the continued oversight of the tax privileges conferred by the grant of enterprise zone status. With this one proviso, the Scottish parliament will have competence for matters relating to economic development, including area regeneration through the use of enterprise zones. I have already brought forward an amendment to Schedule 4 (Amendment No. 167A) entrenching the consent requirement so that it is outwith the legislative competence of the Scottish parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-41_para4"></a>As regards assisted areas, in an earlier debate the former Secretary of State for Scotland, the noble Lord, Lord Lang, made an important contribution. He pointed out and agreed with the case that the designation of assisted areas could not be devolved to the Scottish parliament simply because of the EU requirements that member states were allocated a percentage of the population that could be covered by assisted area status and the further requirement that in drawing the lines on the map they had to follow a common methodology within the member state. Therefore, it was impractical to devolve the drawing of assisted areas because of the EU requirements for commonality within the single member states.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-41_para5"></a>Perhaps I may touch on inward investment generally. The White Paper made it clear that there would be a concordat on financial assistance between all parts of the UK. In that concordat, we are seeking to have simple and transparent arrangements based on co-operation and partnership. We hope shortly to be in a position to publish the draft concordat. It will allow Locate in Scotland to maintain its excellence of securing inward investment for Scotland. It will also give assurance of value for money for the taxpayers and fairness to all parts of the United Kingdom, while allowing effective negotiations to attract inward investment projects.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-41_para6"></a>I understand and appreciate the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, to ensure that we have a strong and effective regional development policy and strong and effective regional development tools at the hand of the Scottish executive. I believe that we do and I honestly believe that his concerns are unfounded. I hope that he will be able to withdraw the amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   Will the Minister tell me whether the money comes out of the block grant or direct from the Treasury? Is the only reason for Treasury permission because of the tax advantages?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Yes, the only reason for the Treasury permission is because of the considerable tax advantage that enterprise status provides. Basically, if you went around creating enterprise zones at your own hand, that would very quickly have an effect on taxation and macro-economic policy generally. It is because of that particular characteristic of enterprise zones that there is the requirement for Treasury consent.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation. I understand the point about the Treasury. The Treasury's consent is one thing. I wonder whether the Scottish parliament will be able to suggest enterprise zones to the Treasury. In other words, will the Scottish parliament be able to make a proposal that such and such a place which may have had serious closures, or whatever it may be, should be made an enterprise zone? The Treasury will then be able to consider that. Whether it gives its consent is another matter. But will the Scottish parliament or executive be able to trigger that? If the Minister cannot tell me now, perhaps he will write to me so that we can consider the issue.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   I shall write to the noble Lord but this falls under the general heading of trying to maintain the best and most effective dialogue between the Scottish parliament and UK departments. That would be an example where one would wish to see the most effective dialogue possible.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   That reply probably means that yes, the Scottish parliament would be able to say to the Treasury, "We think you should have an enterprise zone." I can understand that the Treasury may say "We would be quite happy with that but you have rather too many. If you have that one, you may have to lose one. Would you agree to us removing enterprise zone status?" I can understand that.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-41_para7"></a>I see the point of the Treasury's consent being needed. But I am not entirely persuaded about that part of the drawing of the boundaries and that the suggestion of an enterprise zone or an assisted area cannot be devolved. After all, the parliament will have to act under EU law and regulations in many spheres, including agriculture and fishing which we have discussed on a number of occasions. Therefore, I do not see a problem with the Scottish parliament having to operate within EU rules when it comes to these matters because it will have to do that in other areas.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   Perhaps I may go further on the earlier issue as to whether the Scottish parliament can suggest enterprise zones. The simple answer is yes because it is Scottish Ministers who will actually designate enterprise zones, subject to the Treasury consent. That is how the relationship will work.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   While I accept that the dead hand of the Treasury tends to be everywhere, the Treasury does occasionally give consent for enterprise zones. It has done so in the past. One hopes that it thinks they are good value for money as regards the number of jobs that have been brought to this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-41_para8"></a>For the moment, I shall thank the Minister for his reply. I shall consult my noble friends who, from their experience in ministerial office, know a great deal more about these matters than I do. We may return to the subject on Report; on the other hand, the Minister may have satisfied me. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-41_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   I understand that the Motion is debatable. Therefore, before we agree that the House do now resume, I think that we should press the Chief Whip to be a little more frank with Members of the Committee as regards his intentions. In other words, is it his expectation or even his hope that we can conclude these Committee proceedings on Thursday, bearing in mind the fact that we have to finish by 11 o'clock? I am genuinely seeking information here and, if that is not his hope, it will mean that we will have to resume the Committee stage in the spill-over.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728-41_para13"></a>If that is the case, perhaps the noble Lord can give us two undertakings. The first is that this Bill will have clear priority, given the demands of the Irish legislation which we all understand; and, secondly, that he will move a Motion to dispense with the requirement to have two weekends between the completion of the Committee stage and the commencement of the Report stage. Without that, we shall find ourselves seriously behind in proceeding with the Report stage of the Bill.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="80728-42_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   There has been agreement that we will get as far as we can on Thursday, and if we need any time in the spill-over we have allowed a day for this in the first week back. I believe that that should be enough. I cannot give the undertaking regarding the truncation of intervals because that is up to the usual channels. As I said, we have allowed a day should we need it. We realise that we are in fact short of time on this Committee stage because of all the other pressures on <P>

<P>

That will actually make up for the number of half days we have lost. I am most grateful to him.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-42_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   I should point out that it may well be that the day allocated will be quite a long day, but we will finish the Committee stage on that day.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-42_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Steel of Aikwood: </B>   I am sorry to press the noble Lord on the matter, but my concern is not that we go into the spill-over with the Committee stage; my concern is that, if we had finished before the Recess, that would have provided the quarantine period between the Committee and Report stages which is normal. If we do have this day on our return, which I also welcome, there will necessarily be a gap in the short spill-over before we can even start the Report stage. That is very worrying.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728-42_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   There will be time when we get back. Because of the exigencies of the spill-over due to the time that we need for the Northern Ireland Bill we can, with the agreement of the usual channels, fit this Bill in. If everyone agrees on the Report stage, and so on, we will be able to get the Bill through on time.

The United Nations remains of central importance to the planning of peace support and humanitarian deployments. The reshaping of forces set out in the Strategic Defence Review will enhance the effectiveness of the United Kingdom's operational contribution to each of these international organisations.

<FONT SIZE=3>increase, from 1 April 1998.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728w02_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Shepherd </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728w02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   The committee has submitted its first report to the Prime Minister and today he placed copies in the Libraries of both Houses. Since 1975 the committee has advised the Prime Minister of the day on the propriety of business appointments that Crown servants wish to take up when they leave Crown service. Following a recommendation of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, it now also provides advice directly to former Ministers on their business appointments. The committee's first report offers an account of its work in advising former Ministers from the time they took on this role in November 1995 through the post-election period until the end of March 1998. The report similarly covers the business appointments of senior Crown servants for a two-year period from April 1996 when a number of changes were made to the rules which included bringing special advisers into the system. The committee gave advice to former Ministers on 175 appointments and made recommendations to Ministers on 128 applications from Crown officials.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para0"></a>The committee's new responsibilities for giving advice to former Ministers have made its task more onerous. The Prime Minister is very grateful to all the members for devoting their time freely to this important role. The chairman, the right honourable Lord Carlisle of Bucklow QC, has served with distinction for a number of years and will be stepping down shortly, as will the right honourable Lord Thomson of Monifieth, General Sir Charles Huxtable and Sir Robin Ibbs. They kindly agreed to extensions of their appointments to see through the introduction of the business appointment system for former Ministers. The Prime Minister thanks them warmly for the valuable contribution they have made.

<A NAME = "80728w02_sbhd1"></A><H4><center>The Cabinet Office</center></H4>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728w02_wqn1"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What is the future of the Cabinet Office.[HL3131]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728w02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   The Government faces many new challenges, and it must be ready to operate in new ways to meet them. So, in January, the Prime Minister asked the Secretary of the Cabinet to review the effectiveness of the centre of government.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para1"></a>The role of the Cabinet Office has traditionally been to help the Prime Minister and the Government as a whole to reach collective decisions on government policy. Since the election, the three principal parts of the centre--the Prime Minister's office, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury--have worked closely and effectively together, and with other departments, to take forward the Government's comprehensive and ambitious policy agenda.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para2"></a>However, Sir Richard Wilson identified a number of weaknesses that need to be addressed. He concluded that the linkage between policy formulation and implementation needed further improvement. He found that cross-departmental issues of policy and service delivery are often not handled well. He diagnosed a weakness in looking ahead to future opportunities and threats, and in reviewing the outcome of government policies and the achievement of government objectives. Sir Richard confirmed one impression of the Prime Minister's own; that, while the Civil Service has many outstanding staff, it has not always implemented the best systems to invest in their development. Sir Richard found that there was scope to improve the performance of the centre of government in promulgating best practice and innovation in government and in the corporate management of personnel, IT, government communications and scientific advice.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para3"></a>We have already taken some steps to address the weaknesses identified by Sir Richard. The Social Exclusion Unit is an example of our innovative approach to tackling cross-departmental issues. And the new Cabinet Committee on Public Expenditure, chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, will play a key role in monitoring departments' performance in meeting objectives. However, Sir Richard has identified an important agenda for reform. The Prime Minister today announced key reforms to address the problems he has identified. Further details will be announced in the autumn.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para4"></a>First, the Prime Minister proposes to merge the Office of Public Service with the rest of the Cabinet Office from today. The main purpose of the Cabinet Office is to help departments formulate policy collectively. The main purpose of the Office of Public Service is to help departments find ways to improve the implementation and delivery of policies and services on the ground. Yet policy formulation and delivery are two sides of the same coin. A unified organisation will help ensure that concerns about policy implementation are properly analysed in the process of developing policy, and help to contribute to more effective follow-through when policies are agreed.
<P>


<a name="column_WA187"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column WA187</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para5"></a>Second, a new Performance and Innovation Unit will be set up in the Cabinet Office. It will complement the Treasury's role in monitoring departmental programmes and will have two principal functions. First, it will focus on selected issues that cross departmental boundaries and propose policy innovations to improve the delivery of the government objectives. Second, drawing on the work of the successor to the Committee on Public Expenditure, and other sources, it will select aspects of government policy that require review, with an emphasis on the better co-ordination and practical delivery of policy and services which involve more than one public sector body. The unit will be a resource for policy development for the whole of government, building on the experience of the Social Exclusion Unit.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para6"></a>The new unit will not carry out these roles in isolation from other departments. It will assemble teams from inside and outside the Civil Service to carry out studies of areas where cross departmental working needs to be improved, or innovative approaches to delivery put in place, if the Government's objectives are to be delivered. The first group of projects to be carried out by the unit will be announced in the autumn. They will include studies of the Government's presence in cities and the regions, and of how older people can play a more active role in the community.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para7"></a>Third, the Prime Minister has decided to establish a new Centre for Management and Policy Studies in the Cabinet Office, incorporating a reshaped Civil Service College. If the modernisation of government is to be successful, and Ministers are to get the support they need in finding new approaches to policy and its delivery, we will need to ensure that the Civil Service continues to be a learning organisation, open to new ideas, and that staff at all levels get the training they need. The new centre will also provide an entry point at the heart of government for the best new thinking on current issues and new approaches to management. It will commission research into innovation in strategy and delivery. It will act as a repository for best practice in the public sector and elsewhere and be the focus for training the senior civil servants of the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para8"></a>Fourth, there needs to be more emphasis on the corporate management of the Civil Service as a whole. The Prime Minister's objective is to meet the corporate objectives of the Government as a whole, rather than just the objectives of individual departments. The reorganisation of the Cabinet Office will give it a new focus as the corporate headquarters of the Civil Service. Ensuring that there is a coherent information technology strategy, and that personnel systems deliver the talent needed for modern government, are just two of the challenges. In order to involve departments in the work of the Cabinet Office as the corporate headquarters of the Civil Service, the Secretary of the Cabinet will establish a team, including a number of Permanent Secretaries, to act as a management board for the Civil Service. The Head of the Government Information and Communications Service will from now on be located in the Cabinet Office. The Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government will also work from the Cabinet Office as well as the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para9"></a>So far as possible the new Cabinet Office needs to be located together. Its main base will continue to be in
70 Whitehall. Plans are being drawn up to locate the rest of the office, including the new Performance and Innovation Unit and the Centre for Management and Policy Studies, in the currently unoccupied accommodation in Admiralty Arch, Ripley House and Kirkland House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para10"></a>The Cabinet Office will continue to report to the Prime Minister and Minister for the Civil Service. The Prime Minister will continue to account to Parliament for matters of collective Cabinet responsibility; the Minister for the Cabinet Office will report to Parliament on the management of the Civil Service and allied matters and, in particular, will oversee the major programme of reform the Prime Minister announced today.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w02_para11"></a>The aim of this programme is to create a focus for the drive to modernise government to tackle the new challenges it faces. The broad outline of the programme is clear. A lot of work, and consultation with staff, is now needed to put in place the detail and implement the measures the Prime Minister has described. Further details will be set out in the Government's White Paper on Better Government, which will be published in the autumn.

<P>


<a name="column_WA189"></a>

<B>28 Jul 1998 : Column WA189</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para0"></a>Government policy is that compensation or other financial help to particular patients or groups of patients is only paid out where the NHS or individuals working in it have been at fault. The needs of people whose condition results from inadvertent harm are met from benefits available to the population in general. On that basis, we have decided not to make an exception to the general rule in the case of haemophiliacs infected with hepatitis C.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para1"></a>While the society makes a special case for haemophiliacs because the infection comes on top of a pre-existing serious long term medical condition, the same considerations apply to other individual patients and groups of patients, whether inadvertently infected with another illness or harmed as a result of another medical or surgical procedure, who can only obtain compensation if there has been negligence. The society also argued that, as government provides financial help to haemophiliacs infected with HIV, this scheme should be extended to cover people with hepatitis C. However our view is the circumstances were different: the stigma around HIV at the time the original decision was taken, the fact that it was generally considered a sexually transmitted disease and that haemophiliacs could inadvertently infect their partners were all important considerations which do not apply to hepatitis C.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para2"></a>The society was particularly concerned that young people were fearful of the possibility of passing on hepatitis C. That is a concern we share. The department is therefore working with the society to develop a project aimed at helping young people with haemophilia and related disorders who are infected with hepatitis C to understand their condition and so improve their future health, education and employment prospects. We will help with funding for this project.

But a small proportion of buyers are in difficulty with high service charges, and some are unable to resell their flat on the open market: either they cannot find a buyer, or mortgage lenders refuse to give a loan.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para13"></a>Local authorities have powers to buy housing, but their resources are limited and they have many other people needing help. So we propose to offer them a financial incentive. We plan to reduce the amount they have to set aside from their capital receipts from council house sales by 25p for every &#163;1 they spend on buying back an ex-council property. This would effectively cover 25 per cent. of the cost of the buy-back. They could use this incentive to buy back houses as well as flats.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para14"></a>In addition to this incentive, the authority would regain a capital asset which, sooner or later, would be available for reletting. Moreover, it would reduce the cost of managing its leasehold property--which, in the case of someone in arrears or unable to resell, could be considerable. And in some cases--e.g., an elderly or vulnerable person in mortgage arrears--it would be helping someone whom it might otherwise have to re-house.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para15"></a>Local authorities are best placed to judge who is in greatest need and how they should use their resources to help them. So they would be free to decide whom to help, and on what terms. This could include someone who had bought under a local authority voluntary sale scheme.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para16"></a>We propose to set just two conditions. These are designed to ensure that the concession is only available for buying back properties from individual occupants who want to re-sell. The concession would therefore only apply where the repurchase is from an individual, not an organisation; and it is not done under compulsory purchase powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para17"></a>Copies of the consultation paper Buying back ex-council flats and houses are in the Library of the House. Subject to consultation, we propose to implement the change later this year by substituting a new regulation for regulation 104 of the Local Authorities (Capital Finance) Regulations 1997.

<P>
<A NAME="80728w03_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   We have today together with my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Wales published the Planning Inspectorate's Annual Report and Accounts. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para18"></a>The inspectorate has just completed the second of a three-year programme to restore appeal handling times to optimum levels. Although it has not yet met its timeliness targets, it has improved handling times significantly. We expect them to improve further during 1998-99.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para19"></a>The agency has also maintained the programme of development plan inquiries to a high standard, helping to create a greater certainty for all involved in the planning process as more areas are covered by up to date development plans.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para20"></a>The inspectorate's quality target was met and exceeded, with reduced numbers of justified complaints against decisions issued. Surveys have continued to show that its decisions are widely respected. It has also produced an outstanding financial performance during the last year. The inspectorate is very much involved in initiatives to develop the Government's proposals for the modernisation of the planning system. In the climate of a rapidly changing environment it is always ready to take on new areas of work in dispute resolution.
<P>

<A NAME = "80728w03_para21"></a>In December 1997 the inspectorate achieved Investors in People status--the first agency within the merged Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="80728w04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The fixed penalty system is not used for enforcement purposes in the case of foreign drivers whose vehicles are filmed by speed cameras. Where traffic offences have been detected by cameras, the option to pay a fixed penalty instead of being summonsed to appear in court cannot be offered by post to drivers until they have been traced by the police with the aid of records held at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. As the police do not have ready and easy access to other countries' vehicle and driver records, it is not practicable to issue fixed penalty notices to foreign drivers who are detected by speed cameras. There is also no facility for endorsing foreign driving licences with penalty points. Other considerations are relevant, such as the short time many foreign drivers are here before returning abroad and the difficulty, if no resident United Kingdom address exists, of taking effective enforcement action when there is no response to the police's initial notification of an alleged offence.
