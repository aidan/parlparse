<A NAME="70722-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "70722-01_para2"></a>What consultations they have had with British fishermen's organisations about the results of the recent meetings between the member states of the European Union concerned on the subject of quota hopping in sea fisheries.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="70722-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Lord Donoughue): </B>  My Lords, Ministers met with leaders of the fishing industry last week to consider among other things what additional steps might be taken to ensure that British registered fishing vessels maintain a close economic link with our coastal communities in the light of the recent advice provided by the President of the European Commission. Further meetings are planned.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his reply. Is he aware that two supposed concessions for British fishermen at the time of the Amsterdam conference appear to be of little value to them? First, the requirement that quota hoppers should land half their catches at UK ports has little effect. Indeed, one effect is simply to reduce fish prices for British fishermen. Secondly, tightening rules on the British component of vessels was attempted in the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 and that was declared illegal by the European Court. Will not any further move in that direction be found to contravene again the European laws of establishment?
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I do not agree with that. The Merchant Shipping Act 1988 was ruled to be contrary to the common fisheries policy. The measures we are now pursuing are in line with the recommendations of the President of the Commission. We are assured that they are possible within the law. The President is the guardian of the European treaty and therefore we are reasonably confident that we shall be able to resist any legal challenge. I do not accept what the noble Lord said about landings. If we secure that 50 per cent. of the fish caught are landed in the UK--and that was not secured under the previous agreements--that will have many benefits. Some of the fish may well be transported abroad on landing but we shall gain many benefits from landing charges, transportation receipts and, above all, from the greater opportunity to inspect the fish landed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord not aware that licences granted to catch fish in our waters as long as five years ago contain the requirement that at least 50 per cent. of the fish should be landed in our ports? Does he not agree, therefore, that no progress has been made at Amsterdam at all on this subject? Does he not also agree that, although the President of the European Commission may regard himself as the guardian of the treaty, the Luxembourg Court is the engine of the treaty and we shall have little chance if our case is ever brought before it again?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I do not accept the latter point, for the reasons I have stated. As regards the percentage of landings, it is not the case that the present licence condition is merely a repeat of a previous condition. Previously landings were indicated as a condition but it was also indicated that a mere four visits to a UK port in six months was an alternative. That alternative does not now exist. In the conditions we are pursuing, in consultation with British fishermen, there will be a much tighter requirement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Parry: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend free to tell the House the present state of litigation existing between Spanish based interests at Milford Haven and the Government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I am not in that position but I shall write to my noble friend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Parkside: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend confirm that the vexed problem of quota hopping which Her Majesty's Government are now having to try to solve was created initially by British trawler owners selling their quotas to foreign, mainly Spanish, interests and that while that selling of quotas was going on the then Tory Government stood aside and did absolutely nothing about it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that question. He will be aware that the origins of quota hopping are complex. Some of the problem relates to the situation before the common fisheries policy of 1983 when the foreign ownership of British <P>


<a name="column_1301"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1301</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>registered ships was allowed to continue. My noble friend is right to say that a major problem arose with the second multi-annual guidance programme for fish conservation where the previous government did not pursue any policy of decommissioning and, in a belief in the free market, allowed foreigners to purchase such licences and, indeed, handed them to them for nothing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that we, and I believe the entire fishing industry, will be delighted if any good comes of the Amsterdam conference. We shall also be surprised.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-01_para3"></a>Will the noble Lord confirm that in the forthcoming round of MAGP--doubtless the Government will behave in the way they wish that we had behaved--it will be impossible for the Government to insist that those foreign-owned vessels participate in the capacity reduction? There is no allowance for compulsory capacity reduction. Will the Minister confirm that cuts in capacity are likely to be in the British-owned fleet leaving quota hoppers an even larger percentage of our total fleet?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, the reductions will be across the British fleet. There is a problem in targeting quota hoppers in terms of capacity reduction, as the previous Government attempted to do. The ambitions of the multi-annual guidance programme to preserve stocks are aimed at stocks such as cod and herring. In fact the quota hoppers are small fishers. The subject is complex. However, I can assure the noble Lord that we shall pursue British interests with maximum vigour. I am confident that there will be some benefits from the recent agreement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, the Minister mentioned decommissioning. Do the Government have any plans to spend more money on decommissioning?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, we have &#163;12 million available to assist decommissioning. That item was one of the subjects in discussions held by my right honourable friend with representatives of the British fishing industry on 15th July.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister look again at the judgment of the European Court? I think he will find that, contrary to his statement that the legislation was found to be in contravention of the fishing regime, it was found to be in contravention of the European laws on establishment of businesses. That illustrated the contradiction between two parts of the law and the Commission's work. The fishing regime is based on quotas for nationalities, and nothing but nationalities. The establishment regime more or less equalises all the nationalities in the European Union.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, there are judicial complexities. However, I can assure the noble Lord that it is our confident belief that the new measures we are pursuing will be sustained within the law.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "70722-01_para4"></a>Whether they will consider the case for drug enforcement authorities to have improved access to information concerning the export by European manufacturers of precursor chemicals used in the production of cocaine.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="70722-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, yes. United Kingdom enforcement authorities already have access to information on exports of such chemicals from this country. A number of agreements have been made with countries where cocaine is produced providing for the sharing of such information with their drug enforcement authorities, and more are being negotiated. The United Kingdom played a leading role in the recent United Nations International Narcotics Control Board meeting which identified a number of ways of further improving information exchange.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-01_spnew16"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, while recognising that there are legal measures in place both here and in Brussels, will the Minister nevertheless agree that stronger action is required, given that the majority of precursor chemicals, without which there would be little production of cocaine and many other hard drugs, are produced in Europe and the United States?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I agree with what the noble Viscount said. We already have agreements with Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Mexico and the United States which provide for the sharing of information on shipments of precursor chemicals. We intend to conclude similar agreements with Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree with the previous administration that some 80 per cent. of the illegal heroin seized in this country entered through Turkey? Have the Government had discussions with the Turkish Government; and, if so, with what result?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, shipments from Turkey are a continuing problem which is not overlooked by the Government. We believe--I think that it was the policy of the previous administration--that the key to the question is co-operation with overseas drug enforcement agencies. We have inherited the drugs liaison officer network. We have 50 United Kingdom DLOs stationed in 31 countries on drug trafficking routes in Europe, North and South America, the Caribbean and Asia.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clark of Kempston: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that far from the export of drugs, exporters in this country are being penalised and <P>


<a name="column_1303"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1303</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>jeopardised because of the increase in the base rate and the resulting strength of sterling? What will the Government do about that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, in answering the noble Viscount's Question, and the supplementary question from the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, I sought to treat this Question on drug menace with seriousness in your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Harris of Greenwich: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that a great deal of work has been done on the subject of precursor chemicals by the National Criminal Intelligence Service? I assume that that work is continuing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is entirely right. I am more than willing to pay tribute to the work that NCIS does. Within the past few days I had the great privilege of visiting NCIS to discuss its work; its demands, necessarily, for more resources; and the way ahead. I am careful to state that I was unable to say anything in response to its request for further resources.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister identify any stronger measures that could be effected in this area?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, yes. We press ahead with the regime that we have. We try to put what resource we can into international co-operation. If we do not gain intergovernmental co-operation, if we do not have inter-agency co-operation, we shall get nowhere. One of the serious dangers of the drug trade is the vast amount of money involved. It is notorious that when vast amounts of money are swilling about, sometimes political systems become corrupted. That is a matter to which the Government are keenly attentive.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "70722-02_para0"></a>What is their policy with regard to the screening of members of Her Majesty's Armed Forces to discover any who may be HIV positive.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="70722-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Gilbert): </B>  My Lords, in accordance with long-standing government policy there is no compulsory medical screening for HIV infection of either recruits or those already in service with the Armed Forces. Those who consider themselves to be at risk are encouraged to consult their medical officer on a confidential basis and to undergo counselling and voluntary testing if necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, I am distressed to hear that Answer from the Minister. What steps will Her Majesty's Government take to ensure that those who have to treat injuries and wounds in the field are <P>


<a name="column_1304"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>protected from HIV-infected body fluids, particularly if homosexuals and drug addicts, who are especially susceptible to HIV, are in future admitted into Her Majesty's forces?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, the position with respect to those who have unfortunately become HIV positive as a result of accidents while in Her Majesty's employment is that they remain in that employment until their health deteriorates; then their employment is, if necessary, terminated on medical grounds. They receive full counselling, medical advice and treatment. Going slightly wider than the Question, compensation depends on the circumstances in which the HIV condition was received; where a person was infected; how it happened, and the consequences of that. If the MoD was in any way negligent, then it would expect to pay compensation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew12"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that this matter has potentially significant ramifications for the Armed Forces, not only in terms of the health of personnel but also in terms of morale and discipline? If a screening process is not practicable--I entirely understand what the Minister said in that connection--will he tell the House what estimate has been made of the incidence of HIV positive cases within the Armed Forces at the moment? How do the Armed Forces deal with such cases as and when they come to light to protect other personnel?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, as I should have thought the noble Earl would have known from his experience of these matters, the situation is not nearly as grave as he purports to make out. As I understand it, during the 11-year period since records were first kept, in 1986, there have been only 38 known cases among the forces. Of those 38, 16 serving personnel subsequently went on to develop AIDS; only six have so far died from that sad condition.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is it not obvious that if homosexual practices were authorised within the Armed Forces the number of men who were HIV positive would increase very considerably?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, it is unhealthy for us to focus exclusively on homosexual practices as a source of AIDS. People can contract AIDS through all kinds of unfortunate circumstances that are totally outside their own control. They may, for example, be infected through receiving blood transfusions following a traffic accident, or when they visit their dentist. It is quite wrong automatically to consider that those with the HIV virus contracted it as a result of some sexual practice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, what provision is there to ensure that somebody does not join the Army and then subsequently claim benefit for having contracted AIDS when in fact he already had the infection when he joined?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware of any such cases. They would have to be examined on a case by <P>


<a name="column_1305"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1305</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>case basis. If a member of the forces was found to be suffering from AIDS, as the noble Lords suggests, the forces would consider how the condition was contracted. If, for example, it had been contracted through drug abuse, there would be a possibility of attracting military discipline.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew18"></A><B> Baroness Sharples: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Lord saying that blood transfusions are not safe?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, there are certainly unfortunate cases about which I should have thought the noble Baroness would have heard where people have contracted HIV from infected blood.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it would be extremely difficult to allow HIV positive soldiers into combat? If they were to be injured, it would be extremely unfair on their companions to have to treat them--not only would they be subject to injury from the enemy, but also from their own comrades.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, in extension of the reply I gave to the noble Baroness a moment ago, the infected blood can come from outside this country. HIV might be contracted following a traffic accident in another country, which is nobody's fault. With respect to the noble Lord's question, it is necessary to remind the House that, other than drug abuse, so far as I know the only way of acquiring the HIV virus is through an exchange of body fluids.

<A NAME = "70722-02_para1"></a>What is their response to the paper Gulf War Syndrome: is it due to a systemic shift in cytokine balance towards a Th 2 profile? published in The Lancet on 21st June 1997.

<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="70722-02_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, officials in the Ministry of Defence have held discussions with the authors of the paper, Professor Graham Rook and Dr. Alimuddin Zumla, concerning their hypothesis. Whenever we receive suggestions for additional research into subjects which could have a bearing on Gulf veterans' illnesses, our advice is always that the researchers should submit a formal proposal to the Medical Research Council. I understand that Professor Rook and Dr. Zumla intend to submit a proposal for work to test their hypothesis in due course; we therefore await the MRC's advice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-02_spnew24"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for that reply.

<FONT SIZE=3>fever; hepatitis A and B; encephalitis 1 and 2; meningitis; and three vaccines variously described as anthrax--V1, V2 and biological? If those are anthrax, some of the men will have received five anthrax vaccinations within two days, along with whooping cough vaccine. Will the noble Lord either affirm that these vaccines were used on some of the men some of the time, or nail the lie once and for all? If they were used, will he inform the researchers?

<A NAME="70722-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Countess for giving me notice of part of her supplementary question. I must apologise for the length of the reply that it is appropriate for me to give.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para0"></a>The three vaccines used in the anti-biological warfare programme for British troops during the Gulf War were: anthrax; potassis as adjuvant to it; and plague. Troops were also given a number of routine vaccinations such as might be administered to travellers or health workers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para1"></a>As to the specific diseases mentioned by the noble Countess, I am advised that no vaccines exist for three of these--lassa fever, ebola, and AIDS. Vaccines are available for Q fever, equine micro-encephalitis; rabbit fever (also called tularemia); and certain strains of botulinum toxin. So far as the department can ascertain, none of these vaccines was administered to British troops during the Gulf War.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para2"></a>However, in view of public concern about this issue, part of the forthcoming fact-finding work which is described in detail in the policy statement, Gulf Veterans' Illnesses: A New Beginning, published on 14th July, will examine the range of routine vaccines which may have been received by certain groups of service personnel deployed to the Gulf.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para3"></a>There were a very, very small number of British troops who were given a meningitis vaccine because of the special circumstances in which they found themselves. As I understand it, the numbers are in single figures.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether the noble Lord can help me. Not knowing what a "cytokine balance" is, or a "Th 2 profile", but looking at the Question, is Gulf War syndrome due to that, whatever it is?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his candour. I have not, unfortunately, the faintest idea what a lot of these terms represent. The position is that neither we, with our research programme, nor the Americans, with their much wider research programme, are yet in a position to understand how this syndrome was actually caused.

<P>

The country owes her a debt of gratitude. I am sure that she would accept that under the guidance of my honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces, the position of Gulf veterans has been transformed in many ways.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para4"></a>I draw my noble friend's attention to the 20-point programme recently produced by my honourable friend in the House of Commons. For the first time, Gulf veterans are involved in a committee studying the work being done on their behalf.

<A NAME="70722-03_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that this is a matter on which we, from these Benches, wish to give the strongest possible support to the Government in their efforts to help Gulf War veterans? I appreciate that the MRC has yet to submit its advice on the question alluded to earlier. However, can the Minister add to the helpful paper issued by his department last week and say whether the symptoms complained of by some veterans actually correspond with the symptoms described in the article in The Lancet?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, it would be an act of folly for me to try to add to anything that appeared in The Lancet article or a paper produced by my department only a few days ago. However, I shall look into the noble Earl's question and see whether I can write to him on it.

<P>

As one who has contributed to the hypothesis column, I know that quite often it is a way of floating ideas which need proof. It is still an open question, an important one, but at the moment it is merely an idea.

Will he also accept that, in the words of one of the Gulf War veterans, to put the research with Porton Down is to liken it to asking a murderer to prepare his own prosecution case?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Gilbert: </B>   My Lords, I can confirm that some of the work is being done at Porton Down. However, I do not accept the language quoted by the noble Countess. For the first time, the Gulf veterans have the protection that one of their number at least will be on the committee supervising the research work that is being done. I do not think that the Government can do more than that.

<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para9"></a>Clause 2 [Referendum in Wales]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell </B>   moved Amendment No. 16:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Page 2, line 8, at end insert ("in accordance with proposals set out in a White Paper laid before Parliament before this Act is brought into force which shall also clearly set out the implications for England of the government's proposals.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to move Amendment No. 16 at a rather awkward moment as it directly addresses matters to be covered in a Statement that will be made to the House shortly after debate on the amendment has been concluded. It also relates to the contents of the White Paper which convention dictates will not be available in the Printed Paper Office until the Secretary of State sits down in another place. So in a sense I have to go blindfold into the debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para11"></a>However, we have had a good deal of prior information. I had the experience--I shall not say it was a pleasant one--of waking shortly before seven o'clock this morning, turning on the television and being confronted by a programme concerned with what was to appear in the White Paper and an interview with the Secretary of State. A constitutional expert, commenting on what would happen as a result of the White Paper--at least, if the vote is affirmative--said that it would be the most important constitutional change in our arrangements in this country since the passing of the Government of Ireland Act in the 1920s. So what we are about is particularly important.
<P>


<a name="column_1309"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1309</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para12"></a>I was prompted to put down Amendment No. 16, with which we shall take two directly related amendments, Amendments Nos. 31 and 32, by some reported comments of the junior Minister at the Welsh Office, Mr. Peter Hain. He said that if Wales were to vote against a Welsh assembly in the referendum,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it might soon become one of the few regions in Britain still to be ruled from London". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para13"></a>He went on to say that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"political and business leaders in regionally-important cities such as Newcastle and Manchester will be encouraged to press for their own elected regional authorities if Scotland gets its own Parliament as widely expected". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para14"></a>I am never sure what to make of statements made by Mr. Peter Hain. He made the remarkable assertion that the great Korean company, LG, which is to move to Newport, was only doing so because the Welsh assembly was about to be created. That shows a degree of ignorance about the way in which investment decisions are taken which is startling.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para15"></a>However, we must take such statements seriously. We have had hints that we may hear more about proposals for what will happen to England. We have received information that the central government structure is to be reorganised so that there are regional arrangements. But what I do not think we know is whether they will take the form of elected assemblies in due course or what the Government's future intentions are. We hear a good deal from the Government about the need to place decision-making closer to people in every part of the United Kingdom. We therefore have the rather remarkable situation that we are proceeding by a series of steps--a fairly major step in Scotland, and, as we shall discover later this afternoon, a significant step in Wales--without knowing how those steps relate to future proposals for the government of England. It seems to me that that is an odd way of approaching the whole business of constitutional change.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para16"></a>I conceded a case to the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, when we had a little exchange earlier at Report stage. I could concede the case for having elected assemblies if we had a totally different system of government in the United Kingdom. What worries me is that we have different systems of government in each part of the United Kingdom. I believe that that sets us on a road that is likely to create conflict. Therefore, when I put down the amendment, I simply sought to obtain further guidance as to what the Government's intentions are. I hope--though I have to say that the hope is limited--that we may hear more about it when we see the White Paper, but this House should insist upon knowing more about the Government's plans on the matter before we proceed much further with the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para17"></a>As to Amendments Nos. 31 and 32, one involves Scotland and the other Wales. Again, they have been overtaken in a sense by events. One subsection of Amendment No. 32 asks that the Secretary of State for Wales should publish a summary of the White Paper. In the weeks that have been given to us, we have been told that summaries of the White Paper are to be dispatched to every household in Wales. We have also been told that copies of the White Paper at a cheap price--namely, <P>


<a name="column_1310"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1310</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>&#163;3--are to be widely available to those who wish to read it. So perhaps we are making some progress on that point.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para18"></a>We also now know, told to the world outside in advance of this debate--perhaps the Government have not yet begun to take much notice of the rather helpful statement made by the Speaker in the other place that such statements ought to be made to Parliament rather than elsewhere--that the date of the referendum in Wales is to be 18th September. Subsection (1) of Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 asks for further enlightenment on the constitutional implications of what is proposed and, in the case of Wales, why there should be no tax-varying powers. It appears that the only reason ever given as to why the situation in Wales should be different from that in Scotland is that the proposal did not appear in the Labour Party manifesto. We heard on previous occasions that the Labour Party manifesto was to be treated as a sacred document. Now, apparently, we have a new doctrine. Previously we understood that everything in the manifesto was guaranteed to pass through Parliament without any question or examination. But there is now the doctrine that we must ask why something was not in it. So we do not know very much about why the powers should be given in the one case and not in the other.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para19"></a>I think we shall discover, when we hear the Statement later and see the White Paper, that some rather important constitutional issues are raised. The old issue is the role of the Scottish and Welsh Members of Parliament. The old West Lothian question will not go away. I suspect that when we have heard what is said later, we shall want to ask more about that again. We shall also want to know more about the future role of the Secretary of State. On television this morning Mr. Ron Davies said quite firmly that the role of the Secretary of State would continue. I believe it was asserted during that programme that he was to be a conduit. I looked up the word "conduit" in the dictionary to make sure that I understood it. It is defined as,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a channel or pipe for conveying liquids". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para20"></a>I suppose that that is a role for the Secretary of State but there will be no regulatory body to make sure that such pipes are not polluted. A conduit is also,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a tube or trough for protecting insulated wires". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para21"></a>We can be quite certain that some electric shocks will pass up and down that particular cable as disputes break out between the assembly and the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para22"></a>However, the Government declare and I expect will tell us later this afternoon that the role of the Secretary of State will not change. Interestingly enough, those who most strongly advocate change in Wales do not for one moment believe the assertion. The Western Mail is fighting a vigorous campaign on behalf of the assembly and has become a total advocate of it. But, in an article on 7th July, it declared:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A reduction in the number of Welsh MPs is inevitable, given Wales's historic over-representation at Westminster. So is a workable redefinition of the role of the Secretary of State for Wales".<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1311"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1311</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para23"></a>It went on:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Welsh Secretary must retain a seat in Cabinet but will need to become more of an ambassador for Wales abroad and an effective liaison between the Assembly and Westminster". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para24"></a>That is an interesting definition of the role of the Secretary of State. Whether it justifies a Cabinet appointment is perhaps a matter of considerable doubt and debate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para25"></a>An even more interesting document produced within the past few weeks is entitled Wales in Europe: The Opportunity Presented by a Welsh Assembly. It is published by the Institute of Welsh Affairs and the principal authors are Sir John Gray, a former ambassador, and John Osmond. They have been advised by a formidable group of people who generally favour setting up an assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para26"></a>Therefore, I turn to that document to raise the constitutional issues because those who favour the assembly may be thought simply to be stirring up a hornets' nest. I know that whenever I raise these questions, people say, "You are against the whole thing and, of course, you make these points and there is no validity to them." I find the document particularly interesting. It addresses those questions very frankly and openly.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para27"></a>In section 3.6, the document refers to the Labour Party's document published in 1995 called Shaping the Vision and says that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the paper did not refer to the problems the Secretary of State would face once the responsibility for, and the staff concerned with, devolved matters had been lost and consequently the ability to speak authoritatively on those matters in Cabinet". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para28"></a>It is worth dwelling on the words:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the ability to speak authoritatively on those matters in Cabinet". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para29"></a>The authors prefer the word "broker" to the word "conduit" which I have just used. They suggest that that should be the role of the Secretary of State. They openly concede that there is likely to be a change in the status of the Secretary of State for Wales. Indeed, they say:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"By the time [of] any change ... (possibly abolition of the post and its incorporation into an Office for the Regions) Wales should have in place arrangements for influencing UK decision-making on EU matters which will survive the emergence of opposed majorities in Cardiff and London, and which will have confirmed that a nation like Wales should be treated differently within the United Kingdom to, say, an English region like East Anglia". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para30"></a>That takes us back to the question that I posed right at the start about what will happen to the English regions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para31"></a>The document goes on to say that that relationship should be brokered by the Secretary of State for Wales. For 17 years of my life I was an insurance broker. It was a fairly basic principle that if you acted as a broker, you represented your client and could not be the underwriter at the same time. Here is a situation in which it is proposed that the person who is to be the broker will sit in the organisation which will either accept or reject the risk. That is not exactly a normal situation for a broker to be in. Apparently, he has to broke,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"general principles and practical arrangements between the Assembly and the Secretary of State, and between the latter and his/her Cabinet colleagues. This would allow the Assembly's concerns to be fed into the policy-making machine in Whitehall. <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1312"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1312</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>It would also help lessen the likelihood of the Secretary of State losing the goodwill of either the Assembly or the UK Cabinet (or conceivably both)--something which, if continued over a long period, would put in jeopardy the whole devolution experiment". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para32"></a>Those are rather frank admissions by advocates of the assembly of some of the difficulties inherent in the whole experiment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para33"></a>The authors of the document go on to address the problem of the Civil Service. Again, I have not yet seen the White Paper. But if, as we are told, the Welsh Office is to be divided, with the overwhelming majority of its civil servants going to the assembly and a tiny handful left behind to advise the Secretary of State, that again produces some interesting situations to be resolved. Section 3.10 of the document states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"To explore this issue exposes some of the problems which would face the Secretary of State under devolution: those officials who owed their first loyalty to the Assembly would have no prescriptive right of access to the Whitehall machine; and on the contrary side, those officials who served a Welsh Secretary sitting in the London Cabinet would owe no constitutional loyalty to the Assembly. And if, at some future date, the majorities in the Assembly and Westminster were different, the problem would only be aggravated". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para34"></a>Incidentally, it may be thought to be unlikely that for some time to come the majorities would be different. If we are to have some form of proportional representation it is at least a possibility that that might happen sooner than some people anticipate. It is not something to be kicked away into the long grass as though in Wales it could never happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para35"></a>The authors analyse the difficulty about how the assembly would get its way over important matters in relation to Europe. They declare that again it is something that the poor old Secretary of State has to broker. They declare:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Welsh Assembly should have the right to send officials as observers to any working group meetings in Whitehall where matters devolved to Wales were being discussed, and to participate fully in preparatory meetings of the UK delegations to European Union meetings in similar circumstances". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para36"></a>They acknowledge that those arrangements may again create difficulties.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para37"></a>Finally, on the question of relationships with Europe, the authors say that the assembly should have access to the Council of Ministers; essentially, that it ought to be playing a key role in the deliberations of the Council. That is likely to cause great difficulty if the UK is taking up a negotiating position. There are real difficulties with Ministers having to bring into the process an assembly that may have different views. The unfortunate Secretary of State who will have been trotting backwards and forwards to Wales to listen to the assembly's views--he will apparently be entitled to sit in the assembly; whether or not he will be entitled to vote, I am not sure--will come hurrying back with the views of the assembly about European matters. The assembly may even have direct access to the Council of Ministers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para38"></a>One can go on and explore other relationships. All indicate that we are going down a road where we can perhaps see the first bend but we cannot see round the corner. It is difficult to know what the long-term intentions of government are or what the long-time future <P>


<a name="column_1313"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1313</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is likely to provide. We are starting down a road which is very uncertain. I do not believe that the position of the Secretary of State for Wales--or indeed, the Secretary of State for Scotland--can conceivably survive for long. They will not have a credible or acceptable role.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para39"></a>I believe also that we will run into the difficulties that we debated at some length 20 years ago when it is discovered that virtually all the powers that the present Secretary of State for Wales has over the whole field of domestic government are to be transferred to the assembly. The assembly will be deciding crucial issues fundamental to the work of most Members of Parliament in their constituencies. The Scottish and Welsh Members of Parliament will not be able to decide those matters or have any great influence in Scotland or Wales--except when legislation is passing through Parliament--but will have a significant influence in England.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para40"></a>I return to where I started. If we are to go along a road where the bends are frequent and the future so uncertain, what will be the position in England? We need answers to that question as well as to the questions I have asked in relation to Wales and Scotland. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-03_spnew13"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I can first say to the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, that the post of Secretary of State for Scotland was abolished in 1746 and re-established in 1885. Secretaries of State therefore can come and go.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para41"></a>The reality of Amendment No. 16 needs to be examined. In that spirit I drafted the following text, which may be of help. It reads thus:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government's proposals for Welsh, Scottish and Northern Irish devolution--the implications for England. The purpose of devolution is to meet the demand for a fairer system of government for the United Kingdom. The complaint is no less than the unnecessary domination of the United Kingdom by the English state. The pretence that the UK can only be governed as a unitary state has been finally exposed. It is now accepted that, in Hong Kong parlance, the UK is: one state--4 national systems. The Government recognise that the UK is a union state, and should be governed as such. In particular, it is recognised that the Scots Law has been altered, on many occasions, by the representatives of non-residents of Scotland, and without the consent of the representatives of Scottish residents. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>In a spirit of reconciliation, and with the future of the UK in mind, the Government are putting forward these devolution proposals to meet the needs of a renewed Union. The lesson of the past 461, 290 and 196 years is that a union with England is worthwhile, so long as it does not extinguish national democracy in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Recognising that change must be managed, the Government have decided to start the renewal of the UK in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The plans are asymmetrical, and may not be the final move towards a mutually beneficial Union settlement. The Government plan to extend the programme to London and the English regions". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-03_para42"></a>Perhaps that will commend itself to the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, and possibly--though I doubt it--to noble Lords on the Government Bench.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, we shall not know what the White Paper relating to devolution for Scotland says until the day after tomorrow. There have <P>


<a name="column_1314"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1314</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not been quite so many leaks in relation to that paper to date as there have been about the Welsh situation. But what my noble friend Lord Crickhowell said in relation to the Secretary of State for Wales is probably even more true in the case of Scotland if Scotland is to have a legislative parliament. The role of Secretary of State for Scotland will be even more limited because presumably there will not be discussions in the other place relating to Scottish legislation at all whereas there will be in relation to Wales. Those same points therefore seem to apply.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para0"></a>The amendment suggesting that the implications for England in the Government's proposals for Wales should be clearly set out before people make a decision in the referendum also applies to Scotland. The implications for England of the proposals for Scotland will, if anything, be greater. It has been a difficult problem to discuss to date because the constitution unit, which produced the proposals on which the Scottish White Paper will be based, did not include the need to take account of the situation in the rest of the United Kingdom. The terms of reference simply asked the authors to think about a scheme for Scotland, sell it to the people of Scotland and sell it to the people of the day. That was the gist of it. The noble Baroness, Lady Ramsay, who is well versed in these matters nowadays, may be able to confirm that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ramsay of Cartvale: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may interrupt the noble Baroness to say that I am a little confused. I wonder whether the noble Baroness is confusing the constitution unit with the Scottish Constitutional Convention, of which I am the co-chair. I have never been part of the constitution unit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I am speaking about the Scottish Constitutional Convention's terms of reference which the constitution unit quoted in its material. That interested me very much because the Scottish Constitutional Convention was not asked to consider the relationship between the scheme which it produced and the rest of the United Kingdom. The body which the noble Baroness chaired has not made recommendations about how its scheme would fit into the rest of the United Kingdom. If that problem has been addressed in the White Paper, it will have been done subsequently, and we have not yet seen it. All I am saying is that this amendment relating to Wales has the same implications for the arrangements for Scotland. It is therefore of great interest with regard to the arrangements for the whole of the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Crickhowell has put down an important marker here as we await the Statement on the Welsh White Paper and, in a couple of days' time, on the Scottish White Paper. I can perhaps shorten his contribution by saying that my noble friend has drawn the Government's attention to the law of unintended consequences--in this case, the unintended consequences for England and for the United Kingdom as a result of the proposals which we are about to hear for Wales and, in a couple of days, for Scotland.
<P>


<a name="column_1315"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1315</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para1"></a>I do not think my noble friend actually thought that part of the law of unintended consequences was that the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, would intervene. Having listened to the noble Earl's speech, I sometimes think, when I hear the flavour of how he discusses these issues, that he would be more comfortable on the Cross-Benches representing the Scottish National Party. Perhaps he is able to square that circle better than I can.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para2"></a>There will be unintended obvious consequences for the Parliament of the United Kingdom, for this House and for the other place arising from these proposals. I shall certainly be measuring, as I have no doubt my noble friends will be measuring, these two White Papers not just against what they do to Scotland and Wales but what they do to England and to the rest of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para3"></a>We all know about the West Lothian question: the number of Scottish Members of Parliament and what is their role; the number of Welsh Members of Parliament and what is their role. To be fair to the Liberal Democrats, they acknowledge this position and have clearly stated that the number of Members of Parliament from Scotland and Wales coming to the United Kingdom Parliament should be reduced. When the legislation comes in the autumn I look forward to seeing them putting down amendments to achieve that. The problem could still arise of Scottish and Welsh MPs being involved in English matters when they have absolutely no say about the same matters relating to their own constituents. That is something that the White Papers ought to address.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para4"></a>I shall be pleasantly surprised--I shall go further: I shall be shocked and amazed--if the White Papers have a chapter in them saying "Consequences for the rest of the United Kingdom and how we shall resolve them". My noble friend has rightly drawn to our attention the need to have that chapter. If the Government are not prepared to write it, it will be up to some of the rest of us to write it for them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. He referred to Liberal Democrat Peers and their acceptance of a reduction in Scottish representation in the House of Commons. If he is correct, and amendments are put down to reduce the number of Scottish MPs as a result of the establishment of a Scottish parliament, will he support those amendments?

<P>

<A NAME="70722-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I shall have to look very carefully at those amendments along with other amendments which will be necessary to clarify the role of Scottish Members of Parliament. However, there is no doubt in my mind, and never has been, that there is a logic in the reduction of the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster. That, so to speak, narrows the angle for the problem of the West Lothian question coming to a head. There is an inescapable logic in doing that, just as there is an inescapable logic in the other point that my noble friend drew to our attention; namely, the role of the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales. Once again I understand the Liberal Democrats' position to be that those two offices will be abolished. I look forward to their amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para5"></a>I have to say, because I do believe in the unity of the United Kingdom, that it would be a mistake to abolish those two offices as it would mean that the United Kingdom Parliament would contain neither a Welsh nor a Scottish voice unless some other members of the Cabinet were from Scotland and Wales. For the current Government, that might not be a problem. But it could be a problem in the future, as it might have been at some stages in the past. I am intrigued--I hope the White Papers will address this--as to what the role will be of the Secretaries of State. Will they be the Scotland and Wales representatives in the Cabinet? If they are, will they be excluded when the Cabinet discusses confidential information only relevant to the government of the United Kingdom? They will be there as representatives of another government. Everyone worries about what will happen if different parties are involved. We do not have to wait until then. What will happen if it is the same party?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para6"></a>In Scotland we have had an interesting picture for some years of Strathclyde Regional Council and Glasgow City Council. They were run by the same Labour Party. I have to tell your Lordships that they did not appear to be blood brothers. There was a fair amount of squabbling between them. I do not think that Glasgow City Council--Glasgow District Council as it was then--would have been too happy to have a Strathclyde councillor at its inner cabal; nor would Strathclyde have been happy to have a Glasgow City councillor at its inner cabal. So I really do not think that it is just a question of what happens if the political outcomes of elections in the United Kingdom, Scotland and Wales begin to diverge; because their politics, the people who run them and their objectives will also begin to diverge. That divergence will make the position of the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales hugely difficult if their roles in the Cabinet are merely to represent the interests of the Scottish government and the Welsh government.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para7"></a>I hope that the White Papers will address another point, which has not only constitutional but economic consequences. At the moment the Welsh Development Agency and Scottish Enterprise have a fairly good track record of which I know some parts of England are envious. Let us assume for a moment that the government of England--that is what it will be once the powers that it has currently for the whole of the United Kingdom are taken off to Wales and to Scotland--decide to be a little more robust about grabbing some inward investment. The Scots and the Welsh will promptly cry foul. I can assure your Lordships that they will promptly cry foul. They already do it. In the north-east of England the English grabbed Siemens. I use the word "grabbed" in the way it was portrayed in the Scottish press. If that happens in the future, who will hold the ring between the competing development agencies of the United Kingdom?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para8"></a>No one will be there to hold the ring. We shall not have a United Kingdom overview. Who will answer to Brussels if Brussels says that the Scottish and Welsh parliaments are going much further than they are <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>allowed. They cannot, because they are not member states. Only the United Kingdom Government can do so. All these points require to be addressed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para9"></a>As I said a few moments ago, I hope that there is a chapter in both White Papers addressing the questions about the knock-on effect on the rest of the United Kingdom and on England in particular. Frankly, I do not believe there will be, because the Government think that if they sweep this under the carpet everyone else will ignore it and nothing will happen. The trouble with dust swept under the carpet is that it remains there to cause problems in the years to come. That is exactly what will happen unless the Government face up to the consequences outlined by my noble friend in his introduction of these important amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I shall, if I may, deal with the amendments. They require the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales respectively to publish White Papers. I cannot remember how often my noble friend Lord Sewel and I have given the undertaking that we would do so. The Welsh White Paper is to be published today and the Scottish White Paper in two days' time. Those dates have been known for some while.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para10"></a>The further suggestion is that summaries of the relevant White Papers should be delivered to every elector at least two weeks before the referendum is held and that the Welsh White Paper would have to set out why the Welsh assembly is not to have tax-varying powers. We believe that that last point makes no sense. The purpose of the White Paper is to set out the Government's proposals so that the people of Wales are adequately informed of them before they are asked to vote. The people of Wales are not being asked to vote on whether the assembly should have tax-varying powers. The White Paper will set out the Government's proposals for a Welsh assembly; it will not deal with matters which do not form part of our proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para11"></a>As regards Amendment No. 16, the Welsh White Paper will deal with relationships between the assembly and its partners in Wales, in Westminster, in Whitehall and in Europe. It is the people of Wales who will be most affected by the establishment of a Welsh assembly and that is why the people of Wales are being asked to vote on our proposals. Therefore, these amendments have been overtaken by events. There has never been any doubt about our proposals. They were set out in the manifesto and we are delivering them on time today and on Thursday.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-04_para12"></a>The new clauses also propose the publication of summary versions of the White Papers to be distributed to every elector in Scotland and Wales respectively. There is little between us on that. We plan to produce leaflets outlining the Government's proposals for Scotland and Wales. We propose to distribute them to all households in Scotland and Wales respectively and we intend that they should be with the voters in good time. Of course, one cannot guarantee a precise timetable given the vastness of the task that is to be carried out. We shall also be <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>producing them in Braille, on audio tape, in Gaelic, Cantonese, Urdu, Punjabi, Hindi and Gujerati. I hope that your Lordships will agree that we are making every reasonable effort--bearing in mind that all this costs money--to inform the electorate about the proposals on which they will be asked to vote. I hope that the noble Lords will be able to withdraw their amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, once again we have had a non-answer from the Minister. It is quite extraordinary that when one puts questions, as we have, about arrangements for England and the other matters one does not get a single response that is relevant. I now have the White Paper. It has just been handed to me. I have had a moment to glance at it. It confirms that the Government intend to keep the position of the Secretary of State for Wales.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I hesitate to intervene, but the noble Lord was to speak to the amendments, but the whole of his speech was devoted to other issues and not the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, I suggest that if the noble Lord reads the amendments he will see that they specifically deal with the matters that I raised.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for giving way. Does he agree with me that a reading of the amendments shows that, in the third line, Amendment No. 16 states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"clearly set out the implications for England of the government's proposals"? </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-05_para0"></a>That is also shown clearly in the fourth line of Amendment No. 31, which states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"indicating the potential constitutional implications of the establishment of such a Parliament". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-05_para1"></a>Amendment No. 32 states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"including the reasons why it should not have tax-varying powers and indicating the potential constitutional implications of the establishment of such an Assembly". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-05_para2"></a>I believe that my noble friend will agree with me that he did address these issues, as I did. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, has not read the amendments. Nor has the Minister read the amendments. He is clearly of the view that one does not need to answer the debate at all and all that one needs to do is to answer the amendments, but he did not even do that. If my noble friend says that he believes that to be totally inadequate, I absolutely agree with him.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I understand that the noble Lord is replying to the amendment. Perhaps I may respectfully remind your Lordships that this is Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew5"></A><B> A noble Lord: </B>   A speaker can give way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, I was observing that I have had only a moment to glance at the White Paper, which refers to the intention of the Government to keep the Secretary of State, but does not have a section--as my <P>


<a name="column_1319"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1319</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble friend suggested that it would not--as to what the future constitutional arrangements and their effect on England might be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Parry: </B>   My Lords, I am a little baffled. I have been several times to the Printed Paper Office in order to obtain a copy of the White Paper and it is not on release. Are we not subtly disadvantaged by having one Member of the House who has it, good friend of mine though he is?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I passed the White Paper to the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. It was released as soon as the Minister sat down in the other place. If the Printed Paper Office has not provided it then I have not followed the regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, that is perfectly correct. The White Paper was embargoed until 15.30 hours and we are now well past that. It has been handed to me and I believe that I am entitled to refer to it. I have not had a chance to read it, but it does not address the issues referred to in the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-05_para3"></a>I know that the Liberal Democrat Party now believes that its principal role is defending the Government. Indeed, sometimes during debates it appears to be its only role now. The Liberal Democrat Party defends the Government much more vigorously than anyone on the Labour Benches now defends them. Before he takes that line, the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, should read the amendments. It is positively insulting that the Minister should get up--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords,--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-05_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, no, I am not going to give way again because I want to get on. I want to make one particular point. The noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, who replied to this debate, replied to the two points that I acknowledged at the start had been dealt with, because we are to have a Statement this afternoon. He did not address the other issues at all. It is an outrage that this House should be treated in that way. Therefore I press my amendment.

<A NAME = "70722-06_para6"></a>"This Government believe that, in the United Kingdom, too much power is centralised in the hands of too few people. We believe that there is too little freedom for people in each part of the United Kingdom to decide their own priorities. Our manifesto made clear our intention to give Britain a modern constitution fitting a modern and progressive country. We believe it is right to bring decisions closer to the people, to open up government, to reform Parliament and to increase individual rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para7"></a>"Madam Speaker, the White Paper I am publishing today marks a major step forward in the achievement of our proposals for Wales. We propose to create a democratically elected assembly that will give the people of Wales a real say in the way public services in Wales are run.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para8"></a>"Since the Welsh Office was set up over 30 years ago, there has been a progressive devolution of administration to Wales. As Secretary of State for Wales I am responsible for taking decisions about health, education, economic development, roads, planning and many other public services that matter to people's lives. I am accountable to this House. But our procedures here are too often seen as remote from the day to day realities of devolved administration.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para9"></a>"Madam Speaker, this Government are committed to bringing decisions closer to the citizen. Our aim is to improve public services by making them more responsive to the needs and the views of people in Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para10"></a>"Wales will continue to share the same framework of laws as England, including the primary legislation made for it by Parliament; and it will remain firmly part of the United Kingdom. But the new assembly will assume many of the functions and powers which I currently exercise. It will have at its disposal the staff and budget of the Welsh Office--now totalling &#163;7 billion. It will determine policies and set standards for major public services. It will bring forward secondary legislation where necessary to implement these policies. It will assume responsibility for unelected bodies in Wales and have powers to reform them and bring them to account. This means that in future decisions on schools, health care and other key services will be taken by people directly elected by, and accountable to, Welsh voters, and responsive therefore to their views. And we will be equipping the assembly to set a new economic agenda for Wales, focused on Welsh needs and priorities, to create the new jobs and industry that Wales still badly needs. Above all else the assembly will provide a clear and distinctive voice for Wales.

<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para11"></a>"Madam Speaker, the Government intend that the assembly should be a new kind of elected body, open to all talents and close to the people it serves, working in partnership with central and local government, for the benefit of all parts of Wales. It is this Government's intention to forge a new kind of politics. The assembly will therefore be based on principles of partnership, democracy and inclusiveness.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para12"></a>"Partnership. First, the assembly will improve the government of Wales by working in partnership with others, and especially with Welsh local government. That partnership will respect the legitimate role of each of the tiers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para13"></a>"Madam Speaker, in making this point, I thank my honourable friend the Member for Rhondda for his most helpful paper on the proper relationship between the assembly and local government. Let me tell him and the House: the assembly will promote and foster local government in Wales; the assembly will regularly review with local government how effectively that commitment is being observed; the assembly will not be given any new power to take functions away from local government; but it will be given powers to transfer functions from quangos to local government. The establishment of the assembly gives local government a new opportunity to reassert its rightful place as an equal partner in the governance of Wales. The assembly will also need to work closely with other key partners, including business and industry and the European institutions. The business community will gain easier access to key decision-makers in the assembly as it pursues its new economic agenda; and the assembly will listen to the voice of business and respond quickly and effectively to its needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para14"></a>"The assembly will foster a new relationship with Europe. The administration of European structural funds is a matter of great importance to us in Wales. This responsibility will pass to the assembly which will, in consultation with the Commission, be able to determine priorities for European funding in Wales. Assembly members with executive responsibilities and their officials may, where appropriate, have a role to play in delegations to the Council of Ministers as agreed by the UK Minister leading those negotiations.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para15"></a>"Democracy. I turn to the second principle: democracy. For the first time the key decisions for Wales will be made by people elected by and democratically accountable to the people of Wales. The executive committee will provide the political leadership for the assembly and will be subject to scrutiny through the processes of question and debate. Under the assembly, policies which matter to people in Wales--education, health, and other key public services--will be determined in Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para16"></a>"I now turn to the quango state. In recent years the growth in the number of unelected bodies and some of their activities have caused great concern in Wales. Our proposals for a new and democratic structure of government in Wales will address that concern. The assembly will be given sweeping powers to <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1324"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1324</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>democratise and if necessary further restructure quangos that remain. That is a major package of reform, but in the Government's view the need to start the reform of the quango state in Wales is too urgent to be left to await the assembly. Action is required now even before the assembly is established--a point which has been made forcefully by my right honourable friend the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney in earlier debates. I agree. The Bill establishing the assembly will by merging the WDA, the DBRW and the Land Authority for Wales, create a new economic development agency for Wales. It will be a powerhouse to promote the economic regeneration of Wales. It will also transfer Tai Cymru's staff and functions to the Welsh Office and wind up that body.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para17"></a>"We will also wind up Cardiff Bay Development Corporation by March 2000 while securing the continuing development of Cardiff Bay; reduce the number of training and enterprise councils in Wales from six to four; and make important changes to NHS administration. The Government have already announced that the number of NHS trusts will be reduced. Today I can tell the House that the Health Promotion Authority for Wales and the Welsh Health Common Services Authority will be wound up and their functions transferred. Taken together, Madam Speaker, these proposals will have a profound effect. Unelected bodies will be reduced in number before the assembly is established and placed under proper democratic control and scrutiny once the assembly is in place. No longer will our key public services lie in the hands of political appointees operating in secret and accountable to no one in Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para18"></a>"Inclusiveness. Madam Speaker, the third principle I mentioned was inclusiveness. The assembly we propose will have 60 members. Forty of them will be directly elected from constituencies, with 20 additional members to provide an element of proportionality. Voters will be able to vote both for constituency candidates and for party lists for additional members. The assembly will reflect all of Wales in its membership and in its working practices. Its committees will give all political parties in the assembly the opportunity to make their distinctive contribution to its work. And our proposals for regional committees will give all parts of Wales a stake in the assembly's success. I want people of real ability and commitment representing the widest possible range of interests to serve in the new assembly. In particular, although this is not a matter for legislation it is vital that we see greater participation by women in public life in Wales, and I look forward to seeing a high proportion of women as assembly members.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para19"></a>"The United Kingdom. Madam Speaker, it has been suggested by members of the official Opposition that our proposals in some way threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom. That is simply wrong. Parliament will continue to be responsible for primary legislation for Wales. There will be no reduction in Wales's representation in Parliament as a result of our <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1325"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1325</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>establishing the assembly. The Secretary of State will continue to represent Welsh interests in the Cabinet and will participate fully in the Government's formulation of policy--and, through his links with the assembly, will ensure that Wales's voice is more clearly heard on issues of major importance to Wales. In the same way, assembly officials, who will be members of the Home Civil Service, will work in close partnership with officials in other government departments in developing policy proposals. Wales will remain an integral part of the United Kingdom. Let there be no doubt of that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para20"></a>"Conclusion. Madam Speaker, on 18th September we intend to submit these proposals to the people for their endorsement. I am making arrangements for the White Paper to be widely available throughout Wales. A leaflet describing our plans will go to every household and the White Paper text will be made available on the Internet. Everyone in Wales will have the opportunity to know about our plans and to contribute to the debate in advance of the referendum. The Welsh assembly is a key element in this Government's project for a new Britain with strong communities, a modern constitution and a confident place in the world. In this new Britain, Wales will have its voice. These proposals are right for Wales and right for Britain, and I commend them to the House".
<P>
</UL>
<A NAME = "70722-06_para21"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_time1"></A><H5>4.29 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn, for repeating the Statement made in another place and for his great courtesy in helping me to obtain a copy of the White Paper in time to have at least a glance through it before the Statement was repeated. It appears that the Welsh Office's van had forgotten that the House of Lords was here. If we come to the Bill that is to implement devolution I suspect that it will have good cause to remember where the House of Lords is for many long nights.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para22"></a>In terms of getting the information out to the wide world, I was particularly interested to note that this would be published on the Internet. I took the trouble to look at the Welsh Office site before I entered the Chamber to see whether this great event was presaged. The only statement that I could find on the subject was that press announcements had been withdrawn for the period of the general election. There may be a little updating to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para23"></a>Those of us who have been lucky enough have now received copies of the White Paper. I believe that it is available in the Printed Paper Office. One can now see the mess of pottage for which the Welsh are being asked to exchange their birthright. One sees at considerable length the dishonest question that is to be posed to that great country. On the one hand one is told that nothing in this threatens the Union. On the other hand if one happens to be a Plaid Cymru supporter one <P>


<a name="column_1326"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1326</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is told that this is the first step on the road to independence. There appears to be no shame about presenting those two answers to the same question.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para24"></a>The White Paper is entitled A Voice for Wales. It should be A Lost Voice for Wales. All that will be left at the end is an off-stage croak. It is as if the Government had invited a member of a great Welsh choir to step forward and take a solo part, only to tell him afterwards that he would have to sing the solo part in a locked room in the basement. Wales will be sidelined in government and Parliament. It will be a sad day if the proposition is ever agreed to.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para25"></a>I shall concentrate on asking the Minister some questions. I do not necessarily expect to receive answers today. I hope that he will be able to reply to me in writing before our debate--say, by next Tuesday evening--so that we can follow up the points which concern us.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para26"></a>I turn first to a subject which will be of considerable interest to the House; that is, the mechanism by which power will be devolved to the assembly. We are faced with a wide range of secondary legislation over which it is proposed the assembly should have power. Some of the secondary legislation has a great deal of flexibility in it; other parts are narrow. How will we set about widening that discretion so that the assembly can make use of it? Are we to be faced with an enormous Henry VIII clause so that it can all be done by secondary legislation, perhaps by the assembly itself, within some rather loosely defined power?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para27"></a>We are told that Welsh legislation will continue to pass through this Parliament. On what sort of timetable? How will it be done? Who is to promote it? Who is to ensure that it receives the precedence that it should have in the scheme of things? The White Paper says that the assembly will examine proposals for UK legislation to see what relevance they have for Wales. When will it do that? Will legislation be released to the Welsh assembly in advance of its coming to Parliament? Does that constitute a promise to publish all Bills several months in advance so that they can be looked at by the assembly?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para28"></a>It would be helpful if the Government, in their publicity, would make clear the limitations of what is being proposed for Wales. An interesting article in today's Western Mail contains two equal and opposite misunderstandings. The teachers have put together a "Teachers say Yes" campaign for Wales. They had a conference yesterday. One speaker said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We would not have seen the imposition of nursery vouchers; we would not have seen the opting out of schools"</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para29"></a>if there had been a Welsh assembly. I hope that the Minister will confirm that that is not the case. Those laws would have been passed in this Parliament and would have been effective in Wales. All that the Welsh assembly could have done would have been to ensure that they were pursued properly in Wales. The Welsh assembly could not have opted out of the legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para30"></a>The second misconception in the article is the statement that the Welsh assembly could channel more funds to schools. That is equal and opposite. There is a widespread misconception that the Welsh assembly will <P>


<a name="column_1327"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1327</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not interfere with local government; that local government will continue to choose how much money goes to schools. That is clearly not the opinion of the teachers. Nor is it my opinion, having read the White Paper. It is clear to me that what is proposed for local authorities is that they should be subject to the power of the assembly. The assembly should decide how much money they are getting; should be able to ring fence what they are doing; and should be able to give directions which amount to pretty thorough control of local authorities. I should be delighted if the Minister would confirm that my understanding is right.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para31"></a>It would be helpful also if the Minister could outline the limitations that there will be on the assembly's powers which justify the policy of continuing with 40 Welsh MPs. It is clear that that policy will be called into question if some people's views of how wide the powers go are supported. As I understand it, the reason why the number of Welsh MPs is not to be reduced is that the powers are limited. A restatement of that by the Minister would be welcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para32"></a>Much was made of the quango state, although the reduction, as I see it, is from 80 to 71, which is not a major reduction. It rather gives the lie to a great deal of the rhetoric used in the run-up to the White Paper. Will the Minister confirm that what is at issue is not the power of the quangos passing to the assembly, but power over the quangos passing to the assembly? By and large, they will continue to exist. If they do not continue to exist, that is because, for the most part, they will have been merged with other quangos.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para33"></a>Will the Minister also confirm that the power to appoint members to those quangos as well as the power to hold the quangos to account will rest with the assembly? Is that not a rather surprising conflict of interest with which we deal adequately in our Parliament by having the appointment by Ministers and the questioning by the PAC? Why does the Minister believe it to be satisfactory that appointment and holding to account should be done by the same body? Will the Minister enlighten me as to the continuing role, or otherwise, of the NAO when it comes to the affairs of the assembly and of the quangos which it will control?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para34"></a>A little noticed--I do not believe that it has been widely presaged--element in the White Paper is the advent of regional committees of the assembly, representing the different bits of Wales. That surely must be a recipe for dissent between the different parts of Wales and a mechanism to allow it to happen and to encourage it. Will the Minister enlighten us as to how those regional committees will dovetail with the all-Wales committees, and how that process might be made to work without the dissent which seems inevitable?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para35"></a>My noble friend Lord Crickhowell, in his recent amendment, made much of the fate of the Secretary of State for Wales. When he has a chance to read the whole of the White Paper he will see that that creature is not to be a broker; he is, at best, to be a bookie's runner. He will have immense difficulty deciding where his loyalty lies. Is he a member of the Cabinet and responsible to the Cabinet under collective <P>


<a name="column_1328"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1328</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibility or is he someone who is loyal to Wales? When the two take different views, where will his heart and voice be? Surely it will quickly result in neither side believing that he is one of them, and his becoming totally excluded and irrelevant.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para36"></a>The assembly's powers to direct and control the cash flowing to local authorities; to control what they are doing; to cap them or not cap them, as it chooses in the future; to set rates and business rates, amount in the end, if I read it aright, to the assembly having tax raising powers. If the assembly can withdraw money from local authorities for its own purposes, leaving those authorities to make up the money through the council tax, that is just as much tax raising as if it had power over income tax. I hope that the Minister will be able to explain why, in that case, the Welsh are not being offered the second question that the Scots are.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para37"></a>An interesting variety of proportional representation is proposed for the elections. I am sure that it will greatly please the Liberal Democrat Party. I am not sure that I understand its details. What surprises me is that it is to be based on Welsh Euro-constituencies. Is it not true that by the time the assembly comes to be in place there will be no such constituencies? Wales will be all one region within the list system. So has the Government's thinking become a little confused as to what it will be based on? Where are the powers over the police which the Prime Minister promised to Wales only last week? I see no mention at all of them in the White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-06_para38"></a>I have one last question: will Peers be entitled to vote for this? That is of local interest and I have failed to pick it up in the White Paper. As the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, said in speaking to my noble friend's amendment, the Government have out-Chinesed the Chinese with one country, four systems. Indeed, why stop there? The Government will not stop there because there will be a different system for London and it may be that the different regions of England will be able to choose their own system.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-07_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. I was suggesting that that is the situation at the present moment rather than what the Government are proposing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, it is clearly what the Government are proposing and they are proposing to take it further. I find their reasons for this proposition entirely inscrutable. However, we shall subject the inscrutable to scrutiny to make it suitably acceptable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hooson: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that I can put the mind of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, at peace straightaway. I am sure that Peers can vote in the Welsh assembly provided that they are elected.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para0"></a>I add my thanks to the noble Lord for repeating the Statement made in another place. First, I should like to congratulate the Government on producing this White Paper. I barely know the Secretary of State for Wales but I have the impression that he is a very direct, straightforward chap who is a determined person. He has delivered what he has been working so hard to do <P>


<a name="column_1329"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1329</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for several years in Wales. It is somewhat refreshing to have that direct approach rather than the PR approach which we had so often from the previous government.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para1"></a>I say that I congratulate the Government but, as they are aware, the proposals do not begin to achieve what my party stands for; that is, a domestic parliament for Wales. Our support for the Government is based on the fact that we much prefer the Government's proposals to the status quo because the status quo had become virtually intolerable in Wales. We had so many quangos, a disproportionate number of which represented Conservative interests. That was what was so objectionable about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para2"></a>The electors of Wales demonstrated their disapproval of that in the election results. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, will be very happy to know that if the Government's proposals are approved in Wales in the referendum, at least it will ensure that the Conservative Party has some representation in the government of Wales which otherwise it might not have at all either in the other place or, indeed, at the result of the next election.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para3"></a>I wish to ask the Government a certain number of questions on this matter. Obviously the greatest virtue of this proposed new body is that it will be a forum in Wales and it will be the first directly elected forum that we have ever had in our history. But the second very important matter concerns the quangos. As I understand it, the Government will abolish or amalgamate some of them before the next election. However, I do not read in the White Paper and do not understand that the assembly will have the power to abolish quangos. I believe that gradually we could do away with all the quangos in Wales. From a business point of view, I am a great believer in having managers to manage and who are responsible to somebody. That somebody should be the elected body in Wales. Therefore, I do not see the need for quangos as such if we are to have a properly run assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para4"></a>As the noble Lord pointed out in the Statement:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Since the Welsh Office was set up over 30 years ago, there has been a progressive devolution of administration to Wales". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para5"></a>That is the answer to many of the criticisms made from the Opposition Benches. Devolution is an evolutionary process. I think I am right in saying that in 1964, when the Welsh Office was set up, it had 260 civil servants. That coincides almost exactly with the number of civil servants now employed in the regional offices set up by the Conservative Government in England in 1994. They now number 260 on average.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para6"></a>Therefore, that devolution has been started in England, which was already apparent in Wales before 1964 when the Welsh Office came into being. We may see in Wales the development of a means of having regional government which could be extended to England because the basis for it already exists there and was set up by the last government. However, modestly, they do not seem to take any credit for it. It may be that they wish to hide that devolutionary tendency from the electorate. I do not know.
<P>


<a name="column_1330"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1330</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para7"></a>The third matter is the relationship of the Welsh assembly to Europe. Obviously the European Structural Funds, which are so important in the development of Europe, are disbursed regionally. But what exactly will be the power of the Welsh assembly? For example, is it envisaged that there will be a European committee of the Welsh assembly which will specifically and directly deal with Brussels on those matters? With regard to membership of the assembly, I understand that the Secretary of State for Wales is to be an ex officio member. That is almost certainly part of an evolutionary process because I cannot see that there will forever be a Secretary of State. In time, that office will disappear.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para8"></a>Are MPs to be allowed to be members of the assembly? I very much hope not. In the White Paper it is said that it is intended that members of the assembly should regard it as a full-time occupation. I hope that Members of Parliament at Westminster will not be able to duplicate matters and become members of the assembly. Nor do I think that councillors from the various local councils in Wales, except for the community councils, should become members of the assembly. I do not believe that there should be, as it were, a clash of interest. It would be very much better for the assembly if it were independent of both national and local government, as far as that is possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para9"></a>The regional committees proposed will clearly be very important. There is an oft-repeated suggestion that the rural parts of Wales--and north Wales in particular--will be dominated by south Wales. Will the Government bear in mind that it is not so much a question of the division of north Wales and south Wales as a division between the industrial areas and the rural areas. For example, there will be a great deal to be said for the mid-Wales region of the five old counties--Cardiganshire, Meirionnydd, Montgomery, Brecon and Radnor--being subject to one regional committee because they have similar problems as opposed to the problems of north Wales or south Wales taken as a whole. Therefore, I hope that the Government will be able to confirm that there is no rigid thinking on those matters in relation to the regional committees.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para10"></a>When the Welsh Office is divided--and I refer to the majority of civil servants who come directly under the assembly--will there be a means of ensuring that the executive side works very well because in Parliament Ministers deal with the executive side of government while we deal with the legislative side? The Welsh assembly will deal with secondary legislation but if it is to control most of the civil servants in Wales by what means will they ensure that they are answerable to the assembly in an executive way? That matter needs a good deal of thought and guidance by experts.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para11"></a>I believe that the White Paper sets out exactly what the Government said they would produce. I have always made it clear that if the choice were mine I should have a different White Paper, as I am sure would the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, from his viewpoint. I believe <P>


<a name="column_1331"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1331</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the proposal is what the people of Wales are likely to accept. It is what is on offer and it is very much better for Wales than the status quo.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in his opening remarks. I appreciate his courtesy. If there was a misunderstanding about the journey that a particular copy of the White Paper followed at a particular time, I am happy to say that it was no more than that. I am also happy about the way he has approached his responsibilities vis-a-vis mine. I am grateful for his suggestion that if I wish to give mature consideration to particular matters I may write to him. I promise him, I dare say to the horror of the officials, that should I do so he will have the letter by Tuesday evening, as he graciously suggested.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para12"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, for his introductory remarks, in particular about the Secretary of State for Wales. Whether you agree with him or not, what you see is what you get! As the noble Lord said, it is a refreshing change and for the avoidance of doubt perhaps I may say that I agree with him.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, raised the question of Peers. Reference to that is to be found in the White Paper at page 37, paragraph C.7. It states:

<A NAME = "70722-07_para15"></a>Perhaps I may attach my answer to the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, and extend to him the privilege that was offered to me by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. Members of Parliament will be able to stand as members of the assembly. That is made plain in the citation that I gave from paragraph C.7.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para16"></a>Equally, the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, is correct in indicating that it is anticipated that membership of the Welsh assembly would be a full-time job. Ultimately, it will be a matter for individual political parties to decide whether it is sensible and appropriate that, for instance, an MEP ought to stand for election to the Welsh assembly. Different parties have different views. In the Northern Ireland context, the Reverend Ian Paisley is a Member of another place and a Member of the European Parliament. Such issues are best left to individual party and personal decisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para17"></a>Both noble Lords raised the question of the committees. It is intended that there shall be four different types. First, there will be subject committees, which will be responsible for particular areas of policy such as education or health. Secondly, there will be scrutiny committees, which will need to scrutinise proposed assembly orders or financial matters, therefore ensuring that the appropriate rules are properly followed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para18"></a>Thirdly, there will be regional committees providing different parts of Wales with opportunities to express their views on matters of local concern. I deal specifically with the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Hooson. We have very much in mind the problems <P>


<a name="column_1332"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1332</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that he outlined. The intention would be to have four regional committees; one for north Wales, one for mid-Wales, one for the south west and one for the south east. I believe that his point is well made and that there ought to be the most careful consideration with present bodies and local authorities to determine precisely where the boundaries should be drawn. We do not approach the question with a closed mind. We believe that those with experience of Welsh affairs across the spectrum have a useful input into the decisions that are made about the boundaries.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para19"></a>Fourthly, there will be an executive committee, which will provide political leadership for the assembly in the same way as does the Cabinet. I confirm that the Secretary of State will be a member of the assembly, able to take part in the deliberations but not to vote.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para20"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, asked about the police function. It is well known that the police function is a Home Office function. It is intended to remain with the Home Office. However, perhaps I may give a sensible, foreseeable example. If there were serious questions about police practices in any part of Wales, or in any area of Welsh life, it may well be that the assembly would wish to concern itself with what might have gone wrong. I do not say that in the sense that it would be able to direct police practice, which is firmly lodged in the present arrangements for the police forces. However, I believe that it is legitimate for such an assembly at least to ask for conversations and for an exchange of views with the appropriate police authorities, even perhaps with the appropriate chief constable. I see no difficulty or problem with that if one approaches the matter on the basis that I believe the majority of people in Wales will approach it; namely, that we want to make it work.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para21"></a>Of course, we can be gloomy and say that Wales is fit for no better control over its affairs than it presently has. We can turn our backs on the opportunity that we now have; the first opportunity to have accountable, devolved, representative government in Wales, as the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, rightly said. It is true--it has been said many times and it remains true--that there are devolved powers but they are not accountable in a full sense to the people of Wales. They have been unduly obscured. They have been kept private and secret, although the sums involved are vast--&#163;7 billion or so of public money per year.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para22"></a>We believe that a sea change has occurred in Wales in the past 20 years. We believe that the proposal is what the people of Wales want. They want a decent consideration of their opinions. I invite your Lordships to accept that they do not say that in any sense of wishing to be aggressive or confrontational. Earlier this week, the noble Lord, Lord Hooson, made a point which stuck in my mind. Wales as a country has matured and changed and developed confidence during the past 10 years or so. He is right in saying, "Go and look at Cardiff." It is now a metropolitan, European city. We do not look down on anyone.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para23"></a>I value what England has to offer to the United Kingdom. I have lived here for most of my adult life and I know that it has enormous qualities of fairness and <P>


<a name="column_1333"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1333</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>decency. The rest of the world has been able to learn from it. We believe in the Union but we believe in diversity. When noble Lords opposite speak of their Scottish experiences and traditions I respect them. I have been to Scotland only once--and that was only for the day!--but I know that Scotland is different. It does not claim to be better--at least, not too obviously--but it has variety to offer. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said that this is a mess of potage and that the birthright is being sold but I must most gently disagree. We are not selling our birthright; we are recovering it. I stress again, because there are mischief-makers about, that this is in no sense hostile to any other people who live in the United Kingdom, which we hope will continue to subsist.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para24"></a>Specific questions were asked about the control of local authority expenditure and the functions of the present Secretary of State. They will be transferred to the assembly. We say that that will democratise the current arrangements. We say that we are looking for a spirit of mutual respect between the local authorities in Wales and the new assembly. I am happy to repeat that no member of a local authority in Wales need fear that his or her powers will be decreased--quite the opposite is true. As regards tax, the arrangements currently in place whereby the Secretary of State determines the size of the local government settlement will transfer to the assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para25"></a>A specific question--I believe it to be important--was asked about the National Audit Office. There will be an auditor general for Wales who will be supported by the National Audit Office. We are entirely in agreement with the spirit behind the question of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas. Of course we need to be absolutely certain that the arrangements for accountability of public spending are properly in place.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para26"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, asked how power will be devolved. It is proposed that power will be devolved by a transfer order to be available for scrutiny before the Committee stage of the Bill. I hope that your Lordships think that is appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para27"></a>A further question was asked about control of the quangos. These bodies spend a vast amount of public money. I believe there is serious concern in Wales about accountability and whether or not the money is appropriately controlled. The assembly will be able to set the strategic framework for the quangos, make appointments to the quangos and fund them. Ultimately, it will be able to limit their powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para28"></a>We shall have to await the conclusion of those eligible to vote in Wales. I believe that it will be a positive conclusion. I believe that we have a fair wind for a voyage which will be exciting and which will have a productive outcome for those who care about the government of Wales.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Elis-Thomas: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for repeating a Statement made by my right honourable friend in another place, Mr. Ron Davies. Before I ask a number of questions I declare an interest <P>


<a name="column_1334"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1334</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as the chair of two bodies, one of which is to be transferred into the assembly; namely, the Welsh Language Board. The board welcomes that as a democratisation of its activity. Indeed, it decided at its last meeting to hold its future meetings in public as part of this new spirit of Welsh democracy. The other body, Sgrin, is partly funded by the Welsh Development Agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para29"></a>In asking questions about this document I emphasise that, contrary to what my noble friend Lord Hooson might have implied, this is a White Paper which I unreservedly welcome. This is a White Paper which the Government promised and the Government have delivered it. More than that, it sets out a detailed and extremely intelligent structure of government for Wales. Contrary to what has been implied by some Conservatives opposite, it is not a staging post to anywhere else; it is a viable system of government in its own right. It is as stable, and can prove to be as stable in my view, as the Welsh Office in its great days under the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para30"></a>This paper proposes for Wales three exciting developments. I am impressed by the commitment to regional devolution within Wales. Does the Minister foresee that there will be direct links between the regional committees of the assembly within Wales and local government, and also the training and enterprise councils and indeed other agencies which are currently established as joint agencies with local government?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para31"></a>My next question relates to the relationship with Europe. My understanding is that the assembly will elect members of the Committee of the Regions of the European Union. That is to be warmly welcomed. It was an unsatisfactory situation--although my own party, Plaid Cymru, benefited from it--when members were nominated. Now that there is a directly elected tier in Wales--if this is approved in the referendum--there will be direct election from the assembly to the Committee of the Regions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para32"></a>Can the Minister confirm that it is the Government's intention that the assembly will scrutinise European legislation in draft form in detail; that the assembly will be able to continue to develop the existing WEC arrangements in Brussels should it so wish; and that the assembly will be able to have its own independent representation in parallel to representation of the current UK structure in Brussels?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-07_para33"></a>My next point relates to the issue of equal opportunities. How do the Government intend to ensure that their objective and ours of greater equality of representation within the assembly is pursued? It is crucially important that this body is seen to represent the whole of Wales and that the gross gender inequality of the whole of Welsh politics should be urgently addressed.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for those comments. Although I do not believe that the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, and I have ever been members of the same political party we still have our different regards and different views about Wales. He is right to make the point that the Welsh Language Board <P>


<a name="column_1335"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1335</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which has done so much good in Wales has moved with the times. As he rightly said, the fact that the board is now holding its meetings in public is a reflection of a changed world.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para0"></a>The assembly members with executive responsibilities, and officials, may have a role to play in delegations, for example to the Council of Ministers, as agreed by the UK Minister leading those negotiations. The Secretary of State will continue to be able to participate at meetings of the Council of Ministers and, where appropriate, represent the United Kingdom on certain matters on the same basis as now. The Welsh assembly will have at its disposal the staff of the Welsh Office. We believe that there will be sufficient back-up available properly to discharge duties in addressing these European issues. The Welsh assembly will be able to scrutinise EU documents and it will be able to convey its views to the Secretary of State and to the UK delegations in Brussels. It will therefore be able to ensure that those views are taken into account in United Kingdom policy formulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para1"></a>The Welsh assembly will have to ensure the implementation of EU obligations in Wales. We obviously want to play a full part in the United Kingdom--a United Kingdom which is part of the European Union, and a part of the European Union which we wish to see continue. I may not have made it sufficiently plain that the assembly will take over the current functions of the Welsh Office with respect to the structural fund programmes for Wales. That means that the assembly will be able to determine in agreement with the European Commission what should be the priorities for the structural funds in Wales; how they should be administered; and how the partnership of organisations which access structural funds should be involved in the process.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, said it was important that there should be a devolutionary process which does not stop at Cardiff. I express that point more crudely than he did. I entirely agree with him. Devolution of powers will not be a single step. If the assembly is to do its work properly it will wish to have the closest liaison with local authorities, the business community, development agencies and public bodies. We do not wish there to be a monolithic devolution; if it is a monolith it will have no life and therefore it will not be successful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for repeating the Statement. There are some matters in the Statement and in the White Paper which I welcome. For example, I welcome the fact that the White Paper confirms that Wales has been extremely successful in attracting inward investment and already enjoys a relatively favourable business climate. That is something one could not possibly have said 18 years ago. I also welcome the noble Lord's statement that over that same period it has developed a new confidence. Again I do not think one could have said that at the time I took over my responsibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para3"></a>I agree with and welcome the decisions to merge the WDA, the Development Board for Rural Wales and the Land Authority for Wales. When I took over my <P>


<a name="column_1336"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1336</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibilities those bodies had been recently created by the preceding Labour Government. Clearly they had to be allowed to develop at that time. Indeed, I ensured the survival of the Land Authority for Wales. However, I think that the time has come to bring them together. It is a sensible proposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para4"></a>I also think it right that the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation should hand over its responsibilities around the year 2000. That is exactly what I intended when I set it up. I said at the time that it was there in order to hand over responsibilities to local governments. I agree with all that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para5"></a>However, the Statement said that there is too little freedom for people in each part of the United Kingdom to decide their own priorities. In view of the fact that all the domestic responsibilities of the Secretary of State are to be handed over in Wales to an assembly, I must repeat the question to which I failed to receive an answer during our recent discussions. What then is to be done to ensure that the people in England have that same ability to decide their own affairs?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para6"></a>Perhaps I may address one group of issues: the relationship of the assembly to Parliament. The White Paper says that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There will be a procedure for the speedy settlement of any disputes about the Assembly's use of its powers, and if it exceeds its powers the Government will be able to challenge it in the Courts". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para7"></a>Will the Minister tell us what is envisaged as procedure for the speedy settlement of any disputes? Disputes there inevitably will be. A body with control over &#163;7 billion of expenditure which distributes money to local authorities will from time to time have disputes. I had nothing like that amount when I was Secretary of State, but I had to distribute money to local authorities, and about half that sum to other organisations. As Secretary of State I was faced from time to time with disputes. How are those disputes to be resolved?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para8"></a>The White Paper then states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State for Wales and Members of Parliament representing Welsh constituencies will have a continuing role, but one which will be based upon a new partnership with the Assembly". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para9"></a>Will the Minister tell us a little more about the nature of that new partnership? Unless they are members of the assembly, Welsh Members will no longer be able to raise questions in Parliament as they can at present about the health service, the education service and all the other matters that most interest Members of Parliament in their own constituencies.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para10"></a>The White Paper also states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Secretary of State will continue to be accountable to Parliament for his actions through the normal mechanisms of Parliamentary Questions and debate. He will not however be accountable for the activities of the Welsh Assembly". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para11"></a>So what is he to be accountable for? Are Welsh Questions simply to address the nature of the messages that are passed by the Secretary of State up and down the conduit between the assembly in Wales and those few responsibilities that remain? Matters to deal with royalty are hardly likely to be the subject of frequent question. There are a small number of organisations, but it will be a pretty thin Question Time. What will the <P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Ministerial statements are made for the information of the House, and although brief comments and questions for clarification from all quarters of the House are allowed, such statements should not be made the occasion for an immediate debate". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para12"></a>We seem to be verging on an immediate debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I did not mean to be discourteous to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gwydir. However, I shall respond briefly to some matters raised by the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, bearing in mind the injunctions of the Lord Privy Seal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para13"></a>First, I shall deal with the fast track procedure to which the noble Lord referred. The question of a dispute between the assembly in terms of vires on secondary legislation and the Westminster Parliament will be capable of a fast track dispute resolution. The intention is that the matters shall be in some circumstances immediately referrable to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, asked about a new partnership. He asked about the accountability of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State for Wales will continue to have important functions. He will participate fully in the Government's policy formulation, in legislative and resource decisions. He will represent the needs of Wales in Cabinet and Cabinet committees. He will sit on relevant Standing Committees of the House of Commons considering legislation which affects Wales. The short answer to the noble Lord's question is this. Any retained responsibilities which still remain with the Secretary of State for Wales will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny in another place in the usual way.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-08_para15"></a>Perhaps I may respectfully suggest that we are attempting a debate which has been set for a little later in your Lordships' House, I believe next week. I would prefer to deal with specific questions either by letter if noble Lords prefer, as did the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, or by awaiting the general debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gwydir: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask the Minister a simple question. He referred to the functions of the Secretary of State. The White Paper makes it perfectly clear that it is the intention of the Government that almost all the functions of the Secretary of State will be transferred to the assembly. I believe that about 2,000 civil servants are attached to the Welsh Office. How many of those will be transferred to the assembly, and how many will be left to the service of the Secretary of State?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo970722/text/70722-09.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I cannot deal with that in precise figures. I can agree with the <P>


<a name="column_1338"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1338</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord's observation that a substantial bulk of the Secretary of State's present responsibilities will be devolved to the assembly and therefore a substantial number of the civil servants who will remain members of the Home Civil Service will be attached to the assembly for the discharge of those functions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Gresford: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the White Paper with enthusiasm. I also congratulate the Minister on the manner in which he introduced it and replied to questions about it.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para0"></a>I particularly welcome the reference in the White Paper to an all-party commission to decide on standing orders. Will the Minister confirm that the intention is that the assembly should be less confrontational than the Westminster model; and that there should be a greater degree of co-operation between parties in serving the interests of Wales through this assembly?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I do. It is far from my mind that our discussions on the referendums Bill have been in any sense controversial.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para1"></a>Wales is a different country. It has a small population. It has particular characteristics. I hear from the Benches behind me that it has select characteristics--perhaps elite characteristics. The way ahead for us in Wales is co-operation. Your Lordships may remember that years ago I mentioned this matter in a constitutional debate. If it wished, in present conditions, the Labour Party could have bullied through such a system as would have produced a virtually monolithic result in the assembly elections. We specifically chose, I believe honourably, not to do that. I am happy to confirm that there will be an independent commission to propose the standing orders, and the way the assembly should operate. In due time, as the noble Lord implied, if experience then shows that amendment of those standing orders is required, the assembly will be fully entitled to do that. We want inclusiveness. This is not simply a talisman that we have produced; it is what we really want. I hope that we have begun to demonstrate that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-09_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount St. Davids: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that he wished the assembly to be politically inclusive. How will it take on board the great tradition that we have in local government in West Wales of the independent member? I cite as an example Pembrokeshire County Council, where two-thirds of the seats are held by independents. Annex C.6 of the White Paper states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Political parties will be permitted to nominate individuals". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para2"></a>Independent groups are not parties and cannot group together. Does the Minister have an answer to that point?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I do not see any reason why an independent group should not register itself. The noble Viscount raises a very important point. As he will know, I am familiar with the long independent tradition--for instance, in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. It is an important <P>


<a name="column_1339"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1339</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>question and I shall turn my mind to it--not in any sense of "kicking the ball into the long grass"; I genuinely believe it to be important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I might ask a brief technical question from this side of the House. The Minister may wish to write to me rather than explain the matter at the Dispatch Box. I believe he said that the staff of the Welsh Office would be transferred to the new Welsh assembly but would still be home civil servants. Effectively, they would be answerable to the Secretary of State, who would in effect employ them. When it comes to disbursing public money, it is not politicians who write the cheques; it is civil servants. They take their instructions from politicians. When the civil servants in the Welsh Office write out cheques to disburse public money, whose instruction will they take--that of their "employer", or that of the assembly, which is not their employer?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord may have misunderstood what I said. I was very eager to underline and demonstrate that civil servants will remain bound by the high degree of fidelity to the public interest that they constantly demonstrate. If assembly sums are to be disbursed, that will be done on the authority of the assembly, not the Secretary of State for Wales. I was particularly anxious to underline that the public duties of civil servants will be maintained intact. They will not suffer any loss of independence by virtue of the fact that they will serve the public interest through the vehicle of the Welsh assembly as opposed to serving it through the vehicle of the presently constituted Welsh Office.

<P>

I was about to say that, had earlier remarks been shorter, we could perhaps have included more speakers; however, in deference to those who spoke I shall not say so.

<A NAME = "70722-09_para7"></a>I hope that we can deal with Amendment No. 26 quite quickly. It returns to the general proposition set out in the report of the Commission on the Conduct of Referendums as to what we ought to be doing with regard to the situation in this Parliament: we are promised four or five referendums, of which this is to be the first.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para8"></a>I accepted the point made in Committee by the Government that to draw up a referendums Bill--which is, I believe, the right way to proceed--before starting on the first referendum would not allow the Government to obey their election manifesto promise to hold the two referendums in relation to Scotland and Wales in September. I understand that. On the basis of their manifesto the Government have a good case for saying that we ought to proceed in the way in which we are proceeding, with these two referendums.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para9"></a>However, I wish to place on record, and try to elicit from the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate who will reply, merely some kind of appreciation--I do not even seek a commitment--of the argument in favour of having a generic referendums Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para10"></a>In Committee I quoted at some length the opinions of the commission, whose members included some very important people. The commission made this matter perfectly clear in its report. Perhaps I may quote from Guideline 3 of the report. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If the Government is planning a series of referendums, it has the option of establishing a statutory framework for the conduct of referendums through the enactment of a generic Referendum Act. Such an Act would demonstrate the Government's commitment to the efficient, fair and consistent conduct of referendums. It would provide for the establishment of an independent 'Referendum Commission' and include fixed rules on some matters (for example the organisation of the poll and the count). For other matters, on which it is impossible to determine rules in advance (for example, the wording of the question), the Act should set out how a decision should be reached. Those matters which will be different in each referendum and are likely to be of Parliamentary concern could be dealt with through primary legislation on each occasion". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para11"></a>The proof of that argument is contained in the Marshalled List that is before us, in which the schedules contain--I make no complaint about that because it was my idea--the mechanism for holding the referendum. It does so in the way set out because it has to ride piggyback on the Representation of the People Acts. I think all noble Lords will agree that that is not a very satisfactory way to proceed. There is constant cross-referencing. It would be far better to have a proper Act which, like the Representation of the People Acts, allowed referendums to be fought on a common basis.

<A NAME = "70722-09_para12"></a>I wish briefly to draw to the attention of the House a letter that I received from Mr. Michael Clancy, deputy secretary of the Law Society of Scotland, who, I have no doubt, is not unknown to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate. He states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I read with interest the exchange between you and the Lord Advocate (Official Report Volume 581 No.28, column 420). The Society considers that there may be some advantages to the enactment of a generic Referendum Act and is currently gathering information on Acts which relate to referendums in other jurisdictions. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There are of course many difficulties in relation to a Referendum Act not least the issue of the Referendum Commission. No doubt this and other issues will become clearer as the Society concludes its examination". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para13"></a>I know that the noble and learned Lord received a copy as that is stated at the foot of my letter. He will therefore know that this is the society's view. The letter uses the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there may be some advantages", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para14"></a>However, I suggest that there would be very considerable advantage.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para15"></a>This is merely a probing amendment. However, I hope that the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate will think beyond September and see that, in relation to referendums to come, such a measure would save us all a great deal of bother. It would save schedules of the kind that we see here having to appear in every referendum Bill. It would be the right and proper way to proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para16"></a>I suggest that we should set up a commission now. It would not take a lot of time to appoint one or two people merely to look at the way in which the referendums work in Scotland and Wales in September and then to report to both Houses of Parliament and to the Government. That could be used as one of the factors in the creation of a generic referendums Act. I beg to move.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Lord Advocate   (Lord Hardie): </B>  My Lords, the amendment is identical in terms to the one which was moved by the noble Lord in Committee. That was withdrawn after a lengthy debate. Noble Lords will recall that the question of an independent commission was debated at some length in Committee and I seem to recall that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, acknowledged that he did not wish the bureaucracy of a full-blown commission. I am grateful to him for acknowledging today--as he did on the previous occasion--that it would not be appropriate to have a referendum Act as part of this referendum as that clearly would not be possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para17"></a>I remind the noble Lord of what he said in dealing with this amendment at Committee stage and contrast it with what he said a few moments ago about the time taken to set up such an independent commission. On 7th July, at col. 423 of Hansard, he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Of course I appreciate the difficulty of setting up a commission, as I propose, in the short time we have available". <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para18"></a>He acknowledged at that time that there were difficulties in the timescale in setting up the commission that he proposes in Amendment No. 26, which is in identical terms.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para19"></a>It is all very well talking about setting up a statutory commission, but the commission would have to be in place before the referendums in September if it is to have a proper opportunity to monitor them. The appointments procedure for such a commission would no doubt be a lengthy affair and, in my submission, it would be very difficult if not impossible to hold the referendums by autumn of this year, as promised in the manifesto, if one were to go along that route and accept the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para20"></a>During the passage of the Bill the Government have indicated the precise dates on which it is intended to hold the referendums. I am sure that the people of Scotland and Wales would not accept any unnecessary delay arising from my accepting this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para21"></a>I am also sure that the noble Lord did not wish to frustrate the Government's manifesto commitment in that regard when he put down the amendment. I urge him to reflect and to withdraw it today. He has quite properly, on several occasions, drawn the attention of the House to the report of the Commission on the Conduct of Referendums. Perhaps I may assure him that, were he to visit the Scottish and Welsh Offices, he would find a number of well-thumbed copies of the report, which has been an extremely useful document to the Government in preparing our proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para22"></a>I said earlier that I thought the delay would be unnecessary. I also point out to noble Lords that the preparation of the report on which the noble Lord relies illustrates another matter. The commission did its work without any prompting from the Government. It did not require a statutory commission to be set up and in my submission it is unnecessary to have a commission at this time.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para23"></a>Previous referendums have been held successfully, as was recognised in the commission's report. Lessons have been learnt from them and noble Lords will appreciate that each referendum is different in many respects. However, I can assure the House that, should any lessons be learnt from the forthcoming referendums, the Government will take account of them in providing for future referendums. That is what was done in the past in respect of this referendum and it is what our predecessors did in respect of the 1979 referendums.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-09_para24"></a>Quite rightly, I believe, Parliament will wish to consider on its merits the legislation providing for each referendum, as we are doing today. That allows the opportunity to consider how each individual referendum will be run, while taking account of past experience. I do not think that anything will be gained by these amendments, which would simply add another layer to the process.

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1343</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do not want to contemplate the idea of a commission which would learn from what happens during these referendums? Do the Government not wish to learn from the report of the Commission on the Conduct of Referendums and lay recommendations before the House for future referendums? That course seems a practical idea. Is the noble and learned Lord discounting it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for seeking clarification on the matter. As I sought to explain, there is not time available to set up the statutory commission prior to the undertaking of the referendums. Of course we shall look at what happens in the referendums and learn any lessons that arise. I would not want to give the impression that either the Government or I are being complacent and saying that we could never learn from any experience. The way that this has been done in the past is to look at what happened in the past, learn from it and take matters forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para0"></a>It is not appropriate in this Bill, because of the timescale, to have such a commission. Therefore, it is not appropriate for the House to deal with it at this stage. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate for reminding me of what I said at Committee stage. I had not forgotten. One of the points of the Report stage in your Lordships' House, as it is in the other place, is that it allows Members to reflect on what was said in Committee. On reflection, I thought that I was rather overstating the difficulty of setting up a commission. Governments can do things pretty quickly when they put their mind to it. Probably a small commission could be put in place in plenty of time to look over the referendums. I am happy to hear that the Government will be looking and learning although, to be honest, I would rather have a slightly more independent eye than that of the Government to do the looking and learning.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para1"></a>Once again, however, the noble and learned Lord, like other Ministers, has failed to answer the second part of the debate about the conduct of future referendums. I know that this is Report stage, but I should be happy to allow him to intervene to indicate whether the Government have any sympathy for and are prepared to give any consideration to the proposition that there should be a generic referendums Act. If they do not, then the next time we come to a referendums Bill we shall have to go through many of the same hoops that we have gone through with this Bill. Then it will be the next one and then the next one, and that is very unsatisfactory.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may intervene. If there is another referendum Bill, I trust and hope that we shall not waste the time on it that we have wasted on this one and that the Opposition's intentions will be a little better placed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I do not think I need to take any lessons on opposition from the <P>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1344</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Lord, Lord Mackie. He has now moved to total support for the Government and has long forgotten that the Opposition's job is to probe and question, to ask what the Government intend by legislation. I suggest that he should go home--the noble Baroness on the Government Benches shakes her head--and, over the Recess, read some of the debates in the last Parliament where legislation was considered in great detail, quite rightly, by people on this side of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para2"></a>I never made any complaint, even when we sat very late into the night, a good deal later than I have kept your Lordships with the Committee stage. That kind of intervention tempts me to show your Lordships that I am as capable as the noble Earl, Lord Russell, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis of Heigham, at keeping a Committee stage going long after we should all decently be home in our beds. Government Ministers are looking at me with some horror. I assure your Lordships that I intend to resist the temptation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para3"></a>I am afraid that we shall have to come back to these issues when we have the next referendum. That is a pity. But perhaps by then the Government will have had a chance to reflect and decide that in everyone's interests it would be better to bring forward a representation of the people (referendums) Bill so that we know the basis on which all referendums will be conducted and will not have to go through very large schedules, as we have on this Bill, which we then have to marry to the appropriate Representation of the People Act. With that expression of disappointment, I withdraw my amendment.

After Clause 3, insert the following new clause--

(" . Every household in Scotland and Wales shall receive a publicly-funded leaflet giving general information on the conduct of the referendums, and statements of the "Yes" and "No" cases relating to each referendum proposition, such statements to be of equal length and to be prepared by the organisations campaigning in the referendums.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we discussed this amendment in Committee and at that stage the Government said that they would consider the matter of funding and come back to us. I quote the noble Lord, Lord Williams of Mostyn:

<A NAME = "70722-10_para7"></a>He said that in response to the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, who graced us with his presence on that day. I believe I am right in saying that the Welsh <P>


<a name="column_1345"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1345</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>White Paper indicates that the Government have decided that there will be a shortened version of the White Paper, which will be a more popular version, and that it will be distributed--by post, I presume--to every household in Wales.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para8"></a>I have not had a chance to look at the White Paper but, frankly, it will be the first government White Paper which presents a balanced picture for and against the Government's case. I make no complaint about that. I do not believe that in 18 years we produced a White Paper which contained both the Government's case and the Opposition's case in the same document. I do not ask the Government to add another chapter to their popular version, if I may so call it, giving the other point of view. But, undoubtedly, if the Government are to do what I have just suggested, at cost to public funds there will be a document going to every person in Scotland and Wales indicating the contents of the White Paper and, I have little doubt, putting the argument for the White Paper. I make no complaint about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para9"></a>But I shall complain if there will not be a similar facility for those who are campaigning against the White Paper and against the proposition that there should be an assembly in Wales and a parliament in Scotland. When there is a general election, the Government do not usually send out at taxpayers' expense a publication urging people to vote for the Government; though no doubt the party managers of both parties, when in government, would consider that to be not a bad idea and equally, party managers of the party not in government would think it an extremely bad idea. Rightly, we have not done that. I have tabled another amendment for later discussion which addresses the way in which we proceed at general elections and probes whether that would be the better way. But this procedure in particular rides on the proposition that a document precis-ing the White Paper will be sent to every household. My amendment seeks to know whether we shall include with that document or send separately an argument--I shall be quite fair--for the "yes" campaign and another for the "no" campaign.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para10"></a>Your Lordships will realise just how fair I am being because there will be two "yes" to one "no" over the Government's White Paper, which will be set out in, I hope, measured tones; and then there will be the more campaigning leaflet of the "yes" campaign and the "no" campaign. Obviously, if the Government just want to send their precis of the White Paper and a summary of the arguments against it, I shall be quite content. But I am trying to be reasonable in this matter and accept that the White Paper stands a little apart--not much--from a campaigning document on behalf of those who wish the people of Scotland and Wales to vote for the propositions in the White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para11"></a>I hope that I have sufficiently explained the position on this amendment and that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, who will reply to the amendment, will be able to give us some further information on how the Government intend to use public funds to make people in Scotland and Wales aware not just of their White <P>

<A NAME="70722-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, let me briefly add a little background on what appears to be happening, which I believe is relevant. Again, I rely on the press in Wales. We are told that there will be a new "hi-tech Referendum Unit" established on Millbank and that the spin doctors who campaigned for the Labour Party and who led the campaign in the general election are spearheading the campaign to get a "yes" in the referendum in Wales. We are told that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Labour's campaign in Wales is being organised with an almost military precision". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para12"></a>The Western Mail continues:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The use of Labour's general election machinery, drafting in English MPs to help with the Yes campaign, the appearance of Cabinet Ministers, a party political broadcast, rallies and public meetings, all lead to the impression that the people of Wales are in for a pro-devolution blitz. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Not only will there be &#163;700,000 spent on Government publicity about the facts and figures involved in creating an Assembly, but there will also be a helpline for those with queries. A special bargain White Paper priced &#163;3 will be available at newsagents across Wales". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para13"></a>I believe that we ought to hear a little more about that helpline. Who will be sitting on the other end of the telephone? Will they be civil servants in the Welsh Office. Will they be the spin doctors on Millbank? Who will be responsible? Who exactly is paying the bills? May we be allowed to know exactly what will be the total costs of putting over the Government's case and whether we shall be told at the end of the day what they in fact were?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-10_para14"></a>Bearing in mind the undoubted sympathy expressed by the Minister when we last spoke about these matters for putting over fairly to people in neutral terms the basic facts without the arguments, I hope that we can have some elaboration now of his ideas and that he has been able to come up with some positive thoughts to reassure us.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may ask the Minister also to comment on a report in the Sunday Telegraph two days ago. I hope that the Government Front Bench has seen it. It stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government has earmarked more than &#163;2 million of taxpayers' money for a 'propaganda fund' designed to help deliver victory in the referendums on devolution for Scotland and Wales. </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The money will be used to produce a range of videos and pamphlets, as well as to staff telephone hotlines explaining the proposals for a Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para0"></a>The Government have said that the referendum is to be modelled on the first one in this country in 1975 and also will follow the 1979 referendum in Scotland. On both those occasions a Labour government were in office.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para1"></a>Let me return to the 1979 referendum because I can compare it also with the 1975 referendum. In 1978, the Government said that they were modelling the referendum on the referendum on Europe. In 1979 the Government were officially supporting one side in <P>


<a name="column_1347"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1347</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the referendum. In the 1975 referendum on Europe, Ministers were allowed to campaign on both sides. There was no financial assistance, free printing or post provided by the Government. That was in 1979. There was no accounting by either side afterwards. On the other hand, in the Europe referendum, each individual's expenditure over a certain amount had to be included in the accounts and five senior Ministers' expenses were in the White Paper published afterwards. Four of them were on one side and one was on the other. Those were examined and certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Most of the money accounted for on that occasion had not been contributed by the Government. Most of it had come from other sources, but it still had to be declared and the expenditure reported.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para2"></a>In 1975--the year of the referendum on Europe--the Government gave a grant of &#163;125,000 to each side. Both sides were required to account for all contributions and to state from where they had come. In 1975 the Government published free for both sides the equivalent of a manifesto prepared by each side. That is similar to the suggestion put forward by my noble friend. That was not done in 1979 although the 1975 procedure was supposed to be followed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para3"></a>The first report to which I referred seems to suggest that propaganda for one side only is to be put out. I hope that the Minister can say whether or not there is substance in that report in the Sunday Telegraph. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate, speaking on the last amendment, said that the Government would want to learn from previous referendums. I initiated a debate in this House on 12th March 1979, nine days after the last referendum. It was quite a long debate--not the kind of short one which has to take place in the dinner break nowadays--and a number of points were made.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para4"></a>I agree entirely that, even though there is no time to set up the kind of commission proposed in the last amendment, lessons should be learnt from what is going to happen this time as well as taking into account what was done in the past. Certainly in the past two referendums, in 1975 and 1979, much trouble was taken to try to make sure that both sides received fair treatment. I am not at all happy that that is what is happening now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-11_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount St. Davids: </B>   My Lords, the "Yes for Wales" campaign is being funded by individuals and organisations who are accountable to the Inland Revenue in the United Kingdom. I understand that the "No for Wales" campaign is being funded by a tax exile--Sir Julian Hodge--who reputedly lives in Jersey. He may see it as a way of redressing the balance and giving some money to the UK taxpayer. If so, does not he meet some of the requirements of my noble friend?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Stanley of Alderley: </B>   My Lords, I support the amendment because I raised the issue at Second Reading. Can the Minister say whether, if the Government as opposed to individuals--I have no objection whatever to individuals giving whatever they <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Stanley, points to the difficulties which showed themselves when I began to investigate. On the last occasion I did not say that I would give consideration to public funding. That was a slip of the tongue. If the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, looks at the citation which he read, he will see that I did not say that I would give consideration to public funding. I said that there should be as wide dissemination of information to the public as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para5"></a>We have no intention of providing public funds to support any campaign organisation. As the noble Viscount, Lord St. Davids, pointed out, the "Yes" campaign will raise donations from those who wish to subscribe. The "No" campaign, similarly, has the right in a free society to raise funds from wherever, whether on or off shore.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para6"></a>We do not intend to provide public money to allow campaigning organisations to send statements of their case at public expense to every household. To revert again to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Stanley of Alderley, there are so many permutations--I am not teasing the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, but I can now recite the mantra; "Yes, No", "No, No", "No, Yes", "Yes, Yes"--that it simply is not practicable to give public funding to everyone who may have a view and regard themselves as a campaign organisation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para7"></a>That is the stance in principle. There are practical objections to the amendment which the noble Lord will recognise. The amendment says,

<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para8"></a>That indicates, if one looks at it, that there is an obligation on campaigning organisations to prepare leaflets. That is not a burden that can be put on a campaign organisation, which may want to have no public dissemination at public expense. It is simply not workable. Someone would have to identify the campaigning organisations. They may be quite different.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para9"></a>We have heard a variety of views in Scotland. For instance, would a campaigning organisation urging people not to vote at all be eligible for public funding? There should be a good public debate. Debates in both Houses of Parliament contribute to that. It is difficult to sit on this Bench at the moment without having quotations from the Western Mail or the Sunday Telegraph put under one's nose with the question--perhaps rather more politely put--"What do you say about that?" I read the Western Mail; I do not always read the Sunday Telegraph. I am ashamed to confess that I did not see the specific reference. Sometimes the Western Mail is accurate; sometimes it is not.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para10"></a>We are not prepared to fund mailshots. I read out the Statement made by the Secretary of State in another place and I shall repeat it if I may:

<A NAME = "70722-11_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, is quite right. It is a bargain White Paper. It costs only &#163;3. That is the conclusion to which we have come. There should be a good public debate. I believe that there will be a good public debate in both Scotland and Wales. Each campaign organisation must fund itself as it thinks appropriate. Campaign organisations will not all have the same song to sing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, he said that he read the Western Mail on this occasion. Is it or is it not true that the Government are spending &#163;700,000 on giving answers and disseminating information? I thought the noble Lord said that it was up to the campaigning bodies to raise their own money. The statement in the Western Mail is that the Government are spending the money. Can the Minister clarify what is the Government's role and expenditure?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-11_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the Government will have a proper role. For instance, they will provide a "Reminder to vote" campaign. That is not a reminder to vote either yes or no. That sort of government expenditure will take place and I regard that as proper public expenditure in a matter of this importance. What will not be available are public funds for campaigning organisations as such. I read the Western Mail. I cannot say that I retain every syllable because I have to read other newspapers as well, with greater or lesser degrees of interest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure whether I am grateful to the Minister or not. I take from his response that it is difficult for the Government to deal with the "Yes" and "No" campaigns. They are worried about who they are and how they will define their literature. At the risk of harking back to the last debate, if there were a generic referendums Act and referendums commission, that would be one of the tasks of the commission and the Government would not have to do it. That is another good reason for dealing with this issue before we hold any more referendums.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para12"></a>What worries me is that the precis White Paper will actually have in it the preface by the Prime Minister. I shall not bore your Lordships by reading out all the purple prose on the page. The last paragraph is sufficient.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I will be campaigning vigorously for a strong yes vote on 18 September". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para13"></a>Apart from the fact that the legislation now says that the Welsh referendum will be on the same day as the Scottish one, which is 11th September--I shall not go into that again--it seems to me that the precis White Paper will be campaigning vigorously for a yes vote. Therefore a document will be popping through all our letter boxes in Scotland and Wales urging us to join the Prime Minister in vigorously giving a strong yes vote on 11th September. That appears to me to be public funds being used to campaign on one side of the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-11_para14"></a>However, I recognise an uphill struggle when I see it. Getting the Government to address debates and accept the logic of arguments is indeed an uphill struggle. We <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   moved Amendment No. 29:
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo970722/text/70722-12.htm"/>

<P>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
After Clause 3, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Free postage for campaigning organisations </B></center><BR>
(" . The Secretary of State shall defray the costs of postage, subject to Post Office regulations, of any organisations designated by him for the purpose of campaigning for and against the propositions set out in Schedules 1 and 2, subject to a limit of one item per elector, containing matter relating to the referendums, not exceeding 60 grammes in weight.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70722-12_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I hope that we shall not have any textual criticism of this amendment because it is a very close crib from Section 91 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, which states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A candidate at a parliamentary election is, subject to Post Office regulations, entitled to send free of any charge for postage to each elector one postal communication containing matter relating to the election only and not exceeding 2 ounces in weight". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-12_para1"></a>I have changed the "2 ounces", to take account of modern usage, to 60 grammes, which I am assured is the Post Office equivalent of 2 ounces. Otherwise the amendment, as your Lordships will have noticed, follows very closely the wording of the Representation of the People Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-12_para2"></a>The reason for the Representation of the People Act 1983 and its predecessors deciding to allow political candidates in an election to send out free mail is simply in order to make sure that people are aware of each candidate's case and the arguments that that candidate wishes to put forward. It is part and parcel of our democratic process. If the Government have decided that that is one of the parts of our democratic process that one day, in the next year or two, they might remove, it would be nice to hear them say so today. I rather hope that all political parties are very much in favour of this service at election time which allows candidates to produce an election address and send it to each elector free of charge. What I am suggesting here is that an organisation designated by the Secretary of State for the purpose of campaigning for and against the proposition set out in the two schedules should be able to have the same facility, if it wishes to use it, as do candidates in an election.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-12_para3"></a>I have tried to get round the problem of the organisations, which the noble Lord, Lord Williams, has put to me, by saying,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any organisations designated by [the Secretary of State]". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-12_para4"></a>I am trusting the Secretary of State for Wales, whom I do not know, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, whom I do know, to carry out that task honourably. I am sure that they would do so. It would not be the most difficult task for them to carry out. In Wales, it would certainly be easier because there are only two answers--either a yes or a no. Scotland is more complicated. However, in general terms I think the first question is the dictating question, and it would be <P>


<a name="column_1351"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1351</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perfectly easy for the Secretary of State for Scotland to designate a "yes" campaign, which I gather has been set up--I have read a little about it but not a great deal--and a "no" campaign, which I know has also been set up. They could easily be designated by the Secretary of State for the purposes of this new clause to receive exactly the kind of services that are received by a candidate for election. I have said in the amendment "one item per elector". That is probably over-kill. In this day and age I think that one item per household is sufficient. But that is the way we have organised it. We have one item per elector at general elections. I see no reason why we should not do exactly the same at this referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-12_para5"></a>If the Government are to put out at taxpayers' expense a precis of the White Paper, as they have made clear they are going to do, and if in that precis they are to advocate their proposition at public expense--I should be rather surprised if they did not do that--they should give serious consideration to this amendment which allows the two campaigning organisations in Wales and the two campaigning organisations in Scotland to do what candidates are allowed to do at a general election.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-12_para6"></a>The Government cannot complain about unfairness because I conceded by withdrawing my previous amendment that the Government can go ahead with a precis of the White Paper to every household. The "yes" campaign will therefore get a second bite of the cherry. But the "no" campaign will also get a bite. If noble Lords opposite are genuine in wishing this matter to be resolved by the Scottish and Welsh people in a high turn out and wish to know the settled view of the Welsh and Scottish people, I cannot comprehend what argument the Minister will have against this amendment. I very much commend it to your Lordships and to the Government. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I am going to disappoint the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, again and essentially on the same basis as I resisted his previous amendment. The Government have come to the conclusion that they will not provide any public funds to support any campaign organisation for the referendums. The "yes" campaigns in Scotland and Wales will have to be funded in the way that the noble Viscount, Lord St. Davids, indicated.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-12_para7"></a>I agree that the amendment does not have the same technical deficiencies and I think I was careful to put the technical deficiencies in respect of the previous amendment very much as subsidiary to the point of principle at which the Government have arrived. We have come to the conclusion that it is not the occasion to provide public funds to support any campaign organisation, whether "yes" or "no". I realise that that is a disappointment to the noble Lord. I hope he will acquit me of discourtesy if I simply restate the Government's position as there comes a stage where simply repeating the Government's position with variations is not particularly fruitful. I feel a sense of time passing as this is the last occasion on the Report stage when I shall have to respond on behalf of <P>


<a name="column_1352"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1352</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Her Majesty's Government to the seduction of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, with whom it is always a pleasure to cross swords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-12_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, the last part of the Minister's remarks certainly almost dulled my critical analysis of the first part of his remarks. I am grateful to him for what he said. The essence of debate occasionally is that we do go over some of the same issues. We try to look at them from a slightly different point of view, we try to accommodate the objections made at the Committee stage and come back at Report. While, I freely admit, it has been something of a learning curve for me to do it from this Dispatch Box, I am sure that it has equally been something of a learning curve for the Minister and his colleagues to do it from the other side. I suspect that we shall have plenty of practice in the years that lie ahead.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-12_para8"></a>What worries me about what we have just heard is that when we read it in Hansard we will be able quite easily to pop "general election" into "referendum" and read an argument which the Government could easily bring forward in favour of actually abolishing the right contained in Section 91 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. I do not think even the Liberal Democrats would be happy if the Government were proposing that. I believe that all the arguments in favour of candidates having the right to send out a leaflet free of charge are as persuasive for these two referendums as they are for general elections and by-elections.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-12_para9"></a>I am not happy with the answer. I wish to see how many of your Lordships will join me in registering our displeasure that the Government are not prepared to follow in referendums the procedures of Section 91 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. I wish to test the opinion of the House.

After Clause 3, insert the following new clause--
<center><B>Broadcasting impartiality </B></center><BR>
(" .--(1) It shall be the duty of every broadcasting authority to satisfy themselves that, so far as possible, the programmes broadcast by the authority comply with the requirement that due impartiality is preserved on the part of the persons providing the programmes as respects matters relating to the propositions set out in Schedules 1 and 2.
<BR>
(2) Organisations campaigning for and against the propositions set out in Schedules 1 and 2 shall be allowed broadcasting time at the same hour of the day and of the same duration only, such that strict impartiality is observed by the broadcasting authorities.
<BR>
(3) No party political broadcast referring to the referendums or to the affairs of Scotland or Wales shall be transmitted between the enactment of this legislation and the date of the referendums.").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this new clause comes in three parts. I have drawn the first subsection from the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973. Essentially, it tries to lay down a duty of impartiality on broadcasting authorities. The second subsection discusses whether or not the campaigning organisations should have party political broadcasts. The third subsection relates to what I might call ordinary party political broadcasts on behalf of the political parties in the time between the enactment of this legislation and the date of the referendums. I hope that the Government will say that I have no need to be concerned about this. I shall be very grateful if I can get that on the record.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para1"></a>Dealing with the first subsection, the broadcasting authorities themselves must make sure that they give due impartiality to the,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"matters relating to the propositions set out in Schedules 1 and 2." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para2"></a>In Scotland and Wales what normally happens in political broadcasting of every kind, including discussion programmes and radio and television news programmes, is that the broadcasters attempt, often on the same programme, to give balance and to have the four political parties in both countries represented. That is not done quite so often in news programmes, for obvious reasons, but they try over time to give balance. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, and I have taken part in a number of programmes in which balance has been attempted, although on at least one occasion a member of one of the minority parties did not turn up so that the balance that the BBC was trying to achieve failed. It could hardly be blamed because the balancing party decided not to come along or had forgotten the engagement or whatever.
<P>


<a name="column_1355"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1355</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para3"></a>What I am concerned about--and I am sure that the broadcasters are equally concerned--is what they will be doing during the time between the end of next week when this Bill becomes law and 11th September. What will they be doing when it comes to balance? If they continue the kind of political programmes that we are used to in Scotland and Wales, we shall have the nationalists, the Liberals and the Labour Party all advocating a "Yes" vote in a programme. I still find it hard to believe that the Government can be comfortable with the nationalists being on the same side and saying that voting "Yes" would be a good idea when we all know that they want to go the next step to independence, and beside them there is a claimed unionist saying that it is a good idea because he does not want to go the next step. There seems to be a contradiction there which we could expose. Nonetheless, there would be three people advocating a "Yes" vote in Scotland and in Wales, and one person, a Conservative, advocating a "No" vote. I do not think that that would be a proper balance when discussing the propositions set out in Schedules 1 and 2.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para4"></a>I hope that that is not the way in which the Government envisage that the broadcasters will act and I hope that the broadcasters will not act in that way. They might be grateful for some guidance. I also hope that the broadcasters will seek to achieve some balance between the "Yes" and the "No" so that in a programme on which four people are interviewed, there will be two people with views on the "Yes" side and two people whose views are on the "No" side. That will be the broad balance that the broadcasters should attempt to achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para5"></a>I do not know whether I drew this matter to your Lordships' attention previously, but, in the commission document to which I have referred on a number of occasions, Guideline 17 states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A balance should be maintained between the 'Yes' and 'No' viewpoints rather than between the different political parties. Broadcasters should be encouraged to provide a limited amount of airtime for setting out the arguments for each option in the referendum". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para6"></a>If Wales is anything like Scotland I suspect that the broadcasters will provide what the public will rapidly regard as far too much airtime for discussion of this issue because the one thing that we know is that the chattering classes in Scotland and in Wales are a great deal more thorough on this than almost any other group in either Scotland or in Wales. That is my first proposition, which is covered by the first subsection. I hope that the Government will be able to reassure me on that point and give the broadcasters some guidance.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para7"></a>The second subsection relates to party political broadcasts on behalf of the "Yes" and "No" campaigns in both Scotland and in Wales. I think that that speaks for itself. Will the broadcasters be obliged under the legislation to give to the "Yes" and "No" campaigns equal time and equal positioning in the broadcasting environment with which to put forward their cases in the nature of a party political broadcast? That is a clear question.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para8"></a>The third proposition relates to party political broadcasts as we know them. It is possible to imagine that there may be party political broadcasts in August <P>


<a name="column_1356"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1356</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and September although I suspect that the parties know that people are on holiday and that they are not very interested in party political broadcasts at such times. In previous debates we have been told that the population of Scotland will be hard at work throughout the whole of August and September. Although I do not imagine that the parties will be desperately keen to put out such broadcasts during August or at the beginning of September, I should like to know what the Government envisage in that regard. The referendum will be a fairly important topic in August and September, so there may not be any other issues on which party political broadcasts will be made. That is why I think that this point is relevant.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para9"></a>Perhaps I may remind whichever Minister is to answer--I believe that it may be the noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate, which will be most appropriate--of a case in the Outer House before Lord Ross on 19th February 1979. The case was Wilson v. Independent Broadcasting Authority. Party political broadcasts were under discussion in that case and your Lordships might be interested to know that the Wilson referred to was then a vigorous campaigner on the "No" side. He is now Minister of State at the Scottish Office and is keeping a very quiet profile on these matters. Indeed, he described himself the other day as a "caretaker Minister". He seems to have had a conversion on the road from Stornoway--perhaps it was the road from Ardrossan in his constituency or even on the road to Ardrossan before that area became his constituency. I am referring to Brian Wilson, whom I know well. We were both educated at the same school although not at the same time. He is therefore a man of high intellect and good education. I would not dispute that.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para10"></a>Brian Wilson and others, the executives of the then Labour "Vote No" campaign committee, brought that action against the Independent Broadcasting Authority because the parties in Scotland were going to put out party political broadcasts advocating a "Yes" vote and Brian Wilson and his friends thought that that was in breach of the IBA's responsibilities. Your Lordships will be happy to hear that I shall not bore you with the learned judgment of Lord Ross--your Lordships may not have been bored--but the conclusion was that party political broadcasts would be in breach and they did not then take place. In my third subsection I am simply seeking to establish that we shall start from that proposition and that there will be no need for Brian Wilson or anybody else--such as Mr. Smith in Wales--to go to court to try to ensure that party political broadcasts do not take place during the referendum campaign.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para11"></a>As we come towards the end of our procedures on this Bill, I am very much looking forward to receiving from the Lord Advocate the kind of assurances which will leave me deeply satisfied. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Crickhowell: </B>   My Lords, I rise briefly but with a particular interest in the answer to this question as I am a director of one of the television companies which will be broadcasting during the referendum campaign and which is subject to the decisions of the Independent Television Commission. It is important that <P>


<a name="column_1357"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1357</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I should know the answer, particularly, as I believe that I pointed this out on an earlier amendment, given the report in the Welsh press that there will be a government party political broadcast in the run-up to the holding of the referendum. It would be most unfortunate if we got into a situation, almost by chance, where a government party political broadcast went out (perhaps because it had been scheduled for some time) but there was no opportunity for an alternative party political broadcast to be given which would allow the "No" campaign to have its say. Much the best solution seems to be that there should be no party political broadcasts at all during that period.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-13_para12"></a>I turn now to the other question raised by my noble friend. It is desirable that there should be a balance. However, as I discovered when I took part last week (for the first time) in a broadcast at midnight--it is not a practice that I hope to repeat frequently--on exactly the topic of Welsh devolution that we are now discussing, "balance" to the broadcasters currently means having three who are in favour of an assembly and one who is supposed to do battle on the other side. I do not mind being in that position and I am sure that I made the case extremely powerfully and won the argument, but it is a pretty odd sort of balance and I do not want to have to spend the whole of August and September carrying out the job of being the odd one out on such a broadcast.

<A NAME="70722-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may add a footnote to what my noble friend Lord Mackay said when moving the amendment. There was yet another Wilson who could have been involved in the case. I refer to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilson of Langside, who was at that time the joint chairman of the "No" campaign in Scotland. He had been a former Lord Advocate in the Labour Government. He could easily have been another Wilson doing the same thing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I can give noble Lords opposite some comfort on this amendment. I do not think that there is any need to be concerned. I was interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, reminding me of the Wilson case. My memory is often bad, but in view of the fact that I drew that case to the attention of the Committee, I am bound to say that in the intervening two weeks my memory has not yet gone so bad that I cannot remember the case--although I must say that it seems longer ago than that. Wilson will be followed by the courts, and that is one reason why this amendment is unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-14_para0"></a>I said at Committee stage that responsibility for what was broadcast rested with the broadcasters and the regulatory authorities. Noble Lords will recall that at Committee stage I set out at length the position on broadcasting. I do not propose to repeat myself. I simply refer noble Lords to Hansard and cols. 420, 434 and 435 of the proceedings in Committee. But there are codes in place to ensure that the reporting of controversial subjects is treated with due impartiality and accuracy both in the news services and in the more <P>


<a name="column_1358"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1358</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>general area of programmes dealing with matters of public policy or political controversy. In that situation I believe that the first part of the amendment is unnecessary. As the noble Lord, Lord Elis-Thomas, said at Committee stage (at col. 433 of Hansard), it is for the existing broadcasting authorities to ensure on behalf of Parliament that the broadcasters operate impartially.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-14_para1"></a>The tradition is that the Government do not interfere in such matters. It is for the broadcasters themselves to observe the code and to face up to their responsibilities. I urge the House not to deviate from that norm. The matter is best left to the broadcasters. If they fail in their objectives the courts will intervene, as happened in Wilson. This has happened in very few cases. The very fact that there are few cases indicates that broadcasters act responsibly. I am sure that they will do so in the reporting and coverage of the lead-up to the referendums. I believe that the amendment in the three subsections seeks to interfere with the way in which broadcasters fulfil that duty. I suggest that such interference is neither necessary nor appropriate in view of the safeguards in place. The situation has worked well in the past both as regards general elections and referendums.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-14_para2"></a>As far as concerns subsection (2), this introduces a new point. It imposes a particular view of what "impartiality" means. I am not sure what would be the effect of allowing organisations to campaign at the same broadcasting time for the same duration. Does it mean that any organisation that declares itself to be campaigning for or against the proposition should be given exactly the same air time? That raises the prospect of, say, half a dozen people coming together to form an organisation. It is quite legitimate for them to do so. Are they to have the same time as Scotland Forward or Think Twice, both of which organisations apparently have a substantial following? Is that fair or sensible? Should we not simply leave the matter to the broadcasters themselves to decide? Is it appropriate for us to set out in legislation that the time allocated to one organisation must be on precisely the same date or time of day as is allocated to another organisation? It may be that to do so will not result in appropriate impartiality on the part of the broadcasters. For that reason I suggest that this subsection is also unnecessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-14_para3"></a>As far as concerns subsection (3), I submit that this is also unnecessary but that it goes further than Wilson. As the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, has already observed, Wilson is the law and it protects those who are anxious about party political broadcasts covering the referendum. No doubt the various broadcasting organisations and bodies will take that into account in deciding how they are to fulfil their obligations. I do not believe it is appropriate for me to give free legal advice to the company of the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell. No doubt it has access to lawyers who can advise it in appropriate terms, for which it will have to pay a modest charge.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-14_para4"></a>As far as concerns subsection (3), it goes slightly further than Wilson in the sense that it prohibits a party political broadcast dealing with the affairs of Scotland or Wales during the referendum campaign. It is not confined to the referendum. One can imagine that something may arise in the run-up to the referendum that is unconnected <P>


<a name="column_1359"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>with it which justifies a party political broadcast about that issue. That issue may have a bearing on the affairs of Wales or Scotland. This amendment will preclude that. I do not believe that that is a desirable outcome of this amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-14_para5"></a>In short, I ask noble Lords to reflect on the way in which broadcasting companies have fulfilled their obligations with responsibility in the past. Let us leave it to them to continue to do so, and let us leave it to the courts to ensure that on the rare occasions when they overstep the mark they are brought back into line. This is not an area in which the Government should seek to regulate and, with respect, it is not appropriate for this House to do so either. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, before the noble and learned Lord sits down, can he express a view on the point put by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish? He said that there were only two arguments for and against and therefore the time would be allocated fairly not between the parties but between the argument for and against. The noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, said that he had been involved in a broadcast which had been three to one against him. There is nothing more desirable than to have three to one against one if one has half the time available to put one's argument. It would be nice if the noble and learned Lord could give a view on that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-14_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hardie: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, raises an interesting question which, from recollection, was addressed in Wilson. Where in a referendum there are only two options, "Yes" or "No", as I understand was the position in 1979, the court has held that there must be balance as between the "Yes" campaign and the "No" campaign. This time the situation in Scotland is slightly more complicated. As the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, has pointed out, one has the "Yes, yes" group, the "Yes, no" group, the "No, yes" group and the "No, no" group. It will be for the broadcasting authorities to decide how to provide balance in that situation. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, that the question is not simply one of three against one, as the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, has said. In such a programme, obviously if the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, were given more time, or half the time, there would be a balance. Knowing the noble Lord's abilities, I am sure that he would not need such an advantage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for that response and to the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie for his intervention which encapsulated some of the points that I was making. I hope that the noble and learned Lord does not think that such legislation is unnecessary because I cribbed--if that is the word--pretty closely from the Independent Broadcasting Authority Act 1973 which lays out some of the matters in subsections (1) and (2). I pretty well followed what is said in the Act, amending it slightly to take account of the fact that we are dealing with referendums and not general elections.

<A NAME = "70722-14_para6"></a>Between what the noble and learned Lord said today and what he said in Committee, I am reassured about the first subsection. I have little doubt that the broadcasters will follow impartiality in the circumstances explained to us by the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie. On the second, I can see some of the problems, but clearly if the broadcasters decide that one of the parties should have a party political broadcast, they will have to give the same facility to the others. It has to be roughly the same day of the week and time as given to the other parties. The words are again taken from the Independent Broadcasting Act 1973.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-14_para7"></a>It clearly would not be balanced to have a party political broadcast for one side at 9 o'clock in the evening on a weekday, and for the other side, let us say, at 9 o'clock in the morning on a Saturday. The law already laid down makes it clear that factors such as the day of the week and time of the day must be taken into account in deciding whether there is balance.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-14_para8"></a>I was a little worried about the noble and learned Lord's answer to the third point. He seemed to be suggesting that the Government might want to have a party political broadcast on Scottish affairs. That would worry me. However, I am probably at ease with that proposition when I read the judgment of the Lord Ross, which I hope encapsulates what I believe to be the right way to proceed. He said:

<BR>

<A NAME = "70722-14_para9"></a>that was the independent broadcasting authorities--

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"what political broadcasts if any should be arranged in relation to the referendum in place of the four party political broadcasts in question. It will be necessary however to ensure that the same time is given to the proponents of 'Yes' as is given to the proponents of 'No'. If no broadcast can be arranged that may be unfortunate but in that event there will at least be no question of a failure to maintain a proper balance. Nor will the public be entirely deprived of information contained in broadcasts regarding the referendum since, as I have already observed, there will be current affairs broadcasts dealing with the referendum". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-14_para10"></a>If the Government decided that they wanted a party political broadcast in Scotland or Wales because of something that had arisen, the broadcasting authorities would have to be mindful of the words that I have read out from that judgment.

<A NAME = "70722-15_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments No. 34 and 56. These amendments are technical and are intended simply to clarify the scope of the finance provision in Clause 5 which allows expenditure in preparation for the establishment of a Scottish parliament or Welsh assembly to be paid out of money provided by Parliament. The intention is that this provision should cover not only expenditure on the building or refurbishment of parliament/assembly buildings, but also advance expenditure on, for example, any adjustment to Inland Revenue and DSS computer systems required to cope with the tax-varying powers of the Scottish parliament. Such changes have a long lead time, and if the tax-varying power is to be available on establishment of the Scottish parliament (whether or not the parliament decides to use it), it may be necessary to incur expenditure before the main devolution legislation reaches the statute book.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para3"></a>These amendments are intended to put beyond any doubt the question of whether such expenditure would be covered by Clause 5.

I shall not do so, because I should then raise the ire of the noble Lord, Lord Mackie of Benshie, who came to my help on the previous amendment. I am happy to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, on his amendments.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I think I understood the Minister to say that it was likely that it would be Treasury Ministers who would be the additional Ministers concerned. If I am wrong, I should be glad if he would say so. My experience is that the Treasury is unlikely to approve any expenditure before a scheme has been approved by Parliament. Is he suggesting that the Treasury would approve the initial expenditure on equipment for a parliament before it had even been decided by Parliament that such a thing should exist, or are there other Ministers and other objects which this is to cover?

<P>
<P>

I am trying to find an answer to a question which has been posed a number of times by my noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish and others; namely, just how advisory is the referendum? The question has been asked that way round and I am now asking it the other way around. I suggest that something should be placed on the ballot paper which states that the referendum is advisory and that things can change afterwards. Indeed, when the Bill is in its final form, there may be aspects of it which are unrecognisable from the White Paper. It may be that in the course of the consideration of the Bill, we shall find something which can be changed to advantage with which the noble Lord and the Government agree; for example, amendments in relation to the points raised today by my noble friend Lord St. Davids dealing with the independent members in Wales and how they could be fitted into the assembly.

What a thought! I have absolutely no intention of being mischievous. But the whole subject indicates a certain amount of interesting confusion on the part of the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para14"></a>In the late 1970s, the building of the former Royal High School in Edinburgh was earmarked as the site for the proposed Scottish parliament. A great deal of public money was spent on refurbishing it and equipping an oval chamber for the parliament. As we all know, it did not come about and the offices became the offices of the Lord Advocate, although I think that his department has now moved elsewhere. The debating chamber was used on a number of occasions by the Scottish Grand Committee when it met in Edinburgh. Therefore, in my previous capacity, I have debated with, among others, the noble Lord, Lord Ewing of Kirkford, whom I see opposite, in the former Royal High School.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para15"></a>For the past 18 years, the campaigners in favour of an assembly have advocated that it should meet in that building. It has been picketed for years by one particular group, although I have not passed through or by that picket line. Indeed, it has been shown as one of the montages of Scottish views introducing Scottish political programmes. Clearly the broadcasters thought that if the parliament ever arrived, it would be seated in the Royal High School. Indeed, I suspect that that was the view of almost everyone in Scotland until about a couple of weeks ago.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para16"></a>My recollection was that in order to give the members of the parliament and its officials the necessary office space, use would be made of Old St. Andrew's House across the road.

<FONT SIZE=3>panelled rooms in Old St. Andrew's House with terrific views over the city of Edinburgh. However, that is another point. That was the idea in the late 1970s and was throughout the 18 years of the government of my noble friend Lady Thatcher and my right honourable friend John Major.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para17"></a>Therefore, it came as a surprise to us all--including, I am sure, to the people picketing there--that the Secretary of State for Scotland suddenly discovered that the premises were not suitable. That seems amazing given the number of times that he must have debated in it as a member of the Scottish Grand Committee. I am still not entirely sure why that conclusion has been reached.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para18"></a>I wonder idly, and perhaps mischievously again, whether the simple fact is that the civil servants currently using the rather beautiful offices in Old St. Andrew's House told the new Government on 2nd May, "If you think we're moving out of here, have another thought. Possession is nine-tenths of the law and we are staying here." I do not blame them. When I was a Minister at the Scottish Office I occupied for most of the time an office in Old St. Andrew's House. Only very reluctantly did I move to New St. Andrew's House in the last year of my ministerial career. I can understand that the officials do not wish to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para19"></a>But, of course, if they do not move, then the parliament must be sited somewhere else. Mr. Dewar has now indicated that there will be a great competition to decide where it should be sited. I do not wish to go into the arguments but the former Royal High School has a lot going for it. Edinburgh is about to become a car-free city if some of the eccentric people who run its council get their way. As people will be coming from all over Scotland, it seems to me that the nearer the proposed parliament is to the main railway station, Waverley station, the better. That will certainly be true for the great majority of the members of the assembly who will be travelling from west and central Scotland. That can be done easily from Queen Street on the train. They will arrive at Waverley and can just walk up the hill. It is a short walk and it will be very good for them. It is slightly uphill, which will raise their heartbeats sufficiently to keep them healthy and prevent too many by-elections.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para20"></a>Seriously, I believe that there is a huge advantage, if the assembly is to happen at all, in it being in the centre of Edinburgh beside the railway station, if it must be in Edinburgh. The Government should make efforts to find their way round the accommodation problem. If that means having an argument with their civil servants and the permanent under-secretary, I suggest they have that argument. If my words of encouragement to them reinforce them in that argument, I shall be very pleased.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para21"></a>I do not believe that Leith is a suitable site. It is not easy to get to without a motorcar and it seems to me to be important that the parliament should be in the centre of Edinburgh. As I live in Glasgow and play a very small part in the life of that city, your <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Lordships might expect me to offer Glasgow as an alternative. The transport arrangements are certainly much better. Glasgow does not have that obsession against the motorcar. It has a good motorway system. The railway lines are extremely good and come into the centre. I am quite sure that the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Mr. Pat Lally, who is very adventurous in such matters, would very quickly find a site to accommodate the assembly and all the other necessary people if that were an option.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para22"></a>This small debate will give many of your Lordships an opportunity to put an oar in for a favourite place. I expect to hear Stirling mentioned, and perhaps Falkirk, as I see the noble Lord, Lord Ewing of Kirkford, present. Perth or even Aberdeen may come from the Minister, if he is allowed to have any independent thought at all. There are a number of variations.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para23"></a>But my serious point is to ask why, after all this time, it has been decided that the Royal High School is not suitable. Why should we embark on what will be a fairly expensive operation to build a purpose-built parliament building with all the necessary offices? It will be a considerable expense. Dare I suggest that that money might be used to get the Secretary of State out of the dilemma that he is in about the Skye Bridge. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Advocate might certainly consider that to be a better use of &#163;30 million or &#163;40 million--or even double that--of resources. Before the extra money is spent--and, after all, it will come out of the Scottish grant, out of the health and education services--we, the Scottish public, ought to be allowed a view on the matter. As we shall be asked in the second question about whether we want tax raising powers, we should be asked whether we want to shift the Scottish parliament from the place where for the past 20 years everyone thought it would be to a purpose built place somewhere in Edinburgh or in another part of Scotland which has not yet been determined and for which there is to be an architects' competition.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-15_para24"></a>Finally, even if the building is inadequate, would it not be better to start the process, if it starts, and then allow the parliament and its government to decide where it will be set up? If the Government are serious about wanting these decisions to be taken in Scotland, would it not be a good start to allow the Scottish parliament to decide for itself whether the buildings are adequate and where it ought to be set up? I believe that the big brother attitude which the Secretary of State for Scotland is exhibiting is out of kilter with his normal views. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, is urging me to complete my contribution and I shall do so. I beg to move.

<FONT SIZE=3>School is good sense. The people of Scotland have expected the parliament to be sited there and I believe that the Government must give serious consideration before they upset that idea. I do not know why they have announced that they are considering an alternative, but no doubt the Minister will tell us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-16_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, I am concerned about the amendment. First, if Scotland is to have its own new purpose built parliament where will the money come from? In that respect, I was relieved when the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, moved Amendment No. 33 because I understood that the setting up of the parliament would be paid for out of Exchequer grants from Westminster rather than out of the Scottish grant. That gave me some comfort, but I was a little concerned when my noble friend Lord Mackay said that he believes that anything to do with the parliament will come out of the Scottish grant.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-16_para0"></a>My concern is that any new building should be traditional and not, for example, like the St. James' Centre in Edinburgh. I have always believed that that is not in keeping with George Street, Princes Street or Queen Street and that when it comes to local authority planning there are double standards. That upsets me a great deal.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-16_para1"></a>I believe that wherever the parliament is established it must have suitable parking facilities. As a Member of your Lordships' House for some years, it has been my experience that we do not keep normal hours and I would not necessarily want to keep any other hours. Any Member, from a Minister to a Back-Bencher such as myself, who is involved in a Bill needs a fair amount of the morning to carry out research. Therefore, parliament cannot sit at ordinary times and many people will need to use their cars when attending the parliament in Scotland. Unlike London, Edinburgh does not have a first-class public service. Although I do not know Glasgow too well, I do not believe that the service can be as good as it is in London.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-16_para2"></a>Finally, if the Government are planning a new purpose built parliament, will they consider establishing it in Perth? Perth really is at the centre of Scotland. There is almost nowhere, from Dumfries to Wick, that cannot be reached in about two hours by motorcar. That is one of the great advantages of Perth. I realise that civil servants involved in the parliament would have to travel from Edinburgh, which would be their base, but I believe that the suggestion is worth making at this stage. I ask the Government to take it on board. I will not say that the amendment is the kind that I would support in a Division, but it has raised important points.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lyell: </B>   My Lords, I have been in the centre of Edinburgh only twice during the past 13 months, but I find St. Andrew's House akin to the maze at Hampton Court when one is attempting to find one's way around let alone to the Royal High School. Will there be parking for the future MSPs?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-16_para3"></a>Will the Minister confirm that Perth was the capital of Scotland until 1437 when the King was murdered? The court moved to Edinburgh to escape the warring clans, such as those of my noble neighbour Lord Mackie and myself. Indeed, one had to cross not one but two rivers, the Tay and the Forth. That is why the entire court and the administration of Scotland moved to Edinburgh in the 15th century. I believe that now is the time to reverse that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-16_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Perth: </B>   My Lords, I feel that I must take part in the debate since I have the honour to bear the name Perth. It is right that until the middle of the 15th century St. Johnstone, as it was in those days, and Edinburgh vied as the capital. Sometimes the court was at one place and sometimes it was at the other. I can promise the Government that if they considered Perth seriously I know that it can provide just the site at the Horse Cross. It is an admirable place near the Perth museum, which is perhaps appropriate. I do not wish to pursue the matter further, except to say that the parliament would be most welcome.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, we learn something new every day. Finally, we have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, that he is so committed to the devolution project that for the past several decades he has refrained from passing through the picket line outside the Royal High School. That is good news.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-16_para4"></a>I liked the argument about Perth. Of course, if one is looking around Scotland, no city can offer as much delight and delectation to Scottish parliamentarians as can Perth. I am interested in the argument that it should be the site of the new parliament because it is in the centre of Scotland. On the same argument, I take it that we shall shortly be moving to Meriden, which is the centre of England. I do not think we can decide this matter on the basis of geographical centrality, however attractive that may be.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-16_para5"></a>There was criticism of why we had just announced the proposal to review the location of the parliament. We were asked if we had just woken up to the problem, as it were. The answer is simple. The government who were in office until 1st May and who had been in office for the previous 18 years had not been particularly concerned to establish whether the Royal High School was a suitable location for a Scottish parliament. They had a slightly different view of what should happen to Scotland in constitutional terms. Some 20 years ago the Royal High School was considered to be suitable but times move on. There have been changes and the condition of the building has significantly changed. I must make it absolutely clear that at this stage we are not ruling out the Royal High School. However, we believe we should take a broader view and take into account a broader range of options before reaching a decision to ensure that a new parliament for Scotland can be housed and can operate from a suitable building that is appropriate for a modern, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>functioning, working parliament. That is the point. It would be premature to cut short such consideration by determining the matter in a rather inadequate manner by means of the two questions that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, offers in his amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-16_para6"></a>I make one serious point--not that the others have not been serious--in the context of the Royal High School. We all know that the nature of public life has changed significantly over the past two decades, and not always for the best. An issue which now has a higher profile than formerly is that of security. Those who know the location of the Royal High School will recognise that it poses significant problems for security. It may be possible to overcome those problems. As I say, we have not ruled out the site. We want to consider the whole range of options. Twenty years ago I do not think that we would have had in the forefront of our minds the need to protect the security of those who perform their day-to-day business on the site of the parliament and the fact that a wide-ranging group of people might visit it from time to time. For those reasons I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-16_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, will he bear in mind the problem of parking? Many of us, if we were members of the parliament, would still need to travel to Edinburgh by car.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl makes a fair point. The problem of parking will clearly be borne in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to those noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, who I believe described the amendment as daft--I am not sure whether that was the word he used, but it is a fair precis of it--but said that the argument had some merit. I am grateful to him for saying that because it was to get the argument on the record that I tabled the amendment in the form I did.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-16_para7"></a>The Minister rather puzzled me when he suggested that this Parliament might move to Meriden because that is the centre of England. I wonder whether the Government have some further plans to turn this Parliament into the parliament of England. Perhaps the West Lothian question is a little deeper than even I thought it was.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-16_para8"></a>I take the point about security and the former Royal High School. As regards the measures that I assume will be discussed on Thursday, I am not certain that the Scottish parliament will debate the kind of issues which result in security being as big a problem as it is for this Parliament. However, I appreciate that there may be a security problem. I could mischievously say that if all these difficulties exist there is a perfectly good parliament for Scotland here on the banks of the Thames as part and parcel <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>of the United Kingdom. That is a fair point but it is not original. I noted that someone made that point in the letters page of one of the Scottish newspapers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-16_para9"></a>However, the authorities here have managed to adapt a 100 year-old building imaginatively and well to the needs and the work of a modern parliament. That has been achieved with the addition of buildings outside Parliament which are used as Members' offices. I suggest to the Minister--this is meant to be constructive--that a discussion with those who have adapted this building may be useful in terms of developing ideas about the location of the Scottish parliament. I notice that the Minister completely ignored the question of Old St. Andrew's House. However, if I were in his shoes, I might not want to send a message to my officials that I was about to turf them out of their rather nice offices and move them to rather poorer, modern offices. As the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, said, this is a serious issue. I hope that the Government will consider it in much greater detail than they have to date. Above all, I hope they will consider the point I made that perhaps we should leave this decision to the people who will sit in the new parliament, if that comes about.

<center><B>BACK OF PAPER </B></center><center><B>YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE AS PROXY </B></center><BR>
1. This proxy paper gives you the right to vote as proxy on behalf of the elector whose name is given overleaf.
<BR>
2. Your appointment as proxy will be for the referendum only. You have the right to vote as proxy only at the referendum specified in the proxy paper.
<BR>
3. Prior to the elector applying to have you appointed as proxy, you should have been consulted and asked if you were capable of being, and willing to be, appointed as proxy, or you should have signed a statement to the effect that you were capable of being, and were willing to be appointed as proxy. You are capable of being appointed as proxy if you are at least 18 years old on polling day, a British or other Commonwealth citizen, a citizen of any other member state of the European Union, a citizen of the Republic of Ireland and not for any reason disqualified from voting. If for any reason you are not capable of being, or are not willing to be, the proxy please advise the elector, without delay, in order that the elector may cancel the appointment.
<BR>
4. You may vote as proxy at the polling station allotted to the elector on whose behalf you are appointed. However, you may not vote as proxy at the same referendum for more than two electors of whom you are not the husband, wife, parent, grandparent, brother, sister, child or grandchild. Shortly before polling day you will be sent a proxy poll card telling you where the polling station is. You do not need to take either the poll card or this proxy paper to the polling station but you may find it helpful to do so. You should note that the elector may still vote in person. If ballot papers are issued to the elector at the polling station before you apply there for ballot papers as the proxy, you will not be entitled to vote as the proxy.
<BR>
5. You may also apply to vote by post as proxy at the referendum if the Electoral Registration Officer is satisfied that you cannot reasonably be expected to vote in person at the elector's polling station.
<BR>
Any application to vote by post as proxy should be made on Form R.P.F. 11 REF (Scotland) which may be obtained from the Electoral Registration Officer. You should note that the Electoral Registration <P>

<A NAME = "70722-17_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, it is perhaps appropriate that at Report stage we reach the final series of amendments which echo the broadly constructive attitude that has been taken towards the Bill from all sides of the House. We recognise that there are significant differences of view and opinion and they have been fairly reflected as we have progressed through the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, in his normal helpful, positive and supportive manner, suggested at virtually the earliest possible stage, for reasons that were totally altruistic, that the orders through which the referendum would be implemented should be incorporated into the Bill. After mature reflection and a quick consultation with my diary, I similarly came to the view that there was great merit in incorporating the orders in the Bill. This series of amendments is the means by which that is achieved. I shall discuss the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, later. I beg to move.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish </B>   moved, as an amendment to Amendment No. 50, Amendment No. 51:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Leave out lines 94 to 96.<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I decided that it would be easier on the Minister if I highlighted the three or four issues that I wish to mention in this schedule by tabling probing amendments rather than making a speech of which the Minister has no notice and to which he may not be able to give a substantive reply. There is a huge amount of detail in Amendment No. 50. To follow that detail your Lordships would have to sit in the Library with a copy of the Representation of the People Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para1"></a>At the risk of repeating myself, I believe that once that exercise is done the reason for my suggesting a referendums Act becomes even more apparent. But I shall not go over that again.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para2"></a>Amendment No. 51 takes out the paragraph which states that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A counting officer shall, in accordance with any directions given by his Chief Counting Officer, appoint persons to observe the counting of the votes and the verification of the ballot paper accounts". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para3"></a>Normally in parliamentary and local government elections, names are suggested by the candidates for the people who will go to the count and verify that the procedure has been undertaken properly. They verify the ballot papers and that the counting has been done properly. The procedures are well rehearsed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para4"></a>There is a limitation on the numbers. The returning officer can take into account the size of the premises available, how many people can reasonably be accommodated, and how many candidates are to be accommodated. It is clear that at general and local elections it is the candidates who nominate or suggest those who can go to the count on their behalf.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para5"></a>I merely probe this point. From where does the counting officer get his names? We come back to the campaigning organisations. I do not wish to go over all those difficulties. Is that where the counting officer looks for them? Alternatively, does he look to the political parties? Does he require balance between the "Yes" and the "No", given the referendum questions? The issue is more complicated with the two questions, but I shall leave the matter on the principal question, the "Yes" and the "No". Does he require a balance of persons to observe the counting of votes? Those are my points, I hope that the Minister will be able to respond.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, in effect there is little between us in what we wish to achieve. The difficulty is the amendment. If it were accepted, it would make it impossible for anyone to observe the count. I hope that it will therefore be withdrawn.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para6"></a>It is important that the count is observed: that it is open and seen to be fair. On the point about where the chief counting officer and counting officers look for people whom they can approve to attend the count, I am happy to fall back on their judgment. I am sure that there will be people who will seek to attend the count. I am happy to rely on the judgment of the professionals in deciding who will be there.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister says, I do not propose to put the amendment to a Division because if I were to win that would result in no observers being present at the count.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para7"></a>I had rather hoped that he would go a little further. I understand that the counting officer may look to Members of Parliament for that area and councillors. But I believe that the counting officer should look for a balance. While I understand that it might be difficult to frame in law, given Pepper v. Hart and other matters, it would have been nice to have received an assurance from the Minister on the record that he would expect the counting officer to look for a balance between the two sides of the proposition when he decides who should be observers at the count.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, it would be quite proper for a counting officer to have in mind the attempt to achieve balance.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-18_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for clarifying that. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para8"></a>Amendment No. 51, as an amendment to Amendment No. 50, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=2><BR>
Leave out lines 420 to 422.<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para9"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment draws attention to the provisions of Rule 20 in the Representation of the People Act 1983. It involves the official mark. As noble Lords who voted recently in local government elections--it is all that we are allowed <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>to do--will recall, a perforated mark is stamped on the ballot paper when it is handed over. If the ballot paper is not perforated when it turns up eventually at the count, it is not allowed. Indeed, the issue is a matter of dispute in the case of one parliamentary seat at the last election.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para10"></a>On the occasion of the referendum in Scotland, although not in Wales, the people presiding over the polling stations will have to stamp two ballot papers. I believe that that will add to the time taken to vote. It may not seem much, but if every person who votes at a busy time has to have his or her ballot paper stamped not once but twice, inevitably it will increase the time taken. It increases the danger of one or both papers being missed at that busy time. Is it wise to continue with that rule?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para11"></a>That brings me to my more general point. Why do we keep this rule? It may be an issue for wider debate, but I find it hard to understand what the perforation prevents. It may stop someone stealing a wad of ballot papers, filling them in, and popping them secretly into a ballot box somewhere, or somehow putting them on the table at the count when everyone's back is turned. I think that very unlikely. I do not think that anyone would try to steal the ballot papers, as I suggested. If they did, it does not seem to be a much further step to steal the franking machine. Therefore, the proposition appears even more ridiculous. I wonder why we carry on with the process. Have the Government given some consideration to the time taken; and the increased danger that some papers will not be franked?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para12"></a>As noble Lords who have attended counts will know, either because they are involved personally or because they are overlooking someone else's, there is always a small number of papers which for some mysterious reason have not been franked. I have never been able to understand why that happens.

But there were a considerable number there which were not franked. It has caused a problem. I do not wish to talk about that. I wish to talk about franking in general and the referendum in particular.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para13"></a>My recollection is that few papers are unfranked. I was always puzzled as to why they are unfranked. However, if there is a suspicion that something really naughty has happened, it is possible to count the number of votes that were scored off in the polling station and run a check. I accept that that might delay the count, but, frankly, one of these days I believe that we shall have to start using electronic means to deal with balloting. We undertake it in a pretty old fashioned way in this modern technological age. If we did so, we should not need the official mark.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-18_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, before my noble friend replies, perhaps I may draw his attention to an incident that took place in the elections to the present all-purpose councils in Scotland. In the elections to the Falkirk Council and in the Borders, there were a number of unfranked ballot papers. The defeated candidates petitioned the sheriff court. The sheriff principals in both areas ruled that those elections were null and void because of the number of unfranked ballot papers. That is only two years ago. They ruled that the elections should be held again.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para15"></a>I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, has a serious point about the franking of ballot papers. We all know that if we go into polling stations at 8.30, and the close of the poll is 9 o'clock, there is usually a rush. The polling clerks are inclined to be under some pressure and fail to frank the ballot papers. Therefore we should examine this matter more closely.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para16"></a>I remember from my time as a parliamentary candidate that spoilt ballot papers could throw up some quite hilarious issues. When I was MP for Falkirk and Stirling Boroughs in 1974 a number of papers were spoiled by electors who wrote in referring to my previous occupation as a postman--"that postman from Fife"! The returning officer decided that in cases where the electors had indicated a specific preference for one of the candidates, namely, "that postman from Fife", those should be my votes. My majority was increased by that given number of votes.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-18_para17"></a>To return to the serious point, there have been two recent cases in Scotland, one in Falkirk and one in the Borders, where the sheriff court has been petitioned on the question of unfranked ballot papers. Such cases should be much more closely examined. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, does not wish to press his amendment. However, it is a matter for discussion across the Floor of the House and a matter for much closer examination.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

I tend to agree with both the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, and my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford that even the early technological age has not been evidenced in the way in which we proceed with our electoral arrangements. We are almost back in the time of the quill pen.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para0"></a>There would be a requirement to have some safeguard against forgery at any election. The forging of ballot papers has been a point of debate and dispute historically. It is right and proper that there should be some safeguard against forgery. I have significant doubts as to whether in this day and age the mark is the appropriate method. I do not believe that this particular Bill, at this particular time, is a way to resolve the issue.

The matter requires investigation. It is the responsibility of another place rather than of this House. Nonetheless, the system needs to be examined to see how we can move into the electronic era. I hope the fact that there will be two ballot papers to every person will not present an added problem at busy times, as the noble Lord, Lord Ewing, indicated.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para1"></a>I suppose that the only hope for this proposal is that if, on reflection, the noble Lord's colleagues think it sensible not to retain this particular rule, they could remove it at the final stage of the Bill. There is a small chance that the noble Lord might reflect upon this. If he sees it as presenting a problem for people at the polling stations, he has an opportunity to do something about it next Tuesday. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para3"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Rule 31, which I seek to have removed, relates to notification of the requirement of secrecy. Those of your Lordships who have been present at a count or have been polling agents will know that one makes a declaration of secrecy. I recall from the dim and distant past that the declaration of secrecy was taken so seriously at one particular election that people were even discouraged from going out to the toilet in case they relayed some information to the outside world about the progress of the count.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para4"></a>Nowadays, we can all see the progress of the count because the television cameras are there, let alone the radio microphones. While I do not believe I have yet seen close-ups of the piles of votes in order--although I have come pretty close to seeing that--certainly people are interviewed during the count and asked how it is going. If they are winning, they try to pretend that they are not smiling too much; if they are losing, they try to pretend that their lips are not turned down. I have experienced both, so I know exactly how it feels.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para5"></a>At the last election it was pretty clear to me at every count where the television cameras were present what the result would be before it was declared. It seems ridiculous to ask people to sign a declaration of secrecy and yet allow the media to ride roughshod over rules and procedures established over many years regarding not telling people outside the count the result until the ballot is over and declared. I am pleased to see a number of noble Lords nodding in assent, indicating that they do believe this to be an abuse of the system. I am interested to hear the Government's comments.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para6"></a>I have little doubt, given the interest of the Scottish and Welsh media, that there will be television cameras present at the counts in the referendums. There will be <P>

If the rules are not to be obeyed, I suggest that it is best to change them. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Ewing of Kirkford: </B>   My Lords, before my noble friend the Minister replies, perhaps I may help him out of what I see as a difficulty in answering this amendment. These are non-political matters for a Speaker's Conference; they are not matters for the Government of the day. Therefore my strong advice to my noble friend is merely to reply that "these are matters for a Speaker's Conference" and then sit down. Then we can all go for dinner.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-19_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, these are matters for a Speaker's Conference.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para7"></a>Before sitting down, I shall make one other point. The difficulty with the amendment, as the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, will instantly recognise, is that it removes the requirement for notification of the requirement of secrecy. It does not remove the requirement of secrecy itself. The last redoubt of the scoundrel in Committee and on Report is to take refuge in pointing out the defective drafting of the amendment. In this case I am happy to do so and echo the point made by my noble friend Lord Ewing of Kirkford; namely, that these are matters for a Speaker's Conference.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I rather fear that the quality of the replies has deteriorated again. I appreciate that that is the case. However, this was an opportunity to raise one or two issues. I took the trouble of sitting in the Library and going through this amendment with the appropriate Acts of Parliament in front of me, and it occurred to me that this would be an appropriate point at which to raise this interesting issue, which I believe is exercising other Members of this House and no doubt Members of the other place, especially if they are at the receiving end of a camera thrust into their faces when perhaps they are losing and the last thing they want is to be interviewed while the count is still going on and are busy trying to work out what gracious words they may say in defeat. The candidates who are winning have no such trouble; they are happy to be interviewed. The noble Lord, Lord Ewing, makes a perfectly proper point, but I hope that he and the Minister will not mind me raising the issue as something that is contained in the schedule. I believe that a Speaker's Conference or Parliament will have to return to it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME = "70722-19_para9"></a> The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 53A, I also wish to speak to Amendment No. 53B which is a necessary adjunct to it and which also stands in my name.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para10"></a>The amendments seek to address one unsatisfactory consequence of employing local government electoral rolls for a purpose for which they were not intended. The unsatisfactory consequence is the potential for multiple voting. Unfortunately, I was unable to be in the House on the second day of Committee to move an amendment that I had tabled to Clause 1 dealing with the point. I apologise to noble Lords for having been unavoidably absent. However, I note from the Official Report that the amendment attracted some attention. At col. 332 of Hansard for 3rd July, the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, said, as part of his answer to the amendment, that the matter would be dealt with by an Order in Council applying Section 61 of the Representation of the People legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para11"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for the change of heart which has brought the schedule to the Bill. By introducing it, he has obligingly presented me with perhaps a better opportunity to deal with the matter now. Nonetheless, my basic reaction is that it is all very well making something an offence if those who might offend do not know that they are doing so. It would be naive to suppose that the electorate would seek out and familiarise itself with either the subordinate legislation, which it might have been, or the complicated formula, which is essential to the schedule.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para12"></a>Noble Lords will see on page 16 of the Marshalled List, commencing at line 486, that the schedule imports Rule 35 and substitutes for its paragraphs (1) and (2) the forms of question that a presiding officer may put to would-be referendum voters. At line 504, paragraph (2)(b) sets out the question designed to identify a multiple voting attempt. As the schedule stands, the presiding officer does not have to ask any of the relevant questions. My amendment, Amendment No. 53A, by substituting "shall" for "may", will ensure that the relevant questions are asked. Amendment No. 53B is necessary if we make the procedure mandatory.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para13"></a>This is not the first time that the problem has arisen. The solution I offer is not perfect, but at least it is a fair stab at going some way towards meeting it. Multiple voting is, I suggest, almost impossible to police. Confirmation of that view can be found in the Official Report for 12th April 1978, when this House was in Committee on the Scotland Act. Enfranchisement of Peers for assembly elections under that Act must be via the local government roll. In the course of replying to amendments that I moved, the noble and learned Lord, Lord McCluskey, for the Government, proposed following the same course as the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, outlined on 3rd July this year. But the noble and learned Lord added, at col. 640 of the Official Report for 12th April 1978:

<P>

<A NAME = "70722-19_para16"></a>I do not know whether the replies to amendments proposed are on an upward curve or a downward curve at the moment in terms of quality and I have no idea how my two amendments will be received. However, if the Minister who is to reply has significant difficulty with my amendments or their wording, perhaps in the course of his answer he will consider giving an undertaking that a statement making the position clear will appear, perhaps on every polling card and in any informatory leaflet which may yet arrive in households.

<A NAME="70722-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, unfortunately my noble friend Lord Molyneaux has just left his place so he will not be able to verify my comments. As I understand it, a well-known maxim in Ulster, particularly in areas controlled by Sinn Fein, is: "Vote early and vote often". The pair of amendments in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Gray, would help to obviate the danger of that malpractice occurring in Scotland. Therefore, I suggest that they should be supported.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I think my noble friend Lord Gray makes a valid point. It is all very well for legislators to say: "You should not vote more than once", but when people get two polling cards, for example, dare I suggest that they may become a little confused and think that they do have the right to vote more than once. After all, they have two polling cards in their hands. That is one of the penalties of having a local government register, but I shall not revisit that argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para0"></a>My noble friend has a valid point and he suggests a way of getting round the difficulty. He might even be prepared to accept that the second question in paragraph (2)(b) should be obligatory because that will bring to someone's attention the question: "Have you voted before?", or "Have you voted already in the referendum?". If people have done so because they appear on two registers as a result of the local government problem, they will at least know that they are, in sailing jargon, "sailing into danger". They will then be able to say: "Yes, I have", but they may also say: "But I have two polling cards. Am I not allowed to vote on each of them?". Then the presiding officer can explain. My noble friend has a good point on this.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Gray, explained, Amendments Nos. 53A and 53B deal with the questions that the presiding officer at the polling station may or should ask voters before giving them ballot papers. At elections, presiding officers can ask voters whether they are the person mentioned in the relevant entry in the register and whether the voter has already voted, as the noble Lord explained.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para1"></a>Amendment No. 53A would require the presiding officer at the polling station to put those questions to every voter. At elections, the presiding officer only puts the questions if he believes it necessary or if specifically asked to do so by the candidates or their agents.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para2"></a>Amendment No. 53B is related and requires both the statutory questions to be put rather than "one or both". We believe that it would be better to leave the use of the statutory questions to the presiding officer's discretion. To use them on every occasion would, I am afraid, slow the voting process quite unnecessarily and may well cause problems in the polling station itself. As at normal elections, those questions would be available to be used if and when required, I am not convinced of the power of the argument that has been advanced. I am afraid that I have to ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-20_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Gray: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords who have supported me and thank the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, for his answer. I must say that the quality of the answers due to this side of the House is on the downward curve at this moment. It is a disappointing answer. I am not certain that slowing the electoral process is an adequate reason for perhaps condoning an offence. On the other hand, I am certain that the quality of the presiding officers is such that they will do their very best.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para3"></a>At this hour and in these circumstances, I do not think I have much alternative but to withdraw. However, I did not hear any comment on my suggestion that people might be advised of the position via the polling card or something else. If, before I withdraw the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, would like to interrupt me and comment, I should be grateful.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-20_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, the whole range of issues that we have been discussing in the past few moments indicate general disquiet about the present arrangements.

<FONT SIZE=3>will, no doubt, bring a great deal of pleasure to some noble Lords. It will not bring half as much pleasure to your Lordships as it brings to me, I must say.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para7"></a>Amendments Nos. 54 and 55 are on a slightly different issue, although they address the same part of the rules that my noble friend Lord Gray has just discussed. I tabled them partly because, as I have told your Lordships before, I live in the constituency of Glasgow Govan, where a certain number of questions are posed over some of the people who voted. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Monson, drew our attention to the supposed adage about voters in Northern Ireland: "Vote early and vote often".
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para8"></a>Suppose one intends to impersonate someone and vote in his or her stead, either because one knows that the person is not there and one is safe in doing so or simply because it has been arranged for imaginary people to be registered, their polling cards have been picked up and off one goes. Perhaps I may suggest that, even if the presiding officer asks the two questions, if one is into that kind of villainy, one will say, "Yes, I am the person registered and of course I have not voted anywhere else." So the two questions are rather weak. Therefore, if we are serious about this matter, I have suggested that we ought to give the presiding officer the power to ask a third question; namely, "May I have some verification of your identity?" I make that point very seriously, although I suspect that, having been well guided by his noble friend Lord Ewing, the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, will tell us that this is a matter for a Speaker's Conference.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para9"></a>If in fact this becomes a matter for a Speaker's Conference, I shall feel that I have done a reasonably good job for a few minutes this evening. It is a serious problem. People who vote for either imaginary people whom they have registered or other people whom they know to be out of the country and therefore not going to vote represent a much more serious problem than that addressed by franking ballot papers that we discussed a few moments ago. I do not say that many people do it but I am afraid that quite clearly it is done. Everybody who has been involved in elections has the occasional story about it, without much evidence. As I said, it has become a considerable scandal in the constituency of Glasgow Govan. I believe that this amendment would be one of the ways to get round that problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para10"></a>I should not go quite so far as my noble friend and make the question obligatory on every elector. In many polling stations, especially in rural areas, the presiding officer knows everybody who comes to vote. But in cities that is not the case at all. Therefore, I believe that if the presiding officer had the right to ask the third question, we should put up a blockade to personation which is not put up by questions (2)(a) and (2)(b).
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para11"></a>Even if the noble Lord cannot accept my amendment, I hope that he will accept the argument that I put forward and suggest to his honourable and right honourable friends in government that, should a Speaker's Conference about electoral matters take place, we should consider this whole question. I do not say <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>that my solution is perfect but I believe that the right of the presiding officer to ask for evidence inevitably has to come in our elections in the future. I beg to move.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-20_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, Amendments Nos. 54 and 55 seek to add a further statutory question which voters can be asked at the polling stations; namely, "May I have some verification of your identity?" I can imagine the response that is likely to be given in some of the polling stations with which I am familiar should an officer of the poll ask that question. But let us leave that matter apart; perhaps I know places which are too rough.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para12"></a>According to the amendment, voters will be invited to show some form of verification. As the noble Lord indicated, we do not have that feature at present in relation to elections, either parliamentary or local. I do not believe that a case can be made that it ought to be introduced specifically for a referendum. I do not think that that was the case made by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-20_para13"></a>In terms of the amendment, if a person could not produce some form of identity, he or she would still be able to vote; the ability to vote is not dependent on being able to produce some form of identity.

So, what would happen if he turned up at a polling station with a photograph of Robert Redgrave and, on being asked for some evidence of identity, produced that photograph? What is the purpose of producing evidence of identity? The noble Earl, Lord Lindsay, could produce a Robert Redgrave lookalike!<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para1"></a>It is a serious problem and one day we shall need to consider giving that extra piece of armoury to polling station presiding officers to ensure that people are not voting for people who cannot turn up or imaginary people whom they have arranged to reside at certain addresses on 10th October who receive polling cards.

<A NAME="70722-21_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Balfour: </B>   My Lords, in relation to Amendment No. 50 I wish to make a technical point. Perhaps noble Lords would be good enough to turn to the schedule at page 10 of the Second Marshalled List. I should first like to refer to paragraph (g) and then to paragraph (f). Paragraph (g) states,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a reference to a person's entitlement as an elector to an absent vote shall be construed as a reference to a person's entitlement to vote by post on his own behalf"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para4"></a>fair enough--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or to vote by proxy". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para5"></a>That seems to me to be a strange way of putting it. Perhaps it should be, "or to appoint somebody else to vote by proxy". I am wondering about that wording.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para6"></a>Paragraph (f) says,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a reference to a person voting as an elector shall be construed as a reference to a person voting on his own behalf". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para7"></a>That seems fair enough. I feel that the wording should perhaps be, "or on behalf of another person by proxy". That is my first question. It is a technical one. Will the Minister be good enough to look at that between now and Third Reading?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para8"></a>To save time I shall ask my second question. There is an interesting difference between the elections for the European Parliament and the elections for the Parliament at Westminster or local government elections. For the European parliamentary elections, no polling agents are appointed. That is an interesting difference. Will the referendum be similar to a national election or a European election from the point of view of polling agents? Perhaps the Minister can answer that question.

<A NAME="70722-21_spopq0"></A><B> Viscount Mersey </B>  rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they intend to give full support to the Sussex Downs Conservation Board in their management of the Sussex Downs area of outstanding natural beauty from April 1998.
<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para12"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I feel that I am uniquely placed and privileged to ask the Question. I live at Bignor, on the northern escarpment of the Downs. I was christened in Bignor Church in 1934. I expect to be buried there, as was my father and as was his father, near the Roman Villa.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para13"></a>The Sussex Downs area of outstanding natural beauty in which we live is 400 square miles. At its western end, where we are, it includes also the Weald up to the Surrey border and is 25 miles wide. But further east, where the River Adur cuts through it at Lancing, it is only three miles. It is only 50 miles from here. It is a rural sanctuary sandwiched between two urban developments. To the north lie London's outriders--Horsham, Crawley and Haywards Heath--and to the south lies a great ribbon of seaside towns--Bognor, Littlehampton, Worthing, Shoreham, Hove, Brighton and so on through to Eastbourne.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para14"></a>It was incursion from the South that first worried us. In the 1920s Peacehaven was built on top of the Downs where they plunge into the sea east of Brighton. The society of Sussex Downsmen tried to prevent further urban sprawl. Then followed various preservation plans. One idea in the 1950s was that it should become a national park. However, it was considered already too cultivated for that status: more redolent of Dartmoor or the Peak District. Instead it became one of 40 AONBs in 1965.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para15"></a>Sadly, that still did not provide sufficient protection. Indeed, it is reckoned that 80 per cent. of Sussex Downland has been lost to us over the past 50 years. That is why the Sussex Downs Conservation Board was formed six years ago, but as an experiment. It was a temporary measure and its remit runs out in April of next year. Happily, the Government have just given it a most welcome reprieve of a further three years, albeit with reduced funding. During those three years consultation should give rise to a permanent solution and the 64,000 dollar question is: what is that permanent solution to be?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para16"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, will, I feel sure, have read the adjourned debate in another place on 4th July moved by my honourable friend the Member for Arandale and South Downs and the reply of her honourable friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment. I must confess that I was encouraged by that reply. It seems that government recognise that the conservation board has worked well and that they believe in the maxim, "If it works, don't fix it".
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para17"></a>I hope therefore that the board will be given permanent status over the next three years. That may require primary legislation and some alteration. But not, please, alteration to a national park. National parks are <P>


<a name="column_1409"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1409</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>expensive--&#163;3 million per annum per park. The Sussex Downs Conservation Board is cheap--only one-third of the cost of a park. It relies on a large body of voluntary staff, including 200 rangers.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para18"></a>Then there may be planning difficulties. National park policy can fight local authority policy. But with the Downs conservation board, such a fight cannot take place since all 13 local authorities are represented on it. Besides, the board gives planning advice only. Planning power still rests with the local authorities. Admittedly, the board is too big. It has 36 members--12 from district councils, 12 from county councils and 12 from the Countryside Commission. My solution is to remove those 12 from the Countryside Commission and substitute direct funding from the Department of the Environment for the commission funding. We would then have a democratically elected board of 24 people funded half locally and half nationally.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para19"></a>I must now mention the neighbouring East Hampshire area of outstanding natural beauty and suggest, as have government, that it should join the board which should then be renamed the South Downs Conservation Board. East Hampshire has another 150 square miles of rolling Downland stretching to Winchester. It is managed by three local authorities. If each put up two members, the board numbers would climb back again to 30. So that is my solution: a permanent board, including Hampshire, funded 50-50 by local authorities and government.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para20"></a>There are other solutions. Last summer a seminar was held at Sussex University. Six different solutions were proposed, ranging from a return to the pre-1992 position to a full-blown national park. The former is clearly not on and the latter, to my mind, is too drastic. But whichever solution we adopt, we cannot relax. A three-year reprieve seems long but it took the present board nearly three years from the date of its original legal creation until it was up and running. We must get moving now to guarantee preservation of this part of our heritage.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para21"></a>As I said, I am fortunate. I can just remember my uncle taking me to the top of Bignor Hill before the war and saying that on a clear day you could see the Isle of Wight. Nearly 60 years later, we have the same view, with Stane Street stretching away to Chichester. But to our east, others are less fortunate. There the AONB is narrower and the demands of expansion wider: not just demand for buildings, but demand for golf courses, football grounds and other recreational facilities which would destroy the fauna, the flora and the very essence of the South Downs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para22"></a>Today, 32 million visitors enjoy this conservation area in happy harmony. I ask the Government to ensure that they continue so to do for many years to come.

Both the residents and visitors to Sussex will be extremely grateful to him. Like, I suspect, many other noble Lords who are to speak, I have to declare an interest. My <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>house--or rather my cottage--is in Beddingham in East Sussex downland. I am also a member of the A.27 action group, which seeks to promote environmentally acceptable road developments in the area. So I suppose I could be categorised as a NIMBY (not in my back yard) but I hope to show that that is not my main concern.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para23"></a>I benefit not only from living in a beautiful, spacious landscape but also because the classification AONB and, with that, the eagle eye of the Sussex Downs Conservation Board ensure that any development that is allowed is in keeping with the environment so that its character is preserved; and preserved not merely for the benefit of those who, like myself, are lucky enough to live there but for those who make the 32 million visits per annum to the South Downs that the conservation board has calculated.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para24"></a>Close to my cottage is a public footpath, maintained incidentally by the conservation board. Sometimes quite large groups of people--walkers or joggers--pass by. We had a local marathon 10 days ago. Occasionally their conversation, as they walk along, disturbs the rural peace. But that is a small price to pay for the privilege of living there.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para25"></a>Noble Lords will remember that Voltaire once wrote to a certain Abbe le Riche, "Monsieur l'abbe, I detest what you write but I would give my life to make it possible for you to continue to write it". It is fairly unlikely that I would give my life for walkers or joggers, but by supporting the South Downs Conservation Board and encouraging Her Majesty's Government to do so a little more generously in future than perhaps they have for the two years after 1998, I may be contributing to the future enjoyment by walkers and joggers of the South Downs, which I consider to be one of the lungs of London.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para26"></a>More disturbing than those who jog by are those who motor by--in my case one-third of a mile away along the A.27, the trunk road that passes through the South Downs. The white sound of tyres speeding over the road surface reaches noise pollution levels when the wind blows from the north. In the 18th report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution there is a map showing how between 1960 and 1992 wide streets of traffic noise, appropriately coloured white, have, along major roads, cut into and almost halved the tranquil areas of south east England. That is the current situation without any further development.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para27"></a>Trunk roads are the responsibility of the Department of Transport but the Sussex Downs Conservation Board has an important advisory role. The plan for upgrading the A.27 to near motorway standard from Folkestone to Honiton has been shelved. However, as I have discussed with my noble friend Lady Hayman, there is a particular scheme--the Weald and Downland DBFO, a privately-financed scheme--which, while including a much-needed bypass for Polegate, near Eastbourne, also proposes a monster, environmentally intrusive, split level roundabout with a through route for a much enlarged A.27 pointing directly into unspoilt countryside in the area of outstanding natural beauty. I should like to take this opportunity to express the alarm which this <P>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1411</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>scheme is causing to a number of local and national organisations, including the Council for the Preservation of Rural England. I shall do this in advance of a visit by the South Downs Conservation Board. There are simple, much cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternatives which would still permit the much-needed Polegate bypass to be built.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para28"></a>Finally, while I do not expect my noble friend Lady Farrington to pre-empt the decision, which is imminent, on this and the other DBFO schemes, I hope she will draw these remarks to the attention of her noble friend Lady Hayman, who is the Minister concerned.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-21_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Mersey on initiating this debate and I support the purpose of his Question wholeheartedly. In doing so, I, too, should declare a non-financial but highly involved interest in the subject, being a resident of the area for over 16 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para29"></a>The Sussex Downs is to me, and to many other people, the most wonderful part of England. It is so peaceful and beautiful to walk there at any time of the day and in any season of the year. I feel especially privileged to live in such a marvellous part of the country. I do not want anything to spoil it, ever.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para30"></a>This is not NIMBYism but a statement that embodies my strongly-held belief that the unique character of the Sussex Downs, giving, as my noble friend Lord Mersey said, some 400 square miles of rolling countryside offering peace and tranquillity just 60 miles or so from the capital city of this country, must be preserved.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para31"></a>The Sussex Downs Conservation Board has done a commendable job in achieving just that--preserving it. This fact, indeed, has been acknowledged by the Countryside Commission and by the Government. In a sense this debate is superfluous in asking the Government whether they intend to give full support to the Sussex Downs Conservation Board when the Government have already, in another place, in the form of words from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Environment in an adjournment debate on 4th July given that support to the Sussex Downs Conservation Board. I quote:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Government are very appreciative of the efforts of the Sussex Downs conservation board in conserving the downs over the past five years. I hope the House will agree that the conservation board is a success story--and the Government intend to help to make it even more successful in the future".--[Official Report, Commons, 4/7/97; col. 594.) </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para32"></a>But an endorsement from this House will not go amiss and will reinforce all that has already been said.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para33"></a>It is imperative that the board should continue to be both supported and encouraged. Encouragement is not in short supply at all; funds for the support of the board may be; and that is the subject that concerns me. The Countryside Commission has supported the board most handsomely in the past, allocating about a third of its total funds to the area. However, this contribution is going to be reduced over the next three years, leaving a gap to be filled from other sources. The local authorities have also supported the board, encouraged by the <P>


<a name="column_1412"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1412</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government, and the Countryside Commission wishes to see full participation of all local authorities in the geographical area in the work of the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para34"></a>No one in this House is unaware of the strained financial resources of local authorities; so much so that it really is living in "Cloud-cuckoo-land" to expect the local authorities to increase their funding to make up the shortfall resulting from the Countryside Commission's reduced contribution. The Countryside Commission expects the board to increase income from other sources.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para35"></a>I have worked very hard over the past seven years or so trying to raise money "from other sources" for the arts and for charities. It is not easy. In fact I believe it is now even more difficult because would-be donors are inclined to think that they have been relieved of their responsibility since the introduction of the National Lottery.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para36"></a>Perhaps we can approach the National Lottery: it is certainly worth a try. But with the recent announcement that the Department of National Heritage is now to be renamed the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, I fear that applications to the National Lottery, for a truly heritage project for which that department has responsibility might not be favourably regarded. I ask the Minister to allay my fears on that point and to give encouragement to the Sussex Downs Conservation Board to make such an application, supported by yet a further endorsement from the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para37"></a>As a final point I would also like to ask the Minister if she can elaborate on the statement of her honourable friend in another place to the effect that consultation will begin later this year on,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the best way forward for managing the downs in the medium and longer term". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para38"></a>The specific questions are these: What is the time-scale for such consultation--for example, how long is it going to take? What other new assumptions are likely to be stated as a "given" in addition to the inclusion of Hampshire in the process?

<P>
<A NAME="70722-21_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lloyd of Berwick: </B>   My Lords, I too would like to congratulate the noble Viscount on raising this important question. I believe that I agree with everything that he said. My only qualification for adding anything is that I, too, like so many of your Lordships, live more or less within the shadow of the South Downs, but perhaps rather less so than some noble Lords who are to speak later. For many years I have been a member of the Sussex Downsmen. Indeed I am now honoured to be their president.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para39"></a>I shall say only a very few words because I have almost lost my voice, which may perhaps be regarded as a good thing in a judge. But at least I shall be brief. A few months ago I joined with seven or eight others, including the chairman of the National Trust and the president of the Council for the Protection of Rural England, in writing a letter to The Times calling on the then Government to do what is necessary to protect the great beauty of the South Downs. I cannot remember <P>


<a name="column_1413"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1413</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what word we used, whether we wrote "great beauty", "unique beauty", or "incomparable beauty". But we all agreed that it is one or other of those things.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para40"></a>Many noble Lords who have already spoken or who are to speak, will be as familiar as I am--perhaps more familiar--with the South Downs. The point that we tried to make in the letter is that the South Downs are not just a great joy for all of us locals, but their future is a matter of national concern, and that is the point I wish to make tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para41"></a>That brings me to the conservation board. It has only existed for a mere five years and during that time it has not spent a great deal of public money--at least not by the standards that we are now used to. But I can say that every single penny that has been spent has been money well spent. If it does not sound too quaint to say so, on behalf of the Sussex Downsmen I should like to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, and also my friend--if I may so call him--the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, for all that they have done on behalf of the South Downs over the past five years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para42"></a>To my mind it would be the greatest pity if what they have achieved were now to be thrown away owing to a lack of funds. The work of the board must be continued on a permanent basis either in its present form or in some rather similar form with marginally, but not greatly, increased powers. Above all, it must be made financially secure for the future. Having said that, I shall leave what remains to be said to those who follow.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_time5"></A><H5>8.25 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70722-21_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, I should declare an interest as the chairman of the Council for the Protection of Rural England. I am the first speaker in my noble friend's debate not to live in the South Downs. However, when I was a child my grandparents lived at Arundel, and before, during and after the war I spent early formative years enjoying the Sussex Downs. I say at once that it is precisely the sort of area which CPRE in its first 70 years has been fighting to protect.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para43"></a>The noble Lord mentioned Peacehaven. I recollected that many years ago I became lost and found myself in Peacehaven. It was that experience which first stimulated me to take up the lance to protect rural England.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para44"></a>The plea that I wish to make is an unashamed one; that the body which must protect the South Downs must be adequate for the purpose. It has been pointed out that it was originally proposed by the Hobhouse Committee in 1947 that this area should be a national park. It was not made a national park, but it was made an area of outstanding natural beauty. I fear that that AONB is now rather a second rank status compared to being a national park. Indeed, much damage over the period since 1947 has been done by the ploughing up of large parts of the Downs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para45"></a>Part of the Downs became an environmentally sensitive area in 1987. That is not enough although it is quite expensive. The cost is over &#163;1 million a year compared to a budget for the South Downs as they are now of &#163;1.3 million. The ESA is an expensive and not <P>


<a name="column_1414"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1414</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wholly effectual route to achieve the objective that we want. In 1992 we had the creation of the South Downs Conservation Board under the enlightened chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, who I believe is shortly to be succeeded by my noble friend Lord Renton of Mount Harry. Indeed, the place from which he takes his title is one that I have been fortunate enough to visit a number of times and to get to know the Downs even better.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para46"></a>But that board is financed by the Countryside Commission. For 12 years I was a member of that body. I know that it is not a satisfactory system for the Countryside Commission to be responsible for ad hoc temporary financing. The financing which is envisaged for the present is only a further three years from April next year.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para47"></a>I believe that there are two main reasons why the Downs needs national parks status, but that does not necessarily mean that they should become a national park. The first main reason is planning because one cannot trust local authorities on their own not to see land close to them and within their grasp as land to be developed. Secondly, it is necessary to secure proper funding with a 75 per cent. central government contribution.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para48"></a>I know that there are doubts about national park status for the South Downs. We have been round this track before with the Broads. There was much opposition to the need to replace the ad hoc body which was meant to look after them with the new Broads authority which was brought into effect by the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads Act 1988. As a countryside commissioner I was required to talk to angry groups of farmers, boatmen and others who thought that the arrival of such a body would take away their freedoms and their admiral's flag on the Broads. (I know that that does not apply to the Downs). The Broads Authority has worked extremely well.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para49"></a>We now have the Environment Act 1995 which could be used to strengthen the protection of the South Downs. It could create a new body which could have the existing name: it would not have to be called a national park. It could have the same name as the South Downs Conservation Board and it is hoped that it could be under the chairmanship of my noble friend. Introducing that would be a relatively simple matter--not, as I understand it, requiring primary legislation. In the first instance, the Countryside Commission would be required to draw up a plan. There would then be consultation and, if agreed, it would be for the Secretary of State to designate the agreed area as such. My final appeal to the Government is that in this crucial and beautiful area the time has come to think of a permanent, rather than a temporary, solution.

<FONT SIZE=3>Downs Way, and during the year I spent compiling it the topography and ecology of the South Downs, as well as their history and literature, were never far from my mind. I have trudged all over them and ridden the length of them on horseback. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Rea, has been disturbed by the conversation of my fellow walkers; he is fortunate not to have been of a previous generation when it was customary for ramblers to sing choruses as they walked. I suppose that I am speaking from the perspective of the 16 million or so people from beyond Sussex who visit the Sussex Downs each year.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para50"></a>When my book was first published in 1984 the South Downs Way was only in Sussex, but I extended my coverage to Winchester, recognising that the South Downs transcend administrative divisions, in contrast to the opinion of Hilaire Belloc who scornfully referred to the Hampshire border,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"beyond which there is nothing". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para51"></a>Today I detect a general acceptance that the landscape that concerns us is that which falls in Hampshire as well as in West and East Sussex--in effect, the two adjacent areas of outstanding natural beauty.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para52"></a>Another point of general agreement is that the experimental Sussex Downs Conservation Board has done a good job. As an amateur in the matter, I particularly commend the voluntary ranger service. But it has to be seen as a temporary arrangement, and the Government are very sensibly setting up a consultative process to establish the best permanent solution for the future administration of the South Downs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para53"></a>The consultation paper which was produced by the board earlier last year and which was, I believe, discussed in Sussex University, defines a number of options. These range from a reversion to the system before 1992 to an advancement towards a national park. The central issue is as to where the strategic planning authority lies. At present, the conservation board is merely an influential committee. I wish to add my voice to those who support the concept of a statutory authority, as did the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para54"></a>The extreme pressures on the South Downs are likely to intensify as never before now that the economy is roaring ahead, and big tests are yet to come, such as the plans for the sports complex in Waterhall Valley. The chronic fragility of the landscape was dramatically demonstrated in the recent exploitations of the flax tax loophole--one of them, incidentally, on the Down from which the incoming chairman of the board takes his territorial designation--Mount Harry--and partly in a site of special scientific interest. Within those parts of the downs designated as environmentally sensitive areas, the take-up by farmers of compensation schemes for grassland has been uninspiring.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para55"></a>It is hard to escape the conclusion that a higher price must be paid for the preservation of the downland, and that it will have to come from government funding. The large sums involved, together with the desirability of incorporating the East Hampshire Downs, predicate the establishment of something equivalent to a national park, even if that particular designation is to be avoided.

<A NAME = "70722-21_para56"></a>The co-operation of local authorities should surely be attainable within the provisions of the recent Environment Act. That of the landowners is also essential, especially because, without it, we are faced with the danger of extensive scrub reversion. I can think of no part of upland or lowland England where scrub reversion would be more deplorable than on the South Downs, whose appeal derives from their bare and sensuous lines, what W. H. Hudson memorably described as,

<A NAME = "70722-21_para57"></a>the result of centuries of shaving by sheep and plough. Clothed in a garment of wood and leaf, they would be scarcely distinctive or discernible.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para58"></a>What we must hope for is that they will be protected under a regime altogether more strict than that for ordinary AONBs, a strictness that must apply to visitors as well as residents, so as to recreate a sense of space and solitude such as is so sadly lacking elsewhere in south-east England today.

<A NAME="70722-21_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Addison: </B>   My Lords, I should first declare an interest as vice-president of the Council for National Parks and of the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers. There is great concern among the 43 environment and amenity organisations that make up the Council for National Parks that the South Downs should deservedly be given the status equivalent to that of a national park. During the last week I was privileged to fly over the South Downs with the Hampshire police, so the Downs are fresh in my mind.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para59"></a>The Sussex Downs Conservation Board has been successful in generating a consensus that something needs to be done to secure the future management of the South Downs. However, the South Downs deserve a more unified, Downs-focused approach to planning, to countryside and recreation management, and to landscape enhancement than the board has been able to provide. The board has lacked essential powers and the benefits that a long-term approach can bring.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para60"></a>Therefore, I warmly welcome the Government's announcement of a consultation later this year on the best way forward for managing the Downs in the medium and long term. I should like to ask the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington of Ribbleton, for an assurance that the consultation on the South Downs will genuinely explore all the options for the Downs, including that of awarding them national park status. I know that there is tremendous local support for a body with national park status to take over the management of the South Downs, building on the start made by the Sussex Downs Conservation Board.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para61"></a>The board was charged with reviewing the possibility of national park status for the Downs annually. Unfortunately, this has not happened and perhaps the board is not best placed to undertake such a review. I would also ask for an indication from the Government as to whether the consultation on the future of the Downs will be undertaken by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, in consultation with the Countryside Commission, as happened with the <P>


<a name="column_1417"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1417</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>New Forest consultation on national park status in 1992. If the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions were to undertake the consultation, this would avoid the consultation on the future of the South Downs being confused or subsumed by the Countryside Commission's forthcoming consultation on areas of outstanding natural beauty in general.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para62"></a>I understand that the Government are keen to have a permanent solution for the management of the South Downs in place before the end of the interim funding to the Sussex Downs Conservation Board; I share the concern expressed by the Minister for the Environment. I therefore hope that the Government will be able to tell us when the consultation on the future management of the Downs will start and finish.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para63"></a>I am delighted by the Government's commitment to designate more areas of countryside with national park status. I was involved in the national park-related clauses of the Environment Act 1995 and suggest that they have opened up some exciting possibilities for tailoring any new national park body to the special requirements of its area. For example, there is now some flexibility for tailoring planning arrangements to the needs of the area and also some flexibility as to whether the term "national park" needs to be used in the name of any new body. I hope that the Government will explore these options with regard to the South Downs.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-21_spnew12"></A><B> Viscount Hampden: </B>   My Lords, I should also like to congratulate the noble Viscount for introducing this important debate. I am totally opposed to the request of the noble Viscount, Lord Addison, for national park status, but perhaps he would expect that. I also declare an interest. My family has owned quite large tracts of the South Downs for many generations. I believe that Mount Caburn, an ancient hill fort behind Lewes, has been in my family since the 13th century. In the middle of the 17th century we moved southwards and acquired the parish of Beddingham where the noble Lord, Lord Rea, has his cottage. It does not belong to me any more. Thanks to a generous Act of Parliament, my great-great grandfather was voted an annuity of &#163;4,000 for his 12 years as Speaker. The family was then able to buy further large tracts of the South Downs at &#163;25 per acre in the 1890s.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para64"></a>Some of the beauty of the South Downs is pure nature and some is man made. I am afraid that my family has been responsible for some of the man made features around Lewes. One hundred and fifty years ago we went into the lime works business and clawed great chunks of chalk out of the Downs, dug clay from the marshland and built a tramway and a mining village. If I suggested today that I did any of those things everybody would come down on my head and say "No!". One hundred and fifty years later a number of these features are of great beauty. The disused clayworks is now a lake and is a sanctuary for wildfowl, owl, harriers etc. The chalkpit is a rather dramatic scar in Caburn and a place for picnics. I mention this because I believe that all planning must be for the long term and not just the short term.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para65"></a>I refer to Mount Caburn to give your Lordships some idea of the management problems. It is an ancient monument. Members of the Institute of Archaeology are to visit it next week to do a dig. English Nature has claimed it as a nature reserve. It is home to a great many burnt-tipped orchids and other species. It is also a beauty spot for walking. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, has walked there with his team when writing his book. Arrangements must be made with the local authority to provide footpaths. When the wind is in a certain direction it is the only place in the south east of England where para-gliders can operate. I must have another arrangement with them for access to car parking. It is quite a trial although a great joy. I believe it is very important that a conservation trust like that presided over by my noble friend Lord Nathan can operate in the local environment with people who understand the problems.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para66"></a>I should like to end by referring to one matter touched upon by my noble friend Lord Gladwyn. He referred to scrubbing. This is a very important matter. It takes one back to agriculture. Farming on the South Downs is not profitable. One can just about make a living out of it--at least that is what one's tenants say. In the 1930s my family was unable to let the hill farms because sheep farming was so unattractive. This led to all of the problems referred to by my noble friend: scrubbing, ranching and the disappearance of partridges and other songbirds. It is enormously important that we take into account the agricultural interest as well as all the other interests.

<A NAME="70722-21_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </B>   My Lords, I should like to declare two interests in this interesting debate on the Question asked by the noble Viscount, Lord Mersey. First, as some noble Lords have already mentioned, I have the great honour to have been elected by the South Downs Conservation Board to succeed the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, as chairman in due course. I, too, should like to pay tribute to the tremendous work of the noble Lord as chairman. He has put a huge amount of time into it. He has put in not only time but diplomacy and judgment. It is as a result of so much of his work that the board has been the success that it has.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para67"></a>My other interest is that Mount Harry is the territorial tag that is now attached to my name. It is one of the Sussex Downs that this evening we are talking about conserving. I assure the noble Viscount, Lord Hampden, that I have not been at Mount Harry for nearly as long as he has been at Glynde. It was not because of any flax tax that I chose this name. I remind the House that it was on Mount Harry on 14th May 1264 that Simon de Montfort beat Henry III at the Battle of Lewes. In January of the following year he summoned not just churchmen and lay barons but two representatives of each borough to form what was in effect the first truly democratic parliament in England. That is perhaps to be celebrated more in the other place than in your Lordships' House.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para68"></a>I should like to reply briefly to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, and my noble friends Lord Marlesford and Lord Addison on the question of <P>


<a name="column_1419"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1419</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>national park status for the Sussex Downs. I realise that this will be extensively debated in the months and years ahead. There is nothing wrong with that at all. However, having lived at Mount Harry for 30 years and been a Member of Parliament for Mid-Sussex for 23 of them, I see no sign whatever in Sussex of great support for national park status. I believe that your Lordships should bear in mind three factors. First, farmers and landowners are very much against it. They believe that they would lose a good deal of control over the use of their land. Secondly, the local authorities are against it. National parks are normally planning authorities. Therefore, local authorities will lose development control over land that is of questionable value in an area that is certainly subject to as much pressure as the Sussex Downs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para69"></a>Within the conservation board there is a planning committee that carries out co-operative work between the board, the Countryside Commission and the local authorities. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, agrees that to date that has worked extremely effectively. Arguably, it is at least better than the national park system. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Sussex Downs are not wild wilderness country like most national parks; rather, they are rolling, gentle farm landscape surrounded by towns. Ten million people live within one hour's drive of the Downs. The beauty of the Downs depends not so much on the conservation board improving rights of way and visitor facilities as the care with which farmers and landowners have looked after and tended the land, often for many generations. It is very important that in considering the future of the Downs in the years ahead one works with the grain of what is reasonably received in Sussex rather than look at exemplars in other parts of the country which frankly may not be very suitable.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para70"></a>I should like to put two questions to the noble Baroness who is to reply. These matters were raised by her colleague in the other place in the debate on 4th July. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary said she understood that financing had been agreed between local authorities, the Countryside Commission and the board for three years ahead. This is simply not so. The Countryside Commission has made its proposals. They mean a reduction of about 50 per cent. over the three years in the money that has been received from the Countryside Commission in the past three years. One needs a clear view as to what the Government expect from the board in the years ahead at a time when the amount of money available from both the Countryside Commission and local authorities is likely to be severely reduced.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para71"></a>In the other place the Parliamentary Under-Secretary also gave the impression that measures had been taken to deal with the flax problem. Last Sunday I walked past that part of Mount Harry where flax was growing. The crop is coming along very nicely. The blue flowers are now on top of the plants. I should like to know the Government's precise proposals to deal with the flax tax or subsidy in the future. This is a matter of very great concern in many areas of the Downs.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-21_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Nathan: </B>   My Lords, first I should like to thank the noble Viscount, Lord Mersey, for introducing this wide-ranging debate. I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Renton, who has already spoken is to succeed me as chairman of the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para72"></a>I declare two interests. First, I have lived in my present house in the AONB for some 45 years. Both my wife and I have lived on the margin of the AONB throughout our lives. I also declare an interest as chairman of the board effectively since it started in 1992. I believe that it has been a success. I say that because of some of the kind remarks that have been made. I am grateful to those of your Lordships who have made such remarks.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para73"></a>The Countryside Commission instructed consultants Green Balance to report to it--the consultants reported in September of last year--on the achievements and effectiveness of the board. In its report it said as to countryside management:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Board has been remarkably good value for money achieving perhaps twice as many projects (of a greater size on average) as would have been expected". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para74"></a>As to town and country planning, it says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is doubtful whether the Countryside Commission could have spent money in any other way to influence the planning of the AONB to the same extent, so we conclude that the Board has provided value for money". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para75"></a>I hope therefore that the Minister in her reply will give an unequivocal, positive answer to the Question.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para76"></a>The idea of the board originated with the two counties, East and West Sussex, which, together with the eleven district councils falling within the AONB and the Countryside Commission, established the board by agreement between them that it should continue for an experimental period of six years from 1st April 1992 to 31st March 1998. The Department of the Environment gave it a fair wind. The counties between them undertook for the six years to provide funding of &#163;600,000 per annum for that period to be matched by the Countryside Commission; that is, a 50/50 division.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para77"></a>AONBs are nationally designated, being of national and not only local importance. This is the context of the Countryside Commission's responsibilities. In 1990 the Smart Anderson Report was published relating to AONBs and the need to ensure that they were not merely second class national parks. The constitution of the board in 1992 was in part prompted as an experiment of national importance to test whether this combination of local and national membership, accountability and support would demonstrate a successful way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para78"></a>In view of the comment that has been made, I should mention that the board has considered whether it should constitute itself, or arrange that it should be a national park. It decided against that, but the matter was carefully considered at the conference at Sussex University to which reference has been made.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para79"></a>The idea of funding for an interim period from April 1998 was to provide time for consultation and decision as to the permanent arrangements for <P>


<a name="column_1421"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1421</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>administration of the AONB. The funding during this period must be adequate to keep the board in being and effective to carry out its core functions--countryside management and planning--pending the permanent arrangements coming into effect. The cut to just over 50 per cent. of previous support by the Countryside Commission presents the board with serious problems with which we are grappling. We can only carry on if the local authorities continue or increase their funding. I believe their enthusiasm is such that they will, even in these very difficult times for them. I hope that I am right. It will be essential that the Countryside Commission is flexible as to the rate of drawing down its funds (as it has indicated it will be) and as to the use to which its funding is put. The work programme for coming years earlier discussed with it will clearly require modification. The board will, as the Countryside Commission itself acknowledges, have to engage in securing substantial funds from elsewhere (itself involving time, effort and expenditure) to undertake the tasks which have over the past years given it its reputation as a trail blazer. By deferring new initiatives planned for 1998 and years following they may be funded by new money secured by our efforts, but this will take time, perhaps a couple of years or more.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para80"></a>In the meantime, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in another place said that extensive consultations would take place as to the permanent future of administration of the AONB. Can the Minister give any indication of when and how the consultation will take place? I and, I am sure, my colleagues would like to take an active and constructive part in those consultations. We have recently heard much of "fat cats". The reduction in funding results, if I may be forgiven the personal paradox, in our being slim cats on a starvation diet.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-21_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Teviot: </B>   My Lords, following that amusing speech, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Mersey for introducing this debate. I must declare an interest in that for the past 20 years I have been president of the Sussex area of the Ramblers' Association. So I shall concentrate on discussing rights of way.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para81"></a>In the same vein, time permitting, I am a serious walker and, like many others, enjoy walking the paths in the splendid landscape of the South Downs. Effective management of rights of way is a priority for the now unified Countryside Management Service, given the large number of visitors to the area. As has been said, they number a staggering 32 million a year. Incidentally, that is more than to any national park.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para82"></a>The area is well managed. As the board has pointed out, it provides not just access, but spreads the pressure and reduces the conflicts between conservation and recreation. The board has made tremendous strides in survey and maintenance, upgrading rights of way. Unlike most other areas of the countryside, it expects to come close to achieving the Countryside Commission's objective of ensuring that all rights of way are unobstructed, <P>


<a name="column_1422"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>well-maintained and accessible by 2000. Keeping them in that condition under heavy usage is an ongoing task.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para83"></a>That does not come cheaply. The board spends &#163;100,000 a year on that activity alone. The use of the South Downs paths is heavily on the increase. I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I become anecdotal. Just a week ago last Sunday, I took part in an annual event sponsored by the Long Distance Walkers Association; 1,150 people took part in three events of eight, 15 and 27 miles. I chose the latter. I was out walking roughly between 8.30 a.m. to 4 o'clock in the afternoon. I must have been one of the vulgar people to whom the noble Lord, Lord Rea, referred. He would have seen me walking bare-chested and in shorts. I hope that I was not one of those awful people who made ribald remarks over his garden fence. Next year I shall take great care and be silent.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para84"></a>Whereas in the past on that particular walk one would have seen a few other people walking on some of the supposedly lesser-used paths, this time, happily, there were many people around. That was encouraging. One felt that the message had got through, but the paths have to be managed all the more.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para85"></a>Again, and rather more worrying, on the way home I drove past Ditchling Beacon car park, owned by the National Trust, which is just outside the conurbation of Brighton. There were cars littered all over the roads because the car park was full. There one saw different types of people pursuing their leisure activities. They have just as much right as walkers such as myself. Those people want to stop to read their books and perhaps take a gentle stroll, with or without dogs, along the South Downs Way. Why not? Everyone has to be catered for. One hopes that some people may be induced to patronise less popular sites to take the weight off places like Ditchling Beacon. Again that type of activity has to be managed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para86"></a>Another point made by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, and the noble Viscount, Lord Hampden, related to clearing the scrub and all that sort of thing. That is done by the conservation board, but amateur groups must be encouraged. One to which I pay tribute is the Monday Club at Hassocks where those newly retired people who do not quite know what has hit them, before they come to the stage of not knowing how they found the time to go to work, are enjoying themselves going out together on a Monday to clear scrub, mend stiles or put down planks on muddy spots. I hope that other amateur groups may be encouraged to take part in such activities.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para87"></a>One is concerned that the reduction in funding by the Countryside Commission, particularly when it is tied to future projects, may lead to cuts in that and other essential core activities of the board. I am concerned too that uncertainties about the immediate and long-term future may lead to the loss of key members of the dedicated team of officers and staff that the board has built up over the years. I, like others, therefore very much welcome the statement made in another place by the Under-Secretary of State <P>


<a name="column_1423"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>for the Environment, that the Government intend to initiate a consultation process on the best way forward for managing the Downs in the medium and longer term. I have no preconceived ideas as to what is the best way forward in organisational terms. But we are all looking forward to the noble Baroness's reply to the Question this evening. I hope that it will help to reduce the unease which is felt widely by informing your Lordships of the timing and procedure of the promised consultation.

<P>
<A NAME="70722-21_spnew16"></A><B> Viscount Gage: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Viscount, Lord Mersey, for the debate. I agree with those noble Lords and, in another place, with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, all of whom have praised the excellent work of the South Downs Conservation Board over the past six years.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para88"></a>Like other noble Lords, I declare two interests. The first is contemporary. Like the noble Lord, Lord Rea, I am a member of the A.27 Action Group. I agree with everything that he said. I have an historical interest. Although I cannot compete with the noble Viscount, Lord Hampden, my family has farmed in East Sussex for over 500 years on the chalk farmland for which the area covered by the board is so well known. I have first-hand knowledge of the enjoyment that many residents and thousands of visitors gain from walking the South Downs Way as well as the complex network of maintained foot paths and bridlepaths in this unique countryside. The degree of respect shown by these people to the landscape, which is unspoilt and yet sufficiently close to London and other large towns to be accessible, has been achieved without the imposition of notices or signs in a low-key manner which enhances the enjoyment of visitor and resident alike. That is very much to the credit of the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para89"></a>The Downs are, and have been, under threat from a combination of over-exploitation for leisure pursuits, urban development and inappropriate farming practices. In my opinion, in recent years, these dangers have been kept under a reasonable and viable level of control by the board.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para90"></a>On the subject of planning, I have recently had first hand experience of the vigilance of the board in its policy of monitoring planning applications and the efficacy of its powers of veto. I can only assume that others are subject to the same rigorous and thorough screening process. My late father, once the father of this House, did a great deal singlehandedly to restrict building development on the Downs between the wars. I am sure that he would be delighted with this continued expression of his philosophy.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para91"></a>The Government have instituted a consultation process on the best way forward for managing the Downs in both the medium and longer term, and that consultation will begin later in the year. One of the options put forward is that the area should be made into a national park.

<A NAME = "70722-21_para92"></a>In 1949 when the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act was passed, the South Downs were excluded. The need for increased domestic food production and improved agricultural methods was imperative. It was discovered that the Downlands were both fertile and productive and accordingly over 50 per cent. of the area was put under the plough. As the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, said, unlike many national parks the South Downs does not contain "wilderness" but is a gently farmed landscape which has been maintained with care by generations of farmers and landowners. Although the agricultural landscape of the South Downs is changing and greater emphasis is being put on pasture rather than arable, partly as a result of pressure from the EU, agricultural farming remains very much a vital and successful element in the local economy of the area. The board has been responsible for pursuing a policy which balances the need for conservation and sensitive agricultural use and has gained the confidence of farmers and landowners as well as visitors who come to enjoy the beauty of the landscape.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para93"></a>The board has an exemplary record in managing the area and it is in that context that I can make the point that it is metaphorically a Rolls Royce in terms of its administrative success. It needs funding, not fixing. The administration of a new national park would be more expensive than funding the existing board and would rely on already overstretched central government resources. The input of the 11 regional authorities concerned would be removed and the danger of over-exploitation for tourism rather than the needs of the local community would arise. It could invite the danger of bureaucratic managers unfamiliar with the region who might introduce a surfeit of unnecessary signs and huts which would detract from the timeless beauty of our South Downs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para94"></a>The South Downs Conservation Board has been universally supported and its policies have proved efficacious at both a national and local level. The time has come to provide the board with secure long-term funding from national sources to enable it to continue its excellent work in maintaining the unique identity of the South Downs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para95"></a>When the Government undertake their new consultation process I am hopeful that the conclusion will be that it is desirable to maintain and support the existing board and possibly also to enlarge its field of influence to include the Hampshire Downs under its jurisdiction.

<A NAME="70722-21_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Holme of Cheltenham: </B>   My Lords this has been a most interesting debate and we are all grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Mersey, for initiating it. It has been particularly interesting to hear from the once and future chairman of the Sussex Downs Conservation Board. I am particularly happy to hear from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, speaking on behalf of that splendid body the Sussex Downsmen.

<A NAME = "70722-21_para96"></a>Like so many noble Lords, I must declare an interest. I live about 10 miles from the Downs in West Sussex. I walk there and draw refreshment from the Downs. It is a landscape of great integrity which has been preserved over the years with some difficulty. It has, of course, changed. Your Lordships will recall the famous Belloc poem:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The great hills of the south country
 They stand along the sea
 And it is there walking in the high woods
 That I would wish to be". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para97"></a>There are precious few high woods now. We all think of those wonderful beached whales, the Downs, with not many woods on top. So it is not a static landscape. It has changed and bears the influence of humanity on it and, as has been said, in many ways that has been to its benefit over the centuries.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para98"></a>The Downs are small in scale. When we talk about them, often foreigners are not ready to register how tiny they are. However, they appear large in the imagination. My wife, who is listening to the debate, grew up in the Downs near Goodwood. Such is the grip of that landscape on her imagination that she is notorious to her family for looking at mountains and landscapes ranging from the Dolomites to the Blue Mountains near Sydney and saying, "Just like the Downs!". They have such a grip on our imagination, which is why the debate is important.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para99"></a>As regards money, which has rightly preoccupied us tonight, we must recognise that there will be great pressure on the budgets of local authorities. The motivation exists and I am one of those who hope that East Hampshire will come within the remit of an expanded board. All the authorities, whether in Sussex or Hampshire, will continue to feel pressure. Understandably, the Countryside Commission feels great pressure as a result of the large share of its resources which the board has occupied.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para100"></a>The Question being asked is proper, but I am with those in the debate who have asked whether it is essential to go down the national park route. To put the question crudely to the Minister: could not the board have the money without the structure and status? That is not altogether a facetious point. It has been notable in the debate that most noble Lords who are associated with national organisations have seen a national solution. However, one of the great strengths of the board is that it came from the grassroots upwards; that it belongs to the locality, to Sussex, in a real way.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para101"></a>I hope that in looking at solutions in the process of the consultation, which has been properly offered, we can be flexible and recognise, first, that this is a special place. Secondly, we must build on the success of the conservation board rather than demolishing it and starting again. Thirdly, we must build on local support, which is the key to the board, and we must remember the principle that "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Finally, can we not find a bespoke solution rather than one that is off the peg?

<P>
<A NAME="70722-21_spnew18"></A><B> The Earl of Lindsay: </B>   My Lords, in welcoming the interesting debate raised by my noble friend Lord Mersey, I must stress that as a good Scot I do not have an interest to declare. Unlike many noble Lords who have taken part in the debate, I do not live in the area. I do not have the correct territorial tag, unlike my noble friend Lord Renton of Mount Harry. I have not run bare chested along the Sussex Downs, unlike my noble friend Lord Teviot. For a moment I thought that I had a friend in the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, until he admitted that although he has not lived there he has written a book about the Sussex Downs. Perhaps I am unique in the debate but the Minister may trump me.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para102"></a>I pay tribute to what has been achieved by the Sussex Downs Conservation Board under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Nathan. He was a famous chairman in this House and his reputation as chairman of the conservation board has reached my ears in far off places.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para103"></a>I give a guarded welcome to the Government's announcement that roll-over financing will continue. However, I echo the concerns expressed by my noble friend Lord Renton of Mount Harry, the noble Lord, Lord Nathan, and others. If the board is such a success story, which the Government admit, why are they cutting the funding and therefore jeopardising that success?
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para104"></a>The board has been a great success. It has achieved its objectives; it has delivered countryside management; and it has had a considerable influence on town and country planning in an acceptable way. Furthermore, it has had an ability to work with local communities and local interests, deploying persuasion, building partnership and co-operation. As was said by the noble Viscount, Lord Hampden, it has produced a style of conservation that understands local problems. It has worked with the grain--a good expression used by my noble friend Lord Renton of Mount Harry.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para105"></a>The mechanism has been established voluntarily. The board has not sought statutory planning powers, but it has delivered on a modest budget. I hope that the Government will be prepared to retain it and to maintain it properly. Furthermore, I hope that they will be prepared to seek such solutions in other areas. As was said compellingly by the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, this is a tailor-made solution that has been built from the grassroots up. It has been built on the circumstances and the agenda that have been recognised in the area. It has been built on partnership and not on prescription. Therefore, I, too, would welcome the Minister's assurance that such a solution should be the first priority in sorting out countryside management. We should not resort to more Draconian prescriptions unless the voluntary, tailor-made, grassroots approach has obviously failed.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para106"></a>The success with which the board has delivered its agenda as regards value for money is outstanding. It is vital that the lessons learnt are adopted by other bodies. Nevertheless visitor management can account for a considerable portion of resources. Building <P>


<a name="column_1427"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1427</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>co-operation and consensus and seeking agreement can also generate costs. Those are less in the long run than in the case of a prescriptive solution, but nevertheless it takes time and it requires input to gather people together and to establish common solutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para107"></a>We all know that resources are not unlimited; they are tightly constrained. I have some sympathy with the Minister and with the Government in that respect in that financing solutions to the problems of the countryside is not an easy matter. The problems and challenges will inevitably increase. As the years go by, there will be a greater need for countryside management, not less. There will be greater costs which will have to be met, not fewer. There will be more people, more houses and more areas which can be described--as did my noble friend Lord Mersey in relation to the Downs--as rural sanctuaries between urban surrounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para108"></a>I hope that the Government will consider not only the problems and solutions relating to the South Downs, but also will consider strategically the kind of funding mechanisms that may be needed in the next five to 10 years. As regards funding countryside solutions, the public sector is probably being squeezed to the hilt in terms of what the taxpayer and central government and local taxpayers and local authorities can fund. My noble friend Lady O'Cathain, referred to that famous label, "income from other sources" which is always mentioned with great optimism and hope. However, that income has been well exploited and is exhausted. Private sector companies are becoming more involved in the countryside. In Scotland, for instance, a major television company has just become involved in rambling and rights of way. Non-government resources are stretched but they will also seek to deliver as much as they can in this respect. There are one-off sources of funding such as the lottery and some European sources of funds.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para109"></a>I hope that the Government recognise that the issues that arise in connection with the South Downs will have to be addressed in many other areas of the United Kingdom. The one statistic which I think should provoke some lateral and strategic thinking in government is the fact that the South Downs attracts 32 million visits per annum. That is a source of potential revenue. I hope that government strategists will explore such avenues. I welcome this debate and the discussion of issues that it has stimulated. We look forward to receiving the assurances from the Government that various speakers have sought.

<a name="column_1428"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1428</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Board. It was refreshing to leave for a short time the issues taxing the people living in Scotland and Wales and become English, as it were.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para110"></a>I want to assure the House that the Government have every intention of continuing to provide an appropriate level of financial support for the Sussex Downs Conservation Board from the public purse until we are in a position to establish a permanent solution for the sympathetic management of the South Downs.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para111"></a>As many of your Lordships have said, for the past five years the Sussex Downs Conservation Board has dealt with the problems of what is a special case among areas of outstanding natural beauty. In the early 1990s the Countryside Commission and the local authorities in East and West Sussex got together to form the new experimental body with which so many of your Lordships have been personally involved. They were prompted by extreme pressures which, in the case of the Downs, are greater than the pressures experienced in most of our national parks.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para112"></a>The Countryside Commission wanted to see whether a large area of outstanding natural beauty under severe pressure could be satisfactorily managed by a local authority joint committee. Accordingly, on an experimental basis, the Countryside Commission entered into an agreement with the local authorities to set up and fund the Sussex Downs Conservation Board on a 50:50 basis for a six year period. As your Lordships are aware, that period ends on 31st March 1998 and of course that has prompted a great deal of interest and concern about what should follow.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para113"></a>In paying tribute to the achievements of the board perhaps I may echo the words of the noble Viscount, Lord Gage, and the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, who paid tribute to the work of the noble Lord, Lord Nathan.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para114"></a>There is almost universal agreement that the Sussex Downs Conservation Board has achieved a great deal during the experimental period, and has undoubtedly established a sound base for future and further work. Among its important achievements have been the establishment and development of an integrated management service and volunteer ranger service. It has also produced a management strategy for the area and a landscape report which has been adopted as supplementary planning guidance. Although the local authorities have not delegated their planning powers to the conservation board, the board has made good use of its right to comment on planning applications and I believe has had some success in influencing development plan policies and development control decisions. Certainly, an independent report commissioned by the Countryside Commission, which was delivered last year, concluded that the conservation board had brought about real improvements to the planning and management of the area. The importance of the local commitment and the sense of identity in the area have been echoed by many speakers in your Lordships' House today.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para115"></a>Before addressing the question of what happens after 31st March 1998, it is important to deal with <P>


<a name="column_1429"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1429</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the key role of the Countryside Commission. It is important to bear in mind that the Countryside Commission habitually operates as an innovative body. It supports many experimental projects for a limited period in order for them to become self sustaining. It does not and cannot afford to allocate large amounts of its grant in aid for indefinite core funding of particular bodies. In the current year, 1997-98, the commission is spending &#163;640,000 on the Sussex Downs which works out at about 35 per cent. of the total amount that the commission has to spend on all 37 areas of outstanding natural beauty in the country. The commission has taken the view that there are a number of other areas which are under pressures not dissimilar to the Sussex Downs. It recognises the importance of providing a reasonable level of assistance to as many of those areas as possible. From the beginning there has been a recognition by all concerned that it was a six year period.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para116"></a>Despite that, and although sufficient steps to secure the future of the conservation board after March 1998 have not been made over the past five years, neither the Government nor the Countryside Commission has been prepared to leave the good work of the board threatened. That is why we have agreed with the Countryside Commission a further tranche of funding for the conservation board of more than &#163;1 million. Members of this House with a particular interest in the Sussex Downs will no doubt have been aware of the joint announcement by the Countryside Commission and the conservation board on 1st July. The commission will provide &#163;1,050,000 for the board over the period to 2000-2001 to fund specific projects which the conservation board is to agree with the commission as part of an overall work programme. The commission will keep Ministers informed about the development of the work programme and the continued progress of the conservation board. We are determined that the future programme will be a success.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para117"></a>The issue of local authority funding is extremely important. It was raised by several speakers. The local authorities in the areas have made clear that they are keen to see an agreement with the conservation board and are committed to seeking agreement on that. After all, the two counties were keen to set up the board in the first place. Without an exceptional commitment from the local authorities, the position that we are in today would not be so strong.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para118"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, and the noble Lord, Lord Renton of Mount Harry, raised the question of Countryside Commission funding. I know that there has been some criticism in the press. It is undeniably true that the figure I mentioned--&#163;1,050,000--divided by three, leaves a smaller figure per annum than the figure in excess of &#163;600,000 which the commission has provided during the experimental period. There are two specific points to be made in response to that.
<P>


<a name="column_1430"></a>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1430</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para119"></a>First, as I explained, the commission is contributing additional funding to the board by extending its support beyond the period originally agreed. That therefore hardly represents a cutback.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para120"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Nathan, asked whether there were yearly limits in relation to that funding. No, there are not, my Lords. It will be drawn on as it is needed to make progress on the work programme. We very much hope that the long-term arrangements that we shall develop will be in place by the third year.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para121"></a>In terms of reaching the stage of putting in place the results of the consultation, it is difficult to say anything about an outcome which would meet with the universal approval of the Members of this House who have taken part in tonight's debate. The Government are committed to instituting a consultation process on the best way forward in the medium and longer term. That consultation will begin later in the year. There is likely to be a special conference, in Sussex or East Hampshire as part of that process.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para122"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, and the noble Viscount, Lord Addison, raised the timetable for the consultation. The precise timetable and terms of reference are still subject to discussion by the department and the Countryside Commission. The mechanics of the consultation will be handled by the Countryside Commission, which is the Government's statutory adviser on these matters. The commission will liaise very closely with the department both in drawing up the consultation package and in the analysis of the response.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para123"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Mersey, who gave us the opportunity tonight to discuss these matters, and the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, raised the issue of future membership. That is a matter for consideration during the consultation period. I have no doubt that a wide range of views will be put on what the future membership of a successor or continuing body ought to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para124"></a>It is extremely important, in response to detailed questions about the sorts of issues that will be raised and what the givens will be at the start of the consultation, to recognise and respect both the needs of the locals within the terms of reference and the cost on the public purse of any possible timetable. The Countryside Commission is expecting to report in the spring of 1998. That is our understanding at this stage, but, note the word "expecting", that is not definitive.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para125"></a>Among the important issues raised is the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Gladwyn, who asked about clarifying the geographical coverage. It is clear that the South Downs extend into Hampshire as well as East Sussex. The Hampshire area of outstanding natural beauty is an important part of the framework of the area to be considered. We are keen to see a solution that will bring the management of the whole of the South Downs together.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para126"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Renton, raised the issue of flax. In light of the time and the detail of the debate, perhaps I may write to him in greater detail. Officials at the DETR have been working closely with MAFF <P>

<B>22 Jul 1997 : Column 1431</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and English Nature, in order to examine urgently a range of options, including the benefits and disadvantages of both voluntary and statutory approaches.
<P>

<A NAME = "70722-21_para127"></a>In conclusion, I thank all those who have taken part, particularly the noble Viscount, Lord Mersey, for giving us this opportunity. My noble friend referred to the accelerated roads review; the outcome of that process or at least the 12 urgent programmes will be known before the House rises.

<A NAME = "70722-21_para128"></a>The Government are committed to ensuring that the next phase of the project is successful, as the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, said, both for those who live locally and those of us who need the resource to be protected nationally. We need to ensure that the noble Lord, Lord Teviot, is able to walk without disturbing my noble friend Lord Rea, and that processes for the future protect this vital part of our natural heritage.

These were disposing of the interest, allocating ministerial responsibilities to avoid any conflict, or, where ministers held an investment portfolio consisting of a variety of different shares, placing them in a blind trust.

<FONT SIZE=3>properly informed about all food safety matters. My honourable friend the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has therefore decided to make some important changes to improve the reporting of results from our regular food chemical surveys. He plans to increase the amount of information available about surveys and ensure wider publication of the results. For all relevant surveys, the full results for individual samples, including brand names, will be given. Furthermore, he will open up the food chemical surveillance programme to greater public scrutiny by publishing information on surveys to be undertaken.

<A NAME = "70722w01_para7"></a>My honourable friend the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food endorsed fully the view that we must release the results fairly and provide the public with the best possible advice on their significance. These changes will benefit consumers by enabling them to make a more informed choice about the food that they buy.

We have written today to the Local Government Associations and others with an interest to advise them that paragraph 31 of the circular has been replaced with the following:

Information may be recorded in the definitive statement which, in practice, restricts the use of the way by those whose rights to use it are recorded on the definitive map. Where such information is not about position or width, or is not recorded as a limitation or condition, highway authorities should examine the evidence in each case in order to resolve the inconsistencies."

<A NAME="70722w01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   We have been looking at the implications of a recent High Court judgment for the evidence that is required to prove that vehicular rights of way have been established through regular use. We have concluded that vehicular rights cannot be claimed through 20 years' use (under Section 31 of the Highways Act 1980) if access to the route in question was prohibited by the Road Traffic Acts during any of those 20 years. The fact that people have driven along a footpath or bridleway does not mean it has ceased to be a footpath or bridleway. Vehicle users will not be able to claim new rights of way on the basis of past use unless the landowner has dedicated a way for their use.

<A NAME = "70722w01_para10"></a>The purpose and application of the advisory cost limit remain unchanged. It is intended to act as a threshold for disproportionate cost Parliamentary Questions (PQs). Any written PQ where the marginal cost of preparing the Answer is considered likely to exceed the threshold may be refused in whole or in part on the grounds of disproportionate cost. Alternatively the Minister may decide that the PQ is to be answered irrespective of cost. There is no advisory limit for oral PQs. The advisory limit continues to be based on eight times the average marginal cost for written PQs, which is now &#163;62, rounded to the nearest &#163;50 for convenience of application.

The Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (THORP) is expected to reprocess 14,000 tonnes of spent fuel in its first 20 years of operations and in the order of 100 tonnes of plutonium will be recovered during this time. The exact quantity of plutonium will be dependent on the type of fuel and the level of irradiation in the reactor the fuel originates from.
