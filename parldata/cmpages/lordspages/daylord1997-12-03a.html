<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "71203-01_para0"></a>What is the annual subvention from the Treasury per capita of population in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and what would be the cost to the Treasury of bringing the per capita payment in England level with that in Scotland.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="71203-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, grant in aid is annually voted by Parliament to the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund in respect of the difference between payments from the fund and its income from rates, other receipts and its attributed share of United Kingdom taxes. That subvention is estimated at &#163;2 billion in 1997-98. No similar arrangement exists for other parts of the United Kingdom. Therefore, I am not able to give my noble friend the answer that he requires in respect of those other areas.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend at the Dispatch Box aware that, if one talks in simple financial terms, per capita of population &#163;871 is paid for each person in Scotland in excess of that paid in England and that if we were to bring the 49 million people in the English regions up to that level, it would cost over &#163;340 billion? Is my noble friend also aware that this week local authorities are being told the amount of grant they will receive? Is he further aware that, if Manchester, where I was eventually the leader of the council, was paid according to the Scottish formula, it would be drawing &#163;348 million a year more than it is at present and that, if Leeds, where I was a Member of Parliament, was similarly treated, it would be drawing &#163;450 million extra? Will there be equality during the devolution proceedings?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the figures my noble friend gives are exactly the reason why we do not do that. I gave my noble friend the figures in respect of the subvention. The figures that he quotes relate to the general government grant to different parts of the United Kingdom rather than to the subvention, which is the difference between the grant and what is received by those different parts of the country. The impossibility of making such a calculation becomes more apparent when one considers smaller areas such as Leeds and Manchester.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that before the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, <P>


<a name="column_1362"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1362</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rationalised the differentials which were favourable to Scotland they had already existed for many years, based on what was called the Goschen formula, but that the public in Scotland were mostly unaware of that bonus, no doubt due to the complexity of the subject, as illustrated by the Deputy Prime Minister in his Statement yesterday?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I was afraid that someone would tempt my noble friend Lord Barnett to intervene. I see that he intends to. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, is right in saying that the Barnett formula was preceded by the Goschen formula in the 1880s. If I may say so, the Barnett formula is widely misunderstood. It refers only to changes in expenditure and is calculated strictly on a population basis rather than a needs basis.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, naturally I am flattered that the Barnett formula has lasted 20 years under a whole series of Chancellors, including the noble Lord, Lord Lawson. However, is it not a fact that the figures clearly indicate that expenditure per head in Scotland and in parts of England--not Wales, which is still suffering badly--is still so far out of line that there is a case for a Barnett formula Mark 2? Did my noble friend notice what the Prime Minister said recently--that, in the public expenditure review, nothing has been ruled in and nothing has been ruled out? Does that include the Barnett formula?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I read very carefully my noble friend's evidence to the Select Committee on the Treasury in another place on 13th November. I notice that my noble friend refers to a "Barnett formula Mark 2" rather than to a new formula because he has become very attached to his name over the years. Of course, there is no commitment for all time to any particular formula. The advantage of the Barnett formula over the years has not been that it is based on strict rationality but that it avoids argument each year when the allocation of resources is determined.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackie of Benshie: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord find extraordinary the amount of jealousy that devolution in Scotland engenders among noble Lords from other areas? It is a fact that the calculation has been made on the basis of need in those vast areas and on the lack of enterprise in Scotland compared with the spending in England. It would be interesting to hear from the noble Lord how much the Government spend in the London area as compared with Scotland. Does the noble Lord agree that, when we have a new formula (whether Barnett, Goschen or a mixture of the two), after five years there will be no question but that Scotland will have increased its prosperity to such an extent that there will be no need for any formula at all?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have much more sympathy than the noble Lord, Lord Mackie, for those in the English regions mentioned by my noble friend Lord Dean of Beswick who feel that they have had a hard deal over the years. I must correct the noble <P>


<a name="column_1363"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1363</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord. The Barnett formula does not represent need but is based on changes in expenditure and population. It has subsequently been justified on the basis of need by sparsity of population and so on, but that is really an argument ad hominem.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the noble Lord can confirm the following answer given to me on 11th June 1997 by his noble friend Lord Haskel:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no intention to make any alteration to the Barnett formula until the review has been completed".--[Official Report, 11/6/97; col. 930.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-01_para1"></a>Can the Minister further confirm that the review will not be about the Barnett formula and increases in expenditure by UK departments but about the base line? Can the Minister assure the House that in considering the Scottish base line proper account will be taken of Scottish need?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is quite right in saying that the comprehensive spending review is about the base line. It is concerned with zero budgeting and achieves its strength exactly from that. However, as the noble Lord rightly says, the Barnett formula is based on changes, not increases, in public spending. The reason why my noble friend gave the answer he did in June was that, as the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, well knows, the Scottish and Welsh White Papers both make clear that for the purposes of devolution the Barnett formula is to be retained.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Cledwyn of Penrhos: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for drawing the attention of the House to the fact that Wales is suffering badly. What is my noble friend doing to put that right?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am not certain that either noble Lord is right. I do not believe that Wales suffers badly in terms of expenditure per head. I have no basis on which to calculate the subvention; that is, the difference between expenditure and receipts.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Peyton of Yeovil: </B>   My Lords, if the Minister can shed the inhibition contained in his original Answer and let his mind range over the available evidence, can he resist the conclusion that the present situation is highly prejudicial to the north of England?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not believe that I am in a position to speculate when I do not have the figures to do so.

<A NAME = "71203-01_para2"></a>Whether all children under five years old who are in primary school reception classes enjoy a teacher/pupil ratio and other adult care appropriate to their age and needs.

The Government are committed to providing a good quality free nursery place for every four year-old child, with early years development plans and partnerships ensuring that this has been achieved by September 1998. We shall also be consulting early in the new year on establishing a more uniform regulatory and inspection regime for early years settings, including reception classes.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her reply. Does the noble Baroness agree that children's first experience of school is an important factor in their subsequent progress and success in school? In reviewing the situation, and in the new arrangements to be introduced in March, will the Government consider the introduction of regulations to ensure that all local authorities are obliged to comply with the staff/pupil ratios which are already applied by law to the private and voluntary sectors?<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo971203/text/71203-02.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I very much agree with the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, about the importance of children's first experience of school. If that is an unfortunate or negative experience it can be very damaging in the long term. It is very important that when young children start school they are in an environment which is supportive and meets their needs. I assure the noble Lord that the Government are firmly committed to raising standards in all types of early year settings. The Government will undertake consultation early next year on the establishment of a new uniform regulatory and inspection regime for all early years settings that offer nursery education and day care services.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I should like to repeat part of the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, which was not dealt with in the reply of the noble Baroness. Is it the intention of the Government to level up to the more generous teacher/pupil ratio that is required of private nursery schools or to level down to that required in state provision, or neither? Can the noble Baroness inform the House whether the Government have any intention of controlling the fees charged by private nursery schools as a condition of entering into planned nursery provision in local authority areas?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the Government are looking at the whole issue of pupil/teacher ratios. <P>


<a name="column_1365"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1365</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>As the noble Baroness will be aware, our decision to abolish the assisted places scheme so as to provide more teachers and smaller class sizes for five, six and seven year-olds will affect reception classes--that relates to the Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne--so that all children in reception classes will benefit from class sizes smaller than those that existed under the previous government. On the noble Baroness's second question about fees charged, we have asked all local authorities to carry out early years development plans in conjunction with the voluntary and private sector. We shall be asking them to look at the whole issue of the fees being charged.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that most of us are happy with her Answer, but that we would like to know how soon that will happen? What is the pupil/teacher ratio in local authority reception classes at the moment? How soon will it come down to a level which most of us, I am sure, would like to see?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I think that your Lordships will agree that the Government have got on immediately with trying to reduce class sizes for primary schools and infant schools with children aged five, six and seven. That will happen as soon as possible. We made a manifesto commitment, and we will meet it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew5"></A><B> The Viscount of Falkland: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister acknowledge the contribution made by playschools in recent years in filling the gap where nursery provision is not available? Is she aware that the reception classes have taken away valuable resources from playgroups, which is causing them to close in their hundreds? What future plans does her party have for playgroups?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, we greatly value the work of playgroups. We deeply regret the fact that, as a result of the divisive voucher scheme introduced by the previous government, some 800 playgroups have had to close. In the new programme for the expansion of provision for all four year-olds we have asked local education authorities to work with the playgroup movement. I do not believe that reception classes have taken resources away from playgroups. What is needed is sensible, planned collaboration between the voluntary and the maintained sectors. That indeed is what we intend.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, are local authorities entitled to refuse children with learning disabilities, either in this age group or among the five and six year-olds to whom she referred, just because they say that they are unable to provide the special care required?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the Government are committed to supporting children with special needs, whatever their age. Under the previous government, some local authorities were unable to provide places for children under five who had special needs, but the new Government's proposals will ensure that all four year-olds, whatever their needs, will have a place in a maintained, voluntary or private school of some kind.

<UL>
<A NAME = "71203-02_para0"></a>Whether a project director for the Millennium Experience at Greenwich has been appointed with the sole responsibility to ensure that the Millennium Dome and related structures are completed to the agreed specification, timescale and estimated cost.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="71203-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the New Millennium Experience Company appointed Mr. David Trench as Director of Sites and Structures in May 1997. Reporting to the chief executive, he is responsible for all sites and structures contracts and for ensuring that they are completed to time and budget. In addition, Sir Alan Cockshaw, former chairman of AMEC, was appointed to the board of the New Millennium Experience Company in June. He is taking an interest in all construction matters.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew11"></A><B> Viscount Caldecote: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that encouraging reply. Does the project director whom he mentioned have full authority, without reference to committees or anything like that, to take all decisions necessary to complete this great project to time and estimated cost?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the New Millennium Experience Company is a company and not a local authority. Mr. Trench reports directly to the chief executive. He has responsibility under her.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, why are Her Majesty's Government not publishing interim accounts? Who is Mr. Trench?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I shall answer the noble Baroness's second question first. Mr. Trench was appointed two years ago to--I suppose the phrase is--clean up the problems in the British Library. He has done so successfully and to the great satisfaction of Her Majesty's Government. As to the interim accounts, the New Millennium Experience Company was only formed on 12th March this year. Its audited accounts, which are what make sense, will become available only after its first full year, which will end on 31st March next year. However, the Minister without Portfolio, in his evidence to the Select Committee yesterday, undertook to ensure that management figures would be made available as soon as is practicable.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew15"></A><B> The Earl of Lauderdale: </B>   My Lords, is there any news yet about a Lambeth working party, which was mentioned a week or two ago, which is studying the idea that the Millennium Dome should have some Christian aspect, as the millennium is supposed to commemorate the founding of Christianity?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, do the Government consider that the Millennium Dome will be profitable or, in the end, a terrific cost to the nation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, the total cost of the Millennium Dome has been well publicised. The full budget, including inflation, is &#163;758 million. That will be met by a combination of contributions from the National Lottery, visitors, and, to a more modest extent, the taxpayers. That balance of income and expenditure has not changed.

<A NAME = "71203-02_para1"></a>Whether all moneys saved as a result of the abolition of maintenance grants to students in higher education and the moneys generated by charging fees for tuition will be dedicated to higher education.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="71203-02_spnew20"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced in another place on 23rd July that the Government would ensure that savings from the new funding arrangements would be used to improve quality, standards and opportunity for all in further and higher education. We have already taken decisive action to address the serious funding problems facing higher education. The funding package announced on 23rd September will allow an extra &#163;165 million to be spent on higher education in 1998-99. In addition some &#163;15 million of the higher education savings has been allocated to the further education sector to contribute to meeting the Government's priorities for reducing social exclusion and increasing employability.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. If money is to be saved exclusively at the expense of higher education students and their families, and spent elsewhere, even if it is in further education or elsewhere in the budget, then it is a tax on those students and those families.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-02_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the previous government left the further education sector severely underfunded. It was in an even worse situation than the higher education sector. The increase in funding of &#163;83 million for the further education sector, which includes a &#163;20 million increase in employer contributions to employer-led provision in further education, will provide for a resumption of growth in student numbers, geared particularly to widening participation on a financially sound basis.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, as a result of the fall in recruitment and the consequent financial difficulties for some universities, especially the new ones, would it not be fairer to allocate most of the available money to those which have been badly hit?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, there has not yet been a fall in recruitment in any of the universities. In fact, this autumn the universities took in more students than in the previous year. Applications are slightly down on last year, but the final date for applications through the UCAS system is 15th December. Therefore, it is a little too early to say whether numbers will be down.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para0"></a>Perhaps I may remind my noble friend that only about 75 per cent. of applications are usually received by 15th December; therefore we need to wait and see. Next year we shall be providing additional support for the new universities, as with the old universities, through the extra &#163;155 million announced in September by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister noticed that the number of applications expected by the universities is declining drastically, with the effect that hundreds of thousands of letters are being sent to local authorities and others to encourage more applications? If there is a fall in the number of students entering higher education in 1998 how will the universities make up the resulting drop in income?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, there has not been a drastic decline in applications. There has been a small decline; the latest figure indicates that it is around 7 per cent. However, there is still time before the closing date for applications. Large numbers of students required more information about the new scheme, which they have now received. When the scheme is fully understood, I believe that students will realise that it is fair and equitable and that it is in their interests to pursue a course in higher education if they have the potential to do so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Glenamara: </B>   My Lords, will the &#163;1,000 a year paid by a student for tuition be retained by the university which provides that tuition?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Beloff: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister inform the House of the distinction that she draws between higher and further education, as so many of her colleagues tend to use those expressions interchangeably?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, it would be wrong to use those expressions interchangeably. There is a clear difference between universities and the provision that they make available, and further education colleges. <P>


<a name="column_1369"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1369</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Universities provide degree-level courses at both undergraduate and postgraduate level. For the most part, colleges of further education provide sub-degree-level courses, including a vast range of vocational courses. However, there is a slight blurring at the edges in that some new universities provide HND and HNC courses, which are sub-degree-level courses. Similarly, some FE colleges provide degree-level courses. That is a long-standing situation which developed throughout the period of the previous government.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that, in response to the supplementary question from my noble friend Lady Blatch, she said that all moneys saved as a result of the abolition of maintenance grants would be devoted to higher education?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, no, I did not say that. I said that all the money which would be produced as a result of the changes in the support system for students would go to either higher education or further education.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, would not the most obvious and correct source of funds for the expansion of further education be the removal of the misuse of public funds involved in the excess subsidy to the Oxford and Cambridge colleges? Is not that the true source in terms of ability to find money for further education?

<A NAME="71203-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the additional premiums which the universities of Oxford and Cambridge receive through the college fee system is &#163;35 million. No decisions have been made by the Government as to whether that premium should continue. However, were there to be any changes, it would be right that any money should be redistributed to the university sector.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the financing of students in higher education might be considerably helped if more worked their way through college, as students do in the United States of America? Do the Government have any plans to facilitate such work?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, approximately one-third of all students in higher education are studying part-time. Nearly all of those have jobs during the day and study either on day release or in the evenings and at weekends. Therefore, a huge number of students in the British higher education system are already working their way through university.

Does she believe that the public services, as employers, can compete with that?

<FONT SIZE=3>wish to buy off the debt. As regards the public services, the Government are putting in place a system which will allow medical students who are employed by the public sector to undertake the longer courses which are necessary in order to obtain their medical degrees, with a bursary scheme in the fifth and sixth years of study. Similarly, the Government are putting in place a system whereby PGCE students who are training to be teachers will receive their PGCE course with an exemption from the payment of tuition fees and bursaries.

<A NAME="71203-03_spnew16"></A><B> The Viscount of Oxfuird: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the pamphlet is not what the 17 to 18 year-old student is expecting, and that the details which he or she does not know are important? The student does not know the level of parental income which absolves the tuition fee; the income level at which repayments start; the period of repayment, the level of difficulty; how he will qualify for a &#163;250 loan; or how he will repay it. The leaflet does not answer those important questions. What is the situation?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, under the existing scheme students are already subject to means testing in terms of their maintenance awards. Their parents must complete a long and complicated form in order to gain access to a maintenance grant or a loan. Therefore, in respect of the information which parents must provide, there is no difference between the old and the new scheme. It may be true that potential students do not know their parents' incomes, but their parents must continue to do exactly what they are doing at present. We have provided potential students with an enormous amount of information. We have also provided that information to those who advise them in the careers service and in schools and colleges. The trigger point for the repayment of loans is clear. All the information is included in the leaflet which students have received.

<A NAME = "71203-03_para6"></a>gives your Lordships an opportunity to discuss economic prospects and issues seven months into a radically reforming new government. There are many distinguished contributors to today's debate. In particular, I look forward to hearing the five maiden speeches that are to be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para7"></a>The terms of the Motion are deliberately drawn widely. We can range over world developments and their impact on the British economy; on the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy by the new Government; on our productivity performance, compared with our competitors; on public expenditure and taxation issues; and, indeed, on the welfare to work programme of the new Government. Moreover, there are the issues of innovation, research and development and new product development which matter so much for the long-term prospects of the country. As I said, the debate is widely drawn. I am sure that noble Lords, with their unlimited ingenuity, will demonstrate that all sorts of other issues can comfortably nestle under the welcoming branches of the Motion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para8"></a>I wish to address four particular issues: first, the legacy that this Government received from the previous government; secondly, the question of the Government's strategy and, in particular, the question of whether the charge that my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has been over-prudent in his fiscal management has validity; thirdly, the risks posed to our economic prosperity by the tumultuous developments in Asian markets; and finally, the issue of EMU and our entry into it.
<P>


<a name="column_1372"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1372</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para9"></a>We hear a lot these days about how the Labour Government have been blessed by receiving from the previous government an excellent legacy. I have to say that there is some truth in that. Since 1992, the British economy has grown steadily with low inflation. On the whole, macro economic policy has been well conducted. In saying that, I have to declare an interest in that I was an independent adviser--and I stress the word "independent"--to the former Chancellor of the Exchequer as a member of the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para10"></a>With that background, I can say that the legacy is not as good as all that. The previous year saw boom and bust. It is worth recalling that output peaked in the early part of 1990: it took four years for it first to fall and then climb back to that same level. Normally one would have expected it to march upwards. Those were four wasted years for the British economy which has proved to be the most unstable of any of the G7 countries over the past 20 years. Unemployment soared over that period--that is, from 1990. As a result the employment prospects of successive cohorts of school-leavers were blighted, and not just for a year or two. The evidence is that the consequence will flow on through their record of employment and that they will have less good jobs as a result of that initial starting point.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para11"></a>The effects of unemployment live on through successive generations. From the evidence of the national child development survey, we know that family poverty resulting from unemployment adversely affects the educational attainment of children and their subsequent employment record. If one takes the longer view, the British economy grew no faster over the past decade than the economies of France or the United States and was appreciably slower than that of Germany. The same is true if one goes back to 1979. That helps to explain, as the Government have noted in their recent statements, that our productivity performance lags well behind that of our competitors. There is a great deal of ground to make up.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para12"></a>Some commentators have suggested that the shift of tone with a change of government is a tribute to the impartiality of our civil servants. I rather think that it is an example of the over-hyped rhetoric we had before the election coming down to earth. We are doing well, but we need to do better. Some of our companies are among the best, but we have a long tail of unsatisfactorily performing companies. We need to improve our record of innovation, new product development and research and development in order to catch up with our competitors.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para13"></a>The legacy also involves an economy which has been growing rather too quickly in an unsustainable way--demand growing rather faster than is likely to be sustainable. That arises because of the previous government's reluctance to heed the Bank of England's advice that interest rates needed to rise before the election to head off over-rapid demand growth. That expansion was fuelled by consumer windfalls, admittedly small compared to the scale of the windfalls enjoyed in the late 1980s when house price increases added something like &#163;900 billion, nearly a trillion pounds, to personal sector wealth, leading to massive <P>


<a name="column_1373"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1373</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recession. The windfalls that we have had recently have been more modest. House price rises and windfalls from building society conversions have, nonetheless, been fuelling consumer spending too quickly. We see growing signs of skill shortages in the British economy comparable to the period at the end of 1987. Perhaps I may quote Alan Greenspan, talking about the US economy. He said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The law of supply and demand has not been repealed. If labour demand continues to outpace sustainable increases in supply, the question is surely when, not whether, labour costs will escalate more rapidly". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para14"></a>That dilemma is part of the legacy received from the previous government.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para15"></a>Against that background, I believe that my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is entirely right to be firm in his fiscal management and in his overall stance on policy. There has been iron in the policy, but I believe that to be appropriate. We must avoid a repetition of the boom-bust of the previous government. We cannot realistically abolish the cycle, but we do not have to encourage it. We can certainly hope to limit it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para16"></a>I believe it was entirely right to make the Bank of England independent. The Monetary Policy Committee, in turn, has been right to push up interest rates to check the rapid growth of domestic demand and the tight stance of fiscal policy is also to be welcomed at this point of the cycle. The recently announced code for fiscal stability again takes us forward by injecting much greater consistency, stability and openness in the conduct of fiscal policy. It will help us to avoid the mistakes of the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para17"></a>If we can keep the cycle under control--the booms and busts on the demand side--we need then to operate effectively in terms of supply-side policies. We need to help the disadvantaged in the labour market to get back into the world of work. We need to reform the welfare and tax system to prevent the creation of artificial barriers to re-entering work. Education and training become an absolute priority to give people the capacity to respond to opportunities. We need to encourage flexible product markets which will, in turn, encourage competition and the dynamism which create jobs and, indeed, innovation. In that respect the Competition Bill which your Lordships are considering at present is an important part of the picture. We also need tax reforms to promote investment and encourage longer-term growth. All of these are matters where the Government have action in hand. I believe that we will see results over time.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para18"></a>There are two points I wish to make. First, these supply side measures take a long time to work through. The fruits are not quick and we need to be patient. Secondly, the devil is often in the detail of policy in this area. I refer to problems of working out interactions of welfare systems and tax systems to make them helpful in allowing people to move back into work. This is a fundamentally difficult area to tackle. We shall have to see how easy it is to work out the full details.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para19"></a>I turn to the world scene. Until recently the forecasts for the world were relatively benign. Growth has primarily occurred in the US, the UK and the Asian <P>


<a name="column_1374"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1374</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Pacific. It was hoped that the baton of growth would be passed to continental Europe and Japan. Against that background the best prospect was for a slowdown of the British economy to a more sustainable growth rate. That is certainly the forecast produced by my colleagues at the London Business School who predict a slowdown of about 2 per cent., where inflationary pressures will not be triggered, and unemployment falling to about 1.4 million. That is still possible. However, the Asian developments may threaten the situation. I remind noble Lords that the Asian "flu" spread from the smaller ASEAN economies of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines to Korea, once described as the eleventh biggest economy in the world but now, following devaluation of its currency, much smaller, and now threatens Japan, the weak link in the industrial world. We can expect impacts on Brazil, Russia and eastern Europe. A number of the emerging markets will be much more turbulent and much less dynamic over the next year as a consequence. The key domino that may fall is China.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para20"></a>My colleagues are forecasting zero growth for Asia next year and the year after. That is a dramatic change in the world economy. Conventional forecasts suggest that all this means is a few decimal points off our growth rate, nothing dramatic, just a bit of a slowdown. However, I suspect that that is wrong as it fails to take account of the interconnections in a dynamic world. The cancellation of Samsung's investment in the north is an example of what will happen. We shall see more of that kind of thing. I expect to see inward portfolio investment cool, affecting our capital markets. I would not be surprised if the London housing market comes off the boil as money from overseas ceases to flow in. We may see a loss of confidence leading to a much more severe weakening of the economy, internationally and at home, than we might expect.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para21"></a>I hope that noble Lords will not misunderstand me. I am not a Jeremiah predicting that we are about to be engulfed in a major world recession. That is a remote possibility, not least because we have the powers to prevent it. But it is a call for policy vigilance. Last week Alan Greenspan was entirely correct in deciding not to raise US interest rates, which might have been justified on domestic grounds in the light of the Asian developments. The Monetary Policy Committee needs to follow that lead. We have given it the independence to exercise its judgment with wisdom and I suspect that that may be tested over the next few months. A further rise in interest rates would be unwise. We need to be ready to exercise prudence on fiscal policy to advantage. If the UK economy significantly weakens, it will be right to let the public deficit rise, to borrow more, to spend more or to tax less--not permanently but temporarily--to prevent the risk of an unnecessary slide into recession. There are times when it is prudent to spend. Our current fiscal rectitude, which I applaud, is an investment that should allow us to respond firmly and decisively to risks of emerging recession, should they arise. That is a point that has much wider international application. I refer to an issue that is worrying; namely, the shortage of hard currencies that the International Monetary Fund may face over the <P>


<a name="column_1375"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1375</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>coming year as a result of the bail-outs it has had to carry out. We need to address that issue if we want a well ordered international economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para22"></a>I turn to EMU, an issue that will have a great influence and--contrary, possibly, to the views of some Eurosceptics in your Lordships' House--a positive influence on British economic prospects. It is clear that EMU will proceed with a large first wave. Therefore, the Government's commitment to entry in principle and when the appropriate conditions are right is much to be welcomed. It is also right to rule out entry in this Parliament. The position of the British economy with its different cyclical configuration from our continental partners makes for difficulties. Our interest rates are higher and need to come down in time. Sterling, having appreciated 20 per cent. or so over the past year, needs to be at a lower level. To enter at this level of sterling would be a mistake. The personal sector needs to adjust its variable interest mortgage borrowing to a fixed form at the appropriate time if it is to avoid being hit unduly by interest rate changes imposed by a future European central bank.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para23"></a>However, I believe that we shall pay a high cost if we stand aside in the longer term. I refer to both economic and political costs. Over the past few days we have seen the possible political costs of not being in the first wave with our partners' understandable reluctance to give us a Euroclub seat on Euro-X's committee. We shall have to travel steerage for a while.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para24"></a>The evidence from large companies that are studying the euro points to the possible danger that the rationalisation they are going through may adversely affect us. I give an example. The big companies that operate across the European Community are aware that the euro touches every aspect of their operations. They have set up major taskforces to review them. If one reviews the whole of one's company's operations in the light of the euro, one may as well review the whole of one's company's operations altogether. This is an opportunity for rationalisation which many major international companies are taking. There is a danger that those countries which stand aside may find themselves rationalised somewhat out of the picture. There is a real danger that we may be marginalised. Although I do not see dangers arising from our not joining immediately, if we stay out long term there will be dangers for us. I am concerned therefore that leaving the decision to the next Parliament makes it harder for us to join in a timely way. A rushed decision after the next election is just about feasible. It is possible technically for that to happen. Government and business could make the appropriate arrangements for a parallel arrangement where sterling circulates alongside the euro--it is fixed irrevocably but circulates alongside. However, that would mean a two or three-year period of working with sterling and the euro in parallel. That dual working is difficult; it is costly to business and it could be avoided.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para25"></a>Such a step would give little time for mortgage holders to adjust the maturity of their mortgages. That is rather vital if the European central bank's decisions on interest rates are not to fall unduly on our personal <P>


<a name="column_1376"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1376</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sector. It is not sensible for mortgage holders to switch now because if they were to do so they would incur the inflation risk built into our long-term interest rates reflecting the risk that we may not join. If one joins quickly--a rapid decision after the next election--that implies a rapid adjustment that will be hard to accomplish. There is also a risk that we shall see re-emerging convergence plays in Forex around 1999 or 2000. Speculation on whether we shall or shall not be "in" would destabilise our interest rates, asset markets and exchange rates. That instability could make life difficult for us in going in. ERM as a condition of entry to EMU may well be waived if--and probably only if--sterling is relatively stable against continental European currencies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para26"></a>I worry that without a decision on EMU earlier than the next election we may be in some difficulty. For all those reasons I hope that the door on such an earlier decision is not altogether closed. Otherwise we may be a rather late entrant to EMU, and that would be damaging to our economic prospects.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para27"></a>In conclusion, the Government are right to argue that our economic prospects are good. With the current arrangements, the independent Bank, and the code on fiscal stability, we shall not see a repeat of the past excesses that proved so damaging to growth and jobs in the British economy. We cannot eliminate the economic cycle, but we can limit it. It will involve hard choices, in particular in public spending and elsewhere, to ensure that factors for long term growth are put and kept in-place. But with economic stability and more people brought into work, with more resources flowing in time into the key areas of education and training, and a confidence in our place in Europe, I believe that the long-term prospects for the British economy are very good indeed. I beg to move for Papers.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-03_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Currie of Marylebone, on the wide-ranging and judicious way in which he reviewed many of the basic aspects of our economic prospects. As he rightly said, this is a subject on which many issues can be dealt with. There are a number of distinguished Peers who will speak later, and many maiden speakers. No doubt noble Lords will choose their specific subject on which to speak.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para28"></a>I wish to concentrate on the pre-Budget report which we discussed briefly last week. As I stated, it is an innovative document which leads to more transparency in policy formulation. We have the opportunity to respond at greater length today to the challenges which the report raises.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para29"></a>The message of the pre-Budget Statement is that the Government, in carrying out their economic policy, wish above all to avoid the pitfalls of the past--the boom and bust situations which have been such a feature in Britain in recent decades. I was interested to read the document setting out the lessons from the previous economic cycle. I welcome it especially because in formulating forward policy we do not often spend time learning lessons from the past. The Statement is a good illustration of the benefits of so doing.
<P>


<a name="column_1377"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1377</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para30"></a>The economic growth forecasts in the document show that the economy is increasing currently at the rate of about 4 per cent. per annum, which is well above the historic average of 2.25 per cent. In 1998 it is expected to fall to the average of 2.25 per cent., with a further slowing down to between 1.5 per cent. and 2 per cent. in the year 1999 to 2000, and thereafter there could be some modest increase back to the historic average. In the government forecast which is more or less in line with other independent forecasts--for example, the forecast of the CBI--there will be a noticeable slowing down in the economy in the two to three years ahead. The real test will be how that is dealt with.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para31"></a>Where, according to the Government's analysis, things went wrong at the end of the 1980s, when we were at a comparable peak in the cycle, was that fiscal policy was unduly relaxed, thus precipitating a deterioration which led to the PSBR reaching a high point in 1993-94 at just over 7 per cent. of GDP or &#163;46 billion. The Government state that now that we are once more at the peak of an economic cycle, they are determined not to repeat such an error.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para32"></a>The two areas where the Government can most influence the economy are monetary and fiscal policy. Steps have already been taken to exert a strict control of monetary policy and the Bank of England has been given the task of carrying out the Government's objective of a maximum of 2.5 per cent. inflation. It is a policy which we from these Benches have long advocated. We are glad to see it has been brought about.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para33"></a>In the matter of fiscal policy, the Government have sought also to introduce a similar degree of stability. With the papers accompanying the pre-Budget document, they issued a document relating to what they call the code for fiscal stability. I welcome that, too, because it is another way in which we are able to discuss in advance the bases of government strategy. If monetary and fiscal stability can be achieved through the means agreed upon, we should be reasonably on the way to avoiding the overheating which occurred so regularly in the past.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para34"></a>Nevertheless, the Government's own growth figures suggest a major slowing down in the coming two to three years to which I referred earlier. Although this slow down will be by no means as sharp as on previous occasions, according to the current forecast, it nevertheless could cause economic and social problems particularly in the matter of employment, especially if the economy falls to the lower of the figures forecast by the Government. An important way of avoiding the disadvantage of slow growth in the next two or three years would be, I believe, to stimulate the level of investment in both the private and public sectors.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para35"></a>The chart on page 77 of the pre-Budget document demonstrates that the UK's overall investment performance has been poor by international standards, just as we have had the productivity lag to which the noble Lord, Lord Currie, referred. Investment in the UK has consistently been below the OECD average since at least 1960. In my opinion, it is urgent that we should now seek to catch up. I can think of no better time to try to do this than when the economy is about to begin <P>


<a name="column_1378"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1378</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>slowing down. The Government have already taken some steps to stimulate investment in the private sector by reducing corporation tax and by improving investment allowances for small firms. I believe that in the three years ahead there should be further incentives along these lines. There is also a need for investment in essential parts of the public sector. A start has been made by injecting more funds into education and health, but more is required not only in improving those services but also in providing the essential built infrastructure. That would have the benefit of maintaining activity in the construction industry in a period of possible slow down. The release of housing funds would also help in that regard. My noble friend Lord Razzall will speak on these aspects later.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para36"></a>I need hardly remind noble Lords that an area of public activity which urgently needs more investment is transport. It is particularly necessary on environmental grounds. The UK is rightly taking up a positive position at the Kyoto conference, but this must be followed up by urgent action. Such forms of transport as the London Underground require urgent additional funds. The injection of private funding is desirable, but the form in which it is to be done must be settled quickly. Investment in energy saving is also important. The Government are to be commended on reducing VAT for schemes helping the less well off to insulate their homes, as I mentioned last week. It satisfies an environmental need as well as meeting a social requirement. I am delighted that it could mean that 40,000 extra homes a year could be insulated under the home energy efficiency scheme as a result of the change.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para37"></a>We are entering an important new phase in the conduct of economic policies. The setting out well in advance of Budgets of the issues that have to be met and the clear statement of long-term policy objectives are to be commended, and I hope that they will be a regular feature from now on. But setting out the issues is one thing. Progressive and determined action is required to achieve the desirable objectives stated by the Government. In my opinion, that applies particularly in matters of investment and environmental improvement.

May I say that it is a particular pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, who, I recall, had such a distinguished record as chairman of the National Coal Board. Perhaps I may say, too, that since being here I have been treated with nothing but friendship, and from the staff I have received courtesy and help, particularly in finding my way around the corridors.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para38"></a>Of course, this is not my first maiden speech. That took place in the other place on 25th May 1966 on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill. I recall going up to the Speaker's Chair and saying: "Mr. Speaker, I wish to make my maiden speech today". The Speaker at that time was Dr. Horace King, who subsequently became Lord Maybray-King. He replied: "When Margaret Thatcher sits down, you are on. Good luck!" I hasten to add that at that time the noble Baroness was the number <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para39"></a>Numerous noble Lords have inquired about the origin of my title "Islwyn". It comes from the mountain Mynyddislwyn, in the county of Gwent, where I was born and where I still have strong local and family connections. I was influenced, too, by the fact that the Welsh poet/preacher of last century, the Reverend William Thomas, who lived close to my old home, took his bardic title, "Islwyn", from the same mountain. It was said of him that, "he loved Wales--her mountains, her religion, her hymns, her history". I can assure your Lordships that I share those sentiments.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para40"></a>The debate today, so admirably opened by the noble Lord, Lord Currie, is about Britain's economic prospects, following on from the pre-Budget report put forward a week ago in the other place by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That report shows that the Government aim to build long-term prosperity through measures to help people off welfare and into work; improve competition, innovation and investment; and ensure economic stability. The Chancellor is clearly trying to get rid of the dependency culture, and I fully support his objective. It is so much better for people to be in meaningful employment rather than waiting for the next social security cheque. People who get back into work gain a new dignity and self-respect. I appreciate that low wages prevail in many trades and industries today. That may be a disincentive to people seeking employment. But at least there is in preparation the minimum wage legislation, which will go some way towards eradicating that problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para41"></a>I commend, too, the help that is to be given to pensioners in relation to winter fuel bills: &#163;20 for all pensioner households, and &#163;50 for pensioner households on income support. Such measures can do nothing but good for old people, who for so long have been crying out for a better deal. Then there is the &#163;300 million programme for childcare over the next five years. I hope that the scheme will be successful.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para42"></a>I would urge the Chancellor to place increasing emphasis on the importance of the traditional family. So much can be done through taxation; yet over the years successive Chancellors have tended to move in the opposite direction. Traditional family life has been the bedrock of our society, and the move away from it in recent years has led to so much juvenile delinquency, with all the side-effects of drugs, homelessness and lack of educational attainment. I repeat that I strongly urge the Chancellor to look closely at the issue of the family; he is in a position where he can do a great deal to help.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para43"></a>The Chancellor's expressed objective is that:

I was rather surprised, therefore, to read about Sir George Russell, chairman of the Northern Development Corporation, complaining about preferential treatment for areas like Wales. He was referring to the so-called "Barnett" formula, which was mentioned at Question Time today. It is designed to spread wealth around the component parts of the United Kingdom via the public purse. At least, that is my understanding of the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para45"></a>Because the gross domestic product in Wales is only 83 per cent. of the United Kingdom average, in general terms, for every &#163;100 that the Government spend in England, they spend &#163;116 in Wales and &#163;125 in Scotland. The noble Lord, Lord Barnett, whose formula bears his name, recently went on record as saying that,

<A NAME = "71203-03_para46"></a>He confirmed that point of view this afternoon. I draw attention also to the remark at Question Time by my noble friend Lord Cledwyn, who called for action on the situation in Wales. I endorse that sentiment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para47"></a>I can assure Sir George Russell and his North-East colleagues that Wales is not some sort of Eldorado. It has numerous unemployment black spots and poor housing, together with a great deal of poverty. Anything that we have achieved in Wales, whether it be the Korean LG investment or the second Severn crossing, has been the direct result of our own efforts.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para48"></a>In conclusion, I support the Chancellor in his efforts to get rid of the dependency culture and to put people back to work. I urge him to back the traditional family and, likewise, to recognise the economic disparities in Britain today. Wales and a number of other regions are simply crying out for a better deal.

<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para49"></a>This debate is taking place, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Currie, against the backcloth of an economy which is in extremely good shape. Those responsible for that should be given the credit that they deserve. We find ourselves in the happy position of having low inflation, falling levels of unemployment, real growth in output and a strong pound--a position which is the envy of our European neighbours.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para50"></a>The reality is--these things do not happen quickly--that we are now enjoying the fruits of policies adopted and rigorously applied by the previous government. In saying that, I do not seek to detract from the economic measures taken by the current Administration nor even particularly to comment upon them. I wish only to acknowledge that it was the tight management of the economy and the willingness to take unpopular measures by the previous Administration that led directly to the satisfactory situation in which we find ourselves today--credit where credit is due.

<A NAME = "71203-03_para51"></a>I have spoken in this House before on EMU. The noble Lord, Lord Currie, raised the subject again and commented that he was glad that we were not planning to go in in the immediate future, though I believe he hoped that we would decide to go in in the life of this Parliament. I have said before and will say again that in my view the practical difficulties of handling the introduction into economic and monetary union simultaneously with handling the practical difficulties of debugging the Millennium, would have meant that many organisations such as my own in this country--though I suspect the banks also--would find it incredibly difficult to cope. We suspect that many of our continental retailing competitors will discover just how difficult it is, and that there will be many pitfalls before this particular baby is born.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para52"></a>Your Lordships may recall that in his July Budget the Chancellor abolished tax credits on dividends for tax exempt pension funds. The rationale given for that was that the loss of tax credits would remove an incentive to pay out high dividends and encourage companies to invest more of their profits in the business. I am afraid that that line of reasoning is utterly flawed and the only certain impact is that government revenues will go up by around &#163;5 billion at the expense of those who are prudently investing for the future. The Chancellor has introduced a swingeing new tax on pensions concealed behind the appearance of economic rectitude. It will damage the economy. It is not only a tax on pensions; it is also a tax on jobs. It will raise the cost of employment for businesses, local authorities and any others who are required to make good the deficit in the funding of their pension schemes.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para53"></a> The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, referred to last week's so-called green Budget. That also contained a proposed change to tax regulations which should not be allowed to pass unnoticed nor unchallenged. Advance corporation tax is to be abolished, at last, and I very much welcome that. The payment of ACT is administratively burdensome and falls unfairly and sometimes irrecoverably on many companies. However, the scheme proposed to replace ACT will require businesses to pay, in quarterly instalments, during the course of the fiscal year. In other words, as I understand it, they--we--will be required to forecast the full year profit on which corporation tax is to be levied in order to calculate the quarterly payments in advance.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para54"></a>It is a fundamental principle of taxation in this country that losses should not be assumed nor indeed profits anticipated. I can think of no other situation in which a taxpayer is obliged to make payment before the full measure of liability is known and where the calculation is not based on actual figures. In this case the inequity is compounded by the proposed imposition of a differentially high interest rate on any business that wittingly or unwittingly underestimates its full year liability. Where businesses are highly seasonal, that is all too easily done.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para55"></a>We are promised that the Inland Revenue will treat such underestimates with a light hand.

<FONT SIZE=3>Revenue with quarterly payments in advance is to give an implied profit forecast for the full year, and that simply is not acceptable. Indeed, the whole proposal as it stands is unworkable. In the United States, Germany and Japan, all of which currently require corporation tax payments on account, companies base their calculations on previous year actual profits or on profits already generated in the current fiscal year. I submit that those are much more satisfactory arrangements which the Government would do well to consider.

<A NAME="71203-03_spnew25"></A><B> Lord Jacobs: </B>   My Lords, I rise with some trepidation to address your Lordships for the first time. More than 20 years ago I made two attempts to become a Liberal MP but without success. I do not therefore feel as well prepared to make a speech among your Lordships as those recently arrived from another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para56"></a>In considering my maiden speech, my noble kinsman Lord Wigoder advised me to speak upon a subject about which I know very little, lest I risk being known as a one-subject specialist. That left the choice of subjects rather wide, for there are many subjects about which I know very little. However, as we all know, advice from friends and family can safely be ignored and I have therefore chosen a subject upon which I have a little knowledge.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para57"></a>Liberal Democrat politicians have one advantage over the two other major parties in the sense that they can criticise present and past governments with impunity. For, even in my lifetime, we have not had a Liberal Democrat administration. I hope therefore that your Lordships, particularly those on my Benches, will forgive me if, in a spirit of constructive opposition, I offer on this occasion some praise to former and present governments for economic management.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para58"></a>While what came to be described, I believe, as the "Lawson boom" ran out of control and thereby caused interest rates to be raised so high to reduce inflation that it brought about a severe recession, I do not recall many voices at that time urging the Government to rein in the economy. Most of us were advocating how money would be better spent helping the poor rather than reducing rates of income tax.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para59"></a>Following the last recession the government, under their excellent Chancellor of the Exchequer, had to embark upon a course of retrenchment to bring under control a &#163;46 billion fiscal deficit. That was a painful period for most people. Nevertheless the deficit was brought down to around &#163;20 billion while the economy slowly recovered--a creditable effort, in my opinion, although of course we can and do argue that excessive public expenditure before the 1992 election substantially caused the deficit in the first place.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para60"></a>In other words, in the past three years the government have managed the economy well; it has to be recognised, however, that they may have caused most of the problem. In the past 18 years they have brought about two fundamental changes in the economy. First, the privatisation programme turned loss making, inefficient nationalised industries into profitable, efficient private industries. Secondly, they succeeded in <P>


<a name="column_1383"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1383</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reducing trade union power, leaving unions with adequate strength but not a stranglehold on the economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para61"></a>The Labour Government have come to power at a time when Britain is economically the strongest country in Europe: low inflation, falling unemployment, steady growth in the economy, a rapidly diminishing PSBR, altogether a veritable honeypot of a situation. Have the Government yielded to temptation and consumed the honey by increasing public expenditure? Indeed, they have not, for their strategy, I believe, is to bring the PSBR to zero as rapidly as possible. I agree with that strategy. So why am I and my party urging that more money be spent this winter on the health service to cut waiting lists, and on education to reduce class sizes?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para62"></a>I believe that the Government want to increase public expenditure to achieve those very same objectives and, in addition, to bring in by stages a 10p reduced rate of income tax to help the unemployed get back to work. Can all these competing demands be met without increasing the PSBR? I believe they can. The fiscal system in this country is continually distorted by providing reliefs for every imaginable subject. The special reliefs against income tax were devised, historically, when less than half of those in work paid income tax. What the system fails to take into account today is that the tax base has been lowered time and time again by so much that if the minimum wage were to be just &#163;4 an hour everyone in full-time employment would pay income tax on more than half their earnings. As a consequence, perhaps half the taxpayers in this country would be unable to take advantage of many tax reliefs and, worse than that, would actually be contributing to the tax reliefs of higher earners.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para63"></a>I give housing as an example. Surely it is the better off people who buy houses and the relatively speaking less well off who rent council houses. One gets mortgage relief to buy a house while those renting homes partly pay for that relief from their own income tax and VAT payments. It is incontrovertible that the less well off are subsidising the better off.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para64"></a>Then there is tax-free, profit-related pay, a very well intentioned relief which we supported. But the cost has spiralled out of control. There are numerous other special tax reliefs--TESSAs and PEPs to encourage savings--and property enterprise and venture capital trusts. There is also tax relief for pensions, which could certainly be restricted to the basic rate. Just these few examples could yield &#163;4 billion a year--&#163;2 billion perhaps for health and education and &#163;2 billion going a fifth of the way towards a 10p rate band. There are many more ways of increasing public expenditure without increasing the rate of income tax and without increasing the PSBR.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para65"></a>Finally, I come to the prospects for the economy as a whole. Economists seem to make little mention of the fact that the US and the UK are at present engaged in a massive economic experiment. They are seeking to discover if, by modest early increases in interest rates, they can restrain the economy and prevent rising inflation. With unemployment rates steady, this may present no problem. But if unemployment continues to <P>


<a name="column_1384"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1384</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>fall, we step into the great unknown. Economic theory used to dictate there was a natural rate of unemployment below which inflation would rise. At one time this was believed to be nearly 10 per cent. Today in the United States unemployment is less than 5 per cent., and still inflation is not increasing. Do we know when we have to apply much higher interest rates? Can we avoid serious recession? We are attempting to fine tune the economy. Ironically, most economists do not believe that fine tuning is effective. Still, economists have been wrong before, and we must just wait and see. I remain, however, more optimistic for Britain's economic future than at any time since the war.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para66"></a>In conclusion, I thank your Lordships for your patience in listening to me today and ask in particular your forgiveness for my presumption in believing that there are straightforward, equitable and pragmatic solutions to some of today's social problems.

<A NAME="71203-03_spnew26"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, it gives me considerable pleasure to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Jacobs, on behalf of the whole House on a clear and precise maiden speech. The noble Lord's experience in business will be of considerable value to your Lordships' House. I know that I speak on behalf of all of us when I say that we look forward to hearing many more addresses from him in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para67"></a>The area I wish to address is the question of the national minimum wage. Although I make no apology for believing that there should be a national minimum wage on social justice grounds alone, I also hope to demonstrate that it is economically sound to introduce such a provision into this country. It is interesting to observe that in the 19th century many men of good will proposed changes either for humanitarian reasons or because they believed they were socially just. But what is significant is that each time they advanced those proposals, they found that they met resistance on economic grounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para68"></a>I should like to draw your Lordships' attention to William Wilberforce. He introduced a Bill in 1791 to abolish the slave trade, but it was not passed by the Commons until 1804 and was even then twice rejected by the Lords. It eventually became law in 1807. In his later years William Wilberforce supported the movement for the total abolition of slavery, which was not accomplished until 1833. Each time he argued for the abolition of the slave trade and of slavery he was met with resistance on economic grounds. It was said that we would collapse economically if we did not continue with slavery. It is interesting that as early as 1791, in his last letter to Wilberforce, John Wesley wrote:

<A NAME = "71203-03_para69"></a>Still in the 19th century, perhaps I may now refer to Lord Shaftesbury and his Mines Act of 1842. Under the Act the underground employment of women, and of children under the age of 10, was forbidden. The year 1842 is a significant date to me personally. It was the year that my great grandfather was born. It seems as though the legislation for the employment of children <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para70"></a>Lord Shaftesbury again met with economic resistance when he wanted to reduce the age at which children could be employed. Wilberforce and Shaftesbury were told that there would be economic disaster facing this country if they took these measures. Also in the 19th century there was an economist, educated at Eton, by the name of Nassua Senior. Regarding the long hours that were worked in the middle and late 19th century, it was said that if those long hours were reduced, according to the economist, there would be total economic disaster. He argued that the profit was made in the last hour of the day and all profits would be destroyed as a result.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para71"></a>We then turn to the 20th century. I believe that Winston Churchill understood the matter a little better because in 1909 he introduced legislation which was the forerunner of the wages councils of this country. He did not argue from the point of view of social justice, although that was the manifestation of it, but from an economic and competitive point of view. That is confirmed in his classic statement which he made in the other House when he was introducing the legislation. He said that if we did not have minimum standards of wages, then the bad employers would undercut the good employers and the worst employers would undercut the bad. In fact, the wages councils stood the test of time from 1909 to 1986 when they were butchered and finally abolished in 1993. So the people of this country do not have any protection, unlike all the other countries of the Western world.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para72"></a>But we still hear today the siren voices and the prophets of doom that call out and say, "If you introduce a national minimum wage there will be economic disaster and bankruptcies". That should not occur. The Labour Government have set up a Low Pay Commission, which will take into account the evidence presented by all sides of industry. Certainly it is not the wish of a Labour Government to see job losses arising from the introduction of a minimum wage, because they have a policy of trying to maximise the employment levels in this country. Therefore, I see the national minimum wage as also a contributing factor to our economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para73"></a>The reason I say that is because no civilised country should tolerate poverty wages that have to be subsidised by state handouts, which in turn go to bad employers, unscrupulous employers and certainly to inefficient employers. That cannot be an efficient way of running a country. What are these subsidies? They are family credit, income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit. They are state subsidies paying the employees of employers who can maximise their profits as a result. There is no need to become more efficient because the <P>


<a name="column_1386"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1386</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employers can survive on the basis of paying low wages and finding that their employees can be subsidised from the taxpayer.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para74"></a>Earlier this year, in Scotland alone, it was assessed that &#163;265 million per year is paid from the state to top up low pay. In the north west, where I now come from, 30 per cent. of the working population earn less than &#163;4 an hour. Advertisements in Jobcentres cite a banner maker at &#163;2.36 per hour, which is &#163;92 a week; a care assistant at &#163;2.80 per hour for working a night shift; a hairdresser is cited at &#163;1.31 pence per hour, which is &#163;55 a week. An employee in a travel agent is quoted at &#163;60 for a 39 hour week. I could go on with further examples.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para75"></a>But it seems to me that we cannot go on as a country subsidising bad employers with welfare payments. We cannot go on allowing people to languish in the poverty trap between low wages and benefits and allowing more and more of our people to have no training, no skills, no hope of jobs or even of better jobs. In my view that is a recipe for spiralling down further into the pit where we compete with the worst and not with the world's best.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para76"></a>The national minimum wage is part of the Labour Government's policy for economic and social stability. No self-respecting and reputable employer has anything to fear from a national minimum wage. Labour's policy of welfare-to-work; the removal of the poverty trap; continuous training, high technology, high levels of employment; a skilled workforce, with committed and ambitious workers, will provide the economy that we want. We want workers with hope, expectation, dignity and self-respect. That is the society that I wish to see in the 21st century, with Britain competing successfully with the best economies of the world and not trying to compete with the worst, where covert slave labour rates of pay and not so covert child labour is employed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para77"></a>When legislation for the national minimum wage comes before this House I expect support from all sides. If not, I may again feel obliged to remind the House of the things that I have said today.

It is a great honour also for my family, my wife and children and my dear, late parents. I appreciate the welcoming and friendly atmosphere of the House and in particular the many warm handshakes after my Introduction.

<A NAME = "71203-03_para78"></a>I would like to say a few words about my personal background. I come from a religious family. My grandfather was a rabbi and my father was in full-time service to the synagogue. I qualified as a chartered accountant, started professional practice and then went into commerce in the entertainment industry. For many years I have spent a great deal of my time within the voluntary sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para79"></a>I believe strongly that economic and entrepreneurial activity must be combined with an involved voluntary role in order to have an active community and therefore create a strong society. I recognise the wealth and depth <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>of experience and expertise within your Lordships' House and I sincerely hope that I can make a contribution from my own experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para80"></a>I must congratulate the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the first ever pre-Budget report, which will encourage meaningful and informed debate on the economic choices confronting government. The aims of the report are to be welcomed, particularly as regards helping people away from welfare into work, improving competition, innovation and investment and, above all, ensuring economic stability. The report underlines the Government's priorities in the fields of education and health, improving childcare and helping pensioners. The new national childcare programme is one of the most ambitious and practical on record, with up to 30,000 new childcare clubs within five years and up to one million new childcare places. Positive health for all pensioners is also welcomed. There will be real financial help with fuel bills and additional help for those on income support. The voluntary programme to support the long-term sick and disabled who want to get back to work is to be commended, with action on skill shortages through the new deal.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para81"></a>The key factors must include a framework of stability and trust. I particularly welcome the focus on the arts. Music and film have been a major contributory factor to the economic well-being of this country and have created vitality and respect around the world. I am therefore particularly encouraged by the new national endowment for science, technology and the arts, which will make grants to encourage creative talents. Important references have been made to fairness, job creation and training, help for pensioners and also welfare to work. These are very much linked to my particular passion, the voluntary sector, which can contribute many major innovations and solutions and must be taken very seriously within both the economy and society.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para82"></a>The partnership between the voluntary sector, the business and private sectors and the public sector is crucial and an important ingredient for our economic and social prospects. Where one sector is not pulling its weight, nor putting in the necessary investment and support, the other sectors cannot sufficiently compensate. To create an environment where the public sector, the business sector and the voluntary sector can all work together in harmony, understanding and respecting each other's interests, expertise and problems, is crucial to the elements of stability and trust in both our economy and society.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para83"></a>Various facilities can be created to act as a catalyst to co-operation and to better our economic and social prospects. One example is the provision of employment resource centres. Within the many facilities of Jewish Care, the charity of which I have the privilege to be chairman is the employment resource centre, which was started several years ago. To date over 3,000 people have passed through the centre. Therefore the voluntary sector initiated and facilitated the idea, the public sector helped with support and the business community took up the <P>


<a name="column_1388"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1388</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>challenge. To date, over 2,000 of those going through the centre now have gainful employment. This is welfare to work in a practical and dignified manner, a meaningful and useful stimulus to our economic and social prospects, particularly if spread and used on a much wider scale.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para84"></a>Another initiative concerns day centres for the elderly--a facility which I call "youth clubs for the elderly"--where people come to meet others in a warm and friendly atmosphere and where they can maintain their independence and dignity by spending time together, by having a hot meal and by receiving stimulus and entertainment. Within the same charity to which I have referred six of these centres have been created and a membership of over 10,000 now exists. That gives comfort and assurance to the family. It allows the members to help each other and facilitates dealing with the day-to-day problems of life. This helps pensioners in a practical and sensible way and is again an example of all sectors working together and helping both economically and socially a crucial grouping of our society.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para85"></a>These examples prove how useful the partnership is between the three sectors and, most importantly, the help that is provided in meeting people's priorities. We must be intent on pursuing policies to boost the rate of growth and to deliver higher prosperity for all. Every ingredient must count in the mix, particularly as we confront the difficult choices our country has to make in building for the long term. Initiatives that work on a small scale must be examined in detail, explored to the full and then magnified if appropriate on a wider scale. Partnership, understanding and team work are vital in creating a solid foundation for all sectors to work together because by doing so we will be able to maximise the economic and social prospects of the entire nation. I thank your Lordships, and I look forward very much to working together with you all.

<A NAME="71203-03_spnew28"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, it is a great personal pleasure for me, on behalf of the entire House, to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Levy, on his maiden speech. He brings to the House a wealth of experience and combines it with compassion, which he has demonstrated so clearly in the charitable work which he has undertaken outside this House. I know that we shall all listen with great interest, as we have this afternoon, to his future contributions. The work which he has done outside, and not least so far as Jewish Care is concerned, has been of very great value and it is of the essence of these economic debates that we should seek to find expertise, for example, on accountancy--as the noble Lord does--with the desire to use that expertise to improve the lot of our community, whether it be by government action or by voluntary work. So we are very glad indeed that he is here in your Lordships' House. We welcome him and express to him our congratulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para86"></a>I should like to begin by spending just a moment or two on expanding a point which I introduced previously in a debate last week. In answering the <P>


<a name="column_1389"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1389</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>questions put to him on the Statement--the green Statement which we are debating in part today--the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no final decision has been taken about whether we shall continue with the unified Budget and Public Expenditure Statement or about the timing".--[Official Report, 25/11/97; col. 896.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para87"></a>This is a matter which in many ways is primarily one for the other place but nonetheless I think it has very great significance for your Lordships as well. My own view all along has been that this so-called unified Budget is misnamed. A unified budget would be one that had a trade-off between expenditure on the one hand and taxation on the other. But that of course is not the case either in parliamentary or in government terms. The House of Commons itself is unable to say, "We want to spend more on something and put up taxes accordingly". The Rules of Order prevent that kind of trade-off. One can either put forward proposals to cut taxation or put up expenditure: one cannot trade them off together. Therefore it is not a unified budget in any sense and indeed, as the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, will accept, it is not so in government, either. The Secretary of State for this or that department does not go to the Chancellor and say, "You must put up taxes because I want to spend more on something else". That is not the way it works.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para88"></a>The unified Budget is therefore a misnomer; but what has gone wrong is very much on the timing, because what happened when the Budget was unified was that it moved to the autumn. The effect of that was to crowd into the autumn both the Queen's Speech debates and the Budget debates, and so other legislation did not receive a Second Reading until a very great deal later. That has had an inevitable effect on the programme of your Lordships' House. The situation is not the same this year because we have had an election but I very much hope that in the light of the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, the Government will reconsider this issue, either by allowing the Budget to resume in the spring, as indeed it has this year, or alternatively that the Queen's Speech comes in the spring and the Budget in the autumn. In many ways that might be a better arrangement. If the parliamentary programme in both Houses is to be put right, this is something which needs serious consideration.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para89"></a>Much reference has been made in the debate to the so-called green Budget and the Statement today. There was relatively little in the Statement which provided a basis for consultation. It either said there will be other reviews on which we could consult or it put forward a number of specific proposals--not least a new deal for lone parents; heating for pensioners; a strategy for childcare; and so on. I make no complaint about that. The fact that the Government are doing so is something I welcome in the spirit that Iain Macleod once expressed, that the Opposition should never shoot Santa Claus.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para90"></a>It is difficult not to feel that these measures may have something to do with the position of the Secretary of State for Social Security. I know of no other reason. In that context, it is extraordinary that yesterday the Secretary of State did not make the usual up-rating Statement in the House of Commons. I cannot think of any precedent where that has been the case. The Minister of State did not do so either and it was left to an Under-Secretary.
<P>


<a name="column_1390"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1390</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para91"></a>There is a danger that, at present, the Government are tending to treat Parliament with a degree of contempt to a considerable extent. Whether the right honourable lady will, in the words once supplied by Mrs. Thatcher, remain unassailable is a matter of conjecture, but it is important that we see these measures in the context that I have just described.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para92"></a>I want to concentrate primarily on the question of inflation, particularly on some of the measures which are mentioned in the so-called pre-Budget Statement and on the question of the independence of the Bank of England. It is quite extraordinary that the Governor of the Bank of England is prepared to accept what the Government have proposed. He is to be held accountable for controlling inflation, and the only weapon which he has been given is control of short-term interest rates. I cannot think of anyone who believes that the control of short-term interest rates alone gives sufficient power to control inflation. It is strange that that situation has been accepted by the Governor of the Bank of England.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para93"></a>One must relate not only monetary policy and interest rate policy but fiscal policy together. The crucial relationship is one which relates the PSBR, the extent to which it is funded, and the effect of that on the money supply.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para94"></a>Curiously, the arrangement for the Bank of England appears to be an interest rate policy. It has a so-called monetary committee but it is really an interest rate committee. It is not at all clear how that committee or the Bank of England will control the money supply. It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Chancellor is trying to dispose of the responsibility for what happens to inflation onto the Governor of the Bank of England, but is not giving him adequate control.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para95"></a>One of the more paradoxical aspects of the new arrangement is that it would appear that the control of long-term interest rates has come back to the Treasury and away from the Bank of England. Indeed, in the Statement which we discussed the other day, the Chancellor actually takes credit for a fall in long-term interest rates. It is a very strange situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para96"></a>We have instead a so-called code for fiscal stability. When we discussed this earlier, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, said no, we did not want a Gramm-Rudman arrangement, as they have in the United States. While that has had its difficulties, it has the great advantage, if the borrowing requirement is to be kept under control, of a set limit, and if necessary for a vote to remove that limit. It would be a much more effective control by Parliament on the Chancellor than the mere fact that he will come back to this House and report on whether or not that limit has been breached.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para97"></a>What is not clear is the purpose of fiscal policy. This is not spelt out in the consultation document, and while it is in many ways an interesting document it does not deal with many of the crucial issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para98"></a>In the Statement we are now debating, there is a remark that there is a danger that today's pay rises threaten to become tomorrow's mortgage rises. While it may be a chicken and egg situation, after we have had--I have lost count--four or five increases in interest rates, it is extraordinary that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should <P>


<a name="column_1391"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1391</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>put the proposition in that way. We must all hope that we will move to a situation where pay restraint is achieved and there is a reasonable rate of economic growth.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para99"></a>The idea that the Bank of England can be held accountable on these matters really does ignore what is happening on fiscal policy. It also ignores what is happening on import prices, on the exchange rate and on wage settlements. It is important that we should treat the proposals which are now put before us with a degree of scepticism. We must all hope that the Chancellor succeeds in his objectives. If his proposals are sensible, we must back those objectives and the measures he proposes. It is important that we look at them critically. I hope that the Treasury Select Committee in another place will bring forward the kind of points I have raised today. It is a very welcome development that your Lordships have this opportunity of discussing this today.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para100"></a>One final point. There will be other occasions when we can discuss the question of economic and monetary union and there are many traditional arguments for that development and many against it. They are very well known and I do not wish to deploy them now. But one argument did emerge when the Chancellor made his Statement to the House of Commons about the Government's position on EMU which had not been used to any great extent previously, and that is that we cannot do anything now because our economy is not in sync with those elsewhere in Europe.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para101"></a>We must consider very carefully whether it is desirable that the economies of Europe--and certainly the economies of an extended Europe--should all be in sync. If they are, it is inevitable that if there is a recession it will be at least a Europe-wide recession and will probably cause a world-wide recession. If the countries of Europe are in sync and there is inflation, it will be Europe-wide and probably world-wide inflation. I hope we will not hear that particular argument used in the context of the single currency issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-03_para102"></a>These are all complex questions which we will need to consider very carefully. I am sure that the expertise of the noble Lord who made his maiden speech just ahead of me will make a valuable contribution to our debates in the future.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "71203-04_para0"></a>"With permission, Madam Speaker, I should like to make a Statement about the English regions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para1"></a>"On 1st May, the British people gave this Government an overwhelming mandate to modernise Britain; to decentralise decision-taking; to promote a modern and efficient economy; to raise standards in <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1392"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1392</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>education and training; and to fight against deprivation, and the causes of economic and social decline.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para2"></a>"We are committed to promoting policies which pursue jobs, growth, competitiveness and social progress, within a sustainable environment. Our aim is to achieve sustainable growth and to bridge the economic deficit which bedevils all English regions. The decision to create the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions underlined the Government's more integrated approach to policy making, which will be just as important at the regional level.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para3"></a>"The White Paper Building Partnerships for Prosperity, which I have published today, sets out the Government's proposals for new structures and new opportunities in the regions. The new regional development agencies will bring fresh vitality to the task of economic and social regeneration in the regions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para4"></a>"Since 1945, successive governments have introduced many programmes aimed at achieving economic and social objectives, but these have often lacked coherence, particularly at the regional level. Now, more than ever, the English regions are demanding a strategic lead for greater focus on wealth creation and jobs; for effective policy integration; and for co-ordination of central and local effort. This has been achieved to great effect in the Development Agencies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para5"></a>"Our election manifesto undertook to establish regional development agencies. In June we launched a major consultation process. My honourable friend, the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning, visited all the English regions and opened up a dialogue with regional and national bodies. We received over 1,500 responses to our consultation paper. These revealed overwhelming support for our proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para6"></a>"I will therefore shortly be introducing the Bill to establish nine new regional development agencies, based on the areas of the present Government Offices for the Regions. These "Agencies for Change" will be modelled on those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. One of their key functions will be to develop and implement regional economic strategies. They will do this in partnership with regional interests such as local authorities, TECs, industry, businesses and voluntary groups, as well as with government.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para7"></a>"Regional development agencies will be business-led, but board members will include not only representatives of industry, but also those from local authorities, further and higher education, the voluntary sector, rural interests, and tourism. The agencies will bring greater coherence and a regional perspective to national government programmes and national policy-making; for example, in areas such as transport and land-use planning.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para8"></a>"My intention is that regional development agencies will adopt the best elements of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Development Agencies, which have played a key role in improving the <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1393"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1393</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>economic prospects of their countries. But we will not impose a single blueprint on the regional development agencies. The English regions have different and distinct characteristics. Our Bill will provide a broad framework of powers for RDAs, to give them flexibility to reflect the particular needs of their regions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para9"></a>"RDAs will bring together a wide range of functions which at present are being carried out by many separate agencies. These activities fall into three broad areas. First, RDAs will produce and implement economic strategies which reflect regional priorities and needs, in consultation with their partners. These strategies will cover economic development; social and physical regeneration; competitiveness and innovation. They will also contribute to work on transport and land-use planning. This will all be done within a context which protects the environment and promotes sustainable development. The strategic plans will specifically cover business support and training. Business links and training and enterprise councils will continue to provide services locally, with RDAs monitoring and providing a strategic regional focus for their work.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para10"></a>"Secondly, RDAs will take the lead on inward investment in their regions, working with partners to market the region as a business location. They will develop integrated packages for investors and advise Ministers on applications for regional selective assistance.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para11"></a>"Finally, RDAs will be responsible for specific regeneration programmes. They will lead on the European Structural Funds and will manage the SRB Challenge Fund. They will also take full responsibility for the regional regeneration programmes of English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission. As a Government we are strongly committed to the countryside, recognising the particular needs of people who live and work in rural areas. Our proposals will put urban and rural regeneration on the same footing. This will ensure that rural interests will be given their full weight. Indeed, they will be strengthened by our proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para12"></a>"We are committed to ensuring an effective focus at national level for expertise, advice and information on rural matters. We are therefore accelerating that part of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review which is examining how to strengthen the institutional arrangements for delivering rural policy. We will involve the relevant agencies in this work.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para13"></a>"The Greater London Authority (Referendum) Bill which is currently before Parliament is the first step in providing a new strategic framework for London, which will also have its own development agency. The arrangements for this development agency will be set out in the White Paper on London Government to be published next year. This will make clear its democratic accountability to the Greater London Assembly and the mayor.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para14"></a>"Regional development agencies will of course be accountable to Ministers and Parliament, but they will also need to be accountable to their region. <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1394"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1394</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>Organisations representing local interests, and above all elected local authorities, have a right to influence the work of RDAs. This will be recognised in our board appointments, but we intend to take further steps.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para15"></a>"As we made clear in our manifesto, we are committed to move, with the consent of local people, to directly elected regional government in England. This complements devolution in Scotland and Wales and the creation of a Greater London Assembly. Demand for directly elected regional government varies across England, and it would be wrong to envisage at this stage a uniform approach. Local authorities and their regional partners are already creating voluntary chambers. We welcome this development and intend to build on it as a mechanism through which regional development agencies will have greater regional accountability.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para16"></a>"At present, only two out of nine English regions match the European average for GDP per head. That is unacceptable. The Government are committed to reverse this decline in Britain's economic performance. Our proposals will mean doing so with the regions to the fore.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para17"></a>"Modernisation of the structures in the English regions is part of the wider reform of the governance of the United Kingdom, and, in particular, the devolution of powers to Scotland and Wales. Our aim is for the English regions to grow and prosper within the United Kingdom and within the European Union. Our proposals for Regional Development Agencies are fundamental to achieving this. They will ensure that the potential of each English region can be unlocked. This is our vision, shared with the hundreds of individuals, groups and local partners who have responded to our consultations with overwhelming support and enthusiasm. Together, we can ensure that the regions will fulfil their aspirations.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para18"></a>"I have been associated with the cause of regional development and decentralisation for some 20 years. I was appointed as Opposition spokesperson on regional affairs back in the early eighties, and produced our alternative regional strategy. As Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, I established the Regional Policy Commission under Bruce Millan, the former EU Commissioner and Secretary of State for Scotland. The Millan Commission prepared the ground in a detailed and excellent way for this White Paper. I pay tribute to it for all its work.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para19"></a>"This is a cause very dear to my heart, with widespread support in the country and I am sure in this House. It is therefore with great pride and pleasure that I commend the White Paper to the House".

<a name="column_1395"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1395</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Statement was made in the other place at 3.30 p.m. and the White Paper was not available in the Printed Paper Office in this House at that time, there has been only a limited time in which to study the White Paper, which did not accompany the Statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para21"></a>We on these Benches share the aim of promoting policies for jobs, growth and competitiveness for the benefit of all of our citizens, and we recognise the need for growth and investment in all regions in England. The issue before us today is whether this Statement will help anyone to achieve those aims, whether the proposals will be an improvement on the present structures and, indeed, whether there are other ways of proceeding.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para22"></a>In its manifesto, the Labour Party said, among other things:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Local decision-making should be less constrained by central government, and also more accountable to local people. We will place on councils a new duty to promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their area ... in partnership with local people, local business and local voluntary organisations. They"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para23"></a>that is, local councils--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"will have the powers necessary to develop these partnerships". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para24"></a>Reference was also made to the Conservatives having,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"created a tier of regional government in England through quangos and government regional offices. Meanwhile local authorities have come together to create a more co-ordinated regional voice. Labour will build on these developments"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para25"></a>that is, the local authority developments--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"through the establishment of regional chambers to co-ordinate transport, planning, economic development, bids for European funding and land use planning". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para26"></a>What does one have to implement those promises? Certainly, regional assemblies and statutory chambers in England, despite the Statement, appear to be a receding possibility. I do not necessarily regret that, but they are without doubt a fading promise. Instead, we have the regional development agencies. What will be their contribution to local or regional democracy? Where is the accountability? Regional development agencies are to be imposed on the areas of the existing Government Offices. To my knowledge, there has not been a thorough examination of whether those areas would be appropriate for regionally-based structures. I believe that they were established for the convenience of central government in basing offices on those areas. It is very difficult to establish the area of a region in England. Either there is no great regional feeling at all or great local loyalties to particular areas, often for different reasons and different purposes.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para27"></a>The members of regional development agencies are to be centrally appointed and answerable to the Secretary of State. One paragraph of the White Paper that I have managed to read in the time available states that there will be 12 board members. I believe that the smallest region as defined by the Secretary of State is the eastern region which has seven local authorities within its area. Some have a dozen or more local authorities. The local authority representation will therefore be particularly small.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para28"></a>Perhaps the Minister can confirm or deny that the regional development agencies will have formidable powers, including the acquisition of land, the financing <P>


<a name="column_1396"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1396</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of business, the co-ordination of training, the organisation of inward investment, the development of rural areas, the provision of transport infrastructure and transport planning. I suggest that all of this will bring these organisations into conflict with existing agencies such as the regional development organisations, the TECs and local authorities. Does the Minister agree that, given the great efforts of local government in the field of economic regeneration, these powers will lead to a reduction in the influence of local government? I draw the attention of the Minister in particular to the schedule of functions in chapter 9 of the White Paper which refers to regional development agencies contributing to policies and programmes on transport, land use, the environment and sustainable development, further and higher education, crime prevention, public health, housing, tourism, culture and sports infrastructure projects. That does not appear to be compatible with the manifesto commitment to impose new responsibilities and duties on local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para29"></a>The Minister made reference to the work of regional development agencies in rural areas. It appears that significant powers are being taken from the Rural Development Commission. Can the Minister explain to the House why it is necessary to transfer from that organisation and English Partnerships certain functions? The functions of the Rural Development Commission to be transferred have been exercised since 1909 for the protection of rural areas. Is the Minister aware that my noble friend Lord Shuttleworth has resigned as chairman of the Rural Development Commission as a consequence of this action? Can the Minister comment on his statement that the break-up of the Rural Development Commission sends a negative message to rural England and is a devastating blow for the commission? Does the Minister agree that rural areas have very special needs, that their confidence needs to be maintained and that assurances should be given that their needs will not be overwhelmed by those of large urban areas?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para30"></a>Further, can the Minister tell the House how centrally-appointed quangos--regional development agencies will be precisely that--operating alongside regional Government Offices can be seen as decentralisation? Despite what is said in the White Paper and the Statement, can the Minister particularise the powers of central government as opposed to local government to be given to those bodies? Can the Minister give the House an assurance that no funds which would have gone to local government will now go to the regional development agencies?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para31"></a>Another issue which I believe is of considerable concern to Members of your Lordships' House is land use planning. I know what "land use planning" means but precisely what does it mean in terms of the involvement of the regional development agencies? What effect will that have on planning authorities? Does it envisage a change in strategic planning responsibilities? Is it proposed that the regional development agencies can override local decisions? Where does this leave--I make no apology for referring to it again in your Lordships' House--green belt protection?

<A NAME = "71203-04_para32"></a>The proposals for London add yet another layer to the proposed bureaucracy for the capital: mayor, assembly, boroughs, the Government Office for London and now a regional development agency. In the Statement reference is made to variable structures if rural chambers or assemblies come about. I put it to the Minister that, rather than contemplate a centrally-imposed structure of regional development agencies, local authorities in any given region, however determined, should be allowed to devise their own structures to meet the aims outlined in the White Paper. It is anomalous that on the one hand the Government, based on the comments of the Secretary of State in yesterday's Statement on revenue support, actively support a Private Member's Bill to allow local authorities to experiment with different internal organisations but that in this vital area where local government has already made such advances and there is a clear need for flexibility given the difference between the regions, in terms of size and make-up, they propose a fixed central solution. Does the Minister agree that a much more cost-effective way of achieving the same end is to ensure that local authorities have the necessary powers and competencies to be able to work together on projects of regional significance rather than rely on the imposition of new structures?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-04_para33"></a>Finally, can the Minister tell the House whether it is true that the only significant transfer of powers from central government agencies set out in the Statement--admittedly mine has been only a brief reading of the White Paper--are those from the Rural Development Commission and English Partnerships? Is it true that the importance of the regional agenda is not recognised by Ministers collectively, that the case for regional chambers in particular is not accepted by the Government and that there is extreme nervousness from the top about directly-elected regional government? If so, is that why this particular solution, which represents no greater democracy and accountability but another layer of bureaucracy, is before us today?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="71203-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I too thank the noble Baroness for repeating the Statement. She started by making reference to the new department to integrate the various areas of policy and activity on the environment, transport and the regions. I am beginning to think that she must have some personal regrets about having to represent that integration. For one Minister in this House it is an enormous task.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para0"></a>We welcome the integration of the functions but are concerned that that should not lead to centralisation. It is the aspects of centralisation which appear to peek out from under the new development agencies which concern us. Devolution to the regions from central government is very welcome. To move functions up from local government to new agencies at regional level which are not accountable in the way that we are accustomed to seeing local government work is not welcome. Each local district must retain its autonomy, and not just because there will be a need for local delivery mechanisms of the work to be done by the new agencies. It is important to ensure that our hierarchy of government is understood and that the functions of the new agencies are examined in the light of that hierarchy.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para1"></a>One part of the Statement grated with me, in particular. It has nothing to do with the policy, but with the jargon, "Agencies for Change". If "regional development agencies" is a description of what the agencies will be--regional, and to do with development and being an agency--that is an adequate title. "Agencies for Change" is jargon and may deny the fact that there are aspects of the way our regions function which should be retained.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para2"></a>The Statement refers to the different interests which will be represented on the boards. Let us make no bones about it: these will be new quangos unless and until they are fitted into a democratic regional framework. I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, is not here to answer, but one cannot help observing that it is a little rich to have criticism of quangos coming from that part of the Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para3"></a>We shall need to examine how the boards are to be made up--the relative numbers of representatives of different interests. I am especially worried about local government in that context, not because it is perfect and everything else is bad, but because members of local authorities are elected. There is a great deal to be said for elections. It is important for democracy that they feed in effectively, and that does not mean just the majority groups in local government. Let us admit it. There are some rotten boroughs which run on a majority basis without proper input from minority politicians. That probably applies across the board. It is important that minority politicians, representing those who, on a first-past-the-post electoral system, are in the minority of electors, are not excluded. Indirect representation is not proper accountability.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para4"></a>The Statement talks rightly about the different and distinct characteristics of the different regions and says that a single blueprint should not be imposed. Like the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, I do not believe that the different characteristics are properly reflected in the existing areas of the Government's regional offices. For instance, there are only two regions in an area which stretches from Penzance to Dover, and a doughnut around London which is divided oddly in a way hardly recognisable to those who live in it, assuming, of course, they know in which government region they live. The regions need to be examined. I do not suggest that the legislation should deal with boundaries; it would probably never get through if it did. But it should provide for a boundary commission procedure so that the boundaries of the regions are examined before the new bodies are established.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para5"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, I am concerned as to how the agencies' work will fit into the context of planning in the sense of town and country planning. The current system for strategic plans may not be perfect, but the agencies' work should be done within the context of strategic planning which is created elsewhere. They should not set their own strategic plans in the sense of town and country planning. I am apprehensive about the reference to land use planning contained in the White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para6"></a>The new agencies are to cover business support and training. I question whether it will be necessary to keep the current arrangement of TECs. Training and <P>


<a name="column_1399"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1399</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enterprise are, rightly, inseparable. If RDAs are to be responsible for them, one will need to examine whether the TECs will be duplicating their functions. I also wonder whether the DTI should properly remain within the government regional office network once the new system is up and running.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para7"></a>Reference is properly made to Europe. The regions have lost out within the EU over the years because there has been no appropriate route for EU development funds. On the subject of funding, I have not detected within the Statement--I may have missed it--what powers the new agencies will have to raise capital. That is an important point which should be highlighted, and I hope that the Minister can assist us now. I should also like assurances that the agencies will be resourced from the centre, which may be a different way of saying what the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, said.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para8"></a>We are told that the Government's comprehensive spending review is to be accelerated in the area of rural policy. I wonder how, sensibly, one can accelerate one part of a review which, by definition, should be overarching. Like others, I am suspicious as to what the code is in this part of the Statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para9"></a>Countryside interests may go wider than one region, and they may also be local. To the extent that those references are references to sustainability, that, of course, is welcome, but to the extent that they mean the transfer to quangos which do not have an enthusiastic responsibility for the countryside and put development above other interests, they are not welcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para10"></a>The Statement identifies the difficulty of the London development agency perhaps being established before the Greater London authority. I am glad to see that the White Paper on London will make clear the democratic accountability of the agency, but will the Minister comment upon whether there is any scope for considering the postponement of the LDA so that it is properly within the democratic control of a new democratic authority, assuming that that is what we end up with?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para11"></a>There is the whole question of regional government. Liberal Democrats are enthusiasts, as is well known, for regional government where there is a demand for it. From the north east--there are others in the Chamber who know the north east better than I do--one hears loud cries and demands for regional government. I do not know whether the Minister can comment upon the possibility of a fast-track approach to a regional assembly in that part of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para12"></a>Finally, we welcome the Government's general progress on constitutional reform. We are therefore most anxious to see the RDAs set in a constitutional, democratic, and accountable framework, dealing with truly regional and not local matters.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, many issues were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. I shall do my best to answer all of them. A great deal of the detail, as the noble Lord acknowledged, is contained in the White Paper which, he will understand, had to come out contemporaneously with the Statement.
<P>


<a name="column_1400"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1400</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para13"></a>At the beginning there is an issue about boundaries which it is important to get out of the way. We have chosen to base the RDAs on the administrative boundaries of the Government Offices. Those Government Office boundaries were well established for economic purposes and we believe that it makes sense to base the regional development agencies on them. That does not militate against cross-boundary co-operation; we want to encourage that. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, acknowledged that if we became bogged down in debating issues of boundaries, the progress that we have made on regional development agencies, let alone regional government, would have been slow. We did not wish to become diverted from the real agenda, which is about improving the competitiveness of our regions and addressing their economic deficit.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para14"></a>We must look at the powers which are being drawn down into the regional agencies from government in that context. I wish to make it clear that the specific functions of regional development agencies will be towards inward investment; the administration of a single regeneration budget challenge fund; the regional regeneration role of English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission; a leading role in European funding; advising Ministers on regional selective assistance; and helping TECs and business links to improve their performance and to match their work to regional needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para15"></a>We believe that that is a reasonable and sensible package which will give the regional development agencies the influence that they need to make an impact. Partnership working is the key to that. The regional development agencies will need to work with all the stakeholders in their regions; they are, local authorities, industry, business, trade unions, education and the voluntary sector.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para16"></a>As regards some of the concerns that have been raised, I make it clear once again that the regional development agencies will be accountable to Ministers. Their boards will be business-led, but they will also reflect a broad range of groups with an interest in the regional economy, including four members from local authorities. That issue was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, expressed anxiety about the potential of taking away responsibility from local authorities rather than drawing down and devolving them from central government. The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, raised the issue of new roles for local authorities, but I am afraid that he must wait a little longer for the Government's proposals on that. I can reassure him that the RDAs will take no powers from local authorities. Local authorities will have great influence on the regional development agencies both through the board membership that I have described and through the role of the voluntary chambers. We have set out broad criteria for the formation of those chambers, but they allow for some flexibility. That point was generally acknowledged in the consultation process and in the House.
<P>


<a name="column_1401"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1401</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para18"></a>As regards planning, about which there was concern, the RDAs will not have land use planning powers. Those will remain with the democratically elected authorities. The regional planning process is being reviewed and one of the main objectives is to increase regional ownership of the process. However, it is difficult to see how a statutory regional plan could be introduced in the absence of a statutory body to devise and implement it. As the White Paper makes clear, the creation of statutory regional chambers or directly elected regional assemblies is for longer term consideration. Voluntary chambers might have a greater role than at present within a process where the Secretary of State retained ultimate responsibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para19"></a>Perhaps it is appropriate to comment on the issue of chambers and assemblies because a point was made about the regional development agencies--they are business-led and not democratically elected bodies--and longer term plans. The voluntary changes which have begun in many regions are at various stages of development. We need to develop those bodies. The RDAs would be required to take account of the views of the chambers and give to them an account of their activities within the existing democratic framework. That will be a first step towards giving a voice to the regions. In time, the regions may move to more directly elected regional government. However, it is important to recognise that we see the RDAs as providing a catalyst for the development of the voluntary chambers which have made a promising start.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para20"></a>In the longer term, we are committed to more accountable regional government in England, but we are not in the business of imposing directly elected assemblies where there is no demand. We believe that within the present democratic structures we can do a great deal to build up the voice of the regions. Local authorities are already coming together with business and other partners to form voluntary regional chambers and to set out a more integrated regional approach. It is important to develop that regional approach if we are to focus and to enable all the regions in England to achieve their full potential.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para21"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked about the special position within London. We will be announcing details of the timing of the London development agency in the White Paper on government in London and the greater London authority. It is sensible to make specific arrangements around the London assembly, given the plans for a democratic assembly within London which will not be mirrored in regions in the rest of the country.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para22"></a>I turn to rural issues. The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, referred to the resignation of the noble Lord, Lord Shuttleworth, from the Rural Development Commission. I regret that resignation. The noble Lord's service to rural areas is well recognised and perhaps particularly acknowledged in this House. The Rural Development Commission, while supporting proposals to give rural development agencies a rural remit, expressed strong concern about RDAs taking over its regeneration work. While we understand this strongly held view, we believe that our proposals and not those put forward by the commission will provide the most effective way of building on the rural regeneration work.
<P>


<a name="column_1402"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para23"></a>The Government have made clear that each RDA will serve the need of all its regions. An integrated and inclusive approach is the best way of improving the economic performance of the rural areas as part of the region. The board of each rural development agency will have at least one person with a rural background and rural experience. The RDAs will design rural development programmes targeted on the most deprived rural areas and will monitor, consult and report on rural problems and how the agency is tackling them. The Government's strong commitment to rural regeneration will continue to be reflected in the RDAs' funding for rural areas. We believe that that will meet the concerns which I know exist and will in the long term provide a better focus for the needs of the rural areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-05_para24"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, is wrong if he believes that he interprets a lack of corporate commitment to the policy or a lack of enthusiasm at the centre. He did not have time to go through all the White Paper, but perhaps I may refer him to the preface. It was signed by the Prime Minister, who stated in the final paragraph:

<A NAME="71203-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Shore of Stepney: </B>   My Lords, I welcome what my noble friend said about regional development agencies. I hope to be able to welcome the White Paper, too, once I have read it. Two important questions arise from the Statement. First, different regions of the country have different problems and needs. On what principles are government resources to be allocated to the different regions to meet those needs? Secondly, what will be done to prevent undesirable competition between the different regional bodies for inward investment and other development?<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo971203/text/71203-06.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, undesirable competition must be taken seriously. The issue has existed as regards the regional development agencies for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We want to ensure that we tackle those problems rather than create extra ones in terms of an English dimension. That is why very urgent attention is being given to ensure that the concordat which is being worked out with the Department of Trade and Industry between the bodies that will be focusing bids for inward investment is a constructive process which actually allows energy to be generated and the best to come out of the regions and their bids, rather than make unnecessary and wasteful and competitive bids between different regions. We must get the balance right. It would be wrong not to empower the regions to provide the best focus and the best face on what they can do regionally. There has to be a national overview to ensure that that is not destructive competition.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-06_para0"></a>So far as concerns budgets, in the first place we are bringing together existing programmes and providing a strategic framework for them within the RDAs. As regards how that develops and how the allocation of <P>


<a name="column_1403"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1403</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>resources subsequently develops in the future, we will have to see what progress is made after the establishment of those bodies.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Carnarvon: </B>   My Lords, in the case of London and the south-east--I declare an interest in that I am chairman of SERPLAN--are the elected members of local authorities to remain responsible for the regional strategy and thereby aid the Minister in regional guidance?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl will see the answer to that question in the White Paper that we hope to publish very soon on the Greater London Authority. I have made it clear that the special position of London, given the fact that there will be in existence a democratic body of government within London, makes it different from the RDAs in other areas, which will be accountable to Ministers because there are no regional elected bodies in place.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I note that the Statement indicates that RDAs will be "business-led". I should perhaps declare an interest as, for more than six years, I have been the honorary president of a business-led local authority network which was set up to try to attract investment to a sub-regional area, in the noble Baroness's terms; namely, the Wirral Investment Network. In all this time the one thing that the business has been really effective in doing is reminding those working in the field that it has had to cut staff and tailor its modern development to a very much tighter management. There is no mention in the Statement of additional staff for the regional development agencies and no mention of any financial provision. Can the Minister tell the House what financial provision there is to be for the additional staff and, indeed, what number she envisages this grand plan will need?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, from the tenor of the noble Baroness's intervention, I am sure that she would not wish me to answer that it is a "grand plan", with a large number of staff, that is being envisaged. As I said before, it is a matter of drawing together functions which are already being carried out by other organisations looking, for example, at the regeneration role of the Rural Development Commission and of English Partnerships. We envisage that the setting up of the new authorities will involve expenditure in the region of &#163;5 million.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-06_para1"></a>As regards staffing, I recognise that there will be uncertainty for people who are already working within Government Offices, within English Partnerships and within the RDC. However, there is no desire to establish large, labour-intensive organisations. We are talking about strategic bodies and functions which are already being carried out in other parts of government. <P>


<a name="column_1404"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1404</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We are looking towards streamlining those functions rather than expanding into large numbers of extra bureaucrats.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, on a brief glance at the White Paper, I was pleased to see the following passage on page 21:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Co-operative movement and Community Economic Development groups have together stimulated a wide variety of activities which contribute to the overall objectives of RDAs. They engage in business development and support, childcare, youth work, training, managed workspace, security schemes, credit unions and development trusts, and housing and environmental improvements ... All invest in the local community, share social as well as economic goals, and are owned by the community, usually through a membership structure". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-06_para2"></a>I should tell my noble friend the Minister that such sentiments will be warmly welcomed by the Co-operative movement. Certainly the strategy behind the Government's initiative will also be welcomed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-06_para3"></a>Since co-operatives come in all shapes and sizes--they include, not only big businesses, but small and medium-sized enterprises; indeed, there are co-operatives that are consumer based, those which are productive, those concerned with housing, credit, workers, and the like--can my noble friend say whether their claims to be represented on the boards will be fully taken into account in view of their wide and excellent experience?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for his comments. I can make it clear that, when making the appointments, we shall be complying with the guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, which incorporates the recommendations of the Nolan Committee. All appointments will be made on merit, and none will be made without first being scrutinised by a panel, which will include a person who is independent of government.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-06_para4"></a>However, in making those appointments, we shall be seeking candidates who can bring a range of experience to the board. In particular, we shall look for those who can combine experience across a number of sectoral interests within the region. Board members will not be delegates of individual organisations. It is very important that we get it right, because the membership will be crucial to the success of the RDAs. I am sure that the acknowledgement in the White Paper of the contribution made by the Co-operative movement and those involved in it means that we shall have very strong candidates from within that movement.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Harmar-Nicholls: </B>   My Lords, without being in any way critical--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I suggest that there will be adequate time for all those wishing to participate to make a contribution. However, I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Shuttleworth, should speak now.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Shuttleworth: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the House. As my name has already been mentioned this afternoon, perhaps I may ask the Minister for more <P>


<a name="column_1405"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1405</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>detail on the likely impact of the Government's proposals on rural areas. As the noble Baroness knows, I have been chairman of the Rural Development Commission for seven-and-a-half years. However, I felt it proper to resign earlier this afternoon as I cannot agree with the Government's proposals to transfer the commission's rural regeneration work to regional development agencies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-06_para5"></a>I must make it clear that I am not unsympathetic to the principle of the agencies. However, will the Minister tell the House in what way rural areas will be better served by the commission's regeneration role and budget being transferred to RDAs, which will be predominantly urban in character? I simply cannot acquiesce in the break-up of an organisation which has served rural England well for almost 90 years. Can the Minister say how the expertise and skill in rural regeneration accumulated in the commission over the years since its creation will be retained for the benefit of the countryside in the short and long term?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-06_para6"></a>Does the Statement give a foretaste of unfortunate implications for any other government agencies concerned with the countryside? Does the Minister agree with me that, as a result of the Statement, it would not be surprising if some people in rural England felt concern that important rural needs and issues relating to jobs and businesses, affordable housing for those on a rural wage and rural services will in future be addressed, if at all, by remote regional bodies with other priorities? Finally, does the Minister agree that, whatever may be the merits of regional development agencies, the Government have today sent a negative message to rural England, as well as having dealt a devastating blow to the Rural Development Commission?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-06_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, as regards the final point made by the noble Lord, Lord Shuttleworth, it would be sad and wrong if people thought that a negative message was being sent to rural areas by this announcement. We are committed to promoting the interests of rural areas. That was made clear both in the Prime Minister's foreword to the White Paper and in the Statement that I repeated to the House today. There was an argument about whether or not the regeneration functions of the Rural Development Commission would be most appositely placed within the regional development agencies. I appreciate what the noble Lord said with regard to his support in general terms for the creation of regional development agencies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-06_para7"></a>Regeneration will be one of the statutory purposes of regional development agencies. They are being established as region-wide bodies and must have responsibility for regeneration across their areas; it is the only way to make them one-stop shops. We believe that rural areas will gain from being included in the regional agenda rather than being marginalised out of it. We considered all the arguments carefully but decided that those functions should be transferred to the RDAs just as we decided that the regeneration functions of English Partnerships and the administration of the SRB Challenge Fund should be undertaken by the regional development agencies.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-06_para8"></a>I know there is concern--it was expressed just now--that these development agencies will be predominantly urban in character. However, they will not be predominantly urban in character, and if they were they would fail. I have tried to make clear our concerns that the RDAs should not neglect the needs of rural areas. To allay those concerns we have established clear safeguards as regards the creation of the agencies. They will be subject to a specific remit to serve the rural areas of their regions. The budgets for their rural areas will be ring fenced. Outside London each regional development agency board will include at least one member who can contribute a strong rural perspective, and there will be more such members in regions with large rural areas. The RDAs will be required to design rural development programmes targeted on their most deprived rural areas. They will be required to monitor, to consult and to report on rural problems and how they are being tackled. If noble Lords look at that list of specific areas in which rural needs and concerns are addressed within RDAs, I hope that those with an interest in rural concerns will be reassured.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-06_para9"></a>I appreciate that there is a need for early decisions about the remaining functions of the RDC because we are talking here about the regeneration functions. That is why we are accelerating that part of the comprehensive spending review which is examining, together with MAFF, how to strengthen the institutional arrangements for delivering rural policy. We have to move forward in that area. We hope to have reached a conclusion in the New Year. We shall, of course, involve the RDC in that work.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="71203-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the Statement. It demonstrates the Government's determination to fulfil their mandate to pursue a coherent and sensible regional policy building on the voluntary developments which have taken place since the major political change in May. Will my noble friend say more about the correction of the democratic deficit which has developed over the past 20 years? The new Government were committed to correcting that deficit under the manifesto of which the noble Lord made copious mention.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, the Government have had to tackle an enormous democratic deficit that we inherited in May. As the House is aware, we have started to tackle that deficit through establishing a parliament for Scotland, an assembly for Wales and an assembly for London. Now we are taking forward our work in the regions. We believe that the correct thing to do is to start by tackling the economic deficit within the regions. Therefore the first piece of the jigsaw, as it were, is the regional development agencies. As I said earlier, we hope that the regional development agencies will in themselves provide a catalyst for increasing and encouraging the work of regional chambers. The White Paper specifically refers to the need for RDAs to achieve regional accountability through their partnership with the chambers. In the longer term we remain committed to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>more accountable regional government within England. It is accepted that different areas have varying degrees of enthusiasm for regional government. We have to tackle this matter in a measured way. We are tackling it in a measured way and we have taken the first step.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Harmar-Nicholls: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Shuttleworth, spoke before me as I wanted to congratulate him on the positive contribution he has made to this matter by his gesture and explaining that what is being done now seems to be without thought. I do not wish to criticise the noble Baroness who repeated the Statement because she is merely the mouthpiece of the Deputy Prime Minister on this occasion. However, she is an articulate spokesperson. I believe that the Statement represents an abuse of the parliamentary system of making Statements. At the end of the day the noble Baroness has said nothing. She used many words but at the end of her speech nothing emerged that was positive or clearly understandable. A Statement is intended to lead one along the way of knowing some of the details of a particular matter.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I must remind speakers that this is an opportunity to ask questions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Harmar-Nicholls: </B>   My Lords, I want to get to the question, but the lead-in to it is important. All we have heard are words which add up to nothing in practical terms. The question I want to ask--to satisfy the noble Baroness and my noble friend if he is also disturbed about this--is: will the new regional power be able to override, for example, the planning decisions made by a local authority because, at the moment, as I understand what has been said, the Government are merely saying, "We did not like your quango system but we shall bring in our own quango system?". At the end of the day the system being used is identical to that of the previous government. I do not think that that is the way to use Statements and White Papers to try to give guidance to Parliament.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, that intervention was an abuse.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I shall not bandy words with the noble Lord about whether the Statement was an abuse. I thought that I had answered the specific questions asked on specific points. The Statement made clear the process that the Government are undertaking in relation to the regional development agencies. The White Paper fleshes out the detail of that. There will be a Bill before the House. I have done my best not simply to be a mouthpiece but to answer the questions that have been asked on all sides of the House. One of the questions that was asked which I answered--the noble Lord obviously did not hear--concerned planning. I said clearly that regional <P>

<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para0"></a>Debate resumed.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may begin by apologising to your Lordships. Our colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Roll of Ipsden, is 90 today. The Bank of England is holding a dinner for him to which I have been invited. I may therefore have to beg the forgiveness of the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para1"></a>We have had some excellent maiden speeches. I much look forward to the speech of my noble friend Lord Thomas of Macclesfied. I should declare an interest. He is the chairman of a bank which has been of considerable help to a small company that I chair. I look forward to his speech with great interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para2"></a>I agree with much that was in the pre-Budget report, in particular, the small measures on the welfare to work scheme about which the Chancellor spoke. I agree with the national economic objectives, especially the need for fiscal stability. But I fear that the Chancellor's policies will run counter to the chances of achieving his economic objectives. If we are to achieve his objectives at reasonable levels, we shall need reasonable levels of economic growth. I fear that his policies will not achieve that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para3"></a>All in all, I find the report rather depressing. It adds up to a sad and disappointing list of policies for four major reasons: first, growth; secondly, public expenditure and tax; thirdly, unemployment; and, fourthly, economic and monetary union. I shall refer briefly to each in turn, even if I do not always agree with my noble friend Lord Shore on the fourth point.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para4"></a>First, in an excellent opening speech my noble friend Lord Currie spoke of the need for some reduction in growth. I accept that. However, if one reads the Chancellor's pre-Budget report, we now have less than 3 per cent. growth per year until the end of the century. That is not a reduction; it is a destruction of any economic growth. That is a forecast, not an assumption. Next year the figure will be 2.25 per cent., and possibly 2.75 per cent. if his exhortations on employment are heeded, which I very much doubt. The figure for 1999 is even worse at 1.5 per cent. to 2 per cent. For the year 2000 the figure is 2.25 per cent. to 2.75 per cent. Those are appalling lists of forecasts for the remainder of this century.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para5"></a>Why has the Chancellor made those forecasts? What are the assumptions underlying them? Clearly the position relates to inflation and levels of interest. I have read what has been said. We are told that inflation is "invariant". My <P>


<a name="column_1409"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1409</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>knowledge of the English language not being that good, I looked up the word in the Oxford English Dictionary. The first words I read were:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Each cause is invariant; it is only the phenomena that are variable". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para6"></a>That will be clear to all the bright people in your Lordships' House. I believe that it means that the issue will take priority over almost anything else. It will not be variable. That might have been an easier word to use.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para7"></a>We are told that interest rates will be,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in line with market expectations". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para8"></a>I do not know quite what that means. I doubt whether the market does. But quite clearly economic growth, which is essential if we are to achieve anything, for three out of five years will be less than 3 per cent. and is clearly not a priority in achieving fiscal stability or the Chancellor's other policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para9"></a>I agree that he should not be going for a boom/bust situation, but instead he is going for an almost permanent recession. That is one hell of a situation for the remainder of this Parliament. With all that the Chancellor is doing, his national economic objectives have little or no chance of being achieved. I am all in favour of long termism--we are bound to remember that in the long term we are all dead, although I make exception of all noble Lords present and others outside this House. But we shall not have reasonable levels of growth in the short term, and certainly not for three years. That is why I am not happy about the Chancellor's economic policies and his pre-Budget statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para10"></a>Secondly, on public expenditure and taxation, it is sad for me that, despite the higher revenue that the Chancellor will have available, he would rather use it on tax relief, even if it is at 10p in the pound, than to increase vital areas of public expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para11"></a>I am only too well aware of the manifesto commitment that for the first two years of this Government there will be no increase in tax rates. On previous occasions in your Lordships' House I have been able to explain the many other ways in which one can obtain extra revenue without increasing rates. We now have not only more revenue but improvements as regards the cash flow in the short term. As some noble Lords, and others, have complained, the change in ACT will mean that the Chancellor will have available in the short term an extra &#163;2 billion a year. That will change later, but by then I hope that we shall have higher levels of economic growth and higher revenue. But for now the Chancellor will have more available for public expenditure. I recognise only too well the need to maintain tight control of public expenditure, having had to do so for something like five years in difficult circumstances. But it seems to me that a modest increase now in vital areas of public services must be more than justified; I believe that they are essential.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para12"></a>I turn to the third of my disagreements with the Chancellor. As noble Lords will be aware, I never like to spend too much time agreeing with him. On unemployment, I strongly agree with his pledge,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to achieve high and stable levels of employment". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para13"></a>But the pre-Budget report states that they will be,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"flat at October levels". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_1410"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1410</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para14"></a>That is an assumption, not a forecast. Frankly, if it is only an assumption, I hope that he will change some of the other assumptions in order to achieve a better level of unemployment than is likely to be the case under his policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para15"></a>If we are to have levels of growth of the kind I should like to see, sadly the assumptions are all too likely to be the outturns over the next three years. Excellent as are the small measures, including his welfare to work programme--I hope that it will create some jobs--there will be far more jobs lost by the poor economic prospects that he has created. That is my third reason for not being happy about the pre-Budget report.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para16"></a>Fourthly--at this point my noble friend Lord Shore may stop nodding his agreement with me--I refer to EMU and the single currency. My noble friend Lord Currie said that we have seen the political consequence--we are not in the club. Of course we are not in the club; we are not members. We are not going to be members. Why should we be surprised that we are not to be in the club? I am sorry to see at page 23 of the pre-Budget report that we still do not plan to join in this Parliament. The length of the Parliament must surely be irrelevant to a decision on whether we join a single currency. That decision has nothing to do with the length of a Parliament. Indeed, the Chancellor said so. He said that we will join when it is in the national interest. Let us suppose, as I hope, that the national interest occurs two years before the end of this Parliament. Is the Chancellor saying that even if it does, he will not join? In practice, we know that it would not be just the end of this Parliament. If Parliament continues to 2002, after a referendum and legislation it will be 2003 and possibly later. I note the statement that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"barring some fundamental and unforeseen change", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para17"></a>we might still go into economic and monetary union. I hope that there will be such a change.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para18"></a>The Chancellor also repeats his five tests as to whether we should join. We all know that there is only one test: whether there is sustainable convergence for us and others in the European Union. But the plain fact is that as of this moment, apart from one area to which I shall refer in a minute, we have a greater sustainable convergence than many of the 11 countries who are likely to start an economic and monetary union. The Chancellor has said the following on exchange rates and interest rates. He quotes the interest rates: ours at 7 per cent. and the French and German at just over 3 per cent. What is most disturbing is that he tells us that the gap,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is expected to continue for some time". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para19"></a>He is expecting the interest rate gap to last perhaps for five or six years. If that is his conclusion, then I am even more disturbed than I was before. We should see interest rates starting to come down in two or three years' time at the least, even if they increase a little in the next year. By then, I hope that it will have an impact on the exchange rate also, so that we would be nearer to an exchange rate and interest rate convergence than now.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para20"></a>I trust--and I am sure that my noble friend Lord McIntosh will be able to tell us that the Government will do this--that if it is in the national interest and barring those unforeseen circumstances, we will enter economic and monetary union before the end of this Parliament. <P>


<a name="column_1411"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1411</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I know my noble friend Lord Bruce might disagree with me, but I hope that we will do so because the Chancellor has spelt out the benefits to this country if and when we join. I hope we do so before the end of this Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para21"></a>I conclude with this. The Chancellor has asked for a national debate. I have made my own modest contribution to the national debate. I hope that the Chancellor might even take on board one or two of the points I have made and change his policies accordingly.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the opportunity to make my maiden speech in this debate and I am delighted to be following my noble friend Lord Barnett. I recall that he was in the business of growth. He did not have a green budget but if my memory is right he produced a record number of budgets in one year, three in one year with the noble Lord, Lord Healey.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para22"></a>I am grateful too for the kindness, understanding and warm support given to me by all whom I have met since joining the House just over a month ago. It is a great privilege to be here, made even more so by your fellowship.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para23"></a>Later this month I shall be moving on from a lifetime's work in the trade union movement. This has been primarily in the public and Civil Service arenas. Latterly, however, with privatisation and contracting out, I have spent more of my time working with the private sector, negotiating and discussing with multinational corporations which are extending their activities beyond simply acquiring public utilities and outsourced support functions in government departments and agencies but increasingly moving into the core of public administration. This is now happening on a worldwide basis. It is another aspect of the global economy. I anticipate that we shall have more of it in the future, rather than less.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para24"></a>It is all a far cry from my earlier days as a general secretary. They were spent trying to improve the lot of a most deserving but little-loved group of important contributors to the economy, Her Majesty's inspectors of taxes and tax collectors; alternatively, as the noble Lord, Lord Blyth of Rowington, who mentioned them earlier, would have described them, "those of the light hands". Had he been here, I could have told him that a number of them came to the House on Monday to view your Lordships at work. Have no fear. They were not here on official duty. They were greatly impressed by your Lordships, but I regret not sufficiently so to offer any dispensations or discounts.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para25"></a>Our visitors were pleased to see other ex-employees of the former Inland Revenue Staff Federation here--our noble friends Lord Callaghan of Cardiff and Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean, who now make such distinguished contributions to this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para26"></a>Noble Lords will also remember with great respect and affection the IRSF's first general secretary and founder, Lord Houghton of Sowerby. I only wish he was with us: to our regret, he died last year. I mention also <P>


<a name="column_1412"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1412</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>our second general secretary, Lord Plant of Benenden, who was in this House. They are both much missed, as are their contributions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para27"></a>In my brief contribution I wish--contrary to the previous speaker--to welcome the Chancellor's Statement last week outlining the challenges which face the nation on productivity, employment and stability. Progress has been made in improving productivity, and that applies equally to the public sector as to the private sector. But more needs to be done. The civil and public services have embraced significant changes in recent years. The Civil Service alone has been reduced in size from over 700,000 to 475,000, the present figure. Costs have been better contained; output has gone up. There has been greater focus on the quality of services delivered and on customers' needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para28"></a>Some of the changes have been painful for employees or members. Some have been disliked or resisted. We must also admit that many of the changes have been significantly for the better. As a result, this country now has a relatively modern Civil Service and one of which we can be justifiably proud. I certainly am. It is one which, in many observers' view, is way ahead in productivity terms of others in Europe. It is certainly ahead in that respect of the federal machine in the USA.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para29"></a>I believe that ours is a model which we should strongly advocate to others in Europe. Our approach has found ways of rooting out waste. If we take our lessons into Europe, press them and argue with others for them, we could effect substantial savings in the contributions we have to make to European institutions. It is another of those many opportunities open to us in this country to give a lead in Europe where everyone can gain from what we have to offer, particularly with our newfound expertise in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para30"></a>But the drive for modernisation and even better services at home must continue. That means more change. In my experience, that is not necessarily perceived as good news by all, especially if it is badly handled. The new Government should seek to be more sensitive to it than their predecessors were, at least in their latter years in power.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para31"></a>Job insecurity consistently ranks as the number one fear and cause for concern among employees, both public and private. The search for better frameworks within which employees can embrace change with more confidence, so that productivity goes up, must continue. Education, training, re-skilling, lifelong learning and employability are at the heart of confidence-building in the workplace.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para32"></a>I welcome and support the Government's ambitious programmes here. But the tight monetary constraints and accompanying tight fiscal regimes of keeping taxes and deficits low leave little scope for the investment needed. Like others, I would like to know more about how, when and where it will come from. Like the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, I should like elucidation and clearer statements on those areas because we need the investment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para33"></a>Public partnerships with the private sector offer possibilities. But they also bring other fears for public service employees. More innovative approaches are <P>


<a name="column_1413"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1413</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>needed than we have seen in the past. There should be more employee involvement from the bottom up; it should be allowed and encouraged. I was greatly heartened by the contribution made by the noble Lord, Lord Levy, who talked in visionary terms about the types of relationship that we can develop between the public, the private and the voluntary sectors. Much more work needs to be done in those areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para34"></a>There are a thousand flowers everywhere waiting to bloom. An active programme for greater fairness at work would help to remove hostilities and suspicions and ease the way forward on improving productivity. Dare I say it: an active job creation policy is needed too. There are parts of the country with high unemployment where neither the private nor the voluntary sectors can produce jobs. But there is work to be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para35"></a>These days people ask me where are my estates, as I am now in the House of Lords. My estate was just outside Wakefield, a council estate. As I go round I see the condition of council estates from one end of the country to another. Do not let anyone either in this House or elsewhere say there is no work to be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para36"></a>We all share the Chancellor's recent stated concerns about the possible growth of wage inflation and the effects that that could have on jobs. There is, we know, an inextricable link between the levels of wages and jobs. Annual wage and salary bargaining points this up every year. I have had much experience in that arena and increasingly come to the view that we should be trying to move away from the annual negotiating cycle and into longer-term pay settlements stretching over two, three or even four years to link into inflation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para37"></a>That is something I have been pressing on the Government since they were elected earlier in the year and I hope that others will take it up so that we see some movement forward with the Government setting an example. That may be picked up wider in the public service area and beyond that in the private sector too. We need a culture change in our approach to wages and jobs. I know that there is a range of technical obstacles to be overcome, not least the PSBR. But they are not insurmountable.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para38"></a>Finally, a few words about unemployment. I was a member of the independent inquiry into unemployment and the future of work conducted under the auspices of the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland which reported last April. The report was produced after 18 months of fact finding and was written by Andrew Britton, a well known and respected economist formerly in the Treasury and director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The right reverend David Sheppard, formerly Bishop of Liverpool, chaired our sponsoring body.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para39"></a>Time does not permit me to cover the whole of the report and its recommendations. But I trust your Lordships will have heard of it and its principal messages in relation to creating jobs and tackling poverty. Like many in the country I am delighted that the Government are preparing to make serious efforts through the new deal and welfare to work programmes to tackle the seemingly inexorable underlying growth of unemployment. While it is true that the unemployed <P>


<a name="column_1414"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1414</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>claimant count is falling, like my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington, I do not believe that that represents the full worrying picture about the state of unemployment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para40"></a>While the unemployment figures may be falling, there is no justification for anyone spurning the Government's initiatives. Moreover, if more youngsters are finding jobs, the mountain of longer-term unemployed still remains and needs to be tackled. I hope that all in this House will not only wish the Government's programmes God speed, but that, irrespective of party, all will give every assistance they can to ensure that every pound of the windfall tax is put to good and productive use for reasons which are social and spiritual as well as economic.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para41"></a>To that end I would welcome some guidance as to how this House may do more work in that area. Might we not possibly establish an all-party Peers group to monitor and provide a channel through which we could influence the ideas and effectiveness of the new deal. I would welcome advice on how to move forward along those lines.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para42"></a>I am grateful for your Lordships' attention and patience. I am overjoyed to be in this House today. I believe that we have great opportunities and that our economic prospects are good. They will be even better if we are prepared to pull together. That is what the country wants: opportunities for all, fairness and a helping hand for the dispossessed and disadvantaged. That is what I hope I can work for in this House with your Lordships.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   My Lords, it is a great pleasure to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, on his maiden speech. As many will know, he had a distinguished career in the trade union movement. The jobs and duties that he has taken on have given him vast experience. I was particularly interested to see that he was a director of the Prince's Trust Volunteers, a trust in which I have some interest. I know that he will make a major contribution to future debates in this House on those matters with which he is so familiar and so experienced.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para43"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Currie, for introducing this debate. It is a subject of vital importance to both sides and he did it with great clarity. For me, it was rather like the curate's egg; there are a lot of parts which I may wish to qualify and some with which I find myself in agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para44"></a>The starting-point is the position on 1st May last, and the then hand-over to the present Government of an economy which must have been the best economy ever handed over to a succeeding government by a different party. The noble Lord, Lord Currie--this is one of those parts of the egg which perhaps did not come over so well--tried to damn with faint praise what they inherited at that time: a situation of reducing unemployment, increasing growth, reducing RPI and so forth. Shortly after the election, the International Monetary Fund described it in its report as one of impressive macro-economic performance, strong growth and low <P>


<a name="column_1415"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1415</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inflation. I am sure that no incoming government had ever been met with so cheerful a message in relation to their inheritance.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para45"></a>The Labour Government have been lucky. They took that rich inheritance and, at the same time, during the election campaign, promised not to change it. There was not to be any more "old Labour"--tax and spend; there would be sound Conservative policies. They convinced the public that that would be so, and I cannot help saying that perhaps we helped a little in the process. At any rate, they did that with great success.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para46"></a>What has happened since then? It seems that every Minister, in every speech that I have heard in this House or outside, and particularly on television, includes early in the speech a reference to "the mess that we inherited"--"we" being the present Government. It has no bearing on whether there is truth or reality in the comment; it is automatically churned out by the spin doctors or speech writers and must be included in the speech, or else. I waited with interest to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Currie, had to say. Rightly, and correctly no doubt according to the remit of the authorities, he, too, included that reference in his speech. So be it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para47"></a>What are the future economic prospects of the nation? They ought to be good--they are built on the foundations of the work done over the past 18 years, so the chances that they are good are tremendous. The Conservative government freed the nation from so many of the problems that had damned the economy for far too long. They freed it from industrial disputes. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Jacobs, who spoke from the Liberal Democrat Benches, on giving praise where it was due in that regard, and in regard to denationalisation. I remind the House that it was the old Labour government who thought it a good idea to have 98 per cent. taxation. We must not forget that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para48"></a>The question is, how long the momentum of that 18 years' work will continue with the present Administration, given the problems that undoubtedly exist. Some of those problems are external and beyond the Government's control. The noble Lord, Lord Currie, referred to the Far East, and he is absolutely right. The Far East does present problems. There is doubt as to how far it will affect future exports and doubt as to how much internal investment in this country will be affected, bearing in mind the massive investment brought into this country--particularly to Wales and Scotland--during the 18 years of Tory government. They are vulnerable, and our Government are limited in the amount of control they can exercise over them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para49"></a>With regard to Europe, I find myself not in agreement with the noble Lord, Lord Currie of Marylebone, or indeed with the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, who seemed to suggest that it is only a matter of timing as to when we go into EMU, with all the consequences that will follow from that. The choice to which the Government have to give some thought is whether we are going to be a constructive member of a federation of nation states or merely a small member of a federal Europe. That is the stark choice that will face us. EMU would commit us, inevitably, to the latter--to being a small member of <P>


<a name="column_1416"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1416</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a federal Europe. It would be dominated by Germany and its junior partner, France. Other member states seem determined to bring us down to their level. They want to bring our unemployment up to their level, because they cannot get their unemployment down. There are other areas where they wish to see our supreme position lowered. The Government have signed the social chapter, which will give them many opportunities to do that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para50"></a>There are divisions on the Benches opposite and in the other place, divisions which extend perhaps between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, I must admit, sadly, that such differences have been known to occur in previous administrations. It is to be hoped that those can be resolved before the temptation by others to try to trap us by bribes and threats brings an unfortunate answer.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para51"></a>The Government have already inflicted domestic damage on our economy. Despite their promise that there would be no increase in taxation, they have done just that. We all know that there have been 17 new taxes and a &#163;15 billion pension tax. The average family is &#163;650 a year worse off than it was on 1st May. A total of &#163;25 billion in tax has been imposed on business by this Administration. In the past couple of days TESSAs and PEPs have both been faced with their destruction, leaving a number of people with nothing but to try to follow the advice to find a Channel Isles tax haven in which to hide the savings they have accumulated to pay off their mortgage and the like.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para52"></a>There has been some discussion during the debate about the role of the Bank of England. My noble friend Lord Higgins made an excellent contribution. I shall not try to add to that except to say that the attempted division between monetary policy, which has been handed over to the Bank of England, and fiscal policy, which is to remain under the control of the Chancellor, is an unsatisfactory way to proceed. You can have only one person in charge of the economy of this country. You cannot have a Chancellor who says, "But I am not in control of monetary policy. I cannot control interest rates so I have had to put up taxes". That is a matter of some importance which I hope we can consider on some other occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para53"></a>The prospects for this country are somewhat cloudy. We are in a period when speech writers and spin doctors have been concealing what has been going on. They have been concealing the increases in taxation and preventing the average person realising that the pension tax will hit their pockets. Very few people have yet realised this. But that era is now passing. I do not think the public will be fooled for long. They will see through this charade. The Government will pay for it in due course. My only hope is that the Government will not have destroyed our economic prospects before reality comes back.

<A NAME="71203-07_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Thomas of Macclesfield: </B>   My Lords, it is both an honour and a pleasure to enjoy the privilege of making my maiden speech in your Lordships' House while we are debating the economic prospects of our <P>


<a name="column_1417"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1417</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nation. My only frustration today is that, as the unpaid chairman of the North West Partnership, which is made up of public, private, voluntary and academic sectors in the north west of England, I shall not be able to reply to some of the fears raised by the Benches opposite. However, perhaps I shall be able to do that on another occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para54"></a>If I may contribute to this debate, my first observation, and what brought joy to my heart, was that the pre-Budget report, together with the related booklets and press releases issued by the Chancellor of the Exchequer last week, took an inclusive and not an exclusive approach to the economy, while every comment was anchored in the real world of industry, commerce and ecology, in an attempt to ensure that we collectively secure Britain's long term economic future. This debate will, of course, continue. My noble friend Lord Islwyn, in his maiden speech, covered much of that ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para55"></a>In my experience as a banker, it is only when a business embraces in an inclusive manner all the parties who contribute to the long-term success of that business while also understanding and responding positively to the non-negotiable facts of nature that the business has an opportunity to enjoy both economic success and longevity. In my opinion, this applies equally to an individual company and to society at large. This theme of the inclusive partnership I will return to later. However, I have been cautioned that a maiden speech should be non-controversial. This causes me particular difficulty since I must confess that I have earned a good living by being both controversial and fiercely competitive. So, without wishing to be controversial, I will concentrate on this theme of an inclusive partnership, whether in business or society, as it is based on my own lifetime and professional experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para56"></a>The inclusive approach to business is not new. It was first embraced 200 years ago by the industrialist and social reformer, Robert Owen, 1771-1858, and many Quaker companies of that era whose names still surround us today. It was much later embraced by the American, Dr. Edward Deming, some 40 years ago when he almost single-handedly transformed the concept of quality and getting it right first time in Japanese industry. Your Lordships will be aware of the subsequent global impact on quality standards in the manufacturing industries. Then again, the inclusive approach to business once again emerged in the middle 1990s when the results of three years' research by the Royal Society of Arts, Manufacture and Commerce were published under the title Tomorrow's Company.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para57"></a>But first I should like to return to the 18th century and the textile trade, for which the north west of England was famous, and to Robert Owen, a fellow Welshman, mill manager, then mill owner, a social reformer and practical visionary, and a successful businessman whose ideas are now emerging across the world as the most appropriate and intelligent approach to managing a successful and profitable business over the long term--and I emphasise "over the long term". By that I mean least several generations.
<P>


<a name="column_1418"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1418</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para58"></a>It so happens that he was born in Newtown, Wales, in 1771 and his long life overlaps with Adam Smith in Scotland and Karl Marx studying in London. After early business experience in London between the tender ages of 10 and 20, he became a mill manager in Manchester. But he is best known today for what he achieved, and his determination to develop this particular inclusive approach to business, in New Lanark in Scotland.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para59"></a>It has taken us perhaps 200 years to appreciate fully his hard-nosed approach of common sense and business acumen. His ideas were based on the simple proposition that, if the natural partners of a business--customers, staff (significantly) and their families, suppliers, the local community, society at large and, of course, shareholders--were treated and managed fairly, not in preference one to another but in balance and across time, then you would have the formula for both profitability and longevity.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para60"></a>However, it would be wrong to see him as a do-gooder, or as a paternalist, or even as a religious prophet, since he was none of those things. His basic belief was that it was simply the most successful, efficient, ethical, humane and intelligent way to do business in the long term. He was a man who, unlike any of his peer group, and without the support of legislation, took children under 10 years of age out of his mills, built them a school, and provided the school with fully-paid and qualified teachers, while building modern homes for all his employees with clean, running water and waste disposal: what Maslow, the famous behavioural scientist, would later refer to as the basic hygiene factors in the hierarchy of man's needs. That was 200 years ago, gentlemen!
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para61"></a>This was seen as revolutionary at the time, and it was believed that it would damage the whole textile industry and cause major unemployment. Do not those sort of comments ring bells again today? However, Robert Owen prospered and never made a loss in New Lanark. Indeed, he produced superior results in terms of quality. He was the first to produce the famous and up-market Sea Island cotton and also a better return on shareholder funds despite carrying those extra costs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para62"></a>The Sturges Bourne Committee of 1817, which I am sure some of us will remember, was a parliamentary committee set up by Lord Liverpool's government under Sturges Bourne to consider the revision of the Poor Laws, which could not cope with the post-1815 distress. Owen was to present his proposals to the committee with maps, drawings and publications. Unfortunately, the manufacturing establishment of that time got there first and, after the committee had deliberated in private, it voted by a majority that Owen should not be heard nor his evidence accepted. We can only now wonder what might have happened to our manufacturing industry, our society and our environment, if he had been heard and his approach adopted in that era. That is sometimes the fate of great men and women who are visionaries.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para63"></a>There is a similar tale about Dr. Deming, who tried--and gave up trying--to get his approach to business and quality heard and adopted by the post-Second World <P>


<a name="column_1419"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>War American industrialists. Instead, he took his ideas to a conquered country and his words echo down the years to us today. First, for example,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The consumer is the most important part of the production line". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para64"></a>Secondly,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Quality should be aimed at the needs of the consumer, present and future". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para65"></a>Thirdly, he said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The aim proposed for any organisation is for everybody to gain--stockholders, employees, suppliers, customers, community, and the environment--and all over the long-term". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para66"></a>Again, with respect to employees he said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The aim might be to provide for them good management, opportunities for training and education for further growth, plus other contributors to joy in work and quality of life".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para67"></a>In that, he was clearly well before his time as regards this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para68"></a>Then, to bring us right up to date, there are the findings of the research by business practitioners into the characteristics of tomorrow's company. They too concluded that the essential element was an inclusive partnership which embraced shareholders, customers, employees, suppliers and the local community. Again, after Greenbury and Cadbury, the Hampel Committee, in July of this very year, said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Directors' duty is to shareholders both present and future ... but more importantly companies can meet this duty and pursue the objective of long-term shareholder value successfully only by developing and sustaining their other relationships". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para69"></a>We in a clearing bank, which is the Co-operative Bank, have developed this inclusive partnership approach to include the wider society--global, national or regional--which has allowed us to embrace the wider ecological issues and we have also found that, by applying the other elements of Maslow's hierarchy of man's needs, like ego and spirit, we can unite the otherwise possibly divergent views of staff, customers and suppliers in a task bigger and more important than the individual or the company itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para70"></a>Examples of that approach have been, first, the setting up of a business and ecology centre with the four universities of Greater Manchester to serve the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises trying to take advantage of the probable developments and opportunities in terms of legislation on green issues, and, secondly, the campaign that we first launched on behalf of our many national charity customers, to ban the manufacture of landmines worldwide.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para71"></a>To test our sincerity over time, we also embraced a benchmark of past and future generations. Have we honoured the past in terms of the original objectives and aspirations? One thinks of the demutualisation of building societies, for example, as a particularly obscene example of throwing away an important heritage with one generation benefiting from 10 generations of hard work. Have we added today to what we inherited? Are we handing over to generations perhaps not yet born something clearly superior to what we ourselves inherited? That, I suggest, might be a useful benchmark for business and society as a whole and for this and any future government.

<A NAME = "71203-07_para72"></a>In conclusion, my role as a businessman, as I see it, is to ensure that future economic legislation encourages both business and society to develop an inclusive partnership which will allow both to prosper in balance and across time. I thank noble Lords for their patience.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Taverne: </B>   My Lords, I begin with an apology. I had very carefully rearranged my affairs so that I could be here at the end of this debate--indeed, I was scheduled to wind up for these Benches. But, unfortunately, in view of the hour-long Statement which took place in the middle of the debate, it has become impossible for me to stay until the end of the proceedings. I hope that the House will understand. Perhaps I may just add that there could possibly be a case for the Procedure Committee to look at the very heavy weight of Statements now being made in this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para73"></a>I have a very pleasurable task indeed, not only in congratulating the many excellent maiden speakers who have spoken already in the debate, but in particular the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Macclesfield, who has just spoken. He has played a signally effective part as managing director--and he is still playing that part--in the Co-operative Bank, but, in particular, it is his role in being a foremost champion of ethics in business, which is the cause he championed in his speech today, which has been remarkable. He has also been the moving spirit in founding the national centre for business and ecology. Again, I believe that we are aware of the very considerable role that he has played in bringing together the public and private sectors in the course of the regeneration of the North West. I congratulate the Government on selecting such an excellent Life Peer to their Benches. He will be a great asset to this House, as he demonstrated in his speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para74"></a>I want to address first the macro-economic issues which have been raised. Like my noble friend Lord Jacobs in his excellent maiden speech, I pay tribute to both the last and the present governments in their macro-economic policies. We start from a strong base. I also believe that the Chancellor is right to be cautious in his approach to public spending. He may well need room to manoeuvre later on. He is more likely to sustain a reasonable rate of growth in the long run if he avoids a consumption boom in the short run. Again, I suspect that it will be easier to put the United Kingdom on the path of convergence towards monetary union if he proceeds cautiously at this stage.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para75"></a>However, I have three reservations. First, it is clear that the Government have lost some control over our economic affairs by the delay in entering monetary union. It is going to be affected by decisions on economic co-ordination which will be taken by the very important council of EMU members. We cannot take part in that, as the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, or another noble Lord, pointed out, if we are not members ourselves. So we have lost some sovereignty.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para76"></a>But what worries me particularly is that the Government do not seem to understand how the European Union works. The Chancellor of the Exchequer is perhaps <P>


<a name="column_1421"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1421</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the most capable or brainiest Member of the Government, with the exception of the talent on the Benches opposite. He is certainly one of the most capable Members of the Government and one of their most pro-European. It is a tragedy that he should so mishandle probably the most important council meeting that he has yet faced in the Council of Ministers.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para77"></a>If such a capable and pro-European Minister makes such a mess, what will the others do? I think that Lionel Barber in today's Financial Times has hit the nail on the head. The Government have not yet taken the trouble to find out exactly how the politics of the European Union work--and please let us have no more speeches from the Prime Minister or anyone else about the great leadership role which Britain is going to play in Europe. It comes ill from a country with a record of missed opportunities such as Britain has. So let us have no more speeches which might please the headline writers of the Daily Mail: in the long run it is far more important to establish proper relations with our European partners, which will also bring greater electoral advantage.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para78"></a>My second reservation is that while the Government have adopted the Conservative spending plans, I am not sure that they have thought through the implications. If one takes, for example, the spending on the health service, it has been growing at 3 per cent. per annum, and yet the health service faces a crisis. In the next few years spending is going to grow at a much lower rate. It may be impossible to continue to spend as much on the health service as it needs, but to contain it within even tighter limits is a recipe for disaster. If that is to be done then one must re-think the relationship between the health service and the private sector. One may have to look again at the whole question of compulsory insurance. The principle of access for all irrespective of means is a sacred principle which must be preserved, but there may be other ways in which it can be promoted. In dealing with the rising drugs bill, it may well be that the market will have to play a greater role in setting the price of drugs and one may have to look at the Irish passport system to ensure that all those who need treatment can get it, irrespective of means.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para79"></a>My third reservation concerns the Government's attitude on justice. The Chancellor has quite a lot of leeway in achieving his objectives. The income which has come in to the Government is higher than expected and spending is somewhat lower than expected. In seeking to be cautious, there is no reason why he should stick to every single target which the previous government set themselves. Government, understandably, has abandoned the aim of equality, though perhaps to a greater degree than I should like to see, but the Government claim that they are concerned with justice. However, where is the justice in removing up to &#163;11 a week from lone parents, some of whom are the poorest people in the land? The policy of trying to get people from welfare on to work is a very sensible policy, but many single mothers cannot work. In many cases there is no work for them in the area in which they live. Many of them should not work in their particular circumstances. Many of them are quite incapable of doing a job. Are they to be penalised? It is not as if the whole edifice of fiscal discipline is going to come <P>


<a name="column_1422"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>crashing down if the cuts of up to &#163;11 per week were not imposed on single mothers. Frankly, this is a measure of which they should be ashamed. I hope that their Back-Benchers revolt in droves, and I hope they frustrate this ridiculous, shameful measure.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para80"></a>My last comment is about the new regime for savings. The savings regime in this country is in a mess, and savings treatment by taxation is often inconsistent. It was to some extent made worse by the Government's measures on the taxation of pensions, but the individual savings accounts, the ISAs, do lessen distortion and make the system fairer. It was always absurd that small liquid deposits in banks and building society accounts should be excluded from the tax advantages of TESSAs and PEPs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para81"></a>The Government are right, in my view, to widen the base of the whole range of savings and treat more savings alike. It also seems to me that the Government are right to have no requirement for a minimum holding period because those who cannot afford, or have not felt they can afford, TESSAs and those who probably have not had a higher enough income to invest in shares and go for PEPs--and the people who hold their savings in building societies--are on the whole the less well off sections of society. They need certain precautionary balances. They need to be able to draw on their savings from time to time and so the Government are right not to have a minimum holding period.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para82"></a>The Government are also right to limit the costs, because, having taken the measures they did, these could be enormous. They are right to limit annual contributions and to impose an overall limit, although possibly a &#163;50,000 limit is somewhat on the low side. If that had not been done there would have been a massive quick move into tax havens with savings which would be made in any event. So on the whole I welcome the new individual saving accounts wholeheartedly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para83"></a>However, I have one worry. This may be yet one other example of piecemeal reform. It may make for a more sensible form of particular kinds of savings, but one has to look at other savings, too. I hope that in due course the Government will abolish mortgage tax relief and the anomalous exemption from tax of lump sums payable as pension benefits. At the moment there are a host of working parties. There is the party on long-term care; there is the working party on tax and benefits; and of course there is the major review being undertaken on stakeholder pensions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para84"></a>These individual savings accounts are bound to affect what happens to pensions. If the second tier, privately funded stakeholder pension is made compulsory, as I think it should be--and I advocated that recently in this House--there is bound to be a conflict with other forms of savings such as individual savings accounts. With the 10 per cent. tax credits which will be allowed in these accounts on United Kingdom dividends, you will have a more favourable regime for individual savings accounts than you will almost certainly have for stakeholder pensions. Inconsistency is inevitable, if you look at these questions piecemeal. They should be looked at as a whole, and it is the failure to look at these things as a whole and instead produce reforms piecemeal, which is my other source of worry.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Desai: </B>   My Lords, let me first of all congratulate my noble friend Lord Currie of Marylebone on having introduced this debate in a very deep and serious way. He has posed certain questions which we have to address today. Like the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, I have been surprised by the unforeseen circumstances of the Statement. I shall stay as long as I can but I may not be able to stay until the very end of the debate. I apologise for that but it is an unfortunate circumstance.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para85"></a>Like many other noble Lords, I intend to deal with the business cycle issues raised by the Green Budget Statement, and then I shall say something about the related topics of EMU and the individual savings account. It seems to me that the Chancellor is right to introduce a consultative document and it is right for us to have a debate, as my noble friend Lord Barnett, said. If we merely stand up and agree with him we are doing him an injustice, and therefore I shall actually disagree in parts because my areas of agreement with the Chancellor are well known.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para86"></a>Let me first of all say that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has confirmed the golden rule. That is very good and I have been trying to argue even in the pages of Tribune for many years, that the golden rule is a sound principle of public finance. What worries me about the Green Budget is that, if you look carefully at the numbers for this year and next year, as I pointed out when my noble friend Lord McIntosh read out the Statement on that occasion, we seem this year to be not hitting the golden rule in that, partly due to inheritance, we have borrowed more than the capital spending limit, and next year we seem to be following a super golden rule in the sense that capital investment is now about &#163;9.5 billion and the PSBR is around &#163;4.5 billion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para87"></a>Given the fact that this year we are running an economy at the peak of the cycle and next year, by the Treasury's own forecast, we are going to slow down, this seems to me to be the wrong combination. I remember saying before the July Budget that at the top of the cycle we must produce a surplus. That is the only sound principle of public finance I can think of. Although the Chancellor did do quite a bit in this respect, in my view he did not do enough. Had he taken a lot more spending out of the economy--and he might have had justification in trying what I call the Italian trick of taxing the windfall gains of the owners of building society shares and restoring them maybe in 2001, just to even out the cycle. That would have been sound public finance, not to say good politics.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para88"></a>If he had done that, the pressure on the Bank of England to operate on the monetary policy side would have been that much less and we would have had fewer increases in the rate of interest. Like the noble Lord, Lord Higgins--whose speech I admired--I think the rate of interest is a somewhat blunt instrument which acts with delay. I have never believed that that by itself can control inflation. Central banks which sign contracts to control inflation by the use of that <P>


<a name="column_1424"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1424</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>one weapon need their heads examined. I would not do that if I was appointed Governor of the Bank of England--a very unlikely prospect.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para89"></a>Given what we have now got--and I say this with as many qualifications as possible--we may be getting into a position that the Chancellor wants to avoid. As my noble friend Lord Currie said, we cannot eliminate the business cycle, but we can stop exacerbating it. Compared to the projected growth rate this year, we are going to grow faster. Looking at the growth projections based on fiscal year, not on calendar year, the Chancellor's document predicts a halving of the growth rate from 3&#189; per cent. to 1&#190; per cent. That is a big reduction in the growth rate.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para90"></a>Again qualified by all sorts of caveats, my fear is that, given the strength of the exchange rate and the rise in interest rates which we have already had--and I do not see why this will not continue because, if you hold the Bank of England responsible for just targeting inflation, that is all it will do; that is its job--we may have a bigger slow down in the growth rate next year. So we may tilt the cycle; bigger boom this year, bigger recession next year. That is something we should try to avoid.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para91"></a>Although this year is more or less gone and there is very little we can do in this year, the &#163;5 billion underspend which is scheduled for next year is definitely something that the Chancellor should look at very carefully to see whether there are a number of things on which he could relax a little. This is an underspend which, if fulfilled, would not be violating the Maastricht criteria--indeed, the PSBR would be about 1 and a bit per cent. off the GDP. It is not profligacy; it is prudence. I am not advocating profligacy--as noble Lords know, I am rather a hard man in fiscal terms--but from a fiscal point of view the right thing to do would be to keep that coming, especially if we expect the economy to slow down. If we expect that, it is up to us to do something now so that that is avoided next year.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para92"></a>The whole welfare-to-work programme is based on an assumption that the labour market will remain tight; that there will be jobs out there for people to do if only they have skills and receive suitable advice from jobcentres or whatever. At the moment it is all right. We have had falling unemployment since about the first quarter of 1993--except for a month here or there, we have had unemployment falling for four years--but given a predicted growth rate of 1&#190; per cent. for next year, by about the second half of 1998/first half of 1999, that situation will be fundamentally reversed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para93"></a>One does not need a sophisticated model to predict that; that is what will happen--especially if the competitive pressures on British business are such that the productivity growth cannot slow down. But if you have a productivity rate of roughly 2&#189; to 3 per cent., and if you have a growth rate of 1&#190; per cent., by and large we know what will happen. Given that fact, the whole welfare-to-work programme requires a much smoother running economy, because the moment when these people are trained will be exactly the moment when the job market becomes flat.

<A NAME = "71203-07_para94"></a>I wish the policy luck. I have some reservations but I wish the policy luck. If we can do it, it will be very nice--but I do not think we can take it for granted that the job market will stay tight forever. There are a number of assumptions on which this policy is based but, given the projections we have, I doubt very much that the job market will stay tight. What will happen is that the people we are currently preparing for the job market will be last in, first out.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para95"></a>While we are trying the welfare-to-work programme, we must leave in reserve the existing arrangements which are meant to look after people who have longer spells of unemployment than we would like. We should not abandon the old welfare system so totally that we move to a condition where, if you do not work, you do not get any welfare. It may well turn out that, even with the best will in the world and the best supply-side policies, there may not be the demand. If there is not the demand, then we cannot blame the unemployed for being unemployed. They may not be workshy; there may be no work for them to be shy of. That is something I would very much emphasise with this policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para96"></a>Finally, I come to the individual savings accounts. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Taverne. For many years I have said that we ought to move to an expenditure tax and away from an income tax. It is crying out to be done. Every good-thinking economist has said that we should have an expenditure tax and not an income tax and yet somehow we cannot do it except by all sorts of inventive things with interesting titles like TESSAs, PEPs and ISAs. The point is very simple. We should be taxing consumption; we should not be taxing income. That way we exclude savings from being taxed. I do not know when we will get to that stage, we will just have to wait.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para97"></a>I have one reservation which perhaps I can put in the form of a question to my noble friend on the Front Bench. I am not very familiar with these sorts of things, but it worries me when things are sold over supermarket counters. I do not know who will be selling these individual savings accounts. Our experience with personal pensions is not very good, and the kind of people we are trying to attract into the savings phenomenon may not have the time or the expertise to look at the contracts very carefully. Who in the FSA will be looking after the new savings accounts? Now that the PIA has merged into the FSA, who in the FSA is controlling these instruments and making sure that we do not have a repeat of the personal pensions saga? I do not know whether the PIA or its successor was consulted about this or not, but that is enough disagreement for the day.

<A NAME="71203-07_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Montague of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, when I knew that I was to speak on the economic prospects of the nation, my first thought was to ask myself, "What are our prospects?" and I looked back on my commercial career when the prospects of this nation were forever being damaged by balance of payment crises. The answer to that problem seemed to be our discovery of oil and gas. So I thought that the first thing to do was to telephone a few friends to try to find out just how <P>


<a name="column_1426"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1426</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>long that revenue is likely to last. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that the latest estimate is that the reserves might last until 2050. I was amazed at that, because I remembered hearing that the downturn might be as soon as the year 2000. My first source of comfort, therefore, is that, according to the experts, we have a long period of oil and gas revenues before us.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para98"></a>I turn now to the pre-Budget report. I do not know where that title came from, because we are really talking about a consultative period prior to the Budget. I should first like to consider the timing of the pre-Budget report, and of the Budget, because the change in timing is most important. Business people know that the most critical selling period is the Christmas period. Retailers build up their stocks. Nothing could be more damaging to business than to have a Budget in bad times at this vital period. Therefore, it is excellent that the Budget has been deferred until the spring. I hope that that change will be permanent. I do not have sufficient parliamentary knowledge at this stage of my life in your Lordships' House to know whether the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is right that there are parliamentary considerations to be taken into account. However, from a business point of view, I very much welcome the fact that the Budget will be in the spring.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para99"></a>There has been some criticism and debate about whether the Chancellor is being sufficiently cautious or too cautious in the current circumstances. Perhaps I may draw your Lordships' attention to one or two points which have not yet arisen. We are told that it is marvellous that the PSBR will be &#163;9.5 billion. Yes, it is marvellous, but it is not exactly natural. Only yesterday the House discussed the Education (Student Loans) Bill, when we were reminded that the Bill seeks only to sell off the accumulated student debt at a very great discount so that &#163;1.5 billion this year and &#163;1.6 billion next year will be taken into the PSBR. So, an asset sale can have that effect. We know that the Ministry of Defence has done the same with its housing stock. That has been sold off at a great discount. We therefore have two lump sums to consider. I repeat that that flow is not exactly natural and the position is exacerbated slightly by the National Lottery. Your Lordships may wonder how the National Lottery can exacerbate the position, so I shall tell you. The National Lottery has cash in the bank at this immediate moment amounting to over &#163;3 billion. That money is taken as a credit into the PSBR. Whether that is right or wrong is open to consideration, but I can tell your Lordships that that is the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para100"></a>That is why I am not sure that the economy is quite as rosy as some would have us believe. The noble Lord, Lord Boardman, said that after 18 years of Conservative government the economy is in a magnificent state. The noble Lord will remember that there were two terrible recessions in those 18 years. I think that we should be wise to reconsider the position. I do not suggest that we are sailing on the "Titanic", but I am not sure that all is total glory, and I am pleased that the Chancellor is being cautious.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para101"></a>Our exporters tell us of their pain at present as a result of the strong exchange rate. We should give some consideration to that point. What we need are more new products and more innovation in this country. Our <P>


<a name="column_1427"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1427</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>manufacturers can do more if only they would invest more in research and development. Some in this House would be dismayed to know that, expressed as a percentage of turnover, our great country comes bottom of the league for research and development. We should look to the future with more confidence if we were at the top, but we are not; we are at the bottom.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para102"></a>What should we do about it? We already allow research and development expenditure to be set against taxation. In Australia, Canada, France, Japan and the USA there are special measures to ensure that more is spent on research and development. Only one industry in this country spends a good level of money on research and development and that is the pharmaceutical industry. It is a wonderful industry. Let us hope that the Chancellor will act in the coming Budget to influence companies to spend more on research and development.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para103"></a>Perhaps I may refer now to capital gains tax because the Chancellor has said, "This is the consultation period and these are the things that I would like you to think about. What are your views?" One area on which he has invited us to comment is capital gains tax. My first point is that we do not raise very much from that tax--only about &#163;1 billion--so it is not a great source of income. However, that &#163;1 billion results in quite adverse effects on those who have to compute their capital gains tax, particularly when it comes to decisions about, for example, selling a business. If you have created your own business and you come to sell it, and go to an accountant and ask, "How much tax will I have to pay?", he will say, "I can't tell you that. It will take two or three years to work it out with the Revenue". That is hardly satisfactory. Again, those who want to calculate capital gains tax for other reasons have to go back to a base date of 1982. That is becoming increasingly ridiculous as the years go by. I suggest that in formulating the forthcoming Budget the Chancellor should urgently consider getting rid of the inflation allowance and base capital gains tax on the current date.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para104"></a>Other noble Lords have terminated their speeches with references to savings. I very much welcome the Chancellor's new savings instrument, particularly as I am what is called a "trickle-up man" and not a "trickle-down man". I have never believed that when you give a lot of money to people who already have a lot of money they will go out and spend it. I wonder how many National Lottery winners have spent all their money. Not many, I hope. That is not the way life works. If we could get everybody at the bottom to spend a little more, the country would do a lot better.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para105"></a>Returning to the new savings instrument which the Chancellor has just announced, I notice that today's newspapers have concentrated on what they describe as a terrible feature. They say that it will be unfair to many people who have bought PEPs and who, above a certain amount, will lose part of their gains. I know Gordon Brown. He is a sensible fellow and very fair. I telephoned his office to find out whether what the newspapers have said is indeed the case, and I am pleased to tell the House that I am absolutely assured that it is not the case. All existing gains will be honoured.

<A NAME = "71203-07_para106"></a>I have great confidence in this Chancellor. He is a prudent and a careful man. Furthermore, because of our oil and gas revenues and the ingenuity of our manufacturing industry, I have confidence in the prospects for the economy. Perhaps I may conclude on my earlier point about innovation: let us spend more money on research and development and on new products.

<A NAME="71203-07_spnew15"></A><B> Viscount Caldecote: </B>   My Lords, in my view the economic prospects of this country are indeed good, but that is not because of what this Government have done in the past six months. Judgment of their policies will come in a few years' time when we see whether these good prospects have come to fruition. The fact is that our good prospects are due to 18 years of good Conservative government and to our record over that time in enormously improving productivity and competitiveness. Perhaps most important of all, we rekindled a spirit of enterprise and initiative, and improved industrial relations. Of course there is more to do. There must be greater emphasis on increasing the output of our manufacturing industry and its share of world trade. That is the key objective. All other objectives, such as improving competitiveness and productivity, are means to that end and should be so regarded.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para107"></a>In the Chancellor's pre-Budget review I was very pleased to see a reference to the importance of investment in R&D and innovation. I appreciate that R&D is internationally recognised as a measure for comparing levels of innovative investment. However, as I have often said in your Lordships' House, research is very different from development. It is different in risk, cost, market dependence and the outlook of those who carry it out. I was delighted to hear in the speeches of the noble Lords, Lord Ezra and Lord Montague, emphasis on the importance of greater investment. The key to our future prosperity is greater investment in the design and development of new products and processes for sale in world markets.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para108"></a>I should like to ask the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, who is to reply to this debate, what action Her Majesty's Government intend to take to stimulate such investment which requires a long-term outlook that is foreign to the ethos of too many companies? In particular, what progress do the Government believe they are making in filling the gap of high risk early stage investment from &#163;100,000 to &#163;1 million which is so important in getting new ideas developed by small companies? That range of investment is not attractive to venture capital companies and some other way must be devised to find a source of such investment. In past years there has been a good deal of talk of business angels; that is, people who put relatively small (to them) sums into this kind of investment. That is good, but there are not enough business angels. How do the Government intend to attract more of them and create investment in that area?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para109"></a>Too many of our industries have declined, lost market share or even disappeared for lack of innovative investment. A glaring and tragic example is our once great shipbuilding industry. It was decimated in the <P>


<a name="column_1429"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1429</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>1980s by a misunderstanding of the future prospects of that great industry. That led to wrong policy decisions and the closing of many shipyards. Shipbuilding was wrongly regarded by my noble friend Lady Thatcher and her government as great hunks of steel with the addition of some equipment and engines. In reality today's ships are giant systems similar to aircraft. The hull is a relatively small component of the cost. Ships are filled with electrical, electronic and mechanical equipment, much of it under computer control. It is also a fact that for so far ahead as any of us or our grandchildren can see 90 per cent. of our overseas trade will be carried in ships, most of it in container ships. The tragedy is that we build none of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para110"></a>There are now nearly 2,000 large container ships in service. In 1996 there were 339 ships ordered or under construction. Of these, more than 50 are being built in Germany and more than 50 in Poland. None is being built in the UK. Today there are even bigger vessels called PANAMAX ships in excess of 100,000 gross registered tonnes which can carry 5,000 containers. Those ships do not need to go through the Panama Canal and so are not limited in size by that requirement. Over 80 of them are now being built or are on order: 12 in Denmark; eight in Germany but none in the UK. There are also huge luxurious cruise ships of 100,000 gross registered tonnes or more. They have replaced the great transatlantic liners in previous days, such as the "Queen Mary", the "Queen Elizabeth", and so on. Thirty-two are now being built or are ordered: 12 in Italy; nine in Germany; five each in Finland and France, but none in the UK. It is tragic--and well-nigh incredible--that a great maritime nation like Britain is building none of these great ships. They are full of mechanical, electrical and electronic equipment that would be of enormous value to our maritime equipment industry. Think what it would mean in employment and exports if we built just a few of these ships like other European countries. It is incredible that our friends in Europe, in Germany, Finland and Denmark where rates of pay are not very different from here--I do not speak about the Far East where different outlooks and wage levels apply--can build these great ships which would be of such enormous value to our economy but we cannot.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para111"></a>I ask the Minister whether the Government will review the future prospects of the shipbuilding industry. Will they consider ways in which Britain, which is so dependent on ships, can regain its share of this lucrative market, probably by partnership between the public and private sectors? I hope that the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, will not hark back to those mistaken policies of the previous government that I have often criticised. I hope that he replies constructively to the questions that I have raised. They raise important long-term issues of enormous significance to the prosperity of our country.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para112"></a>In conclusion, this has been an important, useful and interesting debate. However, it is rather sad that the great majority of speeches have been concerned with straight economics. With the happy exception of the speeches of the noble Lord, Lord Montague, and one or two other noble Lords, very little reference has been made to where the real wealth of this country is created. Much of it is created in manufacturing industry. If we <P>


<a name="column_1430"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1430</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are to have long term prosperity and high levels of employment we must pay more attention to our manufacturing industry. I hope that the new Government will take that to heart and do all that they can to assist manufacturing industry, particularly shipbuilding, to recover the markets that they have lost over the years.

<A NAME="71203-07_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Randall of St. Budeaux: </B>   My Lords, I begin by thanking my noble friend Lord Currie for tabling the debate today. This debate on the economy is different from others in the past in both Houses of Parliament. What makes this economic debate different? I believe that the answer is very simple. Two or three weeks ago a Statement which was made in the other place by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and repeated in this House made it quite clear that the Labour Government would take Britain, with the consent of the people, into the single currency. So, businesses and ordinary people now know where they stand. The bulk of the uncertainty has been removed and preparations for the adoption for the single currency can proceed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para113"></a>I believe that not only is it firmly in the national interest for Britain to enter the euro currency zone but that it should do so as soon as possible. By failing to join in the first wave, Britain's influence may be diminished in formulating policy. For example, the whole of the central bank structure is now being planned without Britain being fully involved. That is just unacceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para114"></a>We saw the concerns of our EU partners at the Brussels ECOFIN this Monday. Questions arose as to whether Britain would have a seat in the policy meetings, and whether we should have the right to vote. At the moment, that is still unresolved. We must maximise our influence in those important policy forums so that our national interests are pursued. That is how the EU works.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para115"></a>As a parallel, it is worth recalling what happened to the CAP because we were unable to influence its formation. It could reasonably be argued that British farming is the most productive and competitive in the world. It employs about 2 per cent. of our national workforce. Our temperate and wet climate adds to the success of British farming. Yet we still have a CAP which is unsuited to the interests and needs of British farming and the British economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para116"></a>The CAP is more suited to the farming industries of France and Germany. Why is that? It is just because France and Germany were members of the Common Market and were thus able to negotiate during the CAP formation and to protect their own national interests. Britain, by contrast, was on the outside and lost out. The same argument applies to Britain joining the EMU. We must not fail with the EMU as we did with the CAP.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para117"></a>The positive message sent to the EU just two or three days after the Labour Government came into power has unquestionably helped strengthen relations between Britain and the rest of the EU. Other positive steps have also helped. However our partners are looking forward to commitment by us to the EU in the form of early and full participation in the development of the EMU. Hesitation on the sidelines must be a thing of the past.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para118"></a>In 1986, the then Conservative government, under the leadership of the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, adopted the treaty which took Britain into the single market. That treaty resulted in a huge leap in the level of European integration--far more integration than has ever ensued from the later treaties of Maastricht and Amsterdam.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para119"></a>I welcomed that, not just because it led to further constructive development of the EU but because the economic benefits to Britain of the single market have been enormous. Growth of British trade with the EU 15 has soared, resulting in more jobs, increased profits and, importantly, business investment. The single market has been a remarkable success story for Britain, although there is still more work to be done to complete it. I have always believed that the European single market could never be complete without a single currency.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para120"></a>The case for the single currency is overwhelmingly strong. Yet opinion polls suggest that the people feel ignorant about it all. However, the good news is that those polls show that the public also wishes to learn more about the EMU. The strongest supporters are the young people and businesses. Clearly the message regarding the advantages and disadvantages has not been communicated to the public, so there is an important task to be done there.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para121"></a>The single currency will be a vital instrument in helping the Government meet their key economic objectives, which are more economic growth, more jobs and economic stability. If the Government can meet those objectives, then the enormous problem of funding the escalating costs of social policy in the future can be eased somewhat.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para122"></a>On the other hand, the Government's policies--for example, welfare to work--are crucial, bearing in mind that the costs of social policy are not only high but have, on aggregate, high growth rate projections, due largely to the fact that we have an ageing population which requires increasingly costly support services. What makes the funding of social policy so complex is the fact that the sums of money required are so large that they cannot be funded entirely through direct taxation. There are two reasons for that. First, the public no longer likes the idea of paying large amounts of direct tax; secondly, if direct taxes were to be raised substantially, that would have the effect of damping down job creation, which takes place predominantly in businesses employing few people--perhaps between one and five people.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para123"></a>That of course contradicts one of the Government's key economic policies of job creation. So other ways of funding social policy have to be found. The Government seem to be working hard on that. Mr. Frank Field MP has been drafted into the Government to think the unthinkable about how to fund the more expensive parts of social policy. At the same time, wealth generation through increased economic growth remains a key economic objective of the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para124"></a>One of the advantages of joining the EMU is that there will be a greater chance of achieving higher economic growth, which could contribute to funding <P>


<a name="column_1432"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1432</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>social policy. For some time, Labour Party policy has been economic efficiency and social justice. The euro must be a success. That means that the euro must be a hard currency. To have a single currency that is overly vulnerable to speculation would be unacceptable. Therefore we must have good monetary and economic discipline.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para125"></a>What do I expect from the single currency? One way of putting it is that I want businesses, especially small ones, in places such as Hull, to be able to trade as easily with businesses in Rotterdam as they currently can with businesses in Leeds or Manchester. There are still enormous impediments which stifle trade within the EU. The biggest impediment is transacting business in different currencies. Within the euro-currency zone we can expect to have a reduction in the cost of changing money, which currently amounts to a trade tax of about &#163;3 billion per annum.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para126"></a>Secondly, exchange rates will be more stable. Then we could see price cutting because consumers will be more easily able to compare product prices. That will apply especially to cars. Lower interest rates will arrive, and we shall obtain the big benefit of a 1 per cent. to 2 per cent. reduction in interest rates for long-term money, because the market's fears of inflation will be diminished. I hope, too, that we shall see an end to the boom-bust economics which have so dogged the British economy for 40 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para127"></a>Our competitors in the EU have enjoyed lower interest rates and lower inflation, and have been able to sustain a good economic performance. With the European central bank we should be able to build on that record of good economic performance to the benefit of Britain.

<A NAME="71203-07_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, today's debate has centred around the economic prospects of the nation. In that respect, the issue of the single currency has no relevance whatever--at any rate, for the time being. I shall refer to my noble friend's speech later.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para128"></a>It has been a puzzling debate, almost reminiscent of our debates on the Maastricht Treaty. At that time we had a coalition of the then Labour Opposition and the then Conservative Government. They were united in their support for the main provisions of the treaty. I observe that today some minor skirmishing over the social chapter and the relevance or otherwise of the minimum wage has taken its usual form. But in the main, the House as a whole appears to agree that the economy is sound.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para129"></a>References have been made to a possible inheritance of one or two adverse factors. My Government have been accused of unjustly blaming the party opposite for having left some dubious legacies, but, in general, that accusation has lacked force. The House has resumed almost exactly the unanimity of the debates on the Maastricht Treaty.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para130"></a>During my long political life I have learnt to be most suspicious when governments and opposition parties are agreed on anything. Because of a factual ignorance on both sides, matters almost always end up in a joint conspiracy to deceive the public. I am not saying that <P>


<a name="column_1433"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1433</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that is happening today, but anyone who says that the British economy or its prospects are sound wants his brains examining. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para131"></a>My noble friend Lord Barnett, who unhappily is not in the Chamber, gave the most devastating reasons for that. He pointed out that on the Government's own forecast their programme for growth during the next four or five years is virtually non-existent and will in the ultimate result in a decline in economic activity in the United Kingdom. He made his case persuasively. Indeed, the more I listened to him the more I said to myself, "Bruce, this guy is coming around to your point of view on these matters". His criticism was quite devastating.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para132"></a>Likewise, my noble friend Lord Desai almost repeated what he wrote in the Observer on 17th August. I gave him notice that I would mention his article. He stated:

<A NAME = "71203-07_para133"></a>Perhaps he has learnt a little since 17th August, because it has become abundantly clear that the distorted strength of sterling in both the mark and dollar markets is one of the reasons why the balance of trade is sharply deteriorating. If my noble friend Lord Barnett, who is very experienced in these matters, is to be believed, it is likely to continue to do so. How can anyone describe an economy with large-scale unemployment as "sound"?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para134"></a>The figures are damming. We are not dealing with a figure of some 300,000 unemployed, as we were until the quadrupling of the price of oil in 1974. We are dealing with unemployment at a level of 2,822,000, according to the latest figures. I know that the earlier figure is preferred by some people; an adopted figure which refers to claimants of unemployment relief and not to the real number of unemployed. There is a prediction that there might be a downturn in economic activity later this year. My noble friend Lord Desai expressed some misgivings about a slowdown, as he did in the article to which I referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para135"></a>We now have a situation in which, if unemployment falls significantly below 2,800,000, inflation is bound to result. That is the logic of the situation. Is that really tenable? The answer is simple; that there are not the employment opportunities at current capacity levels, plus any anticipated addition to manufacturing capacity in particular, to be able to absorb any labour that is released or propelled under the new welfare-to-work process. The programme of welfare-to-work is excellent. At this stage, I shall refrain from making any more observations about the helpless people against whom the penalties have been directed. I shall return to the matter on a later occasion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para136"></a>We are saying that our economy has reached the stage when professional economists, bankers and so forth can say that, if unemployment falls significantly below 2,800,000, inflation will result. That is a great deal of <P>


<a name="column_1434"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1434</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nonsense. Anyone who knows anything about economics on a practical basis--not on the theoretical and academic side--knows that to be true.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para137"></a>Why should it be so? According to noble friends of the ilk of my noble friend Lord Randall, Europe and our participation in it has been a success. We find the clear reasons not from any prejudiced person such as me but from the European Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs, Padraig Flynn. He states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Present policies have failed and each year our present policies result in two million people being added to the long term unemployed in Europe". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para138"></a>That is the verdict of the commissioner. What is he blaming? He is blaming the inflationary policies laid down in the Maastricht Treaty. They were laid down in a way that has restricted economic development not only in Europe but in this country, too. People can sing and dance as much as they like about the benefits of the single market. I shall quote from them: unemployment in Europe as a whole has gone up by 5 million since the Maastricht Treaty, despite all the alleged successes.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para139"></a>It is not only a question of unemployment; it a question of social cohesion. Ultimately, all economic activity depends on social organisation and the working of one group of people with another in either a locality or a factory. All economic activity is essentially social in nature. It must be so because of the division of labour. People must work with one another even to produce a single item.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para140"></a>Once social cohesion begins to be threatened, the whole base of the economy is threatened. One of the reasons why we were so successful in the last war was because of a feeling of elan, the feeling of confidence and even, to some extent, of pleasure and joy of working with one another for a specific aim. That relationship has progressively been poisoned by the existence of large scale unemployment, by injustice and by lack of housing. Indeed, the number of new houses being built has decreased by 50,000 a year compared with 1979. That has led to a progressive deterioration in housing stock and to the progressive constriction of the normal, legitimate aspirations of people--in other words, their hopes, ideals and dreams. So the relationship in the country in relation to its future prospects has become progressively sour.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para141"></a>It is not a situation which can be eliminated by pure jingoism or anything of that kind; but it is something to which a government must address themselves. There is one thing they could do when they get rid of the schizophrenic attitude towards house prices--on the one hand, they are not liked when they rise because they send inflation up but, on the other hand, they are not liked when they go down because of the threat of repossession. So the Government even have a split mind in that respect. What must--not could--be done on a completely non-inflationary basis would be the immediate enlargement of the entire housing programme in the United Kingdom. That would not need welfare-to-work schemes in order to get people skilled in the art of construction. It is one of those assembly operations in which the amount of skilled labour required is very limited. We shall ultimately be judged in this country as a government--and we, <P>


<a name="column_1435"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>possibly, as Members of this House will be judged if we fail to provide the impetus by urging the Government to do things that they can do, provided that they retain the power to do so.

<A NAME="71203-07_spnew18"></A><B> The Earl of Longford: </B>   My Lords, it is possible to see the arrangement of the speakers' list in this House as representing a descending scale of insignificance, or an ascending scale. I like to think of it as the latter. I am proud to be a postscript to my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington and the preface to my noble friend Lord Peston. I believe that we are really all part of an upward movement. I am particularly glad to follow my noble friend--and, if I may say so, my real friend-- Lord Bruce of Donington. Indeed, of all the friends I have, I feel that if he did not exist it would be necessary to invent him, for there would be no air of pugnacity in the House; we might be thought to be a sort of tea party. He brings some real hostility into the argument, which is all to the good.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para142"></a>When I was an under-graduate, I studied at Oxford officially what was known as "philosophy, politics and economics", which I believe is now known as PPE but was then usually called Modern Greats. I shall not inflict any philosophical views on the House tonight; but, in my few short remarks, I wish to submit that we cannot form a good assessment of the economic future of this country without reference to the political context.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para143"></a>It seems to be reasonable to assume that a Labour Government will be in power for quite a few years. I do not build extravagant hopes on that prospect. Many of us will recall--or, if not, many will have read about it, if they have not been through it--that the Liberal Government with a huge majority of 1906 had disappeared by 1910. Similarly, the Labour Government had such a majority in 1945 but had also disappeared by 1950. Therefore, one must not be unduly optimistic. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to think that the Labour Party in this country will be in power for quite a few years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para144"></a>That would have been a very grim prospect both in the City and in industry, when I was chairman of one of the small clearing banks between 1955 and 1963. I am not qualified to speak about industry from first-hand experience, unless one counts the publishing industry. But that is generally not considered in that light. In those eight years as chairman, I spent most days in the City and never met a Labour sympathiser--at least, no one was open about it. There may have been a few cryptos; but, if so, they did not talk about it until later when Labour won in 1964.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para145"></a>I remind myself that, as chairman of a clearing bank, I achieved the unprecedented feat of being blackballed from the City club. It was politely put to me that it was done on political grounds; but of course it may have been for other reasons, we cannot be too sure. In any case, that was the atmosphere in the City some 30 years ago. But now what do we see? All is sweetness and light among the Government, the City and business. Long <P>


<a name="column_1436"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>may it remain so! It is good news for the country and for the economy. If that goes on indefinitely, no doubt it will help to ensure that the economic future is bright.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para146"></a>However, can we assume that the situation will be quite as happy as that indefinitely? Although the ideals of the various political parties may become dormant, we must remember that they do not die. I was personal assistant to Sir William Beveridge for three years when he produced the welfare plan which was officially accepted by all parties at the end of the war. But when Sir William approached a former patron, the then Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and asked for an interview, the latter did not think the moment propitious. He was too busy with the war. In due course, Winston Churchill reappeared as Conservative Prime Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para147"></a>Again, the King's Norton Labour Party was suspended during the war for breaking the party truce. My wife was then the candidate. It was not her fault. It was part of a misfortune at the time. The Labour Party was suspended for breaking the truce. But what happened in 1945? King's Norton was won for Labour by 12,000 votes, although, by that time, my wife had retired and had four children. We must realise that what may appear to be unanimity does not necessarily last forever.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para148"></a>This Government are very popular. I am very glad that they are. All old timers like myself are delighted with the Labour victory; we are full of hope and encouragement, with confidence in the leaders of new Labour. However, we realise that during the war there was unanimity in pursuit of the common victory and that that disappeared after the war. Therefore, we cannot think of this happy situation going on for ever.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para149"></a>So what do I look forward to? Well, I am unashamedly old Labour. I am old enough. If one is not old at 92, I do not know when one is. The noble Lord, Lord Soper, is a little older but apart from him I believe that I may be one of the oldest Labour people. Although it is true that I started life as a Conservative, 62 years in the party--it may be only 61; I have rather lost track of it over the years--qualifies one to be old Labour.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para150"></a>We welcome new Labour, but what we always look for is a policy which can be considered worthy of real Labour. That is what we shall expect eventually. We realise that we are inhibited for two years by the understandable election manifesto, but the time will come when real Labour will assert itself. When I say "real Labour" I do not mean some extreme Leftist policy, certainly nothing based on Marxism and not even based particularly on nationalisation which I do not think will play a large part in the future, but something that reasserts the traditional Labour demand for social justice. That involves some redistribution of wealth which cannot be effected in the next two years under manifesto pledges. However, that demand will not die; it will reassert itself.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para151"></a>The traditional Labour demand for social justice draws its inspiration from various sources. I rely particularly on the Christian inspiration; but there are others. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, represents worthily a humanist tradition and no doubt he will reassert it in his final remarks today. Whether the <P>


<a name="column_1437"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1437</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inspiration is Christian, humanist or whatever, that insistent demand for social justice will not disappear. Some years from now there will be a new situation. Will this most welcome partnership between the Labour Government on the one hand and the City and business on the other continue? I hope and believe that it will. I and all my friends have the utmost confidence in the present leaders of the party. I believe they are establishing a new relationship with the City and industry which will last when the real ideals of the Labour Party are reasserted a few years from now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I join with other noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lord Currie for his excellent introduction to this interesting debate. I echo those noble Lords who congratulated the maiden speakers on their contributions. The only new Peer who left me slightly worried was the noble Lord, Lord Jacobs. If we confine ourselves to speaking only on subjects we know something about, your Lordships will need to meet only one afternoon a week, if that!
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para152"></a>In making a contribution to this debate I wish to present as balanced a view as possible. I shall not say that everything that happened before 1st May was wrong and that everything my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has done, or is about to do, is right. We should recognise that the previous Chancellor acted well and honestly according to his lights, and the incoming Labour Government for the first time in our history was left an economy which, although it has some problems, was not in a state of disaster and did not need immediate crisis management. Somewhat cynically, I am mystified how that happened, but it did.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para153"></a>I cannot refrain from remarking that historians of the future may come to remark on an ultimate irony. I can even envisage the A-level history question; namely, that the Conservative Party tore itself apart, even destroyed itself for a generation, while laying the economic and financial foundation which enabled the Labour Government to meet the conditions for entry to European monetary union and to proceed with such entry reasonably quickly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para154"></a>In debating our economic prospects, we mean both our long run performance and also what is likely to happen in the next year or two. Our long run performance is determined largely but not entirely by so-called "real forces"--investment in plant and people, technology, enterprise, managerial skills and the like. There is no room for disagreement on that. The Government have got off to an excellent start in achieving our desired aims. We may disagree on the scale of the role of government but I am clear that our differences lie within the range of reasonable discourse. We must also all recognise that there is no pot of gold. If we want to have a high standard of living, we must choose to be economically efficient. That is the case whether or not we take into account international competition. But, overwhelmingly, in a world of free trade and free capital movement, if we choose erroneous policies we shall be unproductive, poor and dependent <P>


<a name="column_1438"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1438</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on others. If we choose the right policies, we shall be productive, independent and able to pay ourselves high real wages.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para155"></a>I use the word "we" advisedly. The failure of the so-called "trickle down" theory in the past decade has been truly shocking. It is a central task of the new Government to reverse the trend in which the poor did not participate in economic advance. Of course, where that is possible, the poor wish to be full members of the economy and of our society and earn their own incomes. The Government are to be congratulated on endeavouring to create circumstances in which that will happen. The restoration of full employment is absolutely central to that aim. But for quite a while there will be many people disadvantaged in all sorts of ways who need help. A country as rich as ours--I emphasise the words "as rich as ours"--can afford to give such help. I for one have no difficulty in advocating progressive and redistributive taxation to achieve that end. In that connection, I add en passant how much I agree with the Chancellor's brilliant initiative on the new individual savings accounts and, of course, with the Government's policy on the minimum wage. I had much to say about the minimum wage but the contribution of my noble friend Lord Davies of Coity was so masterly that there is nothing left for me or any other noble Lord to add on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para156"></a>We have a problem of short-term management which is not easy to solve. That is clearly seen both in the pre-Budget document and the Bank of England inflation report. Demand is rising more rapidly than the underlying rate of growth and although nothing catastrophic has yet occurred something needs to be done sooner rather than later. I suppose that is the rationale behind the tightening of interest rates, and why the market is expecting further tightening. The trouble with that is that we end up with sterling stronger--in my judgment, absurdly so--than is warranted by so-called fundamentals. Without being a slavish devotee of what is called purchasing power parity theory, one can still be worried about the pound's strength as it affects exports, and notably as it affects manufactures and the balance of payments.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para157"></a>However, if monetary policy is not made tighter, fiscal policy must be. I do not see many of my noble friends advocating cuts in public expenditure. We seem to have a new doctrine that has emerged--at least for the moment--that taxation must not be increased. I shall return to that theme in a moment. That means that my right honourable friend the Chancellor's position is not all that easy. It is made even more difficult by the likelihood that as demand converges on its sustainable equilibrium next year, unemployment will rise at least for a while. That means--as my noble friend Lord Desai has pointed out--that those who are being helped to become more employable by the Government's education and training policies will find it harder to get jobs and the whole purpose of the exercise could be defeated.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para158"></a>At the margin I would rather take a risk with inflation than employment, but I must emphasise the words "at the margin". There is a little room for manoeuvre here but not much. I do not believe that the economy will <P>


<a name="column_1439"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1439</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adjust automatically. Therefore we end up with the Chancellor being in the standard difficult position. The wrong policy mix and poor timing can make things worse. If the position deteriorates and he fails to act, he will not be able to say, "It had nothing to do with me".
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para159"></a>On that note, I turn to public expenditure and taxation. No one doubts that in the long run there are limits to the relative size of the national debt, and therefore to budget deficits. That would be so whether or not we had signed the Maastricht treaty or accepted Maastricht criteria. That does not mean that deficits should not vary over the cycle, as my noble friend Lord Currie has said. That is, incidentally, a problem which EMU has yet to face up to. But it means that, starting from the right average fiscal position, public expenditure must be tax financed. That obliges people like me who wish to see more spent on education and health to say how we shall pay for it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para160"></a>I was interested in the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. I was a great devotee of the unified budget. I gave several lectures on the subject, until I discovered that what I had considered important was the one thing that the Treasury would not allow. As regards the unified budget, the only matter of importance is that the other place and this House should be able to answer the following question: if you want to raise public expenditure, what else will you cut or what taxes will you increase? As we are not allowed to debate the unified budget we might as well forget about it. I say that with deep regret. I am not afraid to face those questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para161"></a>I know that for a while the restoration of full employment will reduce transfer payments and will release funds for other purposes. But that is only a temporary solution. In the long run the people of this country have a choice. Do they want a National Health Service and a public expenditure system financed by taxation; do they want user charges, tuition fees and the like; do they want private sector expansion; or do they simply want a continuing fall in standards of public service?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para162"></a>I despair of those who are afraid to make the choices and who complain when they need hospital treatment that the resources are not there when they themselves by their votes chose lower taxation instead. Equally, when people retire they say that they want the state pension to be linked to earnings. But when in work they voted for a party that destroyed that link.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para163"></a>All that is political. As noble Lords know that is not a subject I understand at all. However, I know that it is for my right honourable friends in another place to assess what the people want and what they are willing to pay for. I believe that the average person can be reasonable if the options are set out clearly. In particular, the average person can be reasonable if the Government themselves show leadership.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para164"></a>Perhaps I may say a few words on EMU. I entirely support my right honourable friend giving the Bank of England more independence. I look forward to analysing that when the proposed Bill comes before your Lordships' House. Noble Lords will be aware that <P>


<a name="column_1440"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1440</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on balance I favour joining EMU. But I also understand--I have addressed your Lordships on this matter--that many distinguished economists take the opposite view. Therefore it is a matter of balance.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para165"></a>I do not wish to go over those economic technicalities again this evening. I wish to advert to two related topics. One concerns timing. I know that it is now too late, but I wish that we had put ourselves in the position of being able to join EMU as founder members. It was difficult, if not impossible, for the new Government to take that decision so soon after taking power. It was even more impossible for their predecessors to take any rational decision on Europe in their last year. But EMU will happen and I do not wish to see us again carping from the sidelines. I am not too happy with the proposition that we should wait to see whether EMU is successful and then decide whether to join. If I may put it as simply and politely as I can, that is not the most courageous approach to economic policy making. As my noble friend Lord Randall, said, if we want to be taken seriously, once and for all we must end this business of joining when the main decisions have been taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para166"></a>The country may decide not to join EMU. I do not believe, given the leadership of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, that it will come to that view, but it might. The position of the party opposite for all practical purposes is that we should not join. In that case our place in the European Union becomes quite peripheral. In the long run the rational outcome would be to leave altogether. It is not clear whether the party opposite has thought through the consequences of the policy it has adopted. All I can say from my point of view, and from that of many of my noble friends, is that what noble Lords opposite propose on the subject would be disastrous for our country.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para167"></a>As an economist, it goes against the grain for me to say that the broad economic outlook is good--it sticks in my craw. But despite my professional pessimism, I am convinced that it is. But I conclude by emphasising that economic success is not an end in itself. We welcome economic success because it enables us to pursue other policies which are desirable; and in the eradication of poverty economic success enables us to do that which I regard as a moral imperative.

<A NAME="71203-07_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, in responding on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, perhaps I may say, first, that I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, that there is unanimity of approach between the Tory Party and the Labour Benches. Indeed, anyone winding up a speech on behalf of the Liberal Democrats must feel rather between the Scylla and Charybdis of the other two main parties. If we may call the noble Lord, Lord Boardman, the Scylla of the Tories, he seemed to reflect the specific approach that the Tories have taken to economic policy in this country over the past few years: that the crucial issue is how to lower the tax burden. The Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in another place, when responding to the Statement by the Chancellor last week, seemed to indicate that that was the only critical issue that the Government faced in their economic policy, and repeated the accusation--it was <P>


<a name="column_1441"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1441</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rehearsed again this evening by the noble Lord, Lord Boardman--about the 17 taxes that new Labour has put up since coming into office.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para168"></a>As an aside, perhaps I may say that the Tory Government record leaves no room for complacency despite their success in persuading the public over 18 years that reductions in taxation simply meant reductions in income tax. It is now well documented that over the 18 years of the Tory Government, tax as a proportion of GDP went up rather than down. In 1978-79, the first year of a Tory Government, taxation represented 34.3 per cent. of GDP. In the last year before they left office, taxation represented 35.8 per cent. of GDP. I think that the Tory obsession with taxation is incorrect, and their record leaves much to be desired.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para169"></a>On this side of the House we believe that the significant question for the British economy and for the Government is not what to do about taxation but whether at this stage of the economic cycle we have the right balance between taxation policies and public expenditure policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para170"></a>Following the classical analogy a little further, reference to sirens might be a better analogy. I am sure that in winding up on the part of the Government, the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, will indicate that the general stance the Government take will continue--that is, "Trust us, and we will deliver you the economic paradise that you seek". That will not be now, by the way, but probably at some stage round about the next election. I have some sympathy for new Labour with regard to the performance of my party since the election. We are in danger of becoming the Oliver Twist of British politics. Whatever concessions we achieve from new Labour, we always ask for more.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para171"></a>As regards the conduct of the Government's economic policy, perhaps I may indicate where we agree with them. There is a fairly long list. We agree with them on the idea of the publication of the Chancellor's pre-Budget paper--the Green Budget as it has been called. We shall in due course give our response to it. We agree with giving a greater degree of independence to the Bank of England. It is a policy we have long advocated. We agree with the code of fiscal stability which the Government have brought in. It is the natural companion of an operationally independent central bank. As my noble friend Lord Taverne indicated earlier, we agree in general principle with the announcement yesterday of the creation of Isas, although we would argue that perhaps the limits should be raised. In broad terms, we have welcomed extra money for pensions although we might target it differently, extra resources for childcare, and reduction of VAT on energy saving materials, for which my noble friend Lord Ezra, has campaigned for many years. We welcome the reform of the tax and benefits system to facilitate moving from welfare to work.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para172"></a>I suppose I should also say that we agree that in macro terms the fiscal stance that the Government are currently taking is about right. However, we note the pessimism of the current Treasury forecasts. We note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer revised down in <P>


<a name="column_1442"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1442</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>July the growth forecasts for the current year from 2.75 per cent. to 2.25 per cent. and further reductions in growth, as the noble Lord, Lord Desai, indicated, for the following year. We are particularly surprised by the inflation figure for the last quarter of next year of 3 per cent. in the Treasury statistics which is significantly higher than the Bank of England forecast. As the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, indicated, if the Government believed those statistics, perhaps it is now time to start taking action for further increases in public expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para173"></a>Following the point that the noble Lord, Lord Bruce of Donington, indicated, that there is common ground between us, I believe that there is common ground on all sides of the House. However, if we look at the general government statistics as produced by the Treasury and all independent economic forecasters, the general government financial deficit will generate an enormous surplus in the year 2001-2002. That is arguably quite a good time in the political cycle for the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para174"></a>Putting it into perspective, were the Government to stick to their existing forecast spending plans, it would indicate a &#163;20 billion surplus on the PSBR in today's money terms. That is about 2.4 per cent. of GDP. If we assumed even a modest growth in public expenditure plans over and above what the Government forecast, we are probably looking at a surplus in the region of &#163;7.5 billion in that year.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para175"></a>Having given an encomium to the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, in the hope that he will then take note of the areas in which we disagree with the Government, the first and most significant area of our disagreement is to follow the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, in his plea for a modest increase now in, as he described it, vital areas of public expenditure.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para176"></a>I shall not attempt to rehearse the arguments that were extensively debated during the last general election. As noble Lords will appreciate, the Liberal Democrats argued that if necessary we would put up income tax by 1p in the pound in order to fund improvements in the National Health Service and our school system. The reason that it would be pointless for us to continue that argument is that the Government did not accept it during the election, they have set their face against it and they were elected by a large majority. Therefore the chance of the Government agreeing in their next Budget to put up income tax in order to do what we want is pretty remote.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para177"></a>However, following the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, I wish to indicate within the envelope of the Government's existing spending plans that there is room for that essential expenditure now. Perhaps I may demonstrate it. First, there has been rapid announcement of a number of public expenditure initiatives by the Chancellor. On the basis of those rapid announcements, it is difficult not to lose track of the fact that, first, we have a &#163;2 billion contingency which is left unspent in the Government's spending plans, notwithstanding their determination to stay within the Tory Government spending plans. So there is &#163;2 billion as yet unallocated which is held in the contingency.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para178"></a>Secondly, as always in economic statements and statistics, the devil is in the detail. I commend to noble Lords interested in the subject Appendix B of the Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis 1997/98 which was released at the same time as the Green Budget. It contains the Treasury figures for the current year which demonstrate that total general expenditure is likely to be nearly &#163;1 billion lower than it was thought to be in July for the current year, primarily as a result of the &#163;1 billion reduction in cyclical social security spending.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para179"></a>My submission on behalf of my party is that, first, on the Government's own figures, staying within the expenditure limits to which the Government have committed themselves--the Tory spending limits--within the overall envelope significant sums are available for increased expenditure in the next budget.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para180"></a>Secondly, I urge the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, and, through him, the Chancellor, to follow the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Desai, and my noble friend Lord Ezra, that within the macro-economic framework of the Treasury statistics there is also a macro-economic argument as to why additional expenditure should start in that budget.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para181"></a>I agree entirely with the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, that much of the debate this evening has dealt with the economy in rather dry statistical terms.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para182"></a>In winding up, I wish to refute the remark made by my noble friend Lord Smith of Clifton to me the other day that there is no longer any poetry in economics. I wish to put into perspective what we argue for in the language of real life. When the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, or others on this side talk about essential increases in public services, we mean in real terms, in real language, such things as reducing waiting lists in the National Health Service so that, for example, more people who need hip operations can have them. We mean avoiding next spring local authorities sacking teachers because there is not enough money in the school system to employ the teachers who need to be employed. We need more children of nursery age to be given an opportunity to start nursery education at an age when it is now demonstrated that education is of major benefit for them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para183"></a>We and the Labour Party used to attack the Tories for operating an economic policy in the early 1980s that destroyed the fabric of manufacturing industry. Many economists believe that manufacturing industry has never recovered from the operation of the Tory economic policy in the early 1980s. As an aside to the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, who argued strongly in favour of the shipbuilding industry, I must say that I suspect that one reason his hopes are unlikely to be fulfilled is because of the destruction of the capacity in the shipbuilding industry which occurred during that period. But what worries me about the position we are in now is that we are likely to face exactly the same situation in the public sector. We are likely to have the boom and bust situation in the public sector so that when teachers are sacked because of the straitjacket of government policy, those teachers will not be available in three years' time when the Government turn <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, this has been the usual interesting debate that we have on economic matters. As your Lordships know, I always enjoy them. The House will not be surprised that I enjoyed them a little more when I sat on the opposite side, but on the other hand perhaps I had to listen to more criticism when I sat there.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para184"></a>As I said last week in response to the Chancellor's Statement, it is quite interesting to see the contrast between the upbeat message on the economy that we are now receiving from the Government and the message we received only a few months ago, when the Chancellor tried to paint as black a picture as he possibly could. Of course, he did it on purpose because he wanted to justify 17 tax rises. Those tax rises included a &#163;5 billion-a-year Maxwell-type raid on pension funds. That and all the other taxes imposed already by this Government and the five mortgages rises that have gone with the interest rate rises mean that the average family in this country is already some &#163;650 a year worse off.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para185"></a>There was absolutely no need to do any of it. I use the words of the noble Lord, Lord Healey, who said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We must remember that rarely if ever has a Government had such cause to be grateful to their predecessors when it comes to the economy". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para186"></a>Even the noble Lord, Lord Currie, who was given the task today of introducing the debate, was tempted down the road of saying that it was an excellent legacy. He could not go that far, but he said he thought there was some truth in it. The noble Lord, Lord Jacobs, in an interesting maiden speech, if I remember his words rightly, described it as a "honeypot" situation. I must tell him that his Chief Whip, the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Greenwich, might not like such laudatory remarks about the last Conservative Government. Secondly, it was nice to hear a balanced view because the noble Lord said laudatory things about the Chancellor.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para187"></a>Earlier this year the IMF described our economy as showing,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Impressive macroeconomic performance--strong growth declining unemployment and low inflation". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para188"></a>I am delighted to see unemployment continuing to fall. That is something I should not like to see reversed. But I wonder for how much longer that can continue. There appear to be conflicting signals on the economic front and perhaps the Minister will tell us which we should believe.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para189"></a>For example, I read the other day that the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply reported that growth in Britain's manufacturing sector hit a seven-month high in November. And I also read suggestions of a boom in the high street this Christmas. That looks like good news and I welcome it. However, I wonder whether Eddie George and his monetary committee will welcome it. My noble friend Lord Higgins and the noble Lord, Lord Desai, were concerned that the Bank of England <P>


<a name="column_1445"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1445</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was given sole responsibility on those matters and the only weapon it had to hand was interest rates. The thought of the noble Lord, Lord Desai, as the Governor of the Bank of England was an interesting one and I suspect would be one that would challenge the Chancellor on some of his economic policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para190"></a>My concern is that in the New Year we may see interest rates rise further. That will certainly bring about growth predictions of 1.5 per cent.--not 1.5 to 2 per cent.--in two years. The growth predictions are clearly there in the book. A growth of 1.5 per cent. will bring damaging results for employment, as was well illustrated by the noble Lord, Lord Barnett.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para191"></a>I see some contradictory signs to that; for example, signs which would concern Mr. Robert Owen at New Lanark, about whom we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Macclesfield, in his maiden speech. I am sorry to see that he is not in his place. This week in Glasgow, Hussmann Europe, who manufacture refrigeration equipment, announced their closure with the loss of 300 manufacturing jobs. In Falkirk, Wranglers plant announced closure with 200 manufacturing job losses. I wonder if such closures are being repeated in regional newspapers--they are not big in absolute terms; 200 here and 300 there--throughout the country. In Scotland in the past few weeks we have seen announcements of 1,100 jobs in manufacturing industry either gone or going.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para192"></a>In relation to the Hussmann loss, Brian Wilson, the Scottish Office industry Minister could only describe it as "unwelcome news". If it had happened while we had been in government, his phraseology might have been a good deal stronger. On top of that, as the noble Lord, Lord Currie, rightly pointed out, we have the shadow of the Far East. I am pleased to hear that nobody tried to blame the Conservative government for that. But I wonder what is happening at the Hyundai development in Dunfermline, where the Chancellor's own constituents were looking forward to a huge investment bringing lots of jobs. I understand that on Teesside Samsung has actually withdrawn from the investment that was going to produce 2,000 jobs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para193"></a>Those are real problems. I fully accept that the problems in the Far East are not the fault of the Government, but the manufacturing ones may be. For example, Wranglers are clearly saying that the problem is literally three deutschmarks to the pound. It is manufacturing and other jobs that are important. At the risk of embarrassing him, the noble Lord, Lord Peston, made that point clear last week when we were discussing welfare to work. He said,
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Is my noble friend aware that that makes the labour force more employable"--</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para194"></a>referring to education and training--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it does not make the labour force more employed ... I ask my noble friend to bear in mind that if, next year, we follow the lead of the Bank of England, which has already decided that demand is rising too rapidly--and it appears as if the Treasury believes that as well--most of us believe that, if we were then to cut back on demand for other reasons, unemployment would rise, despite everybody's good intentions with respect to the labour force".--[Official Report, 24/11/97; col.770.] <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para195"></a>That is the point. Whether it is welfare to work, single parents being made to look for work or the disabled being made to look for work, there must be work for them to find. That was a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, in his maiden speech, which I found most interesting as the Minister responsible for some of the changes to the Civil Service that he mentioned. I am sorry that he too is not in his place. Dennis Skinner in the House of Commons yesterday made that very telling point when he described his constituency as somewhere where there was little or no work, so what was the point of talking about people having available work. I doubt if he found Mr. Bradley's reply even vaguely satisfactory-- Mr. Bradley, who was standing in for the Secretary of State who, probably for the first time in living memory, decided to duck out of making the social security uprating Statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para196"></a>I want to turn to pensions and savings. The abolition of ACT on pensions we have already discussed. The first excuse given by the Government and repeated by the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, was that it would encourage industry to invest rather than to pay out dividends. When challenged, they could produce no evidence and, indeed, a study by the City University Business School concluded that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"our analysis does not provide support for the short-termism argument and suggests that dividend payments as well as investment in R&D are distinct strategic decisions of the firm, both aimed at maximising shareholder wealth". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para197"></a>Indeed, my noble friend Lord Blyth of Rowington made the same point. But my noble friend did not notice and I did not notice until the other day that the argument had shifted. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, said last week that the reason for the policy on pension taxation was to remove double tax credits. He did not in any way apologise for the removal of those. He said that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"They were an anomaly that had to be dealt with quickly".--[Official Report, 25/11/97; col. 895.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para198"></a>That was a long-standing anomaly designed by governments to encourage pension savings: exempt, exempt and taxed. Now it has become exempt, taxed and taxed. The result is that people who thought they were in line for a decent pension will have to put in more money to obtain the pension they were aiming at or accept a lower pension.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para199"></a>In his announcement on ISAs yesterday--an announcement that oddly was not made to Parliament--the Paymaster General clawed back tax relief from between 750,000 and 1 million savers. I felt that that came pretty rich from Mr. Geoffrey Robinson, who, unlike most of the savers, is able to shelter his not inconsiderable wealth in offshore funds.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para200"></a>Again, the noble Lord, Lord Currie, talked of tax reforms to increase investment. That seems to be at variance with the &#163;50,000 cap. I have no problem with encouraging people to save; PEPs and TESSAs have done just that for 6.5 million people. But we should look at the other side of the issue--namely, their pension proposals--before we pass final judgment. Savings like PEPs, TESSAs and ISAs may be used for retirement, but not necessarily. Indeed, because ISAs do not look <P>


<a name="column_1447"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1447</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as long term as PEPs and TESSAs, they appear to me to perhaps discourage long-term savings and could result in a reduction in the savings ratio.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para201"></a>It is saving for retirement that must be the priority. I shall reserve judgment on ISAs until I see what proposals the Government bring forward in relation to saving for retirement. It may be the former Social Security Minister speaking, but saving for retirement seems to me, above all, to be what we want.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para202"></a>When we look at TESSAs and PEPs and the fact that many people are now going to be taxed, the manifesto promise not to increase income tax looks like a pretty tarnished promise. Hard working, hard saving families are now to be hit on their savings just as they are being hit on their pensions. It was Polly Toynbee who said--drawn to our attention by the noble Lord, Lord Russell--"Trust them--they are liars".
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para203"></a>I could go on to other issues but do not have the time. I wonder about working family tax credit. Will it replace family credit? Will it be on the individual or will it mean that we will have a joint assessment return? I should have thought that one of the reforms that the sisterhood--if I may call them that--so enjoyed was the reform of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, of separate taxation. I wonder whether family tax credit will mean the return of joint assessment. I am in some difficulty in working out how it will operate if it is not on joint assessment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para204"></a>I wonder too what the pre-Budget Statement meant in regard to national insurance contributions and the 10p. rate. To make one last point to the Government, if they really want to help people on low incomes who are just coming into the tax system, it is not a 10p. rate that we want--though I would welcome any reduction in taxation--it is an increase in personal allowances. That is the most direct way to help low earners out of paying taxation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para205"></a>This has been, as always, a fascinating debate. We enjoyed the maiden speeches. I am looking forward to hearing the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, perform the task that I used to perform.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-07_spnew22"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that so many noble Lords have said that this is a welcome occasion. It is indeed. We had the pre-Budget report last week, and it was obvious from the attention that was paid to it and from the concern people had that it was not possible in the circumstances of a Statement, with responses from the Back-Benches limited to 20 minutes, to do justice to the complex issues we have been debating for nearly five hours today. I am pleased that so many people from all parts of the House have felt that it was right for the Labour Party to devote one of its Wednesdays to these important issues.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para206"></a>It has also been valuable because of the quality of all five maiden speakers in the debate. I hope I shall be able to refer to each of them in responding to different parts of the debate, but I just wanted to pay that general tribute at the outset.
<P>


<a name="column_1448"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1448</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para207"></a>I should like to draw the attention of the House to the wording of the Motion. It refers to "prospects". It does not refer to "forecasts" or to "targets". A great deal of debate has taken place today about forecasts and targets. My noble friend Lord Barnett--I should not refer to him because I should not refer to noble Lords who are not in their places for the closing speeches, but I just have to on this occasion--was disappointed with the forecasts which were represented in the documents produced last week. He felt that on these forecasts--this view was shared by a number of noble Lords--we were simply not going to achieve the kind of growth which is necessary to meet the aspirations of our people. I have to repeat: forecasts are not targets.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para208"></a>Perhaps I may illustrate that with the most familiar quotation from Marx:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Historians have only interpreted the world. Our task now is to change it". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para209"></a>That is exactly the position of this Government. We make these forecasts; we make the best forecasts we can; we have for the first time had them verified by the National Audit Office in order to make sure that the assumptions we have made--for example, about stable equity prices--are the best available to us; and then we try to beat them. That is what it is all about. If we spend too much time in forecasting rather than in action, we will be betraying the task that is in front of us. Perhaps I may move from Marx to a more modern British poet. In Non Cogunt Astra, Robert Graves wrote:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Come, live in now and occupy it well. Prediction is no alternative to forethought". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para210"></a>I have said a few words about the future. As to the past, I think it would be as well for all of us to abjure self-congratulation, either for the achievements of the past seven months or of the past 18 years; or indeed of a much longer period. Economic history does not come in bite sized pieces. It happens over a period of time. Very many of the things that happen in economic history seem to bear remarkably little relation to the party of the day in political power. The changes that have taken place in our economy have been changes from the Industrial Revolution to the post-Industrial Revolution, the oil price changes of the early 1970s, and the rise--and perhaps the plateauing--of the Asian economies. All of those have happened independently of the party which happened to be in power. I do not think it is fruitful for us to spend time in abusing each other or praising ourselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para211"></a>Nevertheless, it is necessary to say that there was general agreement, with the exception of the noble Lord, Lord Boardman, that our economic prospects are good--he described them as cloudy, which I thought was hedging his bets rather. There has been a danger of mixing up the economic prospects for the country as a whole and the financial prospects for the public sector and for government. I have seen that confusion in a number of speeches. But I shall not specify them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para212"></a>So far as concerns the economy as a whole and central government, there have been warning signs to which the Government have had to pay attention. It was the case that the Bank of England warnings that interest rates needed to go up to get the economy back on track were ignored in the latter part of 1996 and the early part <P>


<a name="column_1449"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1449</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of 1997. It was the case--it has been the case for many years now: this is an underlying problem with which we have to deal--that one in five working age households have no one earning a wage, and that unemployment, particularly among young people, and long-term unemployment, are persistent and very hard to fight. My noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington made that point with his usual forcefulness. We cannot ignore the fact that our productivity levels, despite any improvement there may have been, are still up to 30 per cent. below those of the more successful economies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para213"></a>There is a whole range of policies that we have to adopt in order to deal with those. I shall expound on as many of them as I can. However, the first fundamental thing the Government have to do is to convince the country, business people and the world that we mean what we say about putting into place long-term policies. That means--I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, and to the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, for their references to this--that we must systematically remove the barriers that hinder both growth and job creation, and that we must build a new partnership between government, the people and business. In this respect my noble friend Lord Thomas of Macclesfield made a very effective speech about what he called the "inclusive" approach. My noble friend Lord Longford made the same point. It is no good us treating government as some kind of independent arbiter. We have to be in there fighting with business and with people in order to achieve what we need to achieve.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para214"></a>That kind of inclusive approach--if I may use the word of my noble friend Lord Thomas--is necessary to promote economic and social stability, high long-term growth, employment opportunities for all and a fair tax system. In order to achieve those, I hope noble Lords in all parts of the House will agree that we have at least been trying to create a more open style of government based on wider consultation and greater transparency in policy rules.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para215"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, curiously to my mind, questioned whether there was any consultation in what was said in the pre-Budget report. I thought there was a mass of consultation--an almost overwhelming mass of consultation. There was consultation on corporation tax reforms last week; on individual savings accounts yesterday--I point out that individual savings accounts are not firm proposals: it is a consultative document. There was consultation on options for water pollution last week; on charities, in the review that was announced in the July Budget; on the enterprise investment scheme and venture capital tax; on the North Sea oil taxation review which we have announced; and on capital gains tax. I wonder how much more consultation the noble Lord wants. Sometimes I think we are drowning in consultation. The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, was closer to the mark when he applauded the Government for the amount of consultation that we were involved in.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para216"></a>Above all, this consultation is designed to underline our commitment to economic stability. We have already outlined the five key principles which will guide fiscal policy. They are: transparency, stability, responsibility, fairness and efficiency. They have been reinforced by the code for fiscal stability to ensure that our fiscal <P>


<a name="column_1450"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1450</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>policy is in line with these principles and in Britain's long-term interests. I still disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, about that. The Gramm-Rudman Act was more notable for its abandonment in the face of fire than by any conspicuous or continuous success. We set our sights much more by the Australian and New Zealand models which involve legislation which is slightly less level than the Gramm-Rudman Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-07_para217"></a>As regards the promotion of growth, a number of noble Lords have quite rightly drawn attention to the need for higher quality investment in both the public and private sectors. I am surprised at the coolness of the response to some of these issues because business spokesmen have been very welcoming of our measures, particularly those that relate to advance corporation tax. Together with the abolition of that tax and the reduction of corporation tax itself, there has been a move to quarterly payments. I remind your Lordships that those payments will only be required of large companies who make more than &#163;1.5 million in profit in any given year. That is only 11 per cent. of all companies, although I recognise that it is a very much higher proportion--more than 80 per cent.--of tax revenue. There are 350,000 small companies who will not be affected by quarterly payments and 15,000 medium-sized companies will have a regime which is tempered for them.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

Perhaps he can name a single businessman, including his noble friend Lord Simon of Highbury in his previous capacity as chairman of BP, who approves of a &#163;5 billion per annum pension hit?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, what the noble Lord persists in calling the &#163;5 billion pension hit and which I shall persist in calling the removal of double tax incentives, which were no longer justified and were an anomaly, has been criticised by a very large number of people. But in the wider sense of the completion of the review of advance corporation tax which took place last week, my noble friend's successor, Mr. John Brown, the chief executive of BP has said that the changes are very welcome. They reflect consideration of what people have said and they make Britain a great place to do business from. Mr. Adair Turner of the CBI has favoured the reform of the corporation tax regime in line with the principles announced by the Chancellor. Richard Baron, the taxation executive of the Institute of Directors, has said that the abolition of ACT was wonderful for companies.

<A NAME = "71203-08_para0"></a>A number of other noble Lords quite rightly drew attention to what was necessary to improve R&D, innovation and private investment. As regards private investment, I claim that the greater certainty which is now possible from the abolition of ACT and the ability of companies to forecast their cash flow and profits more accurately, must be an advantage to private investment. We recognise the need for steps to improve R&D and innovation. We have set up a group under Mr. Nigel McCulloch of Biotech to look at the financing of high-tech. companies which, I am sure noble Lords will acknowledge, are at the forefront of our needs for increased R&D. That is without in any way denying the valuable investment which is carried out by pharmaceutical companies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para1"></a>We are also committed to the reform of capital gains tax, which will encourage long-term investment and about which the Chancellor will have more to say in his Budget. I hope that my noble friend Lord Montague will be able to wait until that time to receive an answer to the very proper questions that he asked. The noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, also talked about investment from his great experience at 3i. He made a particular plea for the shipbuilding industry. That plea struck home to me. I cannot claim that there are any specific shipbuilding initiatives in the Government's plans at the moment; but the whole thrust of our work must be to encourage investment both in shipbuilding and in other manufacturing industry. The noble Viscount is quite right in saying that very serious and important opportunities have been lost in recent years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para2"></a>Perhaps I my now say a brief word about growth forecasts, which comes back to what I said at the beginning about the difference between forecasting and targets. I believe that it is clear from the pre-Budget report that all of the forecasts are in a range. It is our intention in particular with forecasts of growth, that our policies should result, for example, in the next year or two in an increase from 2.25 per cent. to 2.75 per cent. growth. High and stable growth are at the centre of our policies.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para3"></a>At the same time our economic prospects must be affected by the availability of jobs, skills and people who are willing and able to go to work. That is the reason why we announced in July the biggest ever programme to get the young and long-term unemployed off welfare and into jobs. The new deal which we have announced provides for help to the long-term sick and the disabled to get them into work. It provides out-of-school childcare and a 10-fold increase in the number of out-of-school clubs over the next five years. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Levy for his reference to that in his excellent maiden speech. There will be extra help for lone parents in the form of interviews and advice to get jobs.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para4"></a>I acknowledge, as all Members of the Government have done, the difficulty of finding jobs in areas of very high unemployment. There will be action on skill shortages in bringing forward new deal payments to employers to meet the cost of training. The tax and benefit reform is still incomplete. It is designed to make work pay--in other words, to remove the disincentives to work which have existed until now. My noble friend Lord Davies of Coity, in a moving speech, was very powerful in his remarks on the need for a minimum wage. Tax credits for working families were referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, and are of course still in the planning stage. We are aware of the implications for family and individual taxation, and income tax at the starting rate of 10p is in the planning stage, as are changes to national insurance and benefit tapers.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para5"></a>I think it is important to re-emphasise the role of skills and the need to improve our skills. I liked the reference my noble friend Lord Levy made to "youth clubs for the elderly". I thought he might have been describing the House of Lords when he described a place which was clean, well-lit and warm enough and gave people the chance for civilised intercourse, but perhaps he did not quite mean that. At the same time we need responsible pay settlements to achieve lower inflation more quickly and to reach higher growth and more jobs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para6"></a>I was surprised at how little reference there was about the individual savings accounts. They were welcomed by the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, and by my noble friend Lord Desai, who rightly referred to the need for better regulation. That of course is taken into account in our plans. I am afraid the noble Lord, Lord Mackay, has been seduced by early headlines. The best estimate we have of people who will be affected by the overall investment limit is between 300,000 and 500,000, rather than the million he was talking about--hardly "middle England" as some of the broadsheets chose to say this morning.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para7"></a>However, the noble Lord is right in saying that you have to get complementary policies for long-term investment in the form of stakeholder pensions locked-in saving as well as the additional savings which will be provided by the individual savings accounts. I would remind him that it was under his Government that the cost of TESSAs and PEPs, in terms of tax lost, largely for better-off people, had risen out of control to &#163;1.5 million. We are prepared to live with that &#163;1.5 million but we are not prepared for it to be concentrated on the better off. Our intention is to use the same money to encourage twice as many people to use the individual savings accounts. I hope that those who are involved will think that this is a worthy objective. At the same time, as the House will know, there has been a fairer deal for pensioners in the form of help for winter fuel bills and reducing VAT on energy saving schemes, to which the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, referred earlier this week and again today.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para8"></a>My Lords, I will have to race through the rest of my comments and the final points I wanted to make. On the timing of the Budget and the unified Budget, we hear <P>


<a name="column_1453"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1453</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the warnings that have been made about the difficulties of the unified Budget and about the timing of it; and these will be taken into account in our considerations.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para9"></a>Many noble Lords have referred to European monetary union, nearly all of them urging us to move faster rather than slower. It is interesting that there has not been a single hint of the official Conservative Party policy of no entry into EMU within two Parliaments, whether from the Conservative Front Bench or from the Back-Benches--
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Boardman: </B>   My Lords, I think the noble Lord must accept that I expressed my view on that, which was very much against EMU now or at any time in the future.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I beg the noble Lord's pardon; but I still maintain my position that his Front Bench is not exactly volunteering to expound Conservative Party policy.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para10"></a>To recapitulate, what we have been trying to do, and will continue to do, is to deliver high long-term growth with low unemployment. We have an economy which is growing slowly. It was over trend, and it needs to slow to more sustainable rates next year, and we anticipate that inflation will remain low. For this we need responsible pay settlements from the boardroom right across. This will allow higher sustainable growth and more jobs. Somebody used the words "courageous economic policies". We are not looking for courageous economic policies but for prudent economic policies, and we will not gamble with the nation's finances. If that means that in the short term there is a cry for more public expenditure we understand that, and we understand the position of the Liberal Democratic Party on that, and the position of many in our own Party. However, the need for prudence and long-term sustainable policies will sustain us in our determination to achieve the best results for this country's economic prospects.

<A NAME="71203-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Currie of Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that conclusion to this debate and for responding to the many contributions we have had from all parts of the House throughout this debate. We have had many very effective contributions and five excellent maiden speeches, four of them, I am pleased to say, from these Benches. We have ranged very widely. We have covered the core issues of macro-economic policy, fiscal policy, monetary policy, taxation and government spending, and the vital issue of EMU.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-08_para11"></a>I said in my opening speech that we would range widely and that the ingenuity of your Lordships would ensure that we did not confine the debate too narrowly but that many diverse issues would nestle comfortably within the span of the broad Motion. Indeed, that has proved to be so. We have talked about employment, the management of the Civil Service and its efficiency. We have talked about the vital role of the voluntary sector and we have had a fascinating personal political history of the past half-century or more. We have talked about shipbuilding; and we have had a fascinating account of <P>

<P>
<A NAME="71203-09_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dixon </B>  rose to ask Her Majesty's Government whether they have received the second survey report on MV "Derbyshire"; and, if so, what action they are proposing to take.<P>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in tabling this Question, I should like to comment on some of the more unsatisfactory aspects of this long-running saga, and try to put them in context with the current investigation. It is now over 17 years since MV "Derbyshire" disappeared on 10th September, 1980, 200 miles from Japan, in a typhoon that many felt she should easily have braved, resulting in the loss of everyone on board; 42 crew and two wives of officers.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para1"></a>Despite the loss of life, the Government of the day refused to have a formal investigation. If this accident had happened in any other mode of transport--in aviation for instance--all similar types of aeroplane would have been grounded and unlimited money would have been spent to identify the cause. Given such a loss of life, an investigation should have been the norm rather than the exception. Instead the Minister announced in May 1981 that there was not enough evidence to justify an inquiry.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para2"></a>Since the disappearance of the "Derbyshire" we have had 12 Secretaries of State for Transport, the current one being my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister. The Derbyshire Family Association has fought amazingly hard and showed much patience just to seek the truth and achieve natural justice for the relatives who perished on the "Derbyshire". I, along with others, have been angered over the years by the cavalier way in which the Department of Transport has at times treated the association, in my opinion denying them natural justice. Indeed, if it had not been for the Derbyshire Family Association and the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers and their technical advisers, the loss of the "Derbyshire" would have been a footnote in maritime history. For it was those, along with the International Transport Federation, who found the funds to finance a marine search and succeeded in locating the wreck two and a half miles beneath the China Sea.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para3"></a>The "Derbyshire" was a Bibby Line-owned bulk carrier built by Swan Hunter at Haverton Hill on Tees-side in 1976. She was the last of the six Bridge class oil, bulk and ore combination carriers. They were the first of their kind to be built in the United Kingdom. Out of the six ships only the first, the "Furness Bridge", was built to the original design.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para4"></a>On March 11th 1982, on passage from Hamburg bound for Brazil, the "Tyne Bridge"--the second of the six-ship series--encountered a North Sea storm and <P>


<a name="column_1455"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>started to split badly around frame 65. Such was the captain's concern he arranged for the majority of the crew to be airlifted to safety. The ship was towed to Hamburg for repairs. Inspection of the "Tyne Bridge" in dry dock showed that she had not been built to design and the damage was attributed to the method of connecting the forward cargo section of the hull to the after-engine room section. So alarmed were the surveyors of the "Tyne Bridge" damage that, unsolicited, they sent out warnings to the owners of similarly built sister ships. Two were given the same strengthening treatment in the same year.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para5"></a>If actions speak louder than words this is what the repairs said: one, the longitudinal--that is, the spinal--girders should not have been terminated at and welded to the transverse bulkhead; they should have carried through the bulkhead. I have spent 34 years as a shipwright building and repairing ships. I never in my life experienced this type of construction.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para6"></a>Two, a thick longitudinal should never be butted to the thinner one aft of the bulkhead. Three, the metal should have been either D or E grade. Four, sharp edges should always be avoided on ships because they raise stresses. Five, the deck should have been 30 per cent. thicker.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para7"></a>The question that has never been answered is how do those claiming that the hull of the "Derbyshire" was adequate and up to specification reconcile those claims with the fact that hundreds of thousands of pounds needed to be spent on her sister ships on strengthening and repairs?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para8"></a>Out of the six sister ships, one was built to original design, three had to undergo repairs at frame 65 to restore them to the original design and make them seaworthy; the two that were left were the "Kowloon Bridge" and the "Derbyshire".
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para9"></a>On 25th November 1986, the "Kowloon Bridge", in an abandoned condition, struck Stag Rocks off the southern coast of Ireland and gradually sank, splitting at frame 65 as she sank. It was not until the loss of the "Kowloon Bridge" that a formal investigation into the loss of the "Derbyshire" took place, six years after the tragedy.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para10"></a>The report was published in 1989 and stated that:

<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para12"></a>It was an investigation which many in the maritime community felt was a complete whitewash.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para13"></a>I received a copy of a letter from Mr. J. F. Ibbotson, leader of the Australian Derbyshire Family Association. In it he said:

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para15"></a>After the finding of the wreck by the DFA, the RMT and the International Transport Federation, the Government commissioned the noble Lord, Lord Donaldson, to carry out an assessment into what further work should be undertaken to identify the cause of the sinking of the "Derbyshire". Although it was a well written report, one has to ask if this assessment was necessary. If a plane crashes into the sea, we do not have to have an assessment as to whether you can go in and retrieve the black box.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para16"></a>I always understood that the criteria for reopening a formal investigation is that there has to be a new and important evidence. Surely the finding of the wreck must have met this criteria? If so, the formal investigation could have then been reopened, and the expedition planned and carried out with technical experts from all interested parties. In that way we would have had a balanced expedition. Unfortunately, the Department of Transport took control of the investigation--the very party that is known to have a vested financial interest in its outcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para17"></a>I will explain that financial interest. In 1986 the shipyard which built the "Derbyshire" was privatised, and in order for the deal to go through the Government gave the new owners indemnity against any claims that might arise from the sinking of the "Derbyshire", thus making the Government liable to meet any successful claims. Some have said that is why there were significant differences between the draft report in 1985 and the final report in 1986.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para18"></a>For the present survey the DoT appointed the Ministry of Defence as project managers and appointed two UK assessors who were known to favour a particular loss scenario--"hatch cover failure", the same as put forward at the formal investigation by the shipbuilders. These two assessors made a sort of league table of probabilities, and sure enough the hatch cover failure came way out on top, promoting a loss scenario that would favour the builders and the DoT cannot be described as being objective.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para19"></a>As a member of the All Party Derbyshire Committee, I was disturbed to learn that one of the assessors--Professor Faulkner--got together with a technical expert who represented the builders of the "Derbyshire" at the formal investigation and co-authored a technical paper. This paper also included work that was sponsored by the builders, Swan Hunter. Hardly impartial or objective behaviour.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para20"></a>We took a delegation to the shipping Minister Viscount Goschen to complain about this and other matters. Unfortunately our protests fell on deaf ears and Professor Faulkner continued to promote his pet theory. I can accept that the theory addresses a point of valid concern, but I cannot accept the behaviour of the assessor in presupposing that hatch failure was the cause of the ship's loss.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para21"></a>If we need further evidence of the UK assessors swinging away from hard circumstantial evidence of structural failure, there is the fact that the assessors went into print and stated that the structural failure circumstances of the sister ships "Tyne Bridge" and "Kowloon Bridge" were not relevant to the loss of the <P>


<a name="column_1457"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1457</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"Derbyshire". I understand that Professor Faulkner has now been asked to resign. This was long after our delegation went to see the Minister.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para22"></a>In a letter of October 28th from my honourable friend the Minister at the Department of Transport, Glenda Jackson, she says:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Professor Faulkner's active promotion of the theory that the DERBYSHIRE sank when her hatch covers gave way is a matter of dismay for the Department. Officials have written to Professor Faulkner to convey the Department's displeasure in his untimely interventions. In response, he has offered his resignation as an Assessor ... " </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para23"></a>This was over a year after we complained about his lack of impartiality.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para24"></a>Probably one of the most important aspects of this investigation was to retrieve certain pieces of wreckage for structural and metallurgical analysis. This was requested by the families and by the All Party Group of MPs. It was rejected by the assessors. Instead they opted for a cutting system, that was unproven, in which they proposed to cut only small samples to validate the photos of the fracture faces, not for analysis as was required. I am informed that this cutting equipment failed. I would therefore ask my noble friend if any attempt was made to retrieve any wreckage. I understand that the survey vessel was equipped with alternative methods of retrieval, such as a deep water grab system, and diesel bags that could float wreckage to the surface. This is a proven method of retrieval. If they did not obtain samples, I would like to know why not, as it is of paramount importance to determine the quality of steel used in the "Derbyshire's" construction.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para25"></a>Not trusting the independence of the assessors, the DFA solicitors sent a letter to them requesting they look for quality deficiencies that were known to exist in her sister ships, such as defective welding, misalignment, etc. The assessors refused to do this. Again, I believe that that showed a lack of objectivity.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para26"></a>Contrary to what had been stated, the DFA has never been involved in any planning of the expedition, only attending meetings with assessors in order to be kept informed of developments. The families made suggestions, but they were not accepted by the assessors, for what I consider to be unconvincing reasons.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para27"></a>Such is the families' distrust of the Department of Transport's investigation that they cannot put their faith in the assessors' report and are now setting up a trust fund to finance their own experts to analyse the data and produce their own report. It is a terrible reflection on the Department of Transport when the dependants of the deceased have to find the wreck themselves and then find a considerable amount of money to fund their own independent experts to examine the evidence. They should be able to have complete faith in the assessors' report, but, because of the assessors' unacceptable and biased conduct, they simply do not trust them. In saying that, I do not in any way question the integrity of the EEC assessor, who carried out his duties in a most professional and impartial way.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-09_para28"></a>In the light of what has been stated and bearing in mind that data will form the evidence in any future court of inquiry, may I ask my noble friend whether the analysis and interpretation of the data brought back from <P>

Liverpool was the "Derbyshire"'s registered port. Furthermore, a significant number of the crew came from Liverpool or the North East, so the dependants would be assisted if they could attend the inquiry without incurring the considerable expense that they incurred last time when the inquiry was held in London.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-10_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Caldecote: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the House for speaking in two debates on the same day. I have never done it before and I do not suppose that I shall ever do it again. The "Derbyshire" was the largest UK-built ship ever to have been lost at sea. The trend now is to build ever-larger ships, even bigger than the "Derbyshire". Therefore, it is very important that we learn as much as we possibly can from that tragic loss. The sea is a very hard taskmaster, never to be underrated--and I have seen a few waves in my time. Nevertheless, we should be very hesitant in attributing such disasters to forces of nature, as did the preliminary inquiry in 1980. Mistakes can be made, especially when there are big changes in design, size or type of ship.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para0"></a>Subsequent to that preliminary inquiry, other evidence came to light. I refer, for example to the cracking of the sister ship, the "Tyne Bridge", in 1982, to which the noble Lord, Lord Dixon, referred. Research was commissioned by the Department of Transport. In March 1986, the report was published, but it was an amended version of the original 1985 report. In May 1986, the Department of Transport refused to release the original version of the report. Then, in November 1986, another sister ship, the "Kowloon Bridge", ran into trouble and sank. There were clear indications of structural failure. A further investigation followed. A report was published in 1989, again concluding that the problem was that the ship had probably been overwhelmed by the forces of nature. Discussions continued and in 1990 an important paper was read to the Royal Institution of Naval Architects by the late Professor Bishop. However, in 1991 the Department of Transport again refused to reopen the investigation. Later in 1991 there was another refusal to place the full report of 1985 in the Library of either the House of Commons or this House. That report was made by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para1"></a>So, before the wise recommendation made in 1996 by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson of Lymington--I am glad that he is to speak in this debate--that further investigations were needed, it was a rather sorry story of reluctance to face up to the real issues right from the start of the case and to make full public disclosures of all the views expressed in the various investigations and discussions. Further, as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon, mentioned, there have been delays and other problems in keeping the Derbyshire Family Association fully in the picture at all times. I am glad that that has improved lately.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para2"></a>I understand that the new report will be completed early in 1998. No doubt the Minister will tell us when it is likely to be published. May I ask the Minister to give us two assurances: first, that when the new report is published, it will be published in full, in its original form, without censorship of any kind and without any scaling down of any of the views expressed; secondly, that the Derbyshire Family Association will receive free copies of the report well in advance of publication, as they have requested, to minimise any further distress that may be caused to the families of those who were lost in this tragic accident? I look forward with great interest to the Minister's reply.

I know that he followed the matter assiduously in another place. Over a number of years, I have raised the problem in your Lordships' House, mainly in Questions--and I have never received what I would call a definitive answer. The noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, has been mentioned. He was the previous Minister responsible for this. The last time that I asked the noble Viscount a Question on this, it was a complete waste of time. At the time I considered that what I was asking for was reasonable and in the interests of those who had lost family members. However, it was useless; there was no progress whatsoever.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para3"></a>We talk about tragedies, but I wonder whether many people realise the enormity of what happened. The "Derbyshire" was at least twice as big as the "Titanic". It may even have been bigger, but it disappeared without trace and with total loss of life. For the life of me, I cannot understand how it has been possible--it appears to be a case of vested interests in this country to prevent those who are most entitled to know, the relatives and dependants of the people who died in this ship, from learning what took place. One obstruction has been placed on top of another. As one jumps over one obstruction, another is erected.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para4"></a>I have a copy of the report prepared by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson. In a technical sense it is excellent. I do not wish to clash with my noble friend Lord Dixon or anyone else in the field of shipbuilding. I am an engineer and have never been a shipbuilder, but I know enough about steel construction to appreciate that the box compartment method of building is doomed <P>


<a name="column_1460"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>to failure. Wherever it has been adopted in bridge building or anywhere else it has been a disaster. As my noble friend Lord Dixon has said, in this type of construction there is no continuous keel. Therefore, it must be a main contributing factor to what took place.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para5"></a>I do not have the figures with me, but these incidents occur in all of the oceans of the world. An annual count is made and the latest figure is 20. This type of ship has disappeared without trace in different parts of the world. No one seems to bother. It must be a cheap method of construction. All that appears to be expendable but cannot be quantified is the loss of life.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para6"></a>A second survey is to take place. If a proper survey had been done in the first place and the results had been made available to those who had lost their loved ones--that was all they asked for--these problems would have been avoided. They had an absolute entitlement to it but it was withheld. One can think of other similar incidents in this country. It appears that where there is loss of life at the lower levels of society no one bothers too much. Another example was the "Piper Alpha" disaster, in which 100-odd men are still entombed. The relatives did not receive justice. There was no attempt to deal with that situation. The relatives and survivors wanted certain action taken, but it was too expensive. That was not said but it was the only conclusion that could be drawn from that situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para7"></a>I hope that when the second survey is completed a final answer will be provided from a completely independent point of view, not the point of view of someone who sits on a commission, finds in one way, leaves and is then used by someone else and gives a verdict having abdicated his original responsibility. This is not new; it has happened in other industries. I recall one situation in which Heriot-Watt University in Scotland was commissioned to carry out another task but suddenly withdrew because of pressure exerted by industrialists who financed the university.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para8"></a>I do not know when the second survey will be completed but the sooner the better. If legal assistance is required and the matter goes to court, I hope that the dependants who are left, who have had to beg or borrow to be represented, will have the same access to legal aid as others of whom we read in the press. For example, we regularly read of people who have gone off with other people's money in a grandiose fashion and ended up obtaining legal aid, on one occasion to the tune of &#163;15 million. In another case a German who lived in Italy and who had never visited this country obtained half a million pounds a few months ago in order to sue a Japanese company because that company's business headquarters were in London. In another case an Iranian gentleman who was alleged to have milked the funds of the Arab League, or a similar body, of a substantial amount of money--about &#163;30 million--had his legal costs funded by the British taxpayer. I hope that if the dependants of those who died in this terrible disaster require representation, at whatever level, that will be looked upon sympathetically. If it is not, there is something wrong with justice in this country.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para9"></a>My noble friend Lord Dixon has drawn our attention to an important problem. We should start to look at such a matter as an industrial disaster that needs our fullest <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>attention. It is a reflection on this country and on some of the people of the establishment--it is 11 years ago now--that we are still struggling for justice for the people who should have been given it right away.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to say anything about the chapter of events that took place before I became involved in assessing what should be done thereafter, save to say--I have said it before--that the Derbyshire Family Association deserves great credit for its persistence in trying to get the authorities to find out what was the cause of the loss of the "Derbyshire" or at least to see what lessons could be learnt to the benefit of shipping generally from such evidence as could be gathered about that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para10"></a>If it is any consolation to the families, if there had been attempts to take the matter further at a very much earlier stage, the technology which is now available would not have been available, and I doubt whether they could have obtained a tithe of the evidence which has now been uncovered. Furthermore, human nature and, above all, ministerial human nature, being what it is, had they had a series of inquiries as each new piece of evidence arose, there would have been considerable resistance to going into the matter further.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para11"></a>We now have the position that an expedition has worked day and night for 57 days over the wreck. Photographs have been taken of every part of it. I am told that there are now 140,000 photographs, all of which have to be matched together to find out from where they have come. Some of them have to be looked at with much greater care to see what lessons can be learnt.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para12"></a>There is a mass of factual evidence. There are two stages to this. There is the factual evidence which anyone can see, or will be able to see in due course; and there is the interpretation of that evidence. I hope that no one in their enthusiasm for any particular cause will suggest that those who worked professionally on this survey have in any way suppressed anything. It is all there. There will be legitimate room, no doubt, for differences of opinion as to what inferences, what conclusions, should be drawn; but that is a different matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para13"></a>On that, if the "Derbyshire" families have a different view, no doubt they will put it forward. They will no doubt be advised whether there are grounds for different views. The function of the people who have been involved in this--in particular, Robin Williams, who has been in charge from the technical point of view--is to lay the facts before the Secretary of State, and to state their conclusions. Those conclusions will be open to debate, if anyone wants to, but I hope that there will be no challenge to the facts.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para14"></a>Let me say a word about the approach to my assessment. We had to rate probabilities in some sort of order, because it is no good spending &#163;2 million, which is what we are talking about, on trying to find something that virtually could not have happened. Equally, we are not justified in spending such a sum on looking for evidence of a cause if, in the nature of things, the evidence could not be there.
<P>


<a name="column_1462"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1462</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para15"></a>I shall give an example: fire. Fire would have left carbon deposits which would have been washed away ages ago. We took various hypothetical causes and gave them probability ratings on the basis of such information as we had, and also evidential ratings--the chances of our being able to find any evidence. We added the two scores together which gave us a league table.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para16"></a>In that league table it is not correct to say, as I have heard it said in the Chamber today, that hatch covers were the front runners. There were joint front runners--fore end flooding is a better way of putting the matter, because the water can enter in a number of ways--fore end flooding and Frame 65. There were other subsidiary issues with lesser scores, if one may put it that way.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para17"></a>It is not true to say that the assessors favoured hatch covers rather than Frame 65. All three of us approached the matter on the basis that we did not know what the answer was. We wanted to decide what we were justified in spending the money on in the search for truth.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para18"></a>There have been references to Professor Faulkner. It is true that from an early stage in our deliberations he was saying to me, "Look, you really ought to consider this question of the strength of hatch covers", because Lloyd's Register, if I remember rightly, said that in the light of current knowledge the strength of those hatch covers was inadequate. It does not follow that they were the cause of the loss in any way. But, as a result, the question of the strength of the hatch covers is now being examined. I hasten to say that the "Derbyshire" was constructed entirely in accordance with the standards of the day. It is a question of the information that has come to light since.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para19"></a>Professor Faulkner also stated that he believed that inadequate attention had been paid to special forms of sea that can occur in a typhoon. We paid attention to that, but it did not affect our scaling of the probabilities. It merely meant that fore end flooding and hatch covers had to be examined seriously, just as Frame 65 had to be examined seriously. There was evidence to support both. We heard about the bridge class vessels in relation to Frame 65. We must also take account of the fact that the ITF expedition found the bow virtually intact. I am no expert or naval architect, but it raises the issue of whether that area of the vessel was flooded before she began to sink. One would have expected to find--indeed, the first survey did find--that watertight parts of the vessel exploded as it sank causing considerable damage. There appears to have been no damage to the bow. That does not mean to say that that was the position. It merely raises the probability to a level which comes within a measurable distance of Frame 65.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para20"></a>We now have the facts. They must be incorporated in a report in order to make sense of them. I do not know whether those working on the report have formed any conclusions, but they must do so and then report to the Secretary of State. No doubt at that stage everyone concerned will be able to form a view on whether they accept the report or undertake their own investigations before deciding. But that will be the time to make a decision and I deplore any attempt to rush those who are assembling and analysing the evidence. We can never <P>


<a name="column_1463"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1463</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>undertake the task again; we must get it right this time. If it takes time, then it takes time. I hope that the families of those on the "Derbyshire" will understand that I and the three assessors in their different ways are trying to find out the truth. That is what matters and we must allow sufficient time to achieve that objective.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_time3"></A><H5>9.22 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Dixon, for introducing this important Question. I speak in this short but important debate as a disinterested observer, but one with an engineering background. I have no special knowledge of the "Derbyshire", except what I have gleaned from the newspapers and been able to assess from those reports from my knowledge and experience of engineering history and practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para21"></a>Until I had heard the explanations of previous speakers, my understanding of the situation was as follows. First, the MV "Derbyshire" was one of a series of large bulk carriers built to the same or similar design at the frontiers of knowledge at the time, or certainly close to those frontiers. Secondly, she was lost without warning on a routine passage, admittedly during a period of heavy weather, but not, so far as we can tell, freak conditions. Thirdly, she was relatively new.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para22"></a>Here is where my knowledge of engineering history comes in. One example that I can give is the experience of the early jet engined, aluminium bodied aircraft which suffered metal fatigue as a result of high cyclical stresses. That was a new phenomenon and the experience of the failure resulted in much experimental and research work which pushed back the frontiers of knowledge and resulted in the safe, fast, economical air travel on which we have come to rely.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para23"></a>There is another example which may be a little closer to the case of the "Derbyshire". That is the catastrophic failure of liberty ships sailing in cold waters in the early part of the last war. The failures in those cases were found to be brittle fracture associated with the welded hull structures in conjunction with cold environments. Again, research and development led to shipyards being able to weld hull structures in such a way as to provide safe construction of shipping since the war. I have given your Lordships those two examples to suggest that the situation of the MV "Derbyshire" may have been that it was so close to the frontiers of knowledge that it pushed beyond what was known at the time.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para24"></a>I have gathered that it was argued by the ship designers and constructors that the "Derbyshire" was just a development of current normal practice and that the insurers put the loss down to an act of God. I may have a suspicious mind, but does that mean that the insurers were not liable to pay out? Can my noble friend the Minister tell the House what the insurers' situation would be if the loss of the "Derbyshire" was due to either poor design or poor workmanship?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para25"></a>There is also the situation of the people lost at sea as a result of the "Derbyshire" loss. I am sure that we all grieve for their families. I applaud the campaign that the families have waged to find the truth. But there are other <P>


<a name="column_1464"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1464</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>horrors. What risks have been faced by the crews of the sister ships of the "Derbyshire", and others built to the same design and manufacturing standards? Do the Government have any figures for the number of ships and seafarers who come into that category? Further, can my noble friend advise the House how many of them have been lost or suffered severe structural problems? I think we are entitled to ask if insurers have a duty of care to the human beings involved in vessels, or types of vessels, similar to those that founder in unexplained circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para26"></a>There is also another avenue to explore. If it is not the insurers' responsibility to determine the facts of the case, either as a duty to their shareholders--or, is it "partners", in the Lloyd's sense?--or as a duty of care to the seafarers involved, is it the duty of the shipowner, the national government or the International Maritime Organisation to determine the facts? Who determines the facts in such cases? Here I believe that we all owe a great debt of gratitude to the various seafarers' unions that funded the original search for the wreck of the "Derbyshire", which was amazingly successful.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para27"></a>I hope that the Government can tell us today if they have received the second survey report--or, indeed, when they expect to receive it--and that they can advise us of what action they propose to take, particularly to ensure that the lessons are learned effectively and, most importantly, to protect the lives of seafarers in the future.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Murray of Epping Forest: </B>   My Lords, I confess that I do not know what caused the tragic loss of the MV "Derbyshire". I wholly agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, that the assessors must be given the time and the resources to do the job which they have accepted to do properly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para28"></a>However, as has already been said, I do know that it is 17 years since the ship went down with 42 seamen and two wives. I also know that their loss has caused deep and continuing grief to their families, who are desperately anxious to know what happened. I also know that it was the persistence of those families, sustained by the mutual support that they built in the Derbyshire Family Association and the practical help that they received from the maritime unions, that has led, at last--in the face of apathy at best and resistance at worst from government departments--to the present survey which at least holds out some hope of answering their question.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para29"></a>I do not propose to speculate on what form that answer will take. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon, to whom we are indebted for the debate, asked what lessons we could draw from the events which led up to the present survey. When the MV "Derbyshire" went down in September 1980, the dependants concerned had to get on with life and cope with their grieving as best they could. They tried to pressure the then Government to mount an inquiry. In May 1981, the Minister for Trade announced that a formal investigation was not warranted.

<A NAME = "71203-10_para30"></a>In the words of an article in The Times magazine of 20th September last,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government had better things to worry about than dead merchant seamen. Cargo ships ... were always sinking: they only became news if they polluted beaches, threatened wildlife or could be photographed, preferably breaking up dramatically against British rocks". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para31"></a>As has been said, this was not some clapped out rust bucket. As the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, said, this was the biggest British merchant ship ever lost--170,000 deadweight tonnes. It had been built in the UK four years previously. It was double-skinned and well maintained. It was owned in the UK by a reputable line. It was registered in the UK. It was classed with Lloyd's register. It was crewed by competent UK seafarers. However, its loss did not even warrant a formal investigation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para32"></a>There the matter would have rested had it not been for the stubborn determination of the families. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, has said tonight, and as he noted in his 1995 assessment,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The members of the MV 'Derbyshire' Family Association have played a major role in ensuring that the cause of the loss of the 'Derbyshire' is and remains a matter of public concern ... directly and indirectly their persistence has made a major contribution to the cause of maritime safety". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para33"></a>I hope the noble and learned Lord will forgive me for quoting from that assessment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para34"></a>As we have heard, it took the break-up of another sister ship, "The Kowloon Bridge", off Ireland in 1986 to jolt the Government into launching a formal investigation in October 1987. In spite of the key part played by the dependants in keeping the issue alive--because without them the issue would have been dead in the water--they were not even included in the list of interested parties. It was only after the intervention of the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers--in which I declare an interest as a trustee--that they were included. But even then they were refused assistance to obtain legal representation, which they obtained only because the maritime unions paid for it. NUMAST paid over a quarter of a million pounds. In the event the conclusions were unconvincing.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para35"></a>There the matter would have rested had not the trade unions again taken the initiative, as we have been reminded tonight. In March 1994 the International Transport Workers Federation agreed to provide the &#163;320,000 needed to fund a search for the wreckage. The results of that search persuaded, or rather shamed, the Government into inviting the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, to assess what further work should be undertaken. Your Lordships have, on previous occasions, paid tribute to the noble and learned Lord's report. However, as the noble and learned Lord has generously acknowledged, the real tribute should be paid to the families of those on the "Derbyshire" for refusing over all those years to take no for an answer.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para36"></a>What conclusion the experts will reach from their analysis of the 140,000 photographs and hundreds of hours of videos remains to be seen. However, if the issue is finally to be laid to rest, it will require--as has been said in this debate--more than an assessment by the three government experts. I am not suggesting for a <P>


<a name="column_1466"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1466</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>moment--I pick up a point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson--that the experts would misrepresent the facts or suppress the truth. But this has all gone on far too long and generated far too much suspicion--some demonstrably justified, some perhaps not--to be dealt with in an ex parte manner. As I have acknowledged, the assessors must be given the time and resources to do the job properly. So must the dependants. They must be given the time and resources to do their part of the job.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para37"></a>The first question I wish to echo--it has been put already to the Minister--is whether the Government will make the evidence available to bodies which have shown a valid interest, including the Derbyshire Family Association and the maritime unions, and whether they will financially assist the DFA and the unions to hire competent advisers to examine the evidence, and advise them on their judgment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para38"></a>Beyond that, this case history demonstrates the need to establish once and for all the right of the dependants and their representative unions to play a full part in future inquiries of this kind, and to make their contribution to reaching the conclusions which can bear on their rights to compensation as well as enabling them to come to terms with the tragedy of bereavement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para39"></a>When, during the inquest into the "Marchioness" disaster, it was ruled that legal aid was not available, the Lord Chancellor himself arranged for public funding of the families' legal representation. Similarly, the costs incurred by dependants in the "Piper Alpha" inquiry, to which my noble friend Lord Dean referred, were refunded. As it was put in the report of the "Piper Alpha" inquiry:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There are considerations of public policy in favour of not discouraging trade unions and other bodies and persons of limited resources from participation in public inquiries into matters of safety". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para40"></a>My second and concluding question to the Minister is whether she accepts that judicial recommendation, and whether she will ensure that legal assistance is provided automatically in future cases of this kind to dependants and their organisations.

<P>
<A NAME="71203-10_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, I apologise that in speaking late in the debate I shall almost inevitably repeat points made by previous speakers.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para41"></a>From my point of view, there are three stories which run through the 17-year history of events since the sinking of the "Derbyshire" in September 1980. The first is the story of the people involved: the 42 crew members and two wives who perished in the wreck, their surviving relatives in the DFA, the naval architects and other maritime experts who have taken up their cause, and the MPs and Members of your Lordships' House who have kept this issue alive in Parliament, in particular the noble Lord, Lord Dixon, both with the debate today and in former times when he was the honourable Member for Jarrow in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para42"></a>We should not forget that it was the DFA and its supporters which kept up the pressure for a formal inquiry into the wreck. It was they who increased that <P>


<a name="column_1467"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1467</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pressure following the wreck of the "Kowloon Bridge" in 1986. It was they who, despite the conclusion of the 1986 formal inquiry, maintained the need to consider the possibility that a design fault at No. 65 bulkhead might be the underlying cause of all the problems experienced by the Bridge class. It was they who persuaded the International Transport Workers Federation to fund the expedition which found the wreck of the "Derbyshire" in 1994. And it is they who have the greatest personal interest in the report which we discuss today.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para43"></a>It is beyond question that the Derbyshire Family Association and its supporters feel that they have received less than their due in the long years since the loss of the crew of the "Derbyshire". The noble Lord, Lord Murray of Epping Forest, has referred to the very different treatment in terms of funding which they have received compared with other family members of persons injured in other types of disaster. Their expert advisers and supporters have not been called upon to give evidence. They have not been able to pursue any claim against the shipbuilder or the shipowner. They have on too many occasions learned important news from the press rather than directly from the Department of Transport. Their confidence in government has been damaged by their experiences.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para44"></a>Like others, I wish to ask the Government whether they will give the DFA a sight of the report of the second survey of the wreck site before it is published, and whether they will assist the DFA with the circulation of the technical report to its members.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para45"></a>Secondly, there is the story of the ships themselves--six giants of the Bridge class, built by Swan Hunter, which was then in public ownership, during the 1970s. Of the six, two foundered, the "Derbyshire" in 1980, when it was only four years old, and the "Kowloon Bridge" in 1986. The third, the "Tyne Bridge" returned to port when its master heard cracking noises coming from somewhere forward of the superstructure during bad weather. Serious cracking and misalignment in the area of No. 65 bulkhead were discovered, together with the evidence of an earlier repair. The Italian classification society concerned recommended the introduction of continuous plating through No. 65 bulkhead and a greater thickness of deck plating in that area. In effect, a partial redesign of a particular part of the ship was demanded and undertaken as a condition of further insurance.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para46"></a>In 1982, two further members of the class--the "Alexander Glen" and the "Cast Kittiwake"--were inspected and modified in the same way as the "Tyne Bridge". In effect, all three of those ships, it is suggested, were returned to something nearer the original design of the vessels which was registered with Lloyd's.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para47"></a>One of the mysteries surrounding the sinking of the "Derbyshire" and the subsequent decisions following the preliminary inquiry in 1980 and the formal inquiry in 1986 is whether the modified design was registered at Lloyd's and, if so, where it is now.
<P>


<a name="column_1468"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1468</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para48"></a>In the light of all this experience with faults in the sister ships, it seems extraordinary that it was not until the exploratory expedition funded by the ITWF actually located part of the wreck in 1994 that the possibility that the sinking of the "Derbyshire" was caused by faults in design was given any public credence by the Government or by inspectors at the two inquiries.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para49"></a>Another aspect of the story has been the fact that marine inspectors and others with expertise were not called to give evidence at the inquiries. As a result, the previous Government have been accused, however unfairly, of a cover-up or of a bias against the surviving relatives.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para50"></a>Obviously, we cannot today anticipate the result of the recent survey or of any conclusions which may flow from it. But a number of questions can legitimately be asked and answered today, I hope. First, are the Government likely to convene another inquiry or to reopen the previous inquiry following consideration of the report? If so, will the widest possible trawl be made for expert evidence and will the DFA receive any support--financial support, that is--for their representation at such an inquiry? Can the Government confirm that Her Majesty's Government stand by their decision to bear responsibility for any claims against the shipbuilders that might arise, as was stated at the time of the privatisation of Swan Hunter? Can the Minister reassure those who are waiting to learn how this Government will handle the case that they will approach it in a spirit of openness, fairness and generosity?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para51"></a>The last theme that has run through these 17 years is that of safety at sea. Of course, we have in this House in the person of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson of Lymington, an acknowledged expert in the field and one who has made a unique contribution to policy-making on these issues. I am very much indebted to him for the work that he does in informing us all of progress, however partial, towards improving safety at sea.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para52"></a>I shall not repeat his arguments or the many statements on the need to improve the safety of ships and of their crews which have been made in connection with the loss of the "Derbyshire". Suffice it to say that this case raises a number of very important issues to which speakers have referred already and, in particular, the degree to which lessons learnt from accidents at sea are applied to ship design. It is striking, to me at any rate, that faults in the design or performance of aircraft--metal fatigue, for example--are taken on board not just by the manufacturer of that particular aircraft but by all manufacturers. The "Derbyshire" was one of a rather experimental class of very large cargo vessels yet, as I understand it, it was not put through the same kind of rigorous trials as modern or experimental aircraft have to undertake. Finally, for a number of reasons, there is no ship certification process in existence which has the worldwide force of the aircraft certification process.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para53"></a>I acknowledge that there has been considerable progress in other matters affecting safety at sea; for example, the more demanding port inspection procedures instituted under the Paris Memorandum of <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Understanding and supported by a 1994 EU directive, and the greater exigency of the more important classification societies. But have the Government consulted with experts or received advice or formed a view as to how, given the fragmented state of the shipping and shipbuilding industry by comparison with the aircraft and airlines industry, it will be possible to ensure that shipbuilders take due care in launching new types of ship and learn from the mistakes of others? Is there any action that the IMO, for example, can take in that respect?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para54"></a>The safety record of bulk carriers is sufficiently poor and the number of lives lost in accidents involving them sufficiently great, even in the past few years, to make it a matter of urgent concern that everything possible should be done to improve the safety of merchant vessels and particularly bulk carriers and their crews.

<A NAME="71203-10_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Inglewood: </B>   My Lords, in his opening remarks, the noble Lord, Lord Dean of Beswick, congratulated the noble Lord, Lord Dixon, on asking this Question, for he raised a matter of wide-scale and important public interest. That reflects his long-standing concern and interest in this matter, going back to his responsibilities for his constituents when he was a Member of the other place and relying on his knowledge and first-hand experience of the shipbuilding industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para55"></a>As we are now late in the evening I do not want to be repetitious and go over ground already covered, particularly in relation to the chronology of this matter, which was spelt out in some detail by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon, and my noble friend Lord Caldecote. That was supplemented by the extremely valuable contribution from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, talking to us about the work that he has done on the inquiry into this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para56"></a>As has already been mentioned this evening, when we were in government we instigated the second survey following the recommendations which were made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson. Reference has also been made to the role played by the Derbyshire Family Association in taking forward this matter; in trying to establish what actually took place in this sad and tragic accident on the high seas.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para57"></a>It is understandable that the Family Association wished to have a close involvement with the second inquiry. But, as my noble friend Lord Goschen said on behalf of the government at that time and as was reiterated by my then honourable friend Mr. Stephen Norris in the other place, the government were concerned about the integrity of the investigation. While they understood the Family Association's disappointment at not having greater control and/or involvement in the inquiry, they felt strongly--I believe rightly--that it must be the prime interest of all the parties involved that the expedition and any subsequent assessment and analysis of what was discovered should not be impugned for partiality, or on the basis of procedural irregularity or by virtue of some possible breach of the rules of natural justice.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para58"></a>A number of important points have already been raised this evening. Again, I do not want to delay your Lordships by repeating them; I merely record that I, as much as anybody else in the Chamber this evening, am anxious to hear the replies that the noble Baroness, for the Government, may be able to give us later. However, it is important that we look at this matter from the position of where we are now. As has already been said, the story is already a long one. While it is helpful in clarifying and elucidating the position, we must not become bogged down in what is essentially history.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para59"></a>In particular, the questions I should like to ask the noble Baroness are, first, whether she knows when the report of the inquiry will be published. Secondly, is the analysis of the findings of that inquiry to be published simultaneously? If not, can she say when it will be published? Thirdly--a point raised by a number of other speakers--what opportunity, if any, will be given to those who wish to comment or take issue either with the findings or with the conclusions reached? What help, if any, will be provided to assist those families who, in one way or another, are so closely associated with the tragedy that occurred?
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para60"></a>I echo most strongly the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, when he emphasised that this matter must not be rushed. After all, as he said, we have only one opportunity to carry out this inquiry and this analysis, and it is important that we achieve the right answer--right both in terms of being factually correct and right in terms of justice. But, equally, in seeking the truth, we must not be delayed simply gratuitously.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para61"></a>When this chapter has been concluded it is important that, as far as we can, we know what happened in the case of this disaster. We must also know, if we possibly can, why those things actually happened. Certainly consequences flow from that. What are the consequences of what occurred both in legal and other terms? Finally--and this is perhaps the most important aspect of the whole story--what lessons should be learnt and what steps should be taken by governments and by others involved in the industry to ensure that such an accident does not happen again?

<P>
<A NAME="71203-10_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, in replying to this short but valuable debate, I am conscious that I am joining others who have a long-standing and detailed interest in the subject. I pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Dixon for the way in which he introduced the debate and to other noble Lords for their contributions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para62"></a>In replying, I am aware that we are debating the issue on the same day as the report of the international inquiry into the 1994 "Estonia" disaster is published. The timing properly serves as a reminder to the House that the sea can be a cruel and dangerous place. At the beginning of my reply I should like to extend my condolences to the families who were bereaved by the deaths of the 42 crew members and the two wives who were on board the "Derbyshire".
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para63"></a>I shall do my best to reply to the points that have been made. However, perhaps I may say in direct reply to my noble friend's Question that the Government have <P>


<a name="column_1471"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1471</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not yet received the report of the assessors on the second survey of the wreck of the "Derbyshire". However, I now have the opportunity to inform noble Lords of the progress that has been made, to address some of the issues and, I hope, to give the House an idea of what is likely to happen next and of the way forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para64"></a>However, before doing so, I should like to pay tribute to the efforts of the Derbyshire Family Association, which has succeeded in keeping the tragedy in the public eye for all those long years and for ensuring, as my noble friend pointed out, that the circumstances of the ship's loss were fully investigated. It was through the association's efforts that the International Transport Federation funded an expedition which successfully located the wreck in 1994. That was a remarkable achievement, considering the slim chances of success. In his independent assessment of the matter in 1995, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, also praised the work of the association.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para65"></a>His report recommended that a second extended and last examination of the wreck be undertaken. He concluded that the likely cost would be fully justified in the light of the potential benefits to ship safety. That conclusion was accepted by the previous Administration and in June 1996 they announced that the return expedition would take place in two phases: the preliminary survey to be followed by the main survey. The costs of the expedition were shared with the European Commission. Three naval architects, who are also leading experts in the analysis of ship wreckage, were commissioned to act as assessors. Two were appointed by the Government and one by the European Commission. I have to say at this point that I know that the Derbyshire Family Association wanted to be part of that expedition. This Government wish that they had been able to be so.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para66"></a>However, the previous Administration decided that only the independent assessors and their supporting team should take part. All the interested parties were, however, subsequently invited to a colloquium in March 1996 and to other briefings to discuss the planning and execution of the expedition and the appointment of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. This American research organisation already had extensive experience of examining wrecks at ocean depth.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para67"></a>An important aspect in the planning, execution and analysis of the data was, and continues to be, that all possible loss scenarios are thoroughly researched without prejudice. I believe that is the point that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, made. Where possible, the evidence collected will be used to support or refute each scenario as a possible cause of the sinking.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para68"></a>Phase One, the preliminary survey, took place in July 1996 and succeeded in locating, and positively identifying, the stern of the vessel, tested the technical feasibility of the project, and confirmed the findings of the ITF survey.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para69"></a>Phase Two occurred in March and April this year and returned with a mass of new material for examination comprising some 200,000 photographs and 4,000 hours <P>


<a name="column_1472"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1472</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of video footage. Samples of the evidence have been shown to the interested parties by the assessors who have also explained their methods of analysis. When necessary, the assessors have been assisted by other widely-respected experts who have contributed their specialist knowledge to the assessment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para70"></a>I have to say to the House that the assessor's report has taken longer to compile than was originally envisaged. I believe that several noble Lords who contributed to the debate remarked how important it is that we get the process right. We need to ensure that the distress and uncertainty caused over the years has been resolved. The survey was remarkably successful in providing useful images of the wreck, which have yielded a great deal of information that has had to be analysed. The emphasis throughout this project has been on the thorough investigation of all possible loss scenarios and to obtain as much information as possible from the available evidence.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para71"></a>My noble friend Lord Dixon asked about the retrieval of wreckage. The assessors based their survey on photographs of the wreckage. There was, and is, no proven method of cutting and recovering from the depth involved. The cutting equipment designed for the expedition failed, but alternative means were found to validate the detailed photographs. My noble friend also raised the issue of the resignation of Professor Faulkner, one of the assessors. He submitted his resignation for personal reasons. However, as was made clear from the correspondence that my noble friend referred to, he was well aware of our concerns about certain of his public statements in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para72"></a>As regards timing--that was an issue raised by several noble Lords tonight--I am pleased to be able to report to the House that the assessors have nearly completed their work. It remains for them to draw their conclusions and prepare their report. In answer to the specific question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, and others, the report is expected to be published early in the New Year. It will be published in full and without censorship. I say that in response to a direct question that was asked. The Government have given an assurance--and this is another issue on which a specific assurance was asked for by the noble Viscount, Lord Caldecote, and others--that the Derbyshire Family Association and other interested parties will be given advance copies of the report before it is published. In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Walliswood, the Derbyshire Family Association will be assisted with the distribution of the report as well. Following the publication of the report, the Government will then make arrangements for each of the interested parties to be granted access to the data.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para73"></a>Owing to the almost unique status of some of the equipment needed to view the photographic images, access to the data can only be given on the premises of the department. It is anticipated that the interested parties will wish to undertake their own analyses and to compare these with the findings of the assessors. The Government will facilitate these analyses by providing help in the retrieval and presentation of the images. However, I have to say that it will not be possible to provide funds to pay for technical analysis of the <P>


<a name="column_1473"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1473</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>information on behalf of any of the interested parties, because this money would have to be made available to all the interested parties.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para74"></a>The issue as to whether it was necessary to have an independent analysis of the data funded by the Government was raised. I think it would be prudent to wait until we have had the opportunity to consider what the assessors have to say. It would not be helpful to dismiss their report in advance before it has been submitted. This is an issue that we wish to approach in an open way and, as I have said, a full account will be made available and there will be no question of censorship.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para75"></a>During the time the interested parties are expected to undertake their own analysis the Government will be considering the report of the assessors in deciding whether or not it would be right to reopen the formal investigation into the loss of the "Derbyshire". The report of the previous formal investigation was published in 1989 and concluded, as many of your Lordships may have noted, that the ship was probably overwhelmed by the forces of nature in a typhoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para76"></a>Several speakers who have spoken tonight have recorded the deep-seated concerns there were at that conclusion. The Government will decide whether to reopen the formal investigation on the basis of whether new and important evidence has been found which substantially adds to or challenges the findings of the original investigation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para77"></a>I hope that noble Lords will understand that I cannot prejudge the decision of the Government about reopening the formal investigation prior to the publication of the assessors' report. However, my noble friend Lord Dixon asked whether, if that investigation were to be reopened, we would consider that inquiry taking place in Liverpool. I can give him the assurance that in the event of a formal investigation being reopened we would consider that suggestion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para78"></a>My noble friend Lord Monkswell asked about the decision of the insurers in respect of the loss of the ship. The insurers have paid the full claim for the loss of the <P>


<a name="column_1474"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column 1474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>ship and they may wish to seek to recover the moneys paid from any party whose actions led to the loss. It will be a matter for the insurers to pursue, if they consider there is sufficient evidence to pursue their claim through the civil courts. My noble friend also asked about the ships similar to the "Derbyshire", the number that were lost and the number of crew involved. I have to say that, although many bulk carriers have been lost, of the "Derbyshire"'s sister ships only the "Kowloon Bridge" was lost at sea and all her crew were rescued. The other four sister ships worked until they were scrapped.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para79"></a>My noble friend Lord Dean of Beswick has raised the issue of the availability of legal aid in the event of the formal inquiry being reopened. Legal aid is only available under the legal aid rules in criminal and limited civil cases. The point was raised regarding the view of the inspector following the precedent referred to by my noble friend Lord Murray, and the views of Lord Cullen following the "Piper Alpha" disaster. It is up to the individual inspector to make his own decision, but in doing so he would no doubt have regard to the views of Lord Cullen as expressed following the "Piper Alpha" tragedy and its investigation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para80"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas, asked about the action we are taking to ensure safety at sea generally; and my noble friend Lord Monkswell asked who was responsible for safety. Ultimately the ship's flag's state is responsible but all the involved parties--owners, crews, insurers, cargo owners, builders, repairers and classification societies--must play their part in imposing and maintaining safety standards. We shall be working through the International Maritime Organisation to ensure that new ships are designed and built to the highest safety standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203-10_para81"></a>What is already clear from the survey is that it has set a new standard in the retrieval of information from sunken wrecks for accident investigation purposes. It has returned valuable information which it is important that we use properly to investigate what actually happened to the "Derbyshire" and also to contribute to wider efforts to improve safety at sea.

<A NAME="71203w01_wqn9"></A><B> Lord Lester of Herne Hill </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL> Further to the Answer by Lord Williams of Mostyn on 20 November 1997 (H.L. Deb., cols. 742-744) whether they consider that it is clear under the criminal law of homicide as currently declared by the courts that a doctor treating a terminally ill patient has a defence to a prima facie case of murder based on foresight of consequences, where the jury is satisfied (i) that the doctor administered the treatment in good faith for the purpose of relieving his patient's pain, suffering and severe distress; (ii) the treatment was given with the patient's inferred consent; and (iii) the treatment given accorded with good medical practice.<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203w01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The Government consider that the law is clear. The intentional killing of another person can be prosecuted as murder. Treatment intended to cause death rather than alleviate pain and distress is, and should remain, unlawful. However, it is lawful to provide treatment which is intended to reduce pain and suffering, but which may shorten life, subject to the usual requirements regarding patient consent.

<FONT SIZE=3>Committee and Standing Nursing and Midwifery Advisory Committee published a report in 1992 on the Principles and Provision of Palliative Care. The National Council for Hospices and Specialist Palliative Care Services, working with the then Clinical Outcomes Group in the Department of Health's NHS Executive, has produced a document entitled Managing Cancer Pain in Adults. A further document, Changing Gear--care of people in the last few days of life, is to be published shortly. In addition, as part of the implementation of the policy framework for improved cancer services, a series of guidance documents on site specific cancers is being produced by a group chaired by Professor Bob Howard and disseminated by the
NHS Executive. Each of these will include guidance on care for the terminally ill. Improving Outcomes in Breast Cancer and Improving Outcomes in Colorectal Cancer have already been published. Copies of these documents will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203w01_para4"></a>All doctors training at undergraduate and postgraduate level learn about the principles of caring for the dying as part of their medical training and also about the legal and ethical implications.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203w01_para5"></a>Doctors training for a career in hospitals will be in contact with terminally ill patients to a greater or lesser degree depending upon the specialties in which they train and some doctors choose to receive specialty training in palliative care. 
<P>

<A NAME = "71203w01_para6"></a>Those doctors intending to enter general practice will, during their year of general practice training, regularly see patients with terminal illnesses and will learn about their treatment. Trainee general practitioners may well also see patients with terminal illnesses during their two-year hospital rotation. Additionally, doctors are expected to continue with their medical education after qualification and they will spend some of this time learning about the illnesses and conditions they most commonly encounter.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203w01_para7"></a>The medical education curriculum is a matter for the medical schools in collaboration with the General Medical Council's Education Committee, which has a statutory responsibility to determine the extent of the knowledge and skill required for the granting of primary medical qualifications in the UK, and the relevant Medical Royal Colleges and, in the case of general practice, the Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice. All of these have an interest in ensuring that doctors are equipped to deal with the problems they will encounter in practice--both in hospital and in general practice. It is not however practicable or desirable for the Government to prescribe the exact training that any individual doctor will receive.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203w01_para8"></a>Nurses also receive training at pre-and post-registration levels about the principles of caring for the dying as part of their medical training and also about the ethical implications. Within pre-registration nursing programmes, the Common Foundation element addresses issues of nursing patients with terminal illnesses and associated ethical and moral implications. Many pre-registration nurses will have the opportunity to experience a clinical placement within settings

The review is due to report to Ministers next year.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203w02_para0"></a>There is no provision in current legislation for pharmacists to supply prescription only medicines to a patient following a telephoned request from a dentist. We are not aware that this is a widespread problem.

<P>
<A NAME="71203w02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   The estimate of

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71203w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions   (Baroness Hayman): </B>  We have today published a new Departmental Circular No. 16/97 (Welsh Office 62/97) which gives local authorities guidance on the conduct of compulsory competitive tendering (CCT).
<P>

<A NAME = "71203w02_para4"></a>The guidance reflects the new regulations on CCT laid before Parliament on 21 November. These amended <P>


<a name="column_WA198"></a>

<B>3 Dec 1997 : Column WA198</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the existing framework for CCT in England and Wales to make it more flexible and encourage local authorities to move to a Best Value-based approach to service delivery. The new guidance will alow authorities to pursue the principles of Best Value in a manner consistent with the purpose of the CCT legislation (that is, that local authorities only carry out work if they do so competitively) and provide more flexibility to tendering.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203w02_para5"></a>A draft of the guidance formed part of a package of proposed changes to CCT which went out to consultation on 25 July. The new circular takes account of the views of 112 local authorities and related organisations, professional bodies and private sector interests who responded specifically to the draft. A further 19 responses were received by the Welsh Office. Copies of the responses are held in the DETR's library.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203w02_para6"></a>The guidance sets out the Government's views on how CCT should be carried out in the period before Best Value is implemented. It emphasises the importance of ensuring that competition is undertaken in an open and transparent manner and that service users and service providers are consulted on the level and standard of services to be provided. Local authorities should secure services which are economic, effective and efficient and in which considerations of price and quality are properly balanced. Competing bids need to be evaluated objectively and authorities need to deal fairly with potential contractors to ensure that tendering practice does not advantage any one potential supplier or suppliers.
<P>

<A NAME = "71203w02_para7"></a>The new guidance applies immediately to those services currently subject to CCT. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State will take into account the extent to which there has been a contravention of the guidance in determining whether or not authorities have acted anti-competitively.
