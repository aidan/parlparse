My right honourable friend gave detailed consideration of the proposal in his reply. He concluded that the major questions are already being addressed; for example, by the joint review of the use of restraint in juvenile secure settings. For that reason, a public inquiry would not be justified.</p>

Any death of a child in custody is of course very much to be regretted. The aim of the Youth Justice Board is to do everything it can to ensure that that does not happen in the future and that those children are properly cared for and protected.</p>

Will the Government publish the review and, if so, when? Given that the review was set up in response to concerns that emerged during the inquest on the restraint-related death of Gareth Myatt, why have the Government still not formally responded to the rule 43 report by the deputy coroner, Judge Pollard?</p>

I understand that the review is due to report to Ministers by April this year. The chairs are consulting a wide range of stakeholders before reporting. Ministers will then consider the conclusions and make any decisions regarding what action needs to be taken and any publication.</p>

We have now had a request from the noble Lord, Lord Judd, for a further inquiry into these matters following the Government&#146;s own review of restraint and other matters. Bearing in mind the chaos that seems to exist in the Minister&#146;s department, the Ministry of Justice, does he not think that it might be better if we just took away the whole of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, went home early, and the Government thought out these matters slightly better and came back with some considered proposals?</p>

The Ministry of Justice is an excellent department, which is making a great deal of sense in co-ordinating its different responsibilities. We should not ignore the improvements that have been made in relation to young people in the criminal justice system. As I said yesterday, over our many happy hours of debate, there is a lot more that also needs to happen. However, I think that the Bill is perfectly ordered and rounded and we should proceed swiftly to take it through your Lordships' House so that we can get it on the statute book.</p>

I invite him also to agree that that means that the use of strip-searching and segregation in the criminal justice system for children is something that needs a very sharp examination, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, recommended in his report for the Howard League a couple of years ago.</p>

With regard to strip-searching, I understand that the Youth Justice Board plans to have a review of it very shortly&#151;and obviously we would be very interested to see the outcome. The principal objective of the youth justice system has to be the prevention of offending, because it is within the criminal justice system. However, alongside that, of course the welfare considerations of the child must also be considered.</p>

The last time that it came here, it produced an absolutely devastating report and an indictment of the way in which we were looking after young people. In view of all that has been said in relation to the Bill and other aspects, is the Minister confident that this time we shall receive a clean slate from the committee?</p>

All I will say is that in relation to restraint we have established the review, and we should see what the outcome is. We have debated the issue extensively and I suspect that this afternoon we will debate it more. We are committed to a youth justice system that has as its principal aim the reduction and prevention of offending. It does take account of the welfare of the child, with a lot of emphasis on rehabilitation, and resettlement in the case of those young people who have gone into custody, but with much more emphasis on community sentences when that is appropriate. That is very much the way forward.</p>

For example, before granting a licence to release grey squirrels, Natural England takes into account geographical information on the presence or likely presence of the red squirrel.</p>

In his reply to the Question on grey squirrels asked by the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, on 23 January, he emphasised that only six squirrels have been released. However, is he aware of Joan Ruddock&#146;s letter to Mr Adam Afriyie in another place on 18 December in which, as Minister with responsibility for policy in this area, she states that Natural England granted licences for 257 greys to be released in 2007? Releasing six grey squirrels is surely a very different thing from granting licences to release 257.</p>

<a name="80206-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="08020684000025"></a>According to figures from Defra and the Forestry Commission, 257 breeding greys will produce about 1,800 squirrels in one year&#151;about the same number as that managed by the employee whom I employ to kill squirrels in protecting SSSI woodland. So why in another place has the Minister with responsibility for policy in this area gone against the published views of Defra, Natural England, the Forestry Commission and our legal obligations under the Berne convention and the EU habitats and birds directives?</p>

When I answered the Question a couple of weeks ago, I answered the Question I had been asked about how many licences had been issued. I went on to talk about how many squirrels had actually been released. The two things are not necessarily the same. In 2006, for example, 147 squirrels were permitted to be released, but only six were released. The figure which the noble Lord gave on the number of licences issued does not necessarily represent the number of squirrels released under those licences. Natural England may not have allowed it for some reason. So there is probably no problem at all with the figures; one has to look at what one is asking. The latest year for which we have figures on releases of squirrels is 2006, and the figure is six, but more than six licences were issued.</p>

Any thought of releasing grey squirrels on the Isle of Wight might make the islanders rise up in rebellion. In asking this supplementary question, I should perhaps declare an interest as the owner of a border terrier which is allergic to all squirrels irrespective of colour.</p>

So if anyone wants to see red squirrels, the Isle of Wight is the place to go. There are no greys on the Isle of Wight and, what is more, no greys are allowed. That is the reality.</p>

I sympathise with the Minister&#146;s view and hesitancy about taking action against red squirrels in most of the south of England. But in the north of England it is a different problem. Does he agree that we need to create buffer zones in the vicinity of the red squirrels so that they might survive? Has he had time to review my suggestion that no licences for the release of grey squirrels should be issued in the four northern counties, parts of north Yorkshire and the county of Lancaster?</p>

However, with regard to what he asked me a couple of weeks ago, I can inform the House that Natural England and the Forestry Commission have looked into the matter, which is hardly surprising given that my noble friend is chairman of the Forestry Commission. Natural England has now decided to make a change on a precautionary basis and to increase the buffer zone around the nearby refuges in the north of England. The change will come into force immediately and any existing licences that cover that area will be reissued. I am grateful to my noble friend for asking the original question.</p>

We are certainly happy to review that success. We need to build on it. However, since I last answered the Question, I have also discovered the famous Wild Boar Hotel at Crook near Windermere.

I think that that is not unreasonable. They are released only in areas where they are not a danger to songbirds, to forestry or to red squirrels, and welfare grounds are taken into account when licences are issued. As far as I know, there has been no adverse reaction to the release of those six.</p>

In view of the reduction in staff that Defra is seeking, would it not be a good idea if the Government decided that squirrels are vermin and that they should not be saved under any circumstances, thereby saving a great deal of staffing in Defra?</p>

Natural England is the operator of the Wildlife and Countryside Act and it is a non-departmental public body. It deals with all kinds of wildlife, both in licensing and in determining what action should be taken. Frankly, this probably adds up to a few paragraphs of work a day for someone. I repeat, however, that more licences are issued than squirrels released.</p>

For example, only one-third of councillors are women and only 4 per cent of councillors come from black and ethnic minority groups. We really need to do more.

The report ends by asking, &#147;Why don&#146;t they say so?&#148;. That is surely the best incentive to get people into local government. In terms of how much it would cost, there are a range of proposals, from reducing the voting age to 16, to much else, which will be considered in due course, perhaps by a Speaker&#146;s Commission. When we review these, we will look at affordability, together with all the legal and other implications that the recommendations hold for us.</p>

The report indicates that in a number of ways. Is it not also about the problem of ordinary people in society not knowing how to use a councillor? One of the problems in our political system is that people often think that they must go to their Member of Parliament first because they see them as being at the top of the pyramid of power, instead of recognising that in many cases the first port of call should be the councillor. That is a difficult link to make. It is not apparent to me from the report that we are addressing that in the detail that is needed.</p>

One of the paradoxes is that while 60 per cent of people think that their services have improved, only half think that their council is better. This is about closing that gap. A lot of it is about how we explain and get more out of the work of councillors, particularly ward councillors, who now have a duty to engage with and involve local people.</p>

The report addressed that and said that local government is no less important or interesting a place for councillors to be.

Doubts are left as to the real outcome of that election and we can have no confidence in a government formed on the basis of the announced election results. The EU observers, as well as those of the Commonwealth and others, have all made it clear that the elections fell far short of acceptable international standards.

On the delivery of humanitarian relief, does the noble Lord agree that the obstruction of relief in western Kenya by the continuing violence there and the interruption of supplies from neighbouring countries through the port of Mombasa might warrant the referral of Kenya to the Security Council as a threat to peace?</p>

First, the Annan panel has already dealt with the humanitarian issues. Both sides have committed to the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission, to agree an invitation to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to send an investigation team to visit Kenya, and to the right of freedom of expression and assembly, which led immediately to the lifting of the ban on live broadcasts. They have also committed to the need to deal with the resettlement of those displaced and the provision of adequate security. The talks have now moved on to the more difficult political issues. I spoke to Kofi Annan a few hours ago. He said that both sides had made their opening political presentations and he felt that the hard bargaining would continue this afternoon.</p>

Does he agree that there has been a tendency, particularly in the British press, to take sides and to depict Mr Raila Odinga as the wronged party, whereas, of course, there is major skulduggery on both sides? Therefore, would he counsel that we not only avoid taking sides but that we avoid any further encouragement of massive demonstrations, as some of us argued from the start, because such demonstrations lead yet again to more bloodshed and more horror and that the concentration should be, as he rightly says, on urging some kind of government coalition and coming together of the two parties, so that they can counsel both of their tribal followers&#151;Luo and Kikuyu&#151;to stop killing each other?</p>

In a situation in which 1,000 have been killed and 300,000 displaced, it seems inappropriate to move immediately to elections. There needs to be a cooling off period. Trust needs to be restored. While the conduct of the election is the immediate trigger to the violence, there are underlying causes and, I suspect, as the noble Lord suggests, certainly plenty of blame to be attributed to both sides. Hence the importance of an investigation by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and of a truth and reconciliation commission to assign blame where blame is due.</p>

<a name="08020684000065"></a><b><a name="80206-0002.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08020684000348"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Ashton of Upholland):</b> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. The Statement is as follows:</p>
&#147;The Government are today publishing the results of work on the use of communications intercepts as evidence: the report of the committee of privy counsellors, drawn from the three major parties chaired by the right honourable Sir John Chilcot GCB. I am grateful to Sir John, Lord Hurd, Lord Archer of Sandwell and the right honourable Member for Berwick for that report. It is thorough, measured, detailed, and unanimous; and it properly reflects both the seriousness and the complexity of the questions that their committee was asked to address. &#147;Let me again pay tribute to our security agencies for all that they do&#151;quietly and effectively&#151;in the defence of our country. I have met and listened to those who lead our agencies, and many who serve in them and I praise their expertise, professionalism and courage, often in the most testing and dangerous of circumstances, but always in the best interests of our country. I acknowledge&#151;as we all acknowledge&#151;that what they do defends our freedom, protects our society, and saves lives. &#147;The use of intercept in evidence characterises a central dilemma that we face as a free society: that of preserving our liberties and the rule of law, while at the same time keeping our nation safe and secure. In July, in the first Statement I made on security to the House, I said that I favoured the principle of using intercept material as evidence in criminal cases if, but only if, a way could be found to do so while protecting the higher interests of national security. I therefore invited the cross-party Chilcot committee to advise on, <ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="08020684000274"></a>&#145;whether a regime to allow the use of intercepted material in court can be devised that facilitates bringing cases to trial while meeting the overall imperative to safeguard national security&#146;.</p>
</ul> &#147;Today I am publishing a version of the Chilcot committee's report. The committee itself has prepared this version, which omits, in the interests of national security, certain sensitive facts and arguments. Its main conclusions and recommendations, however, are exactly those of the full report. Briefly, the report examines in detail both the potential benefits of accepting intercept as evidence, and the risks that might arise from such acceptance. However, it concludes that it should be possible to find a way to use some intercept material as evidence, provided&#151;and only provided&#151;that certain key conditions can be met. These conditions relate to the most vital imperative of all, that of safeguarding our national security. The Government accept this recommendation and take the accompanying conditions very seriously. &#147;Intercepts are strictly controlled under the 2000 legislation. Interception is allowed only if it is necessary to obtain information which could not  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1058"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1058</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be acquired in another way, and any interception must be proportionate to what it seeks to achieve. &#147;The relevant decisions of Ministers are overseen by a senior judge, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, who reports at least annually. An investigatory powers tribunal exists to consider complaints from the public and has powers to order appropriate remedies. The most recent figures for numbers of interception warrants are contained in the Interception Commissioner&#146;s annual report, published on 28 January&#151;1,435 intercept warrants were issued in the last nine months of 2006. That compares with 2,407 in the previous 15 months.&#147;The Chilcot report notes that there are already limited circumstances in civil and terrorist proceedings where intercept can be used in evidence. Each of these instances includes appropriate protections, such as closed proceedings, to ensure that the use of intercept does not put our national security at risk. For any new regime, the Chilcot report sets down conditions which start from the proposition that,<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="08020684000275"></a>&#145;any material risk to the strategic capability of the UK&#146;s intelligence agencies would be unacceptable&#146;,</p>
</ul>and,<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08020684000276"></a>&#145;any disclosure of interception capabilities could have a profound impact on national security&#146;.</p>
</ul>This is right.&#147;The report also says that any resulting reduction in inter-agency co-operation,<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08020684000277"></a>&#145;could have a profound impact on law enforcement agencies&#146; ability to combat serious crime and terrorism in the UK&#146;.</p>
</ul>The Government also agree with that assessment. &#147;The report sets out nine conditions in detail. These relate to complex and important issues, including: giving the intercepting agencies the ability to retain control over whether their material is used in prosecutions; ensuring that disclosure of material cannot be required against the wishes of the agency originating the material; protecting the current close co-operation between intelligence and law enforcement agencies, which is crucial; and ensuring also that agencies cannot be required to transcribe or make notes of material beyond a standard of detail they deem necessary. &#147;The committee, which reported to us, acknowledges that further extensive work is needed to see whether and how these and other conditions, which are intended to protect sensitive techniques, safeguard resources, and ensure that intercept can still be used effectively for intelligence, can be met. This is a unanimous recommendation that the Government accept. We will proceed to develop a detailed implementation plan under which material might be made available to be used in criminal cases in England and Wales, subject&#151;and strictly subject&#151;to meeting all the Chilcot conditions.&#147;The report is clear that if the conditions could not be met then intercept as evidence should not be introduced, and the Government accept that. Similarly, the committee recommends that, in the event of a regime being introduced which later fails to meet the Chilcot conditions or otherwise threatens  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1059"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1059</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>our security, that regime should be removed pending the introduction of another, under which the conditions can once again be met. The Government also accept that recommendation. &#147;The report also states that the committee has seen no evidence to suggest that the need for measures such as control orders would be reduced by the introduction of intercept as evidence. Designing a regime to meet the Chilcot conditions will require, as the committee notes, a substantial programme of work covering legal, operational and technical issues. This work must involve and engage the intelligence agencies, government departments, the legal system, and those responsible for communications.&#147;The Chilcot team has made it clear to me that the necessary work should be led by an implementation team within government and that that team should move ahead comprehensively and quickly. But the team has also told me that it would not expect the work to be concluded in time to inform the Counter-Terrorism Bill currently before Parliament. &#147;The Government strongly believe that it is in the national interest to draw on a wide range of expert external advice. The cross-party nature of the Chilcot report has been of great value. I am therefore grateful for the agreement of opposition parties that Sir John Chilcot, Lord Archer of Sandwell, the right honourable Member for Berwick, and another member to be nominated, will advise on privy counsellor terms during the next stage of the work. &#147;The Chilcot report also notes that communications technology is changing, and changing rapidly, with the switch towards internet protocol communications and the clear implications that that brings for our security. Accordingly, we have launched the interception modernisation programme to update our capability to ensure that under these new circumstances our national interests will continue to be protected. The new regime for intercept as evidence must be designed to work safely and effectively for this new capability too. &#147;As the Chilcot report states, the challenges ahead are complex and must not, and will not, be underestimated, but the Government acknowledge and endorse the valuable work of the Chilcot committee and are grateful for the committee&#146;s support in our continuing efforts to meet the double challenge that we face as a nation. The challenge is to at all times and without fail protect our nation&#146;s security while advancing the rule of law. This we will always seek to do. I commend this Statement to the House.&#148;

<a name="80206-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="08020684000068"></a>Many will wonder why the Government did not act earlier on the issue on the noble and learned Lord&#146;s advice rather than waiting for the work of not only this committee but now yet another one to come. Perhaps the Government should consult more with the noble and learned Lord. I also join the noble Baroness in thanking the committee, most notably the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, and my noble friend Lord Hurd of Westwell. As the House will know, my party has for some time advocated the admissibility of intercept evidence in court. It was my right honourable friend Mr Cameron who suggested that a cross-party committee of privy counsellors should look at how intercept evidence might be used.</p>

<a name="80206-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="08020684000069"></a>Of course we will want to study the report carefully, but it seems clearly to accept that intercept should be used, but also importantly to offer guidance on the vital question of how to use intercept to secure convictions while not imperilling national security. Our country has been targeted, hit and some families left pained and grieving, but thanks to the brilliance of our security services we have prevented many other atrocities. We need to defend our homeland and the safety and capability of our security services must be paramount. We must therefore give the fullest weight to their concerns. We must protect security service personnel and we must protect the vital intelligence-gathering techniques. We must, as the Statement says, have the flexibility to adjust to communication by new internet protocol technologies. We also need to ensure that the use of intercept in court does not jeopardise a fair trial.</p>

<a name="80206-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="08020684000070"></a>Will the noble Baroness confirm that the Crown Prosecution Service is clear that the use of intercept will lead to fewer abortive trials? Can she say whether any assessment has been made of how many more terrorists could have been brought to book had intercept evidence been available? Does the noble Baroness agree with the report that Australia, a common law country, also at war with terror, shows how intercept could bring benefits without increasing danger to intelligence services?</p>

<a name="80206-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08020684000071"></a>I am convinced we now need to move forward, so let me ask about implementation. What is the timing? Will there be yet another Bill on interception later this Session, or in the next Session of Parliament? I hear it being said that implementation might take more than two years. That is patently ridiculous. Can the noble Baroness say whether there is any impediment to speedy implementation, and if so, what it is? I find it disappointing that proposals will not be ready for inclusion in the Counter-Terrorism Bill. I make it clear that we would consider recommitment of that Bill if we would help material to be introduced at a later stage.</p>

<a name="80206-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08020684000072"></a>But let me also be blunt on another matter. We favour use of intercept because we think it a useful and effective tool in fighting terror, but we oppose firmly large-scale overriding of habeas corpus and the bringing in of a system, wholly alien to our tradition,

After long and painful discussion, this House reluctantly accepted temporary provision of 28-day detention in terrorist cases. Given the further work being done following the Chilcot report, does the noble Baroness accept that it would be wholly counterproductive to force a phoney political row about 42-day detention? The former Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, is against it, as is the former Attorney-General, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith; and I have not exactly seen the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, waving banners in its favour. This House will not and should not brook our ancient liberties being played with as meat for the spin doctors.</p>

<a name="80206-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08020684000073"></a>Will the noble Baroness give an undertaking that so long as the work following the Chilcot report goes on there will be no question of her pressing legislation to extend detention without trial? If she will not give that undertaking, as Leader of the House, perhaps she could take that message back to her Cabinet colleagues as clearly and as firmly as she likes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08020684000074"></a>Finally, since this Statement is on intercept&#151;and following past concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed&#151;can the noble Baroness say whether the Wilson doctrine applies to Members of this House? No doubt, as Leader of the House, she has asked this: can she give an assurance that no Members of this House have been bugged while going about their duties?</p>

I agree with the Prime Minister that the central dilemma we face in a free society is that of preserving our liberties and the rule of law while at the same time keeping our nation safe and secure. This House has played a key part in retaining that balance in recent years. I join the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, in paying tribute to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd. I pay tribute also to the members from these Benches, my noble friends Lord Thomas, Lord Lester and Lord Goodhart. They have worked to keep that balance when measures were brought before this House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08020684000076"></a>I share the Prime Minister&#146;s judgment of our security services. What they do defends our freedom, protects our society and saves our lives. However, whenever I have sat in this House over the past 10 years considering the numerous Bills presented to us, I have always kept in the back of my mind a statement by my old mentor Lord Callaghan; I think that I have repeated it to the House before. After receiving a briefing from members of the security services and they had left the room, he turned to me and said, &#147;Always listen to what they say, but never abandon your own political judgment&#148;. I think that that is Parliament&#146;s duty when we deal with these matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08020684000077"></a>We in this House have long supported the use of intercept evidence and welcome this move. The task now is to get the balance right between the effective use of such intercept evidence and the protection of capabilities in the field. One concern about the  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1062"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1062</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Statement is that there are so many checks, balances and conditions that it is almost an open invitation to those who do not want to see this move implemented to find reasons not to implement it. It will take some strength on the part of Ministers to ensure that this is not in fact one step forward and two steps back. Is the Minister satisfied that the right balance will be struck between the use of these new capabilities and excessive claims by the security authorities that this will damage the agencies? We must make sure that that happens. Our argument has always been that this move will strengthen our ability to secure terrorist and organised-crime convictions. That will not happen if it is too easy to make such objections.</p>

<a name="80206-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08020684000078"></a>Is the Minister confident that the move will not undermine interagency co-operation? It is true that agencies have not in the past co-operated with each other. They should not use this relaxation of the rules on intercept as an excuse for not communicating with each other. I repeat the question from the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde: when can we expect legislation on this? I also underline his concerns about the justification for pursuing 42-day detention.</p>

<a name="80206-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08020684000079"></a>The Chilcot team has done a good job of work. But, as the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, pointed out, there is now a wide concern that goes beyond just intercepts and concerns the nature of our society and where it is going. The Bill needed to implement this change will, I think, be the ninth one in 10 years to address various aspects of security. There is growing public concern at the growth of what has been termed the surveillance society.</p>

<a name="80206-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08020684000080"></a>I therefore wonder whether the Chilcot team, which has proved so admirable, could not be given a further task: to have a full overview and review of the legislation introduced over the past 10 years and to see what has worked and what has not. Those who have studied these matters have found whole sections of legislation which was rushed through the House in days or hours that have never been implemented. Other provisions referred to in this House have been used with unforeseen circumstances. We must ensure that security legislation is not an ever-incoming tide. We must continually use the considerable strength and wisdom of this House to ensure that we strike the right balance between our civil liberties and our security needs.</p>

I am also very happy to join in the tributes to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. I always consult him because I find it more valuable to do so than not. He and I watched my right honourable friend the Prime Minister give the Statement in another place and I saw what I thought was a flicker of a smile cross his face as he listened.

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08020684000082"></a>We have to be clear that no one on the committee is suggesting that this is a magic silver bullet that will dramatically change the way things are. We have a  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1063"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1063</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>very good and high success rate for convictions in trials in this country. I have no estimates from the Crown Prosecution Service, but the Metropolitan Police estimates that its success rate could increase from 88 per cent to 92 per cent if it could use intercept. That 4 per cent is worth having, but worth having only within the conditions laid down in the report. I think that those bodies would also accept that there could be fewer aborted trials, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde.</p>

<a name="80206-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08020684000083"></a>The issue of the link with Australia as a common law country has been raised today in both your Lordships&#146; House and another place. Noble Lords who have read the report will have seen an extensive section on comparisons with different countries, France, the Netherlands, Canada and Australia being but four. I recommend that noble Lords who have not had a chance to read that section do so, for the committee clearly found the comparison extremely valuable. However, the committee was also keen to point out the differences between the different regimes, not least the different systems. For example, Australia, as I indicated, has a common law system; the other countries I mentioned do not. But there are distinctive differences between the British system and the systems in those countries. Although Australia is a common law country, it does not have the European Convention on Human Rights. That is a distinct difference. We have the adversarial legal system which I have described. We also have strong and good co-operation with international partners. I do not underestimate the importance of that in thinking through how we should use this. As has already been indicated, we also have a very high level of co-operation between the police and the security services. So although the committee was very clear that comparisons are valuable and useful, it was also clear that no direct comparator could be translated across. We therefore need to devise our own solution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08020684000084"></a>I do not have detailed timings to give noble Lords. My plan, of course, is to keep the House informed&#151;not least because, as noble Lords will see when reading the report, there is a lot of detailed work to be done. I do not think that the nine conditions will be a hindrance, but each requires substantial work. I hope the noble Lord, Lord McNally, will be reassured that the combination of an implementation team drawn from across government and from the agencies with the newly convened cross-party group led by Sir John Chilcot, with all the experience that it already has, will enable us to make sure that the eventual proposals are robust and, vitally, as I am sure the House will agree, that we do not compromise our national security ability in anything we do while recognising that there is clearly a possibility of taking this forward in a particular way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08020684000085"></a>I do not want to spend a lot of time&#151;I could, believe me&#151;discussing the 42-day issue. Like noble Lords, I have had the benefit of talking to a number of people in your Lordships&#146; House and in another place and beyond about the issues that I know are of concern. In all the conversations I have had there has been a real clarity of understanding that we are reaching the point where we may need to look in exceptional circumstances at the possibility of someone

Two issues which noble Lords will be aware of come to mind. The first is the ability of those who wish to create havoc and terror in our country to use technology in an increasingly clever way, and the requirements therefore to be able to use the encryption codes and so on that are on our services.</p>

<a name="80206-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08020684000086"></a>The second is that this often has an international dimension, and that requires us to think, talk and discuss with forces all over the world, some of which may be very far flung and do not have the communication abilities that we do. Those issues have implications in terms of whether 28 days will be sufficient. I have always believed it is the job of government to think ahead, to consider and to plan. That is exactly what we are trying to do within the counter-terror Bill that will come before your Lordships&#146; House. It is absolutely critical, having accepted that principle, which I believe people do, to make sure that the safeguards are built in. In the context of the counter-terror Bill, those safeguards are political judgment, parliamentary oversight and judicial oversight combined. Noble Lords may have views on how those work, but they are three important and distinct elements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08020684000087"></a>Finally, I looked up the Wilson Doctrine. The last statement on the Wilson Doctrine was on 30 March 2006. I want to read out the paragraph that answers the questions I have been asked about it:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08020684000244"></a>&#147;In answer to questions in the House of Commons on 17 November 1966, the then Prime Minister, the right hon. Harold Wilson MP, said that he had given instructions that there was to be no tapping of the telephones of Members of Parliament and that if there were a development which required a change of policy he would at such a moment as was compatible with the security of the country make a statement in the House about it. This approach, known as the Wilson Doctrine, has been maintained under successive administrations&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 30/3/06; col. 95-96WS.]</p>

As the noble and learned Lord will know far better than I, there are several possibilities. My noble and learned friend Lord Goldsmith when he was Attorney-General also looked at the PII Plus model. This is the one that the noble and learned Lord thinks would be of greatest interest, so I hope noble Lords will study it with great care. As he says, we will be coming forward with proposals on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08020684000092"></a>Does the noble Baroness accept a point that has not really come out yet in these exchanges? As she said, further important work needs to be done on procedures, safeguards and cost. We hope that we have put forward in the report not only a legally robust procedure, which is set out in some detail, but also a way in which, if the Government accept our suggestion, even if we were wrong and there were to be an adverse judgment somewhere along the way, the result would not be the loss of security. It might be the loss of a particular prosecution, but it would not in any circumstances be the spilling out into the open of the precious information about the capabilities and techniques at our disposal which everyone in this House knows have to be kept secure. I am not sure how far the noble Baroness would follow me in my personal view, which is not the opinion in the report, but this issue has caused the whole government apparatus of counter-terrorism to creak rather badly. Whenever they come forward with ideas for new powers or new procedures, they have to face the argument, which they have not been able to answer, that they are barring themselves from using evidence which could be crucial. Therefore, there is a wider context beyond the scope of the report which I hope that the Government will find useful.</p>

It is valued extremely highly by my right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary.

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08020684000094"></a>I accept much of what the noble Lord said in the first half of his comments. As he would expect, however, I am not sure that I would agree that the apparatus creaks rather badly. I think that there is a perception that this could make a difference. What is very measured in the report is the real understanding that the difference will not make a substantial change in the ability to bring people to justice. In fact, we have an extraordinarily good track record. The question is whether it could make the difference in particular cases and lead to fewer aborted trials and more solid convictions. That is the essence of what we need to look at. It is important to look at it in that light, but not to feel in any way that we have failed to achieve what we need to achieve because this facility has not been available to us. That is where I would not agree with the noble Lord&#146;s terminology of creaking machinery.</p>

Is the noble Baroness aware that when the Joint Committee took evidence on this, we went to Madrid, to Paris and to Canada? What impressed us greatly was that if you look at the common law world and think of the United States, which has a Bill of Rights, and you think of Canada, which has a Charter of Rights&#151;those countries which need to balance liberty and security&#151;they were not subject to the same exclusionary rule as we have. In Europe, only Ireland, in the common law world, has the same exclusion. Is the Minister aware of that and how isolated we have been, and therefore how important it is now that we are able to join forces with, for example, Spain, which has more serious terrorism than any other country? Finally, the Minister will be aware that Sir John Chilcot has been involved in this subject for as long as any of us. He was involved in the first prevention of terrorism Bill in 1974. I cannot think of a better person to do further work in this area. In my view, he is one of the great public servants of my time.</p>

The quality of this report and the work that has been done clearly demonstrates that this cross-party Privy Council approach has worked extremely well with what we wish it to achieve. I pay tribute to all those involved. It is interesting when one looks at the comparisons within the document. The noble Lord talked of going to Madrid, Paris and Canada&#151;indeed, Spain, France, Canada, Australia, the United States and the Netherlands are examples within the document. I take nothing away from the comparison between the ECHR and the Bill of Rights and the ability to make these things work together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08020684000097"></a>However, I would point to the unique nature of the particular criteria that I spelt out for what makes this country different: our collaboration externally with other nations, our adversarial system and so on. When one adds all these up, one sees that we have to have a home-grown solution. I am not sure that we felt isolated. As I have indicated, the quality and quantity of the work we have done in bringing people to trial and to justice has been extremely high. The question was whether we could do even better. In the eyes of the Metropolitan Police, it was the difference between 88 per cent and 92 per cent. That has to be balanced very carefully against the risks which noble Lords have indicated. I also note that Andrew Dismore, who chairs the committee, was keen to welcome this earlier today in another place.</p>

I do not know what the timescales are. I know my right honourable friend will be keen to keep both Houses of Parliament informed on that. As yet, I do not know how long it will take. There is work to do to try to evaluate that. I would imagine that if we asked any member of the Chilcot committee&#151;we are fortunate to have in our presence today at least two of them&#151;they would say that this work could take some time. That does not mean&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord McNally, expressed concerned about it&#151;that we should drag our feet, or indeed take too long.

If the security services have the right of saying no to a piece of information being released, surely it should not be them who have the absolute veto. Surely it should be a judge. If they just say no and that they do not like it, none could come forward. That is my question. My squeak of surprise is that I am very surprised that the Statement says that no control orders would have been found unnecessary as a result of this. Will the noble Baroness elaborate on that a little bit?

In fact, the first tests described within the document is that the intercepting agency shall decide whether a prosecution involving their intercept materiel shall proceed and it shall not be disclosed beyond the people who have been described&#151;the cleared judges, prosecutors and special defence advocates&#151;except in the form agreed. These are all very important safeguards to make sure that the evidence that is being used does not jeopardise the work of the agencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08020684000102"></a>I appreciate the noble Earl understands that, but somebody has to make that judgment. The proposals put forward in the committee were that it would be the agencies themselves. If the work is done correctly and we get this right, there will be, I believe, a clear consensus not only within your Lordships&#146; House and beyond, but across the agencies and the services that this is an appropriate thing to do and they will wish to do it where it is appropriate. We have to be clear who has to take that judgment and I think the work of the committee is to suggest that that judgment should rest with them.</p>

We cannot prejudge that and at the present time it would not have had any impact.</p>

I have yet to read the report but, from the Statement, it sounds like a very thorough-going and welcome report that will exercise both Houses of Parliament for some time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08020684000105"></a>The one point I should like to make is really a point of practical detail. It concerns the four points which have been identified already and the nine conditions. I am sure that we all agree in principle that the intercepting agencies should retain the ability to control their material, and that disclosure of material cannot be required against their wishes. I wish to flag up one practical point that follows on from that. The fourth point is to ensure that agencies cannot be required to transcribe or make notes of material beyond a standard of detail they deem necessary. Many large criminal cases not specifically concerned with security have foundered in the past on that point, when a determined defence team has insisted on transcription of masses of material. One could well imagine that in the sort of cases we are considering today, there could be a requirement to transcribe not only hours&#146; and days&#146; worth of material, but even weeks&#146; and years&#146; worth. Doing so will bog down a prosecution to the point where it may not even run the case at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="08020684000106"></a>I ask the Leader of the House if she would take these remarks back to the team considering the matter. It will be a very finely balanced judgment, of course, but, in practical terms, it is well worth noting.</p>

However, I ask the Minister to have Her Majesty's Government consider carefully in relation to those cases where the veto of the intelligence agencies is not used&#151;I accept that it is for them to decide&#151;that when the matter eventually comes to trial, a longstop discretionary jurisdiction should be vested in the trial judge who will invariably be a judge of the High Court so that ultimately, the ends of justice are seen to be served by an authority that is totally non-partisan.</p>

In this House we have always agreed about that&#151;there is no question of there being a question of principle. I hope that my noble friend will agree with me that the committee has made it clear that there are some very real and serious hurdles to be cleared to meet the conditions which it has laid out. Of the nine requirements which it has laid out on page 49 of the report, six are classified in another part of the report as,</p>
<ul><a name="08020684000251"></a>&#147;requirements for intercept as evidence to be operationally workable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020684000236"></a>That is the key question.

It may not be possible to overcome them, about which the report is clear, as I hope noble Lords will have felt from the tone of the Statement.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08020684000245"></a> Schedule 2, page 170, line 17, leave out from &#147;ways&#148; to end of line 18</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08020684000123"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 39. Under current provisions, courts can choose to leave a youth rehabilitation order unamended after a breach. For instance, a young person on a standard six-month supervision order might have kept more than 90 per cent of his or her appointments but still qualify for breach action. Breach proceedings may often be brought where the young person&#146;s compliance and motivation to co-operate with the intervention are very high, particularly given the chaotic lifestyles associated with many young people who come to the attention of the youth justice system. Breaches can occur easily for children with unstable home lives. Currently the courts tend to respond to technical breaches with warnings or encouragement.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="08020684000124"></a>The provisions in the Bill would preclude such an approach and would require that a court must, when it is satisfied that a breach has occurred, impose a fine or amend the terms of a youth rehabilitation order,  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1071"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1071</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>even if the young person has responded well and the youth offending team and the court consider that the order should be allowed to continue in its present form. Why is the Bill reducing the discretion of the court? Here is yet another example of the Bill doing that. National standards require breach proceedings to be initiated relatively early on, so courts will confront a wide range of different levels of non-compliance. They should have flexibility in how they respond to them.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08020684000125"></a>We share the concern of the Standing Committee for Youth Justice that the provision might reduce the potential for compliance with the order if the young person feels unfairly or harshly treated. In that event, the imposition of such a punishment might be counterproductive, leading potentially to further proceedings for breach or the subsequent revocation of the order, the potential for increased offending associated with non-compliance of the order and, in some cases, a custodial sentence. We are concerned, in other words, that the Government&#146;s emphasis on robust enforcement for breach, because of their view about the need to maintain confidence in community sentences, might accelerate offenders into custody despite original offences not being serious enough to warrant it.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08020684000126"></a>Our amendment would ensure that the courts retain the discretion that they currently enjoy to deal with the wide range of breaches that come before them in the most appropriate fashion in all the circumstances. In particular, the power of the court to issue a warning would provide some form of encouragement to the young person without the imposition of a further punishment. I beg to move.</p>

This has been a short but interesting debate. The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, asked why we did not trust the professionals. I am a great admirer and rereader of the text of the noble Baroness, Lady O'Neill, for the Dimbleby lecture five or six years ago, which was on the theme of putting our trust in professionals and of the dangers of not doing that. As a general proposition, I very much agree with it. Equally, there is always a balance to be drawn between the role of Parliament and government in setting a framework and what then has to happen at local level. We will argue, throughout the Bill, I suspect, about whether we get the balance right.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08020684000132"></a>As a general comment rather than specific to this debate, my experience as a Minister is that, collectively, parliamentarians are concerned about too much central diktat, but then spend most of their efforts putting pressure on the Government to do something. It is difficult to get the balance right. Indeed, some of the amendments tabled by noble Lords who argue for discretion in this area are very precise in another area.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08020684000133"></a>On the specific points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, there is a safeguarding in paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 2, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08020684000246"></a>&#147;If the responsible officer is of the opinion that the offender has failed without reasonable excuse&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020684000237"></a>Together with the guidelines that will be established, that gives sufficient discretion for the responsible officer to make a common-sense judgment in this area.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08020684000134"></a>The court is then given discretion in the ways that it can deal with the breach. It has to deal with it, but there are various options in paragraph, 6 and likewise in paragraph 8 in relation to the Crown Court. I would argue that we have established the right balance.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08020684000135"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, argued that, under the current community sentencing arrangements, courts can choose not to do anything in response to a breach that is brought before them. That is a fair point to make. But we believe that under the new framework that we are debating, doing nothing, or at least doing nothing without reviewing the order, should not be an option. As I said, the specified actions for courts to take provide for a range of options for the court when dealing with a breach while taking into account how the young offender has complied with the existing order.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08020684000136"></a>The new youth rehabilitation order has many different requirements. It is different from the current framework, which is sentence-driven. In the current circumstances it may well be right for a court to allow a young person to continue with a supervision order or an action plan order where this has been breached because, in many cases, the sentence does not have the potential to contain multifaceted requirements such as can be attached to the youth rehabilitation order.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08020684000137"></a>In the Government&#146;s view, where a youth rehabilitation order is breached, the requirements need to be reviewed and revised where necessary and appropriate. We believe that it should be reviewed to ascertain whether the requirements originally attached were best suited to  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1073"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1073</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the young person. Requirements may need to be substituted or amended. Indeed, the court can take no action under the third power that has been set out in paragraph 6(2)(c), and paragraph 8(2)(c). Paragraph 6(2)(c) states that the court can deal with the offender,</p>
<ul><a name="08020684000252"></a>&#147;in any way in which the court could have dealt with the offender for that offence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020684000238"></a>It means that the court could make a youth rehabilitation order less onerous by taking away a requirement that is not appropriate.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08020684000138"></a>I accept the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. Some young people will find the requirements attached to the youth rehabilitation order difficult to comply with. When it is breached, it is right for the court to consider properly whether the original requirements were appropriate and whether they should continue. The youth rehabilitation order will be effective only if it is properly tailored to the needs of the individual. A breach of the YRO could be a clear indication that this aspiration has not been fulfilled. We would not want to perpetuate requirements that, in practice, are not working or suitable. The courts should be able to review and revise a youth rehabilitation order where it is breached. Overriding that is the whole construct of youth rehabilitation orders as part of a programme designed to ensure that custody is truly a last resort. It is about a robust community sentencing framework. We have to make it clear that breaches cannot be tolerated. There are sufficient safeguards in the Bill, which is why I hope the House will accept the provisions as they are currently enunciated.</p>

Clearly, in the context of this debate, the responsible officers play an absolutely critical role and are given considerable discretion.

On the one hand, the Minister has said that the situation has now changed because we have Clause 1 of the Bill and this generic youth rehabilitation order, which takes a new approach to the youth justice system. Consequently, it is necessary to review the scope of the courts&#146; discretion in dealing with breaches. On the other hand, there have a number of occasions when Ministers, in the context of the Bill generally and in the context of this clause in particular, have said that one of the reasons for it is the need to maintain confidence in community sentences. That is an entirely different point. I should like to hear the Minister&#146;s response to that, if he cares to get on his feet again.</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08020684000142"></a>The Minister drew my attention to a number of other provisions in the Bill, suggesting that in fact the change is rather marginal. Is he saying that what I am seeking, and what the Standing Committee for Youth Justice is seeking, is in fact in the Bill anyway if you read all the measures in conjunction? If that is so, why do the Government not simply accept our amendments or say that our amendments are actually what the Bill says?</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08020684000143"></a>My concern is that of course there will be situations when a breach comes before a magistrate or a judge and that magistrate or judge will say, &#147;Actually, the original cocktail of measures under the youth rehabilitation order is not suitable and we will have to refine them&#148;. Equally, he may take a completely different view. He may take the view that the original range of dispositions under the order were exactly right and the reasons why the young man or woman had not been able to comply 100 per cent were either out of their control or understandable in their social circumstances. It is that second thing that the judge can no longer do. He is the only person who will have a real grasp of what the situation on the ground is like; so why on earth remove that discretion from him? I do not know whether the Minister wants to respond.</p>

I thought I was being consistent and that my remarks dealt with both facets. It is certainly so that my colleagues in another place emphasised the issue of public interest and confidence in what we are seeking to do here. That is because we have made a great deal of progress in our discussions in the past two days about the importance of developing community sentences to ensure that custody is the last option. Those community sentences should be effective and should aid the prevention of reoffending. There is little that I have seen that we disagree about. But we also believe that in terms of public confidence we have to show that community sentences are not a soft option. I very much endorse the fact that they are not a soft option. Having now had some experience of joining in with community sentences, I am satisfied that they are not a soft option. Part of building public confidence is to get over that we cannot tolerate breaches, because we have to make sure that community sentencing is a vigorous option.</p>

As set out in paragraph 6(2)(b), one of the ways in which it can deal with a breach is to amend the terms of the youth rehabilitation order. It can make additions or substitutions.

The noble Lord is beginning to give me the impression that actually he agrees with my noble friend Lord Kingsland that when some young man or young woman does something silly that they cannot help and they breach their order, it should not be a breaking point. He is then saying, &#147;We have got to show the public&#148;, so he is trying to give over two messages. That is my understanding; I may be wrong. If he is saying that we do not have to worry and the discretionary powers are there, then good, but he could have said that right at the beginning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="08020684000148"></a>On the one hand, the reporting officer has a massive discretion. He is not a judicial figure; he is an administrative figure, a person obviously near to the miscreant and able to come to a proper conclusion. He has that discretion, and it is right that he should have it, but the court is not given that discretion. It is perfectly true that the court is not driven to any specific punishment or anything of that order. Indeed, I can understand the motivation for saying that it must be brought before the court, because the court will then review. The main question is this: what benefit will that appearance before the court have for the miscreant himself?</p>

<a name="80206-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="08020684000149"></a>The point has been amply made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that a great deal of goodwill will sometimes be won by the fact that the court&#151;normally the magistrate&#151;will say that it is taking no action but is looking closely at the situation. The person will know what will happen if he appears before it again. It will have almost the effect of a suspended sentence. It is missing that opportunity that is the illogicality and weakness of the Government&#146;s position.</p>

First, he is right about the discretion to be given to the responsible officer. For all the reasons that have been suggested in the debate, that is right. As long as it is done within national standards, there is consistency and we can be assured that all responsible officers will do the right thing, there is a need for discretion. If there is a breach, it is inconsequential and there is good reason for it, no further action need be taken. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, looks rather quizzical: there is a need for &#147;reasonable excuse&#148;.</p>

Those of us on the Joint Committee on Human Rights felt that the interests of the child in the government clause was being subordinated against what has been agreed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child in, I think, Article 3.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08020684000161"></a>Our recommendation says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08020684000248"></a>&#147;We recognise that the obligation in the CRC is to ensure that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all decisions affecting children, not the sole primary consideration.

</ul>

It was unanimously agreed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. We keep on coming back to the fact that the interests of the child are primary. Not only is it right that that should be so, but, if we have regard to the interests of the child, get them to go straight and turn them away from their ungodly ways, that will

There is no clash with what we want to do or with crime prevention or rehabilitation or anything like that. Our treaty duty is to do that, and it should be in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Earl has put the argument very well, as indeed did the Joint Committee on Human Rights. As we argued yesterday&#151;it is impossible not to repeat some of the ground in the context of this amendment&#151;it is wrong and misleading to suggest that somehow there has to be a balance between the interests of the child and the interests of the community.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08020684000163"></a>It is upsetting when it is suggested directly or implicitly that those of us who argue the position that I am about to argue are somehow soft on the need to protect society. It is quite the reverse. We are very hard on asking people to stop being stupid by creating situations in which the child is more likely to become criminalised and to be excluded, with all the consequent costs and negative outcomes to society in the future. Seeing the interests of the child as crucial is not only necessary because we have a responsibility for children and we care in value terms about children, it is essential to protect society in the future from the cost of reoffending and from the damage of reoffending.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08020684000164"></a>Yesterday in our very interesting deliberations, the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, referred to one of the children involved in the horrible murder of James Bulger and how he had a mental age of four. If we are really taking the interests of the child seriously, if we really are committed to rehabilitation, not only for the person concerned and not simply on principle but because&#151;I say it again&#151;this is a way of protecting society, we must treat each child as an individual with their own position, their own needs and their own experiences. On the evidence of how things have been done in the past, I do not believe that that happens. That may happen on occasion, but it is probably more on occasion than as a general rule.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08020684000165"></a>Therefore, it seems to me that this is an essential amendment. I applaud those who have tabled it. I hope that my noble friend will respond sympathetically. Either we care about the protection of society or we do not; either we see children as children, as I said yesterday, whatever their situation, or we do not. If we see them as children, we must see them as individuals in need of an individual approach, if we are to get things right.</p>

The Bill requires sentencing to be proportionate to the offence&#151;we are coming to that&#151;but our international human rights obligations require courts&#146; actions to be proportionate to the child&#146;s age and emotional and intellectual maturity.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08020684000168"></a>The committee&#146;s view was that the consequences of breach, as set out in the Bill, could lead quickly to custody, even when it could not have been considered for the original offence. The committee wrote to the Government asking why there could not be more judicial discretion, and they said&#151;I imagine that the Minister will tell us this in a few moments&#151;that sentencers may wish to use their discretion but they cannot permit this because the Government want enforcement to be robust. That word has obviously found its way into the Minister&#146;s brief. The Government&#146;s reply makes it clear that the need for robustness overrides the need to do the right thing for the child and the community.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08020684000169"></a>Those of us who follow the system sometimes see odd decisions reported and ask ourselves, &#147;How could that happen? What were the magistrates thinking?&#148;. I mentioned two cases yesterday. Two children were sent to custody for breach, and one child killed himself. How did a vulnerable child find himself in prison for not turning up for his appointments? Presumably the answer is robustness. The Prison Reform Trust has done an excellent project, supported, I think, by the noble Baroness, Lady Quin, about the large number of people in prison with learning difficulties, including children under 18. They are highly vulnerable. The magistrates or Crown Court must have thought, &#147;This is a very sad situation we are in&#148;. Presumably, it was robustness that meant that these people ended up in custody.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08020684000170"></a>Obviously, robustness is a concept with some merit, but I am not sure how appropriate it is for children with severe learning difficulties, for a child who may be 14 but looks about 10 or the sort of people we see in institutions who make us ask, &#147;How on earth did they get here?&#148;. Our amendment suggests that the courts must look at the child before them, get reports and use their judgment and humanity. The Government make a big mistake with their idea of robustness and the link to public confidence. The public are not interested in that sort of complexity; they are interested in an effective outcome. They are interested in seeing a young person stop doing whatever it is they have been doing that is causing misery and mayhem. In my view, the key is not robustness of enforcement but solving the problem that the child presents. It might need special placement in a school, drug treatment or more social workers&#146; time, but I doubt that it needs robustness.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08020684000171"></a>The robustness that the Minister has been suggesting we should adopt, not only today but yesterday, leads to outcomes that cost a lot of money and do not deliver what the Government want to see, which is confidence and a system of justice that works. I wholeheartedly support the noble Earl&#146;s amendment.</p>

The purpose of sentencing in a social context outside prison is to tackle the issue of rebuilding the life of the person concerned without disrupting it still further. Resorting to the word &#147;robust&#148; does not match up to the philosophy of having these sentences at all.</p>

It is clear and limited. We have heard it said in answer to my noble friend Lord Listowel that magistrates and judges are subjected to a lot of training as time goes on. We know that probably even more resources could be spent&#151;that is important too&#151;so that they are up to date with some of the concerns of offenders who look one age but are emotionally another age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08020684000175"></a>Here we have a perfectly straightforward case. The most effective way to stop reoffending and to do the right thing for the child, the community and the family seems about as clear as it could be in what we have already heard. Unless we are going to hear from the Minister that everything that we are asking for is in the Bill&#151;I cannot see it&#151;I hope that we are all wasting our time because the Minister is going to accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08020684000177"></a>Yesterday, for example, I quoted a conversation with a senior officer who, having been introduced to what a speech and language therapist could do with and for a young person, recognised that he and others had been damaging that person because they had been putting things down to bad behaviour and treating him wrongly. On reflection, it emerged that one of the problems was that these sensible words about what needed to be taken into account on behalf of the child were not there as part of what the young offender institution had to do for that person. When I took a speech and language therapist in with me and asked her to carry out an assessment of young people in custody, she came up with all sorts of important things, such as memory loss and various other aspects, which meant that the institution itself was not tackling the needs of the child.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08020684000178"></a>It is therefore entirely appropriate that the amendment be included to cover the process right from the start, when the person is being considered. Those needs should be followed right through everything done with and for the young person&#151;whether in the community, an institution or whatever. It goes back to this vital point: if you put the interests of the child first, all the protection and the other things we talk about will follow. That is absolutely crucial.</p>

Part 2, which deals with sentencing and the things to which the court must have regard, includes the punishment of offenders. The amendment would not interfere with that. In no way would it diminish the protection of the public or the reform and rehabilitation of offenders, which is exactly the point that the amendment is making.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08020684000180"></a>Of course, the community must be protected. Of course, we must be certain that the press, which is powerful and militant in seeing children as wicked, rather than having needs as well as being offenders, will dislike anything that is not seen to be robust. But it is not lacking in robustness for the court to be reminded, as it should be, of the age and mental capacity of the offender. It will in no way reduce the protection of the public.</p>

I argue that the whole construct of youth rehabilitation orders is to help to solve problems, through the very nature and flexibility of those orders. I have never sought to argue that courts sentencing young offenders have a duty to have regard to their welfare. As I said yesterday, the principal aim of the youth justice system is and must be to prevent offending. If, in legislation, you essentially put it in the Bill that an exclusive focus is to be on the welfare of the child, you risk ignoring the rights of everyone else, including other children&#151;who in many, if not most, cases, are often the victims of young offenders.</p>

We do not legislate in isolation from the world around us. In a sense I am arguing along the same lines as I did in the previous debate. The Government are seeking a much more flexible community sentence response with YROs. At the same time, we must emphasise&#151;public confidence is a factor here&#151;that this is robust approach. It is intended to reduce reoffending. Where breaches are unacceptable, they

I do not think that that is an unreasonable description of a robust approach. I understand the sentiments behind the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, described the words as attractive. I understand that. Ensuring proportionality has to be an important part of what we seek to do.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08020684000186"></a>Paragraphs 6 and 8 of Schedule 2 require the court, when dealing with an offender in respect of a breach of a youth rehabilitation order, to take into account the extent to which the young person has complied with the order. We believe that the amendment is not necessary because the young person&#146;s age and maturity are factors that are embedded in general sentencing practice. As the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, pointed out, Clause 9 sets out the purposes of sentencing and the factors that the courts must take into account when sentencing. The requirement for the court to have regard to the welfare of the young person still applies when the court is considering how to deal with a young offender who has breached a youth rehabilitation order. The court has every opportunity to consider all the circumstances of the breach, including any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. In practice, the court will therefore already take into account factors such as age and emotional maturity when making any sentence decision on breach. These are important matters and factors that the court should take into account when deciding which interventions should be made and how long they should be.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08020684000187"></a>Why then should we not put that in the Bill as opposed to leaving it to the court or the Sentencing Guidelines Council? There could be a range of factors that the court will need to consider as personal mitigation, of which age and maturity are just two. Exactly which factors will depend on the circumstances of the individual. They might include the family circumstances of the offender. There are many matters that the court will have to consider, and it is often difficult to have a definitive list and to single out one or two factors that in some cases may not be as important as other considerations.</p>

<p><a name="08020684000240"></a>What could be more central to the proceedings before the court, where it has to be proved to the satisfaction of the court that the offender has failed without reasonable excuse to comply with a youth rehabilitation order, than that it should take into account the extent to which he has complied with it?

What I am about to say must be heard in the context of my very great respect for him and the level of real concern which he himself has about many of the issues we are discussing. It is a weak argument to say that, because some other factors might need to be listed, this crucial factor should not be put in the Bill. Surely it would be more convincing for those of us on this side of the Committee who are trying to support him and respond positively to his position if he were to say, &#147;I do not find this amendment helpful because of that danger, but I will go away and think of some generic wording that will cover this and other possibilities&#148;. Off the top of my head he might suggest wording such as, &#147;The court must take into account all the appropriate needs of the child&#148;; or if he does not like the word &#147;needs&#148; because it sounds soft, &#147;The court must take into account all the relevant factors of the individual child before deciding what to do&#148;. Just to reject what everybody can see is highly relevant because there might be some other things which are highly relevant is not really a very satisfactory position.</p>

It seems to me that there are two points that the Minister is not fleshing out as he might. If things need to be said in plain English, we should say them in plain English.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08020684000192"></a>First, the Minister seems to be suggesting that the age and emotional and intellectual maturity of children should be lumped together with things such as family circumstances. Everyone else seems to be arguing today that these are factors that are critical to any intervention. We know that they are factors that are critical because in health, for example, the age and emotional and intellectual maturity of children matter when they are being diagnosed. In schools, those factors are taken into account. Across a range of interventions where public policy comes up against the assessment of the child, those factors are critical. Does the Minister accept that point in principle? If he does, it could not follow that the court must take all those other factors into account. As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, all those factors stand in their own right in any event.</p>

<a name="80206-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08020684000193"></a>Secondly, in the light of the passage of this Bill and the provisions concerning youth offending, have the Government carried out any surveys to find out what the public believe should be the approach to the sentencing of children where age and emotional and intellectual maturity&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and others have pointed out&#151;are critical factors in their offending behaviour. We know that NGOs have carried out such a survey and that SmartJustice and others have looked into public attitudes. As for the point of robustness made by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, we understand the Minister&#146;s desire to have public confidence in the system but what evidence do the Government have for that?</p>

It would be wrong for me to do that. While of course I agree that age and maturity are important considerations, I am not sure that I am in any position to say that they are more important than any other factors which call to be considered by the courts. In essence, I believe that the courts at the moment have sufficient discretion, particularly if it is backed up by the kind of assessments that would have to be made by youth offending teams.</p>

She pointed out that in all other areas where we deal with children, it is completely obvious that we consider how old they are before we decide what to do. We also make some sort of assessment of how they have developed, whether they are very young for their age, or even whether they have not developed as they should. Then we make our decisions on the basis of having that information. If we did not do that when they went to the doctor, or the hospital, or the school, we would think that something was extraordinarily wrong. Why, as soon as they get into the court and into the youth justice system, do we stop all that and see only before us the criminal? Is that desirable and does it give us a good outcome?

Those of us who have been proposing this amendment are saying that it should be much more obvious that that is the case.

If I am seen to be replicating what everyone else has said, I apologise, because I am speaking to two separate amendments which should possibly have been grouped together. I wish that the noble Lord, Lord Judd, would stay for a moment, because I shall start by giving him, as well as the Government, a possible &#147;out&#148;.</p>

<a name="80206-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08020684000216"></a>The amendment specifically refers to the CRC&#146;s requirement that,</p>
<ul><a name="08020684000254"></a>&#147;children are dealt with in a manner appropriate to their well-being and proportionate both to their circumstances and the offence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020684000241"></a>That excerpt may or may not be helpful. I will also speak to the amendments in my name which refer again to the use of ISSPs or, more particularly, to their breach, when the original offence was not so serious as to warrant it and even more because the breach is then likely to end in custody&#151;an even more inappropriate disposal.</p>

<a name="80206-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="08020684000217"></a>The Bill does not include the relevance of the child&#146;s age and emotional and intellectual maturity, which may be extremely important, given what we know about the profiles of children who end up going through the court system. Given the preponderance of children who have been abused, who have been in care and who have mental health difficulties and learning difficulties or, for instance, autistic spectrum disorders, this is a very important requirement to include in the Bill. Instead, the Bill&#146;s proposals cause us real concern. They emphasise the importance of breach over all else, regardless of the seriousness or otherwise of the original offence.</p>

<a name="80206-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="08020684000218"></a>I hear the Government&#146;s argument that where an order is breached, rigorous enforcement action is essential. I also heard the Minister say that in order to maintain confidence in community sentences, we cannot tolerate breaches. I will have quite a lot to say about community sentences and my involvement in them later on, but for the moment I should just like to agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, that not only is confidence essential&#151;indeed, it is the pillar of the whole process&#151;but rigorous enforcement, of itself, is not nearly so important as successful outcomes, particularly by reducing reoffending. That is what the public want above all else and there is lots of evidence to show this. We must remember the damage that custody can do unless it is indeed used as a last resort.</p>

<a name="80206-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="08020684000219"></a>In fact, with many children, especially those with the sort of problems I have just referred to, breaching reflects even more the need better to match orders to the situation of the offender. Last year, I met a child of about 13, a tiny boy, who was in an STC for breach. It was absolutely clear that he would continue with the breach when he got out because he was determined to skip school and do anything in his power to be with his sick mother. Clearly, there was a need to find other means of dealing with his situation than by putting him into a child prison. No one was gaining, least of all that little boy. Nor did such an enforcement do much for the confidence of the community in the enforcement of community sentences&#151;it may,

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="08020684000220"></a>There has been a worrying increase in the number of breaches coming back to court in the past few years&#151;a threefold rise in the breach of supervision orders in the past seven years&#151;which has in turn led to a rise in breach proceedings leading to custody, which has increased from 18 per cent to 25 per cent over the same period.</p>

<a name="80206-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="08020684000221"></a>The Bill reduces the discretion of the courts, as Minister just made clear. As a result, breaches of ISSPs resulting in custody rose by 98 per cent in 2005-06. That is an incredible figure, and calls into question whether they have been used as a last resort before other options have been tried and whether they were imposed inappropriately for offences which should not necessarily attract a custodial sentence. That is at the heart of my amendment.</p>

To do otherwise would be to compound an already unhappy situation, as is the case with the child who is in low-level trouble, and create an infinitely unhappier one. It is surely wrong in principle that a non-imprisonable offence should lead to custody through breach, particularly for children, and more particularly for low-level offending and vulnerable children, whom, as the figures show, breach has rippled out to engulf. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Baroness raised some interesting points about breaches. Her amendments would alter the powers available to courts for dealing with young people who breached their youth rehabilitation order. I shall not talk about robustness again, because the point has already been made. I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that I do not use the term in some macho sense of wanting to be seen to wield a big stick. It is more about getting the balance right between ensuring that custody is truly the last resort and that the new approach to YROs and community sentencing hangs together, is integrated and does for young people the kind of things that noble Lords have talked about. Within that, public confidence is important. It is important that they understand that it is not a soft option to place young people on community sentences. I think that we all agree on that.</p>

<a name="80206-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08020684000224"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s Amendments Nos. 36 and 41would remove the provisions which allow courts, both magistrates&#146; and Crown, when re-sentencing for the original offence, to impose a youth rehabilitation order with intensive supervision and surveillance, or custody if the young offender is already on a youth rehabilitation order with intensive supervision and surveillance and has wilfully and persistently breached their order. The provisions apply even where the original offence would not have warranted such a sentence.</p>

<a name="80206-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08020684000225"></a>The amendment would mean that if a young person wilfully and persistently breached the terms of the youth rehabilitation order, they could be re-sentenced only to a further youth rehabilitation order, even if there were multiple breaches. The Bill makes it clear that the measures that we are discussing come into play only for wilful and persistent breach. I assure the noble Baroness that they would not do so for a minor infringement. That is why courts need to be able to raise the bar and use the youth rehabilitation order with intensive supervision and surveillance, or, ultimately, custody.</p>

<a name="80206-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08020684000226"></a>Of course, we want to look carefully at the powers that the court has to deal with those young people who have breached the order when they have not committed an imprisonable offence. When that is the case, custody is available in the following circumstances alone. There must have been a wilful and persistent breach of the first youth rehabilitation order. The court can then impose a youth rehabilitation order with intensive supervision and surveillance for that persistent and wilful breach. Custody is not available at that point, if the original offence was not imprisonable. The young offender then has to again wilfully and persistently breach the youth rehabilitation order with intensive supervision and surveillance imposed in the first place because of his wilful and persistent breach of the original order. Custody is then available to the court, which is then allowed to make a detention and training order for up to four months&#151;the minimum period of such an order.</p>

<a name="80206-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08020684000227"></a>I emphasise to the noble Baroness that this provision really is to deal with wilful and persistent breaches and is not a charter for locking young people up for spurious reasons. The Government have absolutely no interest in wishing to do that. We are talking about what I hope will be a very low number of the worst cases in which, for the sake of the integrity of the whole system, it is important that the courts have that discretion.</p>

This was a child that the noble Baroness met, so we can assume that it is a real child. Is the Minister satisfied in that case that the breaching system and the enforcement&#151;I am not going to say &#147;robust&#148; enforcement; just enforcement&#151;was working as he would like to see it work? If not, what does he think went wrong in that case that we could put right through this Bill?</p>

What is the guarantee within the Bill that in a similar case a person does not inappropriately end up in wilful breach and then in custody? I refer the noble Baroness to page 168 of the Bill. First, the responsible officer has to use his or her own discretion in making judgments. On page 168, at paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 2, the Bill says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08020684000250"></a>&#147;If the responsible officer is of the opinion that the offender has failed without reasonable excuse&#148;.</p>

Then there is the discretion given to the courts. In our previous debate, I referred to the court&#146;s ability to substitute one rehabilitation order for another. It could well be that in the circumstances that the noble Baroness raised, one option would be to substitute the RO that the young person was on for another, which would enable that young person to attend to his sick mother. Those are the guarantees.</p>

I have a copy of the Commons debate on this. I suppose the noble Lord is right to say that there was some confusion in the debate. Certainly, on the face of it, this seems a not unreasonable amendment, except in its effect, which could be very confusing. This issue of immediate family, in particular, could cause considerable difficulty. I am not quite sure how one accurately defines &#147;immediate family.&#148; It is not clear to me from looking at the detail of the debate in another place. I certainly appreciate the sentiment behind the amendment, even though it is not something that we can agree with. It would not be practical to extend the consideration as the amendment does, in the terms that it does, because of the difficulties of definition.</p>

<a name="80206-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08020699000023"></a>We should properly be concerned about the duty of the responsible officer to the young person. When sentencing, the court has to take into account the young person&#146;s family circumstances, as well as the offender&#146;s religious beliefs as stated, before making a youth rehabilitation order. In practice, we would expect that the youth offending team would have regard to the young person&#146;s family circumstances in so far as that is practicable. However, taking account of his or her family&#146;s religious beliefs should not be a mandatory requirement imposed in the legislation. No doubt that is an issue that could be picked up in the round, and no doubt it is something that would be considered.</p>

<a name="80206-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08020699000024"></a>The Bill&#146;s approach is consistent with similar provisions in Section 217 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which relates to the adult community order. I should add that interpreting so wide a duty could be fraught with problems of definition. I referred to one such problem in the concept of immediate family. Moreover, a situation could develop where there were conflicting demands or needs&#151;where, for instance, parents are separated and have a different religious belief from the offender&#146;s, or where parents as a couple have a different religious belief from the offender&#146;s. That said, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

The point is really very simple. Let us suppose that the definition of &#147;immediate family&#148; is father or mother. I am not seeking to have this provision in the Bill; I would simply like to have a statement from the government Bench in relation to the religious beliefs of the child&#146;s father and mother. If, for plain religious reasons, the father or mother is unable to transport the child to undertake a disposition, would the Government agree that that is a complete answer to any allegation of breach?

I know that it is normal practice that instructions are given in writing, but now it seems to me to be crucial that they are. Of course, it is always useful to have proper records of what the offender has been asked to do, but now it is vital. Harsher breach consequences will demand much greater clarity about what the child was or was not asked or required to do. In any case, it seems, if the Government are going to get their way in this Bill on the general question of breach, then the audit trail of what is going on in the world of community orders must be as precise and full as possible. Those are the ideas that have lain behind the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

I realise that it has been aired in another place and I have read that debate.

As many noble Lords will attest, the Youth Justice Board&#146;s national standards set out what the responsible officer is required to do in respect of instructions to young offenders made subject to orders. Those standards state that an agreement must be produced with the offender and that it should be in writing and signed. It should specifically include acceptable and unacceptable absence criteria, setting the terms under which a breach might follow. The standards include a right to be treated fairly and with respect, something that we would all endorse. There is also a requirement to behave acceptably, which goes to the core of why such orders will be in place in any event, and the importance of time-keeping is dealt with. As will be

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08020699000034"></a>As for the young offender notifying his responsible officer of a change of address, a matter addressed in part in the proposal, immediacy of notification must be the priority. It will be essential for the information to be got to the responsible officer as soon as possible. It could be done by telephone but, in this day and age, it will most probably be by mobile phone or even text message. A requirement to notify a change of address in writing could present difficulties for young people with literacy or learning deficiencies, a feature which we acknowledge is present with many of those who are caught up in the criminal justice system at a younger age.</p>

<a name="80206-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08020699000035"></a>I do not believe that it is either necessary or right for the Bill to specify that a responsible officer needs to keep written records of the instructions. This is, after all, basic case management. As we have already outlined, the Youth Justice Board&#146;s national standards require instructions to be put in writing and provided to the young offender. All responsible officers must keep valid and accurate records as these may be required subsequently in court. If a young person wants to see details from their case record, they may apply under existing data protection procedures. In our view, it is not appropriate to repeat those in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80206-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08020699000036"></a>The amendment is not necessary. The instructions are already clearly set out in national standards. We would fall foul of Mr Garnier&#146;s proscription if we were to accede to this amendment.</p>

If the Government are going to take the approach to breach that they have said they have, how can they not require in every case the details of the breach to be before the magistrate or judge in writing? The Minister says that national standards require it; but national standards are not always followed. Indeed, there is no legal obligation to follow them. We seek to make it a legal obligation. A person against whom an allegation of breach is made in the court would be perfectly within their rights to say that there was no record of it and that no written instruction was sent to them. That undermines the case for breach. Is this not then in line with what the Government are seeking to do? I am actually trying to help the Government here. Is it not in line with the philosophy on breach outlined earlier today that, correspondingly, the Government ought to have obligations that instructions, and records on the failure to respond to those instructions, are in writing?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08020699000039"></a>If we were to detail in the Bill this instruction in a particular way and if at some later stage it was felt that that was not the most appropriate form in which it should be set out, we would have to come back to reargue the legislation and use a legislative slot to make that simple change. I do not think that that is an intelligent use of the legislative process. That is one of the reasons why these kinds of matters, important as they are, which I acknowledge, are best kept in the form of guidance which is clear and well understood. That guidance can be consulted on and, from time to time, changed when it suits and when it is right to change. For those reasons, I do not think that the amendment is necessary, nor do I think it is required in the terms set out by the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08020699000061"></a>The noble Lord said: We move now to Part 2 and we enter into another phase of the Bill dealing with the general sentencing provisions. Clause 9 seeks to amend the Criminal Justice Act 2003 by inserting purposes of sentencing of offenders under the age of 18. In particular, the court has to have regard to the purposes of sentencing mentioned in subsection (4). Those purposes set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) are what the Government have in mind. The primary purpose of sentencing is said here to be &#147;the punishment of offenders&#148;. Our amendment is directed to that aspect of the clause.</p>

<a name="80206-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08020699000062"></a>The amendment seeks to ensure that in the sentencing of children, the child&#146;s welfare is a primary concern.  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1097"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1097</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>We argue that sentencing authorities should have the same duties as family courts in having regard to the welfare of the child as defined in Section 1 of the Children Act 1989. No one with experience of the criminal courts as I have can view, without something approaching despair, the problems that defendants have faced during their lives, particularly defendants under the age of 18. There are certain estates in London, in other large conurbations, not to mention in county towns, where it is extremely difficult for a child to break out of a cycle of crime and offending that exists within a family. If we are to be constructive in this Bill, we have to look for ways of breaking that cycle. One of the ways of breaking it is to take away the primary purpose as punishment and to look at other ways of dealing with young offenders. That is why this amendment sets out different priorities.</p>

<a name="80206-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08020699000063"></a>In this amendment, which also seeks to amend Section 142 of the Criminal Justice Act, we suggest in subsection (2) that the court must ensure a proportionate response to offending behaviour. It is not so long ago since the Lord Chancellor sent out an edict that children who are convicted of stealing mobile phones should be dealt with in a particularly harsh way. I have experience of a young man who, at the age of 14, was sent to detention for three and a half years as a result of a series of robberies involving mobile phones within a two or three-week period; 42 months is hardly a proportionate way of dealing with that offence. They were serious offences but three and a half years at the age of 14 is quite an extraordinary punishment.</p>

<a name="80206-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08020699000064"></a>In subsection (3) we have put forward a direction to the court that it,</p>
<ul><a name="08020699000137"></a>&#147;must have regard primarily to the welfare and well-being of the offender&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020699000077"></a>In subsection (4) we suggest that there should be a checklist that the court has to address when sentencing. It includes,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="08020699000121"></a>&#147;(a) the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child concerned (considered in the light of his age and understanding);</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="08020699000122"></a>&#147;(b) his physical, emotional and educational needs;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="08020699000123"></a>&#147;(c) the likely effect on him of any change in his circumstances;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="08020699000124"></a>&#147;(d) his age, sex, background and any characteristics of his which the court considers relevant;</p>
</ul><ul>

</ul>
<p><a name="08020699000078"></a>We feel that that is a suitable checklist that any sentencer should have before him when sentencing someone. We have amended the purposes of sentencing in order to remove punishment as the primary purpose and to put, for youngsters under the age of 18,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="08020699000131"></a>&#147;The juvenile justice system shall emphasise the well-being of the juvenile&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020699000080"></a>Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which I am sure has been quoted already in Committee, requires that:</p>

<p><a name="08020699000082"></a>Under Article 40.4 of the convention, there is a requirement that,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08020699000066"></a>The Government have moved considerably in many ways in improving what used to be the provision for youngsters under 18. Putting punishment first is going against the conventions to which we are a party. They are instruments requiring that the promotion of welfare and well-being should be the primary consideration in proceedings for children.</p>

<a name="80206-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08020699000067"></a>Sentencers will listen if this positive agenda is put before them. They will, we hopes, follow our check list, which may mean that some of the youth orders, such as the youth reparation order that we have been discussing, will be used in circumstances when otherwise prison would be the only alternative. This is a way of ameliorating some of the defects in the criminal justice system affecting young children. It is in accordance with the conventions to which we are a party. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80206-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08020699000069"></a>The substantive point in our two amendments is that the interests of the child should be the first and main thing to be considered. The reasoning behind this is that if the child&#146;s interests are looked after properly, that child is more likely to be reformed and made good. That is in the interests of us all. It is in the interests of the sink estates, so ably described by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, who moved the amendment. We are all conscious of them. As he rightly said, they are not only in big conurbations but appear in parts of leafy conservative country towns as well. That problem is not confined to inner cities and it is extremely difficult to get to grips with. It is not a very new problem but it will be one that my children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will probably address in the future. We can only just struggle to make it better.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08020699000071"></a>I was slightly depressed to hear of the young man getting three and a half years, which is a quarter of his life, for nicking mobile telephones. I am sure that it is extremely irritating to have one&#146;s mobile telephone nicked; I am not defending that offence, but it seems to be quite a harsh sentence. Whether its effect is productive or counterproductive is open to question. It seems to me that the proposals in the amendment should automatically be observed by any judge or magistrate involved in such cases, but I hope that we can concentrate on the important bit, which is the primacy of the child&#146;s interests in the criminal justice system as a whole. I support the amendment.</p>

I confess that I am bemused by the meaning of,</p>
<ul><a name="08020699000141"></a>&#147;the principal aim of the youth justice system&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08020699000084"></a>I have read it a number of times, have reflected on it since yesterday, and I still ask myself what the court can think when told:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="08020699000133"></a>&#147;The court must have regard primarily to the principal aim of the youth justice system, that is, to prevent ... reoffending ... by persons aged under 18&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020699000085"></a>Obviously, it would not help to achieve that aim to send someone into custody, as the evidence is clear that to do so is a recipe for reoffending. What else does it mean?</p>

<a name="80206-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08020699000073"></a>The court does not have the powers to take most of the measures needed to reduce reoffending, such as powers to commission a place in an adolescent mental health unit. I have learnt that the new youth justice legislation introduced in the Republic of Ireland gives the court the power to demand an appropriate mental health placement. The court does not have the powers to demand social work attention, a place in a special school, or any of those aspects of welfare provision that might help to reduce reoffending. The &#147;principal aim&#148; is an extraordinary and inflated view of what a criminal justice system can achieve or what is proper for a justice system to seek to do. This inflated idea of what the system can achieve has landed the Government in substantial difficulty.</p>

<a name="80206-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08020699000074"></a>I want to move on to the detail of the amendments spoken to by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow. The Joint Committee on Human Rights was surprised to see the provision that in sentencing a child under 18 the,</p>
<ul><a name="08020699000142"></a>&#147;court must have regard primarily to the principal aim of the youth justice system ... to prevent offending (or re-offending)&#148;.</ul>

<a name="80206-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08020699000075"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights wrote to the Government and asked how they reconciled their position with their obligation under Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Government&#146;s reply is worth quoting, although it is not that short:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="08020699000135"></a>&#147;We believe it is right that welfare should not be the primary purpose of sentencing and Article 3 of the CRC does not require that it should be. It requires that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration. It is. That is why the welfare of the child is specifically mentioned in clause 9 as something the courts must have regard to when sentencing&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08020699000088"></a>It goes on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="08020699000136"></a>&#147;A justice system exists to tackle crime. Then it must also consider the needs and interests of victims and the wider community which is why punishment must remain a purpose of sentencing.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80206-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08020699000076"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights, unsurprisingly, was not convinced by that reply. The committee therefore concluded that the effect of Clause 9 is to subordinate the child&#146;s best interests to the status of the secondary consideration below the primary consideration of crime prevention. The committee therefore recommended that the provision subordinating the duty to have regard to the welfare of the child to the principal aim of the system should be deleted. It also recommended that the Bill should be amended to make it explicit that the welfare of the child should be a primary consideration. These two amendments seek to implement those recommendations. I am glad to support the noble Earl, Lord Onslow.</p>

I consider it important that we should start at some stage to make the welfare of the child, even the child offender, a primary consideration.

He is absolutely right, but it leads me to the point that I am concerned about in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. Two points worry me. Perhaps the more important is that it omits punishment of the offender. I believe that sentencing has to take into account that, where appropriate, children have to be punished. We are not in a world where the child&#146;s welfare forbids punishment where it is due. Children, like adults, have to be punished on occasions. Not all children have to be punished for all offences. As I wish to say in respect of a later amendment to the Bill, I hope, as indeed the Government choose, to have diversion of children from the offending court where offences have to be dealt with. But to ignore that punishment must be part of the duty of sentencing is to ignore a basic importance for the protection of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="080206108000004"></a>I have not put in a further amendment, but I would like to see something to the effect of the punishment of offenders &#147;where appropriate&#148;, which would provide the ability to punish or not to punish as might be appropriate for the child. The other perhaps rather more minor point that I would take issue with in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, is that I have the impression that he has taken Section 1(3) of the Children Act word for word into the amendment. I am not in disagreement with paragraphs (b) to (g), although I am not certain that (g) is appropriate. I am concerned about (a). I am not sure how far,</p>
<ul><a name="080206108000047"></a>&#147;the ascertainable wishes and feelings of the child&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080206108000040"></a>which are entirely appropriate in children proceedings, are equally appropriate in criminal proceedings. Of course the child as a defendant and the child whose welfare is to be considered have to be consulted. I am not certain that that needs to be put into primary legislation. That is something that the court would have to do in any event.</p>

<a name="80206-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="080206108000005"></a>My preference is to support the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, which probably covers all that is necessary, although I have no objection to the majority of what is said by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, apart from the two points. However, I feel strongly that one has to keep punishment in, even if it is punishment &#147;where appropriate&#148;, as I would prefer. </p>

If the child nicks a Mars bar, it has to know that it should not have nicked the Mars bar. Then punishment is legitimate. If the child does not know what it has done wrong, then one has to leave punishment out and go to reformism. Am I wrong?</p>

He is not someone whom one should be punishing in the sense that I was looking at punishment. However, there are children who offend who need to be told that this is unacceptable behaviour and that they have to answer for the consequences of what they have done. We cannot take welfare to take all children out of the criminal justice system, but there are out there many children who offend as a response to their appalling upbringing and dreadful background. Those children probably need help rather than punishment.</p>

Whatever I think of my noble friend from time to time, most of the time he is a decent chap trying to field a difficult wicket. Having said that, he is literate and he knows very well what we said to Amendment No. 1. It applies equally strongly today. I want to take up warmly the point made by the noble Earl. We are in a muddle conceptually about what we are doing. If a child is not aware that he has transgressed, then punishment is wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="080206108000009"></a>The point is to help the child to understand how they have transgressed. It is a social educational point because society failed that child in one way or another. Even in the context of the family, the child has been failed. It does not have the sense of right and wrong that we all take for granted; not that we always live by it. Sooner or later one has to bare one&#146;s chest: I believe that the concept of punishment has more to do with assuaging society&#146;s emotional needs than with getting the situation right. It is often emphasised to appease the wilfully ignorant popular press. It seems that as one who will never give up on the fight for rehabilitation being the principal objective, because it makes so much sense&#151;I have said it so often that I will not say again why it makes so much sense&#151;of course the noble Baroness is right that there are some people who know perfectly well that they have done wrong and it needs to be pointed out to them that that is not acceptable in society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="080206108000010"></a>I would be happier if we could get back to old-fashioned language in this context and talk more about corrective action to break a deviant in society: &#147;come on board&#148;.

The use of the word &#147;punishment&#148;, as applied to what you do as opposed to the act of sentencing, is where I part company with my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss. Of course, somebody who is too young and has a lack of understanding and all the other aspects referred to cannot possibly be subject to any form of punishment; correction, maybe.

This is where the effort must be, and where the Government and everybody who speaks on this wish to place emphasis. On this detailed list of additions to Part 2, they are very lengthy and a lot have come up in previous debates. Some could perhaps be cut back a little but, by and large, they underline the important aspects of what sentencers should be taking into account as they decide what to do in the best interests of the child and society. It is about time we faced up to this pretence that you will protect society by sounding fierce, and began to educate the public rather more that the best way to protect them is to ensure that we turn as many young people and their families on to a better understanding of how a better life can be achieved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="080206108000014"></a>Article 44 of the CRC requires that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="080206108000045"></a>&#147;A variety of dispositions, such as care, guidance and supervision orders; counselling; probation; foster care; education and vocational training programmes and other alternatives to institutional care shall be available to ensure that children are dealt with in a manner appropriate to their well-being and proportionate both to their circumstances and the offence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206108000041"></a>That is the fuller quote of what I spoke to in the previous amendment. This articulates exactly the template&#151;if you articulate templates&#151;that we need to guide us through the outcomes we should be seeking for our children, which are, in turn, translated admirably into the amendment before us today. Ideally, I would prefer to swap subsections (2) and (3), putting &#147;welfare&#148; before &#147;proportionate response&#148;, but I will not quibble with that. I am sure that all Members of the Committee would heartily agree with the concluding purposes of reform, rehabilitation, public protection and reparation by offenders. However, I know that the Government&#146;s position is that punishment should form part of the menu of purposes; not only have they, as the Minister has today, said so clearly, it is the first of the list of purposes in the Bill. However, it is excluded from the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="080206108000015"></a>I have listened carefully, and I am not surprised by what the distinguished noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has said about punishment, but I do not know that this is necessarily a forum for discussing something so huge and complex as what constitutes &#147;punishment&#148;, what we mean by it and where it comes in a whole range of circumstances, although we must somehow try to nail a little of it in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80206-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="080206108000016"></a>The fact remains that it is largely because of the desire to deliver punishment, which could be characterised in this context as a frightening and unpleasant experience and how you &#147;learn your lesson&#148;, that the alarming rise in child custody has taken place against a fall in offending. We also discussed that at length last night. Children and society are being further damaged; I do not think that there will be dispute over that. The key principles have been departed from.</p>

<a name="80206-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="080206108000017"></a>My experience of rigorous, systematic programmes of reparation and restoration are that they can be difficult, demanding and challenging for children, as well as unpleasant. However, they are also essentially constructive, which is perhaps the difference in this context between reparation, restoration and straight punishment. Punishment is essentially more negative. The punishment of prison is negative both in its application&#151;by which I mean the rupturing of family, home, work or school&#151;and the outcomes for reoffending, criminalising and so on.</p>

We have also been bringing local members of communities concerned into the choice and delivery of the sort of community reparation and restoration they would like to see. The results are very encouraging. We are developing, in certain ways, the Government&#146;s community payback schemes but with the crucial difference that the sentencers&#151;the people who actually make the decisions&#151;are essentially part of the programme. The understanding we have seen develop has also led to some palpable changes in attitude to community penalties by both sentencers and communities.</p>

<a name="80206-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="080206108000019"></a>The amendment therefore moves us on from a relatively simplistic, knee-jerk recourse to punishment, to something which is not only more appropriate to children&#146;s needs but, crucially, involves making good the damage done. It is a positive response. I am sure that those are the lessons we want all our children to learn. I would argue that we bring up our own children along those principles&#151;not just giving them a really hefty wallop; although I have certainly been known to do that from time to time. Anyway, that is what we want for our young offenders.</p>

<a name="80206-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="080206108000020"></a>Finally, I firmly believe that the belief of politicians in particular, and also the press&#151;whose views feed off each other with their mutual, essentially short-term, interests of holding on to a seat and selling tomorrow&#146;s newspaper&#151;do not represent the broad views of the public, which are far less retributive than they would have us believe. At RCP, we conducted our own poll through Mori which demonstrated that, and there has been a steady stream of similar polls in the past year or so. Most interestingly, last year, for the first time, there was a poll of the victims of crime. It was published by SmartJustice and showed, inter alia, that just under two-thirds did not believe that prison prevents offending and only 38 per cent supported the building of more prisons. What everybody wants above all is that the offender does not do it again&#151;here I echo the noble Baroness, Lady Stern. We all know that prison cannot achieve that, most especially with children, but that community interventions can and do. However, the fact still remains, as we discussed at some length on our first day in Committee, that the current purposes of sentencing are failing to an enormous extent. This amendment represents an important building block in the changes that we need to see.</p>

I welcome the strong emphasis on the welfare of children. I recognise what my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss said about the need for sanctions, boundaries and punishment for children where appropriate. However, considering that there are more than 3,000 children in custody in this country, while France and Germany combined have only 1,300, we have to say that we are not getting the balance between welfare and punishment right. I particularly welcome this amendment because, despite the welcome efforts of this Government in the provision for foster care, social work, psychiatric units and residential care, we still have so much further to go in that. We still lack about 10,000 foster carers, and demand for social workers still exceeds supply. We put the most vulnerable children into children&#146;s homes to

A survey looking at residential childcare workers in this country and on the continent found that in this country 20 per cent had a degree-level qualification, but in Germany it was 50 per cent and in Denmark it was 90 per cent. We have so far to go in this area. I welcome the emphasis on considering the welfare interest of the child because it forces us to think that we are imprisoning&#151;putting behind bars&#151;many children. Of course we have to punish some, and we have to put some children in those settings, but we, as a society, have failed many children by failing to provide them with consistent, well supported carers, by failing to support our foster carers over a long period of time, and by failing to put what is necessary into children&#146;s homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="080206108000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred to the mobile phone incident and the children who were given a three-and-a-half year sentence. At that time, a young man called Joseph Scholes was in a children&#146;s home. When that response to the mobile thefts took place, he was newly there and went out with a group of his peers. One of the others stole a mobile phone and because of the strength of feeling about that at the time Joseph Scholes ended up with a custodial sentence&#151;that very vulnerable young man. I cannot speak specifically about the children&#146;s home, but I know that generally speaking staff in children&#146;s homes need far more support than they get. If only the staff in that children&#146;s home had had the support to engage that young man and stop him going out in the street. He ended up being sent into custody. It was recognised that he was highly vulnerable, but there was no place for him in an overcrowded system, and he ended up in a young offenders institution. He was put under watch, but it was not good enough, and he hanged himself. I think I am correct to say that there was a history of abuse in the family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="080206108000023"></a>I welcome this amendment, and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. This amendment implies that it is no longer acceptable to lock up children as frequently as we do&#151;to put them behind bars as frequently as we do&#151;because of the lack of a decent welfare alternative: foster carers, social workers and residential carers. I hope the Minister will welcome the spirit of this amendment.</p>

When I retired from the public service some 20 years ago, I found myself, rather to my surprise, as chairman of the British branch of the United Nations Children's Fund. One of our first tasks in the years that followed was the negotiation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which we made a considerable contribution that was not always well received by Governments in this country. Looking at the terms of Clause 9 in Part 2, which deals with sentencing, I can say that those of us who have operated in the field of international child welfare find it a strange reaction because it appears that we are still concentrating on sentencing rather than on the rights and needs of the child. From my background, that looks like a very odd approach.</p>

I shall go no further than to say that I am extremely sympathetic to the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Onslow and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas. However, I wonder whether we ought to reflect further on where we locate the excellent contribution that the noble Baroness made yesterday, because it might affect the way that we approach the question of the primary purpose of sentencing, particularly when details follow that are not consistent with what the noble Baroness wishes.</p>

<a name="80206-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="080206108000026"></a>I shall not pursue that point any further because I want to address the conformity of the clause with our international obligations; a matter upon which I found the JCHR report especially impressive. As your Lordships are by now well aware, the Bill provides that,</p>
<ul><a name="080206108000048"></a>&#147;where a court is dealing with an offender aged under 18 in respect of an offence ... The court must have regard primarily to the principal aim of the youth justice system, that is, to prevent offending (or re-offending) by persons aged under 18 ... The court must also ... have regard to the purposes of sentencing&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="080206108000042"></a>which are,</p>
<ul><a name="080206108000049"></a>&#147;the punishment of offenders ... the reform and rehabilitation of offenders ... the protection of the public, and ... the making of reparation by offenders to persons affected by their offences&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80206-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="080206108000027"></a>The court must also have regard to the welfare of the offender, as required by Section 44 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. That duty is expressly made subject to the new duty to have regard to the principal aim of the youth justice system. It is extraordinary to reflect that in 1933 an Act could take such an enlightened approach in what we regard, perhaps not entirely rightly, as being a less enlightened age.</p>

<a name="80206-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="080206108000028"></a>The Explanatory Notes to the Bill state that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="080206108000046"></a>&#147;The Government does note that Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that in all actions concerning children their best interests are to be a primary consideration. The duty under section 44 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, to have regard to the welfare of the particular child ... will continue to apply&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206108000043"></a>However, Clause 9 clarifies that where the court is sentencing a juvenile offender it must primarily have regard to the principal aim of the youth justice system.</p>

<a name="80206-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="080206108000029"></a>Why do the Government consider that that provision is compatible with the obligation in Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child to ensure that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children? Their view, as I understand it, is that it is right that the courts should have regard primarily to the principal aim of the youth justice system when sentencing a young offender. The Government see no incompatibility with Article 3, apparently because that article only requires the welfare of the child to be &#147;a&#148; primary consideration in sentencing, not &#147;the&#148; primary consideration. The obligation in the CRC is to ensure that the best interests of the child are a primary consideration in all decisions affecting children.</p>

<a name="80206-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="080206108000030"></a>However, the effect of Clause 9 of the Bill is to subordinate the best interests of the child to the status of a secondary consideration below the primary consideration of crime prevention; in other words, to treat the welfare of the child as a mere supporting factor. In our view, the Bill should be amended to delete the provision which subjects the duty to have regard to the welfare of the child to the primary duty to have regard to the principal aim of the youth justice system. We also believe that the Bill should state that the sentencing court is required to have regard to the welfare of the child as a primary consideration as required by the convention.</p>

<a name="80206-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="080206108000031"></a>I have a second point about the consistency of the Bill with our international obligation. If your Lordships glance at proposed new Section 142A(4) in Clause 9, which they will have already done, they will see the statement about the purposes of sentencing, which are:</p>
<ul><a name="080206108000050"></a>&#147;the punishment of offenders ... the reform and rehabilitation of offenders ... the protection of the public, and ... the making of reparation by offenders to persons affected by their offences&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080206108000044"></a>These purposes seem to me to be indistinguishable from the purposes set out for adult sentencing. How do these purposes differ from the purposes of adult sentencing?</p>

<a name="80206-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="080206108000032"></a>As the Minister is well aware, we are signatories to more than one international convention which make it absolutely clear that the approach to sentencing children is entirely distinct to the approach to sentencing adults. I find none of this in the proposed new section in Clause 9, despite these obligations. So what has driven the Government in setting out a series of purposes, as they have done?</p>

Of course there will be situations in which a child cannot understand that what he or she has done is wrong. Clearly you need a system that will respond to that.

In my early days as a councillor in Oxford, I represented&#151;I am not going to call it a sink estate because that would be pejorative&#151;a council estate that had many challenges. Notwithstanding the difficult circumstances in which some young people are brought up, it is striking how many of them manage to do the right thing.

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="080206108000037"></a>This debate has taken place in the context of custody. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, particularly focused on children who find themselves in custody. I hope I have made clear that this Government believe that custody is the last resort, that the construct of youth rehabilitation orders is to strengthen the whole community sentencing structure and that we see YROs and the general policy direction we wish to see embraced as one where punishment can be constructive.</p>

But as part of that sanctioning process, there can be constructive programmes, hence the emphasis on the prevention of reoffending. I agree with what the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said about some of the issues around social care and fostering. We took part in the Children (Leaving Care) Bill a number of years ago which reflected on some of the very poor outcomes of children in care. There is much that we need to do for those children who end up in custody but we should not run away from the fact that punishment is part of the framework we are dealing with.</p>

In certain circumstances, punishment means retribution. We are not, I hope, talking about punishment as retribution. If we talk about punishment as education or help, we can happily talk about it. Punishment also should have an element of deterrence. In an article on capital punishment Lord Gardiner, when he was Lord Chancellor, said that retribution, deterrence and reformation were the three points of punishment. One cannot use the word &#147;punishment&#148; only as retribution, and I slightly got the impression that the Minister was doing that. I am trying to help the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, as well as the Minister. I am even sometimes thinking my own thoughts out loud to get to the bottom of this complicated matter.</p>

I hope that I did not give the impression that I simply saw punishment as retribution. I think that I said earlier that it could be part of a constructive approach to helping young people move away from the circumstances in which they commit crimes and helping them to rehabilitate and not to reoffend. On a technical point, I wish to make it clear that, although punishment is listed first, it is not a hierarchical list. The purposes of sentences have equal weight, but they are subject to the principal aim of the youth justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="080206113000006"></a>One of the glories of these debates is that Members of the Committee read out my answers because they have already been placed on the record. I do not want to bore the Committee by repeating that. However, I shall speak a little on Clause 9, which is designed to clarify the current law in order to remove confusion and to bring sentencing into line with the rest of the youth justice system. It is interesting that this has been welcomed by a number of relevant organisations. The Magistrates&#146; Association welcomes the clarity that the clause will introduce for magistrates when they are sentencing youths in the court. The Youth Justice Board welcomes this clarity, which would further emphasise the principal aim of the youth justice system. Interestingly, the Nacro response, is that, in view of the principal aim of the youth justice system to prevent offending, as set out in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, it is congruent to make this more clearly the purpose of sentencing. It is also interesting that, in December 2006, the Standing Committee for Youth Justice, said that it believed that

A number of organisations have commented in general in support of the way in which Clause 9 is constructed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="080206113000007"></a>Members of the Committee have again referred to Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the need to ensure that in all actions undertaken in a court of law the best interests of the child are a primary consideration. The Government believe that, while of course that is the position, it should not be &#147;the&#148; primary consideration. I realise that there is a bit of problem of semantics between &#147;a primary&#148; and &#147;the primary&#148;.

<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="080206113000010"></a>I accept that clarity is very important, and we hope that the clause provides clarity. In the first instance, when sentencing a young offender, the court should have regard to and the primary consideration should be the prevention of reoffending. We have a justice system that exists to tackle crime and, at its heart, needs to address offending or reoffending behaviour. Of course, it is the duty of the court to take into account the needs and interests of victims and the wider community, as well as those of the offender. We remain convinced that work to prevent offending must be in the young person&#146;s best interests. A young person&#146;s welfare must be considered in the sentencing process, which is why the courts are required to have regard to the welfare of the young offender. The courts are required to do that at present, and they will continue to do that.</p>

<a name="80206-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="080206113000011"></a>Much of the primary responsibility for the welfare of young people lies with the youth offending teams and service providers who have day-to-day responsibility for the child. In practice, it should be the responsibility of the youth offending teams to provide the court with the welfare background as part of the information provided in the pre-sentence report required before a community sentence may be made. The pre-sentence report is a key to effective working of the youth rehabilitation order, as it will act as a source document for the court&#146;s decision-making process. The pre-sentence report needs to include all relevant details on the young person and put forward recommendations to the court on appropriate interventions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="080206113000012"></a>On the youth rehabilitation order, the recommendations should cover which requirements are appropriate and what their duration should be on the basis of an assessment of the individual young person&#146;s needs. While I accept that it is fundamental that a criminal court, when sentencing a child or a young person, should have regard, as one of the primary considerations, to the welfare of the child, we cannot accept that that should override other considerations that a criminal court must take into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="080206113000013"></a>I know that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, asked me about Clause 9. The advice that I have received is that new Section 142A(3)(b) in Clause 9 is not subordinate to the purpose of sentencing, the principal aim of which is to prevent offending. Having considered what the noble Lord said about our international treaties, we said to the JCHR&#151;we believe that we were right&#151;that we thought that we were compliant with our international obligations.</p>

I disagree with the advice that the noble Lord has received about the CRC. The only way in which Clause 9 can possibly conform with the CRC is if new Section 142A(2) reads, &#147;The court must have regard to the principle aims of the youth justice system, which are to prevent offending or re-offending by persons under 18, and have regard to the welfare of the offender&#148;.</p>

That goes back to the earlier debate about the maturity of the child. That is the key professional, as I understand, who is turned to, to decide what level of development a child has reached. YOTs are well respected, but there is some concern that they do not have the welfare emphasis that they might have.

<a name="80206-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="080206113000039"></a>I was reminiscing about my experiences as a recorder when the noble Earl intervened. I wanted to give noble Lords a feeling for the mindset of those who deal with offenders when they are young. The first object is to get that person to take a different course. One learns of the familial cycles&#151;father, son, grandfather&#151;where members of the same family constantly turn up in court. In my time, I have certainly dealt with two generations, if not three. Generally speaking, such a young person under the age of 18 has an ill developed or malformed sense of right and wrong. The Minister and others have said that most people know what is right and wrong. That is not true. In some deprived families, there is a moral climate in which dishonesty is a way of life. Getting the better of other people is what life is about, and violence is accepted. That applies not just to the members of the family itself but to the peers of the young person, the gangs that roam around and, for example, steal mobile phones.</p>

<a name="80206-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="080206113000040"></a>What one finds with people under 18 is a lack of example from people who can show them that there is a better way of life. In sentencing young people, the first thought that comes into one&#146;s mind is whether there is any way of turning this person from a life of crime. When a convicted offender comes before you, the barrister who is representing him will talk about what a terrible time he had as a child and will go into all those issues. By the time that person is 19, 20 or 21 and has been through all the processes&#151;probation, what used to be borstal, youth offending or whatever&#151;you have to say, &#147;Tough. Society cannot deal with you in any other way except to lock you up, if the offence is serious enough, for its own protection. You have had your chances; you have not changed your ways; all sorts of interventions have been tried in an attempt to deal with you. We are sorry that you had a bad time as a child, but you have to take responsibility and face up to the consequences and disagreeable sanctions&#148;. I think that that was the definition of punishment for which the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, was striving.</p>

<a name="80206-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="080206113000041"></a>However, there is a stage before that. In dealing with someone who is under 18, we are hoping that we can reform and rehabilitate them and set the boundaries to which the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, referred. It is not punishment that will set boundaries for young people; it is encouragement, the teaching of values, the providing of leadership and of role models, so that the young person appreciates that they do not have to engage in crime. They do not have to follow their family or their peers.</p>

<a name="80206-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="080206113000042"></a>For those reasons, I totally agree with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, when he poses the question to which we have really had no answer: how do the purposes set out in Clause 9 differ from the way in which the purposes of sentencing are applied to adults? There should be a difference. There is a possibility of reform and rehabilitation. It is not enough to say that everybody understands punishment and that society wreaks vengeance on those who offend against its tenets. The public have to be protected, but we know that, for young people, detention and prison are failing; punishment in that sense is not working. It is not working because detention and imprisonment&#151;we   


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1115"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1115</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have said this so many times, but it is worth saying it at every opportunity&#151;do not provide the facilities, because of overcrowding, that teach people who are locked up about values and give them the leadership that they require. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, also took issue, to a much lesser extent, with the proposal that the sentencing court should ascertain the wishes and feelings of the child. For many years, I have referred in the House to the children&#146;s panels in Scotland as a much more constructive way of dealing with young people. You are involving, in a far less formal way, the children who are at risk and their parents and are trying to work out, with them, what their problems are and how they can best be addressed. The way in which we approach juvenile crime in this country, by a lower-level system of courts, is not good enough. We need much more of the children&#146;s panel system which is that much more successful in Scotland. I say that not because of my Scottish connections or because my noble friend Lady Linklater is sitting next to me. It is because the statistics show that the system works better by preventing reoffending to a greater degree and permitting children to break out of that cycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="080206113000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, says that we have to have punishment because people understand the concept. What I am always looking for from a Government of any hue is leadership to educate the public that there is a better way of dealing with young people than locking them up. We should not be paying heed to the cries of the popular press; we should be educating, not following, public opinion in this most important area.</p>

He seemed to indicate earlier that, when he had been a recorder, he had struggled with the issue of how you rescued somebody from a life of crime and said that, when you had tried this and tried that, you came to a point at which you had to say, &#147;Well, sorry, you may have had a hell of an upbringing, a hell of an experience, but nothing&#146;s worked, and the only possibility is to put you away&#148;. Does the noble Lord not really believe that he should say, &#147;The point has been reached at which we have to try a more disciplined approach to your rehabilitation than has perhaps been possible by all the other means, and, therefore, we are taking you into custody to have an intensive course&#148;?

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="080206113000053"></a>The other element of what the noble Lord said raises a wider and more contentious debate, but it underlies a lot of our position. I remember listening to a very senior policeman of a very enlightened hue, who said, &#147;The trouble is that, if you live in a society in which the social mores of the successful are greed, short cuts, getting what you can without being too squeamish about how you&#146;ve done it, where is your moral authority to appeal to those at the bottom of the pile? Where is your credibility when you start talking about the threat to society and saying that we must therefore lock someone up?&#148; I do not say it lightly, and I am sure that the concept of hypocrisy means little to many of the youngsters with whom we are concerned, but we are often seen as a pretty hypocritical society.</p>

I accept, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said, that there must be an element of punishment, but we do not always know what punishment means. These questions become deeper and more complicated the more one thinks of them. We can but struggle. I give the Government, and especially the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, credit for trying to get their heads around the matter and to do something about it. It is horribly complicated and difficult, and the crimes will be here generation after generation. I hope that I will get together with other noble Lords.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="080206113000066"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we can see now why Robert Mugabe&#146;s representatives at the series of talks arranged by President Mbeki following the SADC meeting in March 2007 were so often late in arriving or said that they were unable to attend at all. It has been Mugabe&#146;s objective right through the nine months of the infrequent talks to make the proceedings last as long as possible so that the new constitution which was eventually agreed would not come into force before the elections. That has now been achieved by Mugabe. The elections will take place at three levels and will now be held on 29 March this year.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="080206113000067"></a>The registration of candidates was originally to be completed this week; now it has been extended to next week. The new constitution has been initialled but not signed. ZANU-PF has clearly not been taken by surprise. It has been accumulating supplies of food, which Mugabe has for a long time been using for political purposes and which are said to be intended to amount to a few trillions of Zimbabwe dollars. ZANU-PF has, of course, had warning of the impending elections. In a cynical ploy to buy votes the regime has announced that it will over coming weeks open people's shops across the country to provide the basic commodities that are generally unavailable in Zimbabwe.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="080206113000068"></a>Developments as recently as today show that Mugabe's control of events is faltering. The postponement of the nomination day for a week seems to have been taken more in panic in ZANU-PF than with a sudden concern for the democratic process. The emergence yesterday of Simba Makoni from within ZANU-PF as a challenger for the presidency shows Mugabe's increasing isolation. This suggests that the political landscape of Zimbabwe could alter dramatically with new alliances and formations. Mugabe's fightback could be vicious. Makoni is reckoned by many to have prevaricated and supped with the devil for too long. Both he and Arthur Mutambara are widely claimed to lack grassroots support, while Morgan Tsvangirai has courageously led the mainstream MDC since its foundation and has won both scars and voter recognition for his efforts.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="080206113000069"></a>The rising anger against Mugabe was expressed recently by the president of ZINASU&#151;the Zimbabwe National Students Union. In a letter to Mugabe he writes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="080206113000109"></a>&#147;ZINASU is disappointed by your conduct, lack of seriousness and urgency in the purported on-going SADC mediation process meant to resolve the current multi-faceted crisis our country finds itself in. Your attitude towards the initiative facilitated by the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, leaves a lot to be desired, especially considering the fact that you proceeded to announce the election dates before the conclusion of the mediation process.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="080206113000110"></a>We further put to you that the students of Zimbabwe will not accept an election outcome from a flawed election process. We strongly and unequivocally warn you and your cronies that the country will be ungovernable if you steal the people's vote&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1119"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1119</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80206-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="080206113000070"></a>Mugabe clearly fears that the students mean business and are capable of becoming a focus for dissent. He has ordered all state-run universities and colleges to stay closed until after elections on 29 March.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="080206113000071"></a>The Zimbabwean economy is in a state of collapse. The shops, including food shops, have bare shelves because of Mugabe&#146;s decree that all shops must reduce the price of goods by 50 per cent. The first people to get to the shops after that decree, before the shelves were empty, were the police and the military. Other people have had to scavenge for food in waste bins.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="080206113000072"></a>What can be done? The mandate given to President Mbeki last March, at the urgently called conference of SADC heads of government in Tanzania, following a brutally disrupted prayer meeting, was simply to facilitate negotiation between ZANU-PF and the MDC. Before negotiations began instructions were given to the MDC by the police to avoid violence, even though the MDC is entirely peaceful. No such instructions were given to ZANU-PF.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="080206113000073"></a>One of the most urgent things which must be done is to renew the European Union-targeted measures against 131 of Mugabe's cronies limiting their travel, which expire this month. I would be grateful for the Minister's assurance that they will be renewed on time. Last year there were signs of backsliding by some EU members, which were halted by urgent action. These travel restrictions have been exaggerated by Mugabe's constantly describing them as savage economic sanctions, when of course they are nothing of the kind. African Union and SADC leaders peddle the same line. It is not known from what source these falsehoods come&#151;possibly somewhere not far removed from SADC headquarters&#151;but they seem to be given credence by a number of the SADC leaders. I should be glad to know what Her Majesty's Government are doing to refute these lies. Mugabe is a formidable practitioner of spin, but we may now have an opportunity to take our revenge against him.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="080206113000074"></a>Zimbabwe, like other SADC countries, is a signatory of the treaties for the African Union, SADC and NePAD. Those contain undertakings to observe human rights, good governance and the rule of law and to accept peer review. If Zimbabwe has not yet agreed to this last point it should be pressed by other SADC countries to do so. The promise was that these treaties were to be adhered to as part of a bargain with the developed world, which was the subject of a passionate speech by Tony Blair in 2001. The promise by the developed world was to increase the amount of aid, which has largely been done. I shall be glad to know also whether Her Majesty's Government have given thought to the implications of the substantial aid which is given to the SADC countries by the EU and by this country in particular. According to a Written Answer given to me on 10 October 2007, in col. <I>WA 17</I>, aid given by the United Kingdom in the year 2005 to the Southern African Development Community as a whole and to its member nations plus the UK's imputed share of multilateral aid to SADC member nations was over &#163;750 million. That is a formidable figure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="080206113000075"></a>The issue of Zimbabwe was discussed in Addis Ababa at the meeting of SADC countries a few days ago, on the sidelines of the African Union summit. President Mbeki reported that Mugabe's intransigence, and his reneging on agreements made early in the talks, had moved the mediation process to deadlock and failure. Eight nations supported President Mbeki's call for censure but three&#151;Swaziland, Namibia and Angola&#151;backed Mugabe and, surprisingly to me, that was deemed an insufficient basis for a consensual decision. Will Her Majesty's Government reconsider grants of development aid to these three countries to bring home to them the implications for our aid budget of their policy of supporting Mugabe? The Department for International Development will undoubtedly wish to consider aid holistically to SADC. By prolonging the crisis in Zimbabwe, these countries are adding to the massive sums that will be required for reconstruction when ZANU-PF eventually goes and undermining the development of the region as a whole.</p>

We need an election in Zimbabwe but we do not need Mugabe as a candidate. Zimbabwe has gone through a number of stages; it has gone from bad to worse and now to disaster. It is no wonder that thousands have left the country. For the unfortunate ones who have stayed, the rewards are quite clear: the abuse of their human rights, the destruction of their democratic rights and processes, and, of course, the suppression of their liberties.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="080206113000077"></a>As we have heard, the economy is not just on the verge of collapse but, as many would say, has collapsed. Seventy per cent are now unemployed; inflation figures are no longer believable. One in five is now living with HIV/AIDS and more than 1 million children have been orphaned and made vulnerable by the pandemic. One doctor described Zimbabwe in the following terms. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="080206113000111"></a>&#147;Zimbabwe once offered the most comprehensive medical service in Africa, but it has now become a textbook of medical horror&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206113000104"></a>Zimbabwe long ago lost most of its skilled people, the doctors, teachers, engineers and agricultural workers. Now all that it exports is its poverty.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="080206113000078"></a>Our Government have until recently been somewhat diffident in speaking up and speaking out against Mugabe's vile regime, but the time has come for us to confront the myth that our colonial past is somehow responsible for the current misery&#151;nothing could be further from the truth. To succeed in helping the people of Zimbabwe in their liberation struggle from Mugabe, we must take a proactive stance. I was proud that our Prime Minister declined to attend the EU-Africa summit in Lisbon because he did not wish to be in the same room as Mugabe. That was a good start. But if the Prime Minister does not want to be in the same room as Mugabe, is it right to expect our sportsmen

John Howard, as Prime Minister of Australia, gave a clear lead. He said that Australian cricketers would not play against Zimbabwe. If that is good enough for Australia, it should be good enough for the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="080206113000079"></a>A sporting, cultural and economic boycott would hasten the collapse of the regime and relieve the suffering of the people. We must give that lead. The Commonwealth, Europe and the United States would follow. I see the collapse of the regime not as an &#147;if&#148; but as a &#147;when&#148;. We should pause and reflect on how best we can help the people in order that we can ensure their liberation. During the apartheid regime in South Africa, Governments in many parts of the world trained and prepared members of the black population for leadership in that country, to enable them to make the transition from prison to power seamlessly and without violence. I therefore ask the Minister: what preparation is being made in that respect and more generally to help the people of Zimbabwe when that time comes? Protestation and whingeing is not enough. We must back our words with action and the time is now.</p>

Sadly, if the experience of Zimbabwe under Mr Mugabe in the past, or Kenya under Mr Kibaki in the present, are anything to go by, we can expect not only a rigged election, but violence afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="080206113000081"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Morris, has already said, there is already a profound humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe. With an unprecedented convergence of AIDS, poverty and malnutrition, and some 3,500 people dying every week, Zimbabwe now has the lowest life expectancy in the region. If loss of life, as well as historic relationships and responsibility, are important criteria in determining the rankings on the United Kingdom&#146;s foreign policy agenda, Zimbabwe certainly deserves to be higher up. There is now a critical shortage of basic foods. How are Her Majesty&#146;s Government and the European Union stepping up their efforts to meet the shortfall and to ensure that basic human needs are met in full to help create better conditions for the up-coming elections and for people&#146;s lives?</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="080206113000082"></a>Our South African friends have made an effort to obtain the conditions for a decent poll. However, President Mbeki has failed to move Mr Mugabe, who is flatly refusing to dismantle the structures that he has created over the past decade to manage elections and dictate the outcome. Unfortunately, as the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, said, when President Mbeki took the issue back to an extraordinary summit of SADC in Addis Ababa, not only did Mr Mugabe refuse to implement the reforms agreed and required, but he was backed by a number of the other African leaders, which is most disappointing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="080206113000083"></a>As a result, these elections are simply not going to be free and fair by international standards. The opposition have no exposure in the state-controlled media, they cannot campaign freely and many activists are refugees in South Africa and elsewhere. The voters roll is completely distorted by years of manipulation and any fair control of the poll is going to be difficult&#151;some would say impossible. The decision of the split opposition MDC to fight on a divided ticket is tragic. Whatever the short-term problems of agreement between Morgan Tsvangirai and Arthur Mutambara, the long-term consequences for the country are likely to be savage.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080206113000084"></a>Mr Mugabe and Zanu-PF are now so unpopular that I suppose an upset is just possible, but only if what happened in Kenya can be stopped. Prevention of a rigged election and count depends almost entirely on the presence of observer missions and the ability of local NGOs and the political parties to supervise the vote and the count and ensure that it is reported accurately and properly. How are HMG pressing African leaders to make that a possibility? I focus on African leaders because it is just not possible for this to be dealt with simply as an issue for Europe or European states. However, Her Majesty&#146;s Government should maintain their position that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="080206113000112"></a>&#147;It will only recognise an outcome that reflects the will of the people and only in that context would stand ready to help the new government to get back onto its feet&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206113000105"></a>On the other hand, if the election is, as we expect, rigged, there may be value in making it clear in advance that recognition of the new Government could be withheld. Certainly, we must find a way of doing more than simply wringing our hands.</p>

<a name="80206-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="080206113000085"></a>Now that the Mbeki initiative has failed, the UK Government along with other Governments need to engage in proactive multilateral diplomacy. Can we find a common position with South Africa, Botswana, Zambia and Mozambique? Does the Minister think that his right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary will go to South Africa to help build consensus that could bring about an end to the extreme suffering of so many millions of Zimbabweans?</p>

What we have witnessed in Zimbabwe over the past few years has been absolutely horrific, and, while we can all rehearse the depressingly familiar statistics, we need to recognise that this is, first and foremost, a human tragedy. Effectively, the Government of Zimbabwe have declared war on their own people. The cruelty that has been inflicted under Mugabe&#146;s regime will take a long time to heal: and the hurt continues. Fifty-six per cent of the population in Zimbabwe lives on less than $1 dollar a day and around 80 per cent lives on less than $2 dollars a day. In economic terms, Mugabe has managed to transform one of Africa's most successful economies into a complete disaster. Inflation is rampant and some economists count the figure as above 11,000 per cent. There is a shortage of food and the basic necessities of life.</p>

In the 2005 elections, Zanu-PF won more than two-thirds of the votes in parliamentary elections said by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change to be fraudulent. But, as my noble friend Lord Blaker acknowledged in the Motion for this debate, the damage extends well beyond economics and politics. Around 3,000 people die in Zimbabwe every week of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 1.8 million Zimbabweans infected with the disease. When some people stand up and proclaim the wonders of their assistance in tackling this human tragedy, they measure their contribution in terms of money spent. We should focus attention on the number of infections prevented and on the number of treatments, rather than the crude measurement of finance injected.</p>

I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity in his response to this debate to update the House on the actions of the British High Commissioner in South Africa to ensure that Mugabe is placed under maximum pressure. I appreciate that the British Government have to overcome sensitivities, given our colonial history with Zimbabwe, but it must be possible to do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="080206113000089"></a>Zimbabwe stands as testament to the truth that although the power, even of a good Government, to do good, is not infinite, the power of a bad one knows no limit. I hope that other African leaders will change course and live up to their responsibility for the disaster that keeps deteriorating in Zimbabwe. Mugabe has done his country no favours, and the sooner he is out of office the better. It is imperative that the country returns to true democracy, and that opposition leaders are respected and protected. Other African countries need to support this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="080206113000090"></a>In conclusion, it is not the removal of Mr Mugabe that is necessary; the country needs humanitarian aid, the building of institutions, the restoration of democracy on a proper basis, and considerable investment by foreign countries.</p>

My diocese has companion links with three dioceses in Zimbabwe. Members of our parishes pay occasional visits there, and we encourage our link bishops, from time to time, to come here for consultations. One returned to Zimbabwe last week after such discussions.

President Mugabe&#146;s apparent ability to act decisively on land reform has impressed many in Africa. We know that the short cuts taken to land reform through violent farm seizures were disastrous, involving the transfer of land to ZANU-PF supporters, regardless of their ability to farm, and often on the basis of cronyism. Agriculture has been devastated, which, along with poor harvests and drought, has turned the bread basket of Africa into an unproductive wasteland. With elections on the horizon and the knowledge of the political capital that President Mugabe has made from land reform, it is most important that the British Government re-emphasises their commitment to helping a legitimate Zimbabwean Government to achieve land reform that is equitable for all Zimbabwean citizens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="080206113000093"></a>In Zimbabwe, the place where the people most often go to keep their sense of identity is the local church. More than that, when there is little cause for economic or political hope, it is in the churches that people find the most essential human quality&#151;hope for the future. I do not want to mislead noble Lords. Because the church is often the most extensive and deeply rooted community-based network, it also reflects the tensions and divisions of the world in which it is set. Recently in the diocese of Harare, there has been a tremendous battle for the soul of the church, with a close political ally of President Mugabe, Bishop Kononga, driving out clergy who oppose him. The province acted and removed him from office. On Sunday, a new bishop was installed, with more than 700 people worshipping with him at short notice. The good news is that this demonstrates how the brave people of Zimbabwe, given the opportunity, are more than ready to take responsibility for governance. What can happen at the heart of the church can happen at the heart of Government. Please, God, may it do so before too long.</p>

Whatever the merits of the policies pursued by Her Majesty&#146;s Government, the UN, the European Union, the Commonwealth and, indeed, the SADC states, they have all, without doubt, failed miserably. The country is broken, the majority of the people are utterly destitute, society has broken down and the rule of law has gone. This is entirely a man-made tragedy, the blame for which lies squarely with Robert Mugabe, his ZANU-PF henchmen, and those political leaders in the region who have appeased him. </p>

Previous debates have covered a lot of detail, and the House knows very well the depth of the tragedy in the country: the lack of water, the lack of electricity, the misery and the destruction of human rights. We know those bitter facts. We now need to look beyond the current regime. It will not last for that much longer. There are those with power and influence in the country who realise this. We now need to concentrate on what happens after Mugabe goes, as he inevitably will, in, one hopes, the not too distant future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="080206113000096"></a>The infrastructure is now in a terrible state, but it can be rebuilt with help from the developed world. Now is the time to start talking in concrete terms about this reconstruction process, by putting together a coalition of funders, including Governments, multilateral development and funding agencies, including the World Bank, and corporate&#151;and even private&#151;donors. With funding pledges on the table and a reconstruction plan standing by, the prospects for rebuilding the country, stabilising the economy, starting to tackle the desperate healthcare situation and restoring power become more tangible. The prospect of a successful transition from a disastrous dictatorship to a benevolent peaceful regime must be attractive to those with the potential to influence events from within the country.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080206113000097"></a>I am, perhaps, surprisingly optimistic about the prospects for Zimbabwe in the medium term. Many of the productive emigrants, including farmers, teachers and engineers, would come back and work with the brave people who have stayed in that country to rebuild it. Zimbabwe will get worse before it gets better, but hope may not be too far away. We can influence this process with a constructive contribution, as well as maintaining political pressure on Zimbabwe and its influential neighbour in the south, which surely has the key to accelerating this process.</p>

I entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth, that the situation has gone from bad to worse to disastrous. Despite the heavy rains over the past month, most of the farms remain deserted, with very few new crops being grown, facing the inevitability of yet another year of starvation, this time even worse than last year. This will lead, inevitably, to an ever-larger number of Zimbabweans attempting to get across the border into South Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080206113000099"></a>While I support all the measures that can be exerted by the international community to bring pressure to bear on Zimbabwe, I have always advocated that there need to be African solutions for African problems. To this end, while President Thabo Mbeki has had reasonable success as the SADC facilitator in his mediations with Mugabe and the MDC, these efforts, as has already been mentioned, have been aborted by President Mugabe calling a snap election for 29 March. This leaves no time for an agreement to be reached on the new constitution, or the repeal of the tough and very draconian security laws. There is unlikely to be any material change in Zimbabwe, as we all know, until there is a change in leadership. To this end, I certainly welcome the recent news that Simba Makoni will be standing against Mugabe in the presidential elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080206113000100"></a>Mugabe clearly saw the opportunity to call a snap election with the opposition MDC being totally disorganised and failing to form a unified front.

Having the backing of Solomon Mujuru, the ex-head of the armed forces, and several other senior ZANU-PF leaders, should add weight to his campaign. However, like the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, I fear the backlash of Mugabe&#146;s support base against Simba Makoni.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="080206113000101"></a>There is no doubt that Mugabe manipulated the ZANU-PF December congress to ensure that he was the only candidate standing on behalf of the party for the presidency, which was totally wrong. Whatever the outcome of the presidential election, should Mugabe win, the general view is that at the age of 84 he will seek to hand over power soon after being re-elected to his chosen successor. The fear of many Zimbabweans is that this will be Mr Mnangagwa.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="080206113000102"></a>There have been many calls for South Africa to do more to put pressure to bear on there being a change in leadership in Zimbabwe. The recent move by Eskom to cut off the electricity supply to Zimbabwe due to electricity shortages in South Africa has shown the huge dependence that Zimbabwe has on South Africa. However, it is unlikely that South Africa will seek to take these measures intentionally to force political change in Zimbabwe. What is more interesting is whether President Mbeki&#146;s successor, who is likely to be Jacob Zuma, will take a stronger line on forcing changes in Zimbabwe. I believe that he would take a stronger line, but it is unlikely that he will come to power before the middle of next year, and that depends on the outcome of the criminal case against him. It is anticipated that President Mbeki will elaborate on his strategy on Zimbabwe in his state of the nation speech this Friday.</p>

I would also have liked to elaborate on the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, as to what measures have been taken by the international community to offer some form of Marshall Aid package to promote change but, more importantly, expedite the reconstruction of the country once there has been a long-awaited change in leadership in Zimbabwe.</p>

In the past eight years we have had a number of debates on Zimbabwe.

Under the NePAD agreement, many African states have taken all the extra money we said that we would give them but they have given nothing back in increased civil rights, better protection for their citizens or democracy. That is a major failing. The situation, as we see it from this country, is not helped by the situation internationally. The EU is what I would term peely-wally with regard to Zimbabwe. The UN does not take much interest in it

China is sneaking in through the back door whenever it can to disrupt the situation and is planning its future in terms of all the mineral and other assets that Africa has.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="0802071000004"></a>One unique and extraordinary thing about Zimbabwe is that despite the past eight years it has not resorted to violence. That is an amazing fact. If it had resorted to violence, perhaps something might have happened. The French are very quick to protect their interests in Chad, and Kofi Annan, former head of the UN, quickly went to sort out the situation in Kenya. Those countries are getting all the help that can possibly be given. The poor Zimbabweans have been the good guys in this and have not fought. The MDC has resisted every temptation and every encouragement to fight, and it has come worst off. It is a sad tale of human beings in the current world that the bad guys get the help and seem to come out better off than the good guys.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="0802071000005"></a>Mugabe continues to run rings around Mbeki. I differ on this, as I always have, with the noble Lord, Lord St. John of Bletso. Mugabe knew exactly what he was doing; he was running the talks with Mbeki to the last possible minute, knowing that if there was no agreement the MDC would split, making his rigging of the election that much easier. That is exactly what has happened. I give no credit at all to Mbeki. He should have stood up to the other African states and been much stronger with Mugabe right at the beginning. He should have said, &#147;These are the terms. Come on, Robert, sign up. We have been old friends long enough&#148;. But he let it run right to the end and Mugabe ran circles round him.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="0802071000006"></a>I cannot predict what is going to happen in the next month until the election. All one knows is that Mugabe is going to cause severe mayhem with all the opposition candidates, including Makoni. The postponement of the nomination panel gives him a very good chance, as he has a week to screen out all the Makoni supporters and make the election a safer bet. What will happen to poor Zimbabwe? Can the Minister tell us what plans there are for the future? If he is going to get a Marshall Aid package or something like that, what strings will be attached? We cannot afford to let Africa get away with another NePAD, where we give it money and it gives us nothing back in return. I am talking about &#147;us&#148; in the wider sense of the citizens of Africa and of the world. They should give us back democracy and civil rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="0802071000008"></a>There was no mention of Zimbabwe at the AU summit which ended last Sunday. SADC got a report from Mr Mbeki in the margins, but it has said nothing about the reforms that will be necessary for even a partial approximation of free and fair elections on 29 March. The signs are ominous, with opposition rallies being prohibited, activists beaten up, and the police chief being given a grand new title and new car and making public threats against what he calls &#147;those bent on exploiting the economic situation&#148;. We can expect to see violent attacks against candidates and supporters who campaign against the policies that are beggaring the nation while handing new privileges to the army, the police and the so-called war vets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="0802071000009"></a>It is a tragedy, as my noble friend Lord Alderdice said, that the two wings of the MDC failed to reach an agreement on joint presidential and parliamentary candidates, but with ZANU-PF and Mugabe universally hated by the people, there could still be a sporting chance that Mugabe could be defeated. There are splits within the ruling party, with Simba Makoni, the former finance Minister, deciding to contest the presidential election. Apart from him, there are several incumbent ZANU-PF Ministers and former MPs being sidelined in the selection of candidates. No one imagines that there will be a free and fair election, but if the presence of well-resourced observers over the next seven weeks could make a difference&#151;and I believe that it could&#151;what efforts are we making to see that observer teams are properly resourced and financed?</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="0802071000010"></a>Could we perhaps ask the SADC countries to sound out the Commonwealth about possible technical help that it might be able to give not only to the SADC observers but also against the possibility, as has been mentioned, that Zimbabwe will need substantial reconstruction after the election? The observer team might have something to contribute to that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="0802071000011"></a>The regime has said that it will relax the restrictions on foreign journalists, who can play a crucial part in monitoring conditions in the run-up period. I would like to mention the intrepid Sue Lloyd-Roberts, who last autumn got in to show people starving and disease rampant; and, just the other day, John Simpson, who exposed the divisions within ZANU-PF. The free media, particularly journalists from SADC countries, can do more than politicians to ensure that Zimbabwe does not wake on 30 March to a disputed result, with consequences that could be even more disastrous than the horrors we have seen in Kenya.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="0802071000013"></a>Looking back on our endless debates on this subject, I find that we were told again and again that quiet diplomacy was the best course and would work. I gather that the Minister has just been touring parts of Africa, and I hope that he found out for himself what some of us have long argued. While we obviously could play no direct and confrontational part in the unfolding Zimbabwean tragedy, we could and should have been much tougher from the start on sanctions against individuals, companies and interests that were enriching themselves while supporting the regime, and on doubters at the UN who persistently blocked attempts to bring the horrors of Zimbabwe to the Security Council. We could and should have pressed Mr Mbeki and South Africa to be more robust and creative. We could and should have urged China sooner to stop sending aid and succour to Mugabe&#151;as my right honourable friend David Cameron has now rightly done. This is not the fault of the present Minister, as he was not in place, but the Government did not do any of those things. Instead we were constantly and repeatedly told that quiet diplomacy would do the trick.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="0802071000014"></a>Now where have we got to? We have inflation touching anything between 13,000 and 100,000 per cent&#151;somewhere between the two. We have unemployment at 80 per cent, a quarter of the population relying on food aid, refugees streaming over the borders and the rule of law collapsing. To repeat the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso: it would be interesting to know about British subject Simon Mann and why all his legal rights seem to have been ignored in his illegal extradition to Equatorial Guinea.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="0802071000015"></a>This is a disastrous scene in which, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown&#151;I think that I have them right&#151;we have an aid and development policy in Africa but not a foreign policy. That has been the trouble. When one looks at the huge imbalances between the resources available to DfID and those available to diplomacy and the Foreign Office, it is only too obvious what has happened. In the new Comprehensive Spending Review up to 2011, the FCO gets a 0.2 per cent reduction each year, and DfID&#151;which already has a budget four times larger&#151;gets an 11 per cent increase. This is a dangerous imbalance. Instead of having a foreign policy alongside our aid policy, we have been left to drift along with spineless international policy on Zimbabwe and, just somehow, to hope for miracles.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="0802071000016"></a>Maybe a few small miracles could be about to happen, but I do not know. We have heard about Simba Makoni, who has had the enormous courage to emerge to challenge Mugabe in the elections. We know that the Government are now being forced to take back farms that were parcelled out to cronies and officials because they have produced nothing, and that they will now be put in more competent managerial hands. While the MDC opposition is sadly split, so now is ZANU-PF, and that must be good.</p>

I would like to see a Commonwealth working committee drawn from both African and other member state personnel to explore real land reform options, to encourage donors to re-engage and to plan an effective recovery strategy post Mugabe in that once rich country. I am sure that point has not yet been reached, and maybe things are going to get worse before they get better. We can only pray that, when it comes, there will be recovery and prosperity.

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="0802071000019"></a>We all support the view that our primary focus must be on helping ordinary Zimbabweans. The UK is the second largest bilateral donor, giving &#163;45 million in the current year and some &#163;173 million since 2000. As we have frequently reassured this House, this aid is distributed via third parties&#151;the UN and NGOs&#151;and not via the Government. As many noble Lords said, the indications, on every indicator, are that the country faces worse times ahead. The harvest will be poor. We are spending &#163;10 million a year tackling the HIV/AIDS crisis. As the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, said, that does not do justice to the fact that this money is not achieving the results we would wish. Life expectancy is now a catastrophic 35 years.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="0802071000020"></a>We continue to spend money to support democratic change, supporting civil society as well as lawyers to try and improve the climate for free and fair elections. We have ensured that EU-targeted measures are in place to punish President Mugabe and the elite and not the ordinary people of Zimbabwe. I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, that we are confident that those targeted measures will be renewed again later this month.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="0802071000021"></a>We speak regularly with other countries in the region, in particular South Africa and other SADC countries, to encourage them to resolve the crisis. But I take the point about quiet diplomacy. I myself met with the South African Foreign Minister at the end of last week, in the margins of the AU summit. We also have word of the briefings that the South Africans made to the other SADC member states. I am not quite as well informed as the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, on how the countries are divided on the issue, but we are seeing a disappointing failure of the neighbours to stand up for the kind of change that we must see in Zimbabwe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="0802071000022"></a>I do not agree that withholding aid from other SADC members is the way to achieve change there. Angola, which the noble Lord mentioned, is an oil-rich country that is in no way dependent on aid and with its own strong point of view on these issues. SADC contains a number of countries whose development and performance of democracy and respect for it is admirable in its own right. We just wish that they would be as vigorous in applying the same standards to their neighbour Zimbabwe as they are brave enough to apply them at home.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="0802071000023"></a>President Mbeki&#146;s efforts to mediate have essentially now expired. The election has been declared by President Mugabe and he has not accepted the MDC&#146;s demands for delays. By so doing he has negated the few conditions that had been negotiated, all of which depended on time for implementation to allow for a freer and fairer election.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="0802071000024"></a>President Mugabe has stated that there will be no amendment to the constitution until after the elections. One must therefore assume that the conditions for genuinely free and fair elections remain far away. The electoral roll is incomplete and inaccurate. It seems that millions of those outside the country have no prospect of being able to vote. The many new constituency boundaries introduced under the negotiations have been introduced in a rush and essentially amount to gerrymandering, favouring ZANU-PF. To this day, the opposition is unable to hold rallies freely or complain without harassment and is not being given equal access to the media. The military and the police continue to crawl all over the election management process.</p>

<a name="80206-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="0802071000025"></a>On the point about international election observers, it is very unlikely that credible international teams will be allowed to monitor the elections. I therefore use this debate in the House tonight to appeal to the SADC Heads of State and Government who have established very good principles of electoral conduct for their sub-region to insist that those principles be applied in Zimbabwe, and to be the first to declare that they have not been met if indeed they are not met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="0802071000026"></a>I turn to the issue of cricket, raised by my noble friend Lord Morris. There are no sporting sanctions on Zimbabwe, but the Foreign Secretary and others in this Government have made it clear that we do not encourage the England and Wales Cricket Board to allow Zimbabwe to tour England in 2009 or England to tour Zimbabwe in 2012 if the situation in the country is as it is now. We continue to speak to the ECB about these issues but it remains a decision for the board. We have decided that the Government can make their position clear, but that it is not for us to intervene directly in this matter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="0802071000027"></a>I shall say a word about Simon Mann. Before his appeals process had exhausted itself, and therefore completely in contravention of Zimbabwe&#146;s own legal standards and system, he was removed from the country and sent to Equatorial Guinea. We have sought consular access to him there without success to this point. We are pressing both there and here in London for Simon Mann&#146;s rights to be met. We are extremely concerned about the situation given the history of what has happened to prisoners before in that country. We shall certainly press fully for Mr Mann to enjoy his full legal rights.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="0802071000028"></a>A number of noble Lords including the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark raised questions on the future situation in Zimbabwe. My right honourable friend the Prime Minister said in another place that we stand ready to assist in the economic recovery of Zimbabwe once our benchmarks for change in that country have been met; once there is a Government who are genuinely committed to economic and political reform and to the restoration of the rights of its citizens; and once there is a Government who enjoy the support of their people. At that point Britain will be generous in its support to economic recovery. I can assure noble Lords that we are already preparing for that day. We have been working with international institutions such as the World Bank, about which the noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, inquired. We are looking at the cost of recovery. We are planning for it and talking to international partners. I agree entirely that recovery must deal with the issue of land, which remains at the heart of so much of the dispute in that unhappy country.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="0802071000029"></a>I share the views of those who contrasted the international attention given to Kenya and that given to Zimbabwe. I hope it does not prove the point that several noble Lords made, that the international community will be stirred into action only if there is violence. We all devoutly hope that that will not happen in Zimbabwe, although we all also recognise that a very high level of state violence is already being applied to the citizens of that country.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="0802071000030"></a>Zimbabwe is the guilty secret of Africa and the international community. There is a terrible double standard. There has been a failure to point the finger publicly and to declare what a terrible crime is occurring against the citizens of that country. We hope that this election will enable those who run against President Mugabe to champion that point of view. We wish them all the best in the election. To go any further than that would be to undermine their own standing. Even these words will be passed on by President Mugabe and his propaganda sidekicks in an attempt to suggest that one or other or all three of them are British stooges and the British candidates to replace him.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="0802071000031"></a>We hope, as others have said, that there is a glimmer of hope; that, even in a snap election conducted under impossibly unfair conditions, with all the levers, advantages and cards in hands of government, God and good fortune will smile on that unhappy country, and that perhaps out of these elections will emerge a surprising electoral upset. In order to try to ensure the possibility of such an outcome we will insist&#151;and impress on Europe, the region, the UN and the rest of the international community the need to insist&#151;that the right standards of freeness and openness are met in that election to allow the country to return to democracy and prosperity. Zimbabwe has the world's highest inflation rate, lowest life expectancy and, as has been pointed out, an ever-growing number of HIV/AIDS orphans. It is clear to everyone that the solution to this crisis cannot come soon enough.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="0802071000032"></a>We still believe that that solution must first and foremost be an African solution supported by the region and the wider international community. We

In the mean time, to ease the suffering of Zimbabweans at the hands of their leadership, we will continue to provide crucial humanitarian assistance to ordinary Zimbabweans, to try to ease their suffering amidst all the pain and pressures they endure in their everyday lives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="0802071000037"></a>The noble Lord said: After the wide-ranging debate on the previous group of amendments, I might well be accused of condescending to the particular in this amendment. Indeed, it is an amendment about a particular and clear matter.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="0802071000038"></a>Financial compensation orders are not often used by the courts. Why is that so? There are some links here to reparation orders. Financial compensation orders could be an effective way of impressing on offenders the significance of their crime&#151;to take just one example, crimes associated with vandalism. The reality is that the number of financial compensation orders made in youth courts is extremely limited. Offenders who commit property or shop-lifting crime often do not accept that there are any victims. Here is an opportunity to change that. Obviously, a financial compensation order would have to be tailored to the offender and take into account his circumstances. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_209"></a>

I am clear that young people who have offended should be held responsible for their actions and that proper reparation, including financial compensation, should be an important feature of making young people accountable for their actions.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="0802071000040"></a>We do not think that there is a specific need for the noble Lord&#146;s amendment for a number of reasons. Reparation is a key theme within the current framework of the youth justice system, which is why it should be included as a purpose of sentencing for the court to consider. The court can sentence a young person to a specific reparation order, which will remain a separate sentence beneath a youth rehabilitation order. A reparation order focuses on reinforcing personal responsibility

It may cover a variety of activities from simply writing a letter of apology to carrying out work to assist the local community.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="0802071000041"></a>I took part in such a community payback programme in relation to a scout hut in Northolt some months ago and met a number of young people who were required to take part. I must say that I found it useful. It is interesting that through such schemes and their contribution, some of the young people have found skills and work. They also contributed to renovating a much-needed community asset, when it would have been difficult to find the resources to do it.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="0802071000042"></a>There are many other marvellous examples to which we must pay tribute. As we discussed yesterday, I thought that reparation must be an element within the youth rehabilitation order itself. Reparation activities can be used in some of the requirements and as unpaid work.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="0802071000043"></a>In terms of the legislation, we believe that courts already have the power to order any offender to pay compensation under existing legislation. Section 130 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 provides for that power. A compensation order awarded by the court in favour of the victim is the primary sentence of the court, like a fine. Its main purpose is to punish the offender, not necessarily to compensate the victim fully.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="0802071000044"></a>I noted the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that it is all very well there being a provision but it does not seem to be used often. I have some sympathy with that, although no doubt he would acknowledge the benefit of the courts&#146; discretion in these matters, as he has pointed out to us. The problem is probably that the courts take the view that it would not serve a useful purpose to award an amount and require payment at a level that the offender had no hope of repaying within the foreseeable future, which might merely tempt him or her to commit further crime.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="0802071000045"></a>That may be the reason, but as I have said, my figures for 2005-06 show that 15,492 compensation orders were given to young offenders. Clearly the power is used to a certain extent, but I am happy to take away the provision to see whether anything more could be done to encourage more use of the order in the future.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="0802071000051"></a>The noble Baroness said: Despite the Government&#146;s protestations that custody should indeed be the disposal of last resort and for the shortest possible time, as is laid down in international human rights law, the fact remains, as we have now said over and over again, that the number of children in custody has steadily risen over the Government&#146;s lifetime. One hopes that when one says these things over and over that the content of the meaning does not get diluted. It is just a serious fact.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="0802071000052"></a>It is accepted in theory that because they are children, those who break the law must be treated differently from adults, as we have already been saying at great length today. All those institutions and structures devised to deal with them must take that into account. However, the JCHR in scrutinising the provision in the Criminal Justice Act took the view that the restriction on the use of custody is a general one applying to all offenders rather than specifically ensuring that it is genuinely used as a last resort where children are concerned.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="0802071000053"></a>The reason for this amendment is to introduce a more specific safeguard and to create a statutory custody threshold that will act as a barrier to the downward use of custody for lesser offences and be clearly for public protection, except of course where mandatory custodial sentences apply. For the awful truth is that while the crime rate overall is dropping, the numbers of children in custody is rising.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="0802071000054"></a>We have rehearsed so often in this House the statistics relating to children that show that on virtually every measure they are the most deprived and damaged in our society. When we add to that the fact that the reoffending rate is the highest of any group and the subsequent life chances are the lowest, it seems clear that we are all losers in the exercise. It is neither logical nor justifiable in any of the outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="0802071000055"></a>Further, we could just remember that six children have died in custody in the past five years. However, there is evidence that a custody threshold was successful in bringing down the custody figures when it was tried 25 years ago. It resulted in a 54 per cent decrease over a decade on the under-21s given custody for an indictable offence until it was repealed in 1991. Since it cost the YJB &#163;280 million in the year ending March 2007, just think of the possibilities for greater investment, rehabilitation, prevention and restorative alternatives.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="0802071000056"></a>The current threshold under the Criminal Justice Act 2003 is too vague, but Section 1(4) of the 1982 Act provided that the courts must not pass the sentence of custody on a person under 21 unless they were,</p>
<ul><a name="0802071000165"></a>&#147;of the opinion that no other method of dealing with him is appropriate because it appears to the court that he is unable or unwilling to respond to non-custodial penalties or because a custodial sentence is necessary for the protection of the public or because the offence was so serious that a non-custodial sentence cannot be justified&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802071000125"></a>I recommend most urgently to the Minister that we follow that excellent precedent and reintroduce such a threshold again. I beg to move.</p>

She referred to the unacceptably large number of young people being incarcerated in one way or another. With that statistic goes the reality that the facts speak for themselves: it is not a successful process. The rate of reoffending remains deeply disturbing. Even if there were no other grounds, any sane society would say that we had better look at this because what we are doing is obviously not effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="0802071000060"></a>The noble Baroness has put the case very well. On the amendments immediately following, we shall touch on the danger to children in custody as well. I therefore applaud Amendment No. 71 and plead with my noble friend the Minister to take it seriously. The purpose of my amendment is simply to say that I am at least as concerned about the 18 to 21 year-old age group. This was brought home to me in the context of the YMCA&#146;s work in young offender institutions, prisons and the rest. That age group is in many ways a particularly vulnerable section of the population, because it is so easy for staff and others to regard them as adults and they are not. Just think of our own children&#151;as I wish we would more often in this situation&#151;and how dependent they are. They may not want to admit it, but they are terribly dependent and reliant. We must therefore be particularly careful about consigning anyone in that age group to custody unless&#151;as we shall come to on later amendments&#151;we are certain about the form of custody into which we are putting them. My amendments are therefore in a spirit of welcoming the

It brings to mind the fact that, in the custodial system as it is, there are people aged under 18 in the hands of the Prison Service, and then those aged 18 to 21 of whom there many more, but they are marginalised. They are marginalised because nobody is responsible for looking after them; they are not regarded as adults, they are not regarded as children and nothing is done for them.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_283"></a><a name="0802071000062"></a>That group probably needs our help more than any other which we are not helping. Its members are on the threshold of adulthood; it is the last chance saloon, if you like. Therefore, while we are dealing with children and all the special things that happen, we ought to bear in mind that some establishments known as &#147;split sites&#148; have both groups. If you visit them, you will find that the younger group has facilities like education and work, and the 18-21 year-olds have not because the facilities have been milked to provide them for the juveniles for whom the Prison Service is under contract from the Youth Justice Board.</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="0802071000063"></a>It has been said that this group of young offenders should go up to the age of 25. That is another debate and another aspect that needs to be considered, but bearing in mind that, as I shall be raising in another amendment, it is now possible for people to remain in care until the age of 21 and remembering the immaturity of some of these people who need all the help that they can get, it is right that the restrictions on custody that the noble Baroness has so rightly raised should apply to the age range raised by the noble Lord, Lord Judd.</p>

While it is true that since 1990 30 children have died in custody&#151;that is a disturbing enough statistic&#151;during the same period 201 people aged 18 to 20 have died in custody, including 178 self-inflicted deaths and five homicides. We somehow as a society just say, &#147;Oh well, those are the statistics&#148;. Think of the human tragedy that every case represents and the appalling situation for families, relatives and others. For all those reasons, we cannot overemphasise the importance of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment. I am very glad to see that she seems to be indicating that she has no difficulty with our proposition that it should be extended to cover the 18 to 21 age group.</p>

I note what the Minister said about a static period, but can he say a bit more about the trend? I understand there was a rising trend, then a static period and then it began to rise again more recently. Has that rise now settled?</p>

<a name="80206-0013.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="0802071000067"></a>There are a number of points to make about this. I think I am correct in saying that there has not been a death in a local authority secure unit. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that. If one can reduce the population within the custodial centre, one can concentrate on quality. One could make centres local and concentrate on having the best training and support for staff and really use custody effectively. Currently, there is overcrowding, so there is a high level of churn. That means it is difficult to establish relationships between the young people and the custody officers, which means that a heavy use of force is needed to keep them under control. Again and again I hear from people working in these places that relationships are crucial to managing behaviour, but they cannot be established. We now have a call from the Prison Officers&#146; Association for prison officers to be allowed to carry batons in these settings. </p>

This group of children, particularly in today&#146;s world of overcrowded prisons&#151;which, let us face it, it is going to take some time to sort out&#151;is the most vulnerable group. The more we can do to help them the better, by not only encouraging but laying a duty on local authorities and others to see them through into, we hope, a better world with backup and resources provided to help them get into jobs or training. The numbers who take their own lives or self-harm are quite appalling. I would like to ask whether there are any figures for men and women on this but one knows that there are very vulnerable women in these circumstances. The Corston report has made that clear to us. But I certainly back these amendments.</p>

In the last couple of days it has become almost a truism to say that there is very little expectation of a successful result from an order of custody imposed upon anybody under the age of 18. I am much in sympathy with what the noble Lords, Lord Judd and Lord Ramsbotham, have said about the special circumstances that affect the under-21s. Over the years we have legislated to provide that custody for a young person shall only be a last resort.  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1139"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>From that it follows that Parliament has regarded it as a resort, albeit a last one and therefore one very sparingly turned to. My anxiety about these amendments is that it is to impose a dangerously narrow restriction on what may be regarded as a last resort to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="0802071000166"></a>&#147;the offence ... could reasonably have been expected to cause serious physical or psychological harm to another or others&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0802071000126"></a>and that,</p>
<ul><a name="0802071000167"></a>&#147;a custodial sentence is necessary to protect the public from a demonstrable and imminent risk of serious physical or psychological harm&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802071000127"></a>I think that could be found to be dangerously and impracticably narrow. I would be interested in the noble Baroness&#146;s comment on this point and the Government&#146;s response to it. There may be a case for a restriction on what can be regarded as a last resort but as at present advised I think this is unduly narrow.</p>

I particularly support the amendment that raises the age from 18 to 21 for that very vulnerable group of children. I also share the concerns of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, that there should be a restriction but that this is too narrow. One should be thinking a little more broadly for the protection of the public because the public will not understand if between the ages of 18 and 21 we are treating them exactly the same as children. But even with children one has to be a little careful that this is not too restrictive. I totally agree with the concept but some wording to make it slightly broader would be better than the present.</p>

Anticipating perhaps what the Government&#146;s resistance to this might be, I would argue that one of the problems here is the definition of &#147;so serious&#148;. Section 152(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 requires that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80"></a><a name="0802071000144"></a>&#147;The court must not pass a custodial sentence unless it is of the opinion that the offence ... was so serious&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802071000128"></a>The problem is that the threshold and the meaning of &#147;so serious&#148; is too vague. That definition necessarily will relate to a person&#146;s age and circumstances, and, dare I say, emotional and intellectual development, on which we have had such a robust debate earlier.</p>

<a name="80206-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="0802071000073"></a>I direct the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, to international comparisons, which were articulated so clearly yesterday in the opening speech made by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, on the principles. In this country, we cannot have children who are more feral, who are worse, than comparable children elsewhere&#151;at least in comparable economies, GDPs and populations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="0802071000074"></a>When we talk about the situation in this country we seem to believe that something is particularly wrong with us here&#151;I call it British exceptionalism&#151;which is an admission of defeat.

We know that custody does not rehabilitate the vast majority of children; three-quarters of them reoffend within a year.</p>

<a name="80206-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="0802071000075"></a>The amendment would enable interventions to be improved. It perhaps is a little too narrow and perhaps we need to think again about whether we can make it more practically applicable. But it would provide interventions for those who need to be locked up for genuine reasons of public protection and would enable the reallocation of resources for more suitable and effective community work. We know that community programmes are not adequately funded. About 70 per cent&#151;&#163;280 million&#151;of the Youth Justice Board&#146;s programmes budget is spent each year on locking up&#151;I know that the Minister is sensitive about those words&#151;children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="0802071000077"></a>As I think that we have all said in the past two days, custody is known to be one of the least effective and most harmful of criminal justice disposals for children, with eight out of 10 reoffending within two years of release. I note that the Minister in another place, David Hanson, did not object to the concept of custody thresholds, which is not surprising. The Youth Justice Board&#146;s publication, entitled, <I>Strategy for the Secure Estate for Children and Young People</I>, of November 2004, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81"></a><a name="0802071000145"></a>&#147;The YJB expects legislative changes that are due soon to bring greater clarity for courts about the [children&#146;s] custody threshold&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0802071000129"></a>As Members of the Committee are well aware, YJB policy documents are cleared by Ministers and thus, effectively, become government policy.</p>

<a name="80206-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="0802071000078"></a>The aim of a custody threshold for children should be to ensure that children are only ever locked up as a last resort, principally for public protection. Moreover, a reduction in the number of children in custody would release considerable resources for improved prevention and rehabilitation where it can be most effective, as noted by the Audit Commission, the Public Accounts Committee and many other official bodies.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, referred to the downward use of custodial sentencing, which I think is the equivalent of my up-sentencing. We understand what we mean. I just want to stress that this is not the aim. This is about ensuring custody is indeed the last resort. That is why, in the earlier part of the Bill, so much emphasis is put on the YROs. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, referred once again to the very important question of restraint. As I said earlier this afternoon&#151;it seems many hours ago now&#151;the review that has been commissioned is due to report in April. I hope that will inform the development of a sensible and helpful policy. We will have to see what the review says.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="0802071000080"></a>The noble Earl also asked about deaths in custody. I am very happy to circulate the details that I have. I cannot answer the question, raised I think by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, about women. I will try to find that information. We have another happy debate only a few hours ahead in relation to the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, and I have no doubt that that is one of the matters that we will discuss. On the noble Earl&#146;s specific question, every death is a personal tragedy. My understanding is there was one death at Hillside SCH in 1998. I will let him have details of that of course.</p>

<a name="80206-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="0802071000081"></a>I also want to provide the figures on young people in custody and the question of whether we are in a stable position. My understanding is that on 30 June 1997, there were 2,479 under-18s in custody. In October 2002 it had gone up to 2,735. The figure for June 2007, which is the latest I have, is 2,426. It is on that basis that I used the word stabilisation earlier. The YJB disposal data published for 2006-07 show that total disposals in that year were 216,000: pre-court were just over 96,000; first tier 73,000; community 39,700 and custody 7,097. The difference is that the figures I gave earlier were the number of people in custody at one point, whereas the latter figures are about the number of disposals during the calendar year. Noble Lords will interpret those figures, but it does put this into perspective.</p>

<a name="80206-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="0802071000082"></a>I will also comment on another interesting question the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, has raised about the 1982 Act. There was undoubtedly a significant drop in the use of immediate custody between those years for indictable offences for under-21s. This coincided with a corresponding increase in repeat cautioning for offenders, particularly the group aged 17 to 21. For instance, the number of males cautioned for an indictable offence in 1980 was 3,200 and that had risen to 22,500 by 1990. My understanding is that repeat cautioning for indictable offences was deemed not acceptable by the then Government which was why they reversed the position. That is the background to some of the very interesting questions&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="0802071000087"></a>Let me turn to the question in hand. Although we understand what noble Lords are getting at, we think&#151;as has been hinted at already&#151;that the amendments would set an entry point for custody so high that it could present a real risk to the public. Amendment No. 71 would mean that a young person could be sent  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1142"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1142</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to custody only where the offence caused or could have caused serious physical or psychological harm and where it is necessary,</p>
<ul><a name="0802071000168"></a>&#147;to protect the public from a demonstrable and imminent risk&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="0802071000130"></a>of such harm. The proposal could apply to some of the most serious offences, such as manslaughter, rape and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>

<a name="80206-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="0802071000088"></a>There are provisions to deal with young offenders who are classified as dangerous in Sections 226 and 228 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. This involves an assessment of whether the offender has committed an offence listed in Schedule 15 to that Act and whether they pose a significant risk of serious harm to members of the public. If someone commits one of the serious offences I have mentioned they will not be automatically assessed as dangerous. Most young offenders who commit such offences are given a sentence under Section 91 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000.</p>

<a name="80206-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="0802071000089"></a>The provisions in Section 152 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 apply at present to offenders who have committed one of the most serious offences but are not classified by the courts as dangerous. The amendment would mean that even when the most serious type of harm had been caused and if it could be proved that the young offender had deliberately caused grievous bodily harm with the intent to cause such harm, the court could not impose a custodial sentence unless the prosecution could also prove that, looking forward, it was necessary to protect the public from a demonstrable and imminent risk of serious physical or mental harm. Only then would custody be an option.</p>

<a name="80206-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="0802071000090"></a>There is a risk that if we accepted the amendment, notwithstanding that the prosecution could prove all the elements of the offence, the courts could not impose custody unless the prosecution could also show that there was a demonstrable and imminent risk of serious physical and mental harm. Such an offender would not necessarily meet the criterion of dangerousness in the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="0802071000091"></a>We think that there is a risk that the custody threshold could be raised in a way that prevents the courts protecting the public from young people who have committed serious and violent crimes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="0802071000092"></a>I was very interested in the debate about 18 to 21 year-olds. I remind the Committee that in May last year, the then Minister at the Home Office made a Statement about young adult offenders. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0802071000169"></a>&#147;we are firmly committed to further work to ensure we plan for appropriate provision to address the specific needs of 18 to 24-year olds.

<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1143"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1143</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I shall give the overall figure for the young offender population: in June 2007, it was 2,928; in June 2006, it was 2,925. I offer to circulate to all noble Lords the full figures so that when we debate the matter again on Report we are all clear about what we are talking about.</p>

We know simply that the young offender population has teetered around an unacceptable 3,000 for several years. I am grateful particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Judd, for his amendment to my amendment. He was right that nobody knows better than the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, just how even more deprived are these prisoners and how they can deceive us by looking so big, tough, frightening and dangerous. We have only to look at the figures. Well, we looked at the figures for suicides. We looked also at the figures for self-harming, to which nobody has referred today, and which are the biggest and loudest cry for help. It is in this age group that it is the most frightening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="0802071000095"></a>In response to the reservations that have been expressed, I say that the proposed new clause at least offers a strategy for trying to put a lid on what is already such an unacceptably high figure. It might help the Government to focus on this if I said to them that the Ministry of Justice&#146;s figures for December 2007 show that the vast majority&#151;78 per cent&#151;of the 5,291 children aged 15 to 17 who were sentenced to imprisonment in 2006 was not convicted of sexually related offences or violence against the person. They were not those most serious offenders. In other words, this down-tariffing or scooping-up of younger children into custody is one of things that we must find strategies to counteract.</p>

I am very grateful to them for their support for the amendment. I am glad, too, that the amendment is grouped together with Amendment No. 119. Of course, the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, will speak to his own amendment. I shall say only that I am very much on board with it, as it seems to me that if young people are in custody, it is important that the local authorities, with all their special responsibilities and experience, continue to feel a sense of engagement with those children, so that they are there to help with rehabilitation when the children or young people are released and there is continuity in the situation. I am glad that the noble Lord&#146;s amendment refers to the importance of trying to provide for continuity not only institutionally but by having the same people going through the same process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"></a><a name="0802071000110"></a>I do not want to sentimentalise, and I know that I am inclined to talk about this, but my nine years as honorary president of the YMCA had a profound effect on me. One thing that I realised&#151;and I hope that the Committee will forgive my putting it like this&#151;is that if we take rehabilitation seriously, it is important to have someone who takes the hand of the youngster concerned and walks with that youngster through the whole experience of custody, rehabilitation and back into full life outside the institution afterwards. That transition phase afterwards is absolutely crucial in winning the youngster back to society and preventing still further exclusion.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="0802071000111"></a>We have had the statistics on the risks. I referred, in mentioning them, to the tragedy of each individual case, but the tragedy does not really sum up the situation well enough. We should think of the mental anguish and despair of the youngster concerned, who has given up hope. This is a terrible reflection&#151;that we can somehow absorb this statistic and not be angry and indignant about it. I should like to feel that the new department with its new approach&#151;and I believe that there is a lot of new thinking going on there, which I welcome&#151;would have right at the top of its priorities how on earth we are going to stop this human tragedy of youngsters dying in custody. It is our responsibility&#151;all of us&#151;and it is essential for us to register what a terrible reflection it is on all of us that this can happen.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="0802071000112"></a>My first job in government, a long time ago, was as a service Minister. In those days, there was a Minister for each service. I had the privilege of being Minister for the Navy. We had in the Ministry of Defence a very interesting group. I used to tease them by saying that it was rather like painting the Forth Bridge. They were constantly discussing the future shape of the fleet, trying to assess what the real threats were and what kind of fleet we would need to meet the new threats.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="0802071000113"></a>It often occurred to me that, if we were to follow that job through logically and thoroughly, we would send these people off to a country house somewhere with a clean sheet of paper. We should say, &#147;Forget there&#146;s a Navy. Analyse the threats, and come up with the maritime dimension of what you believe needs to be done to meet those threats. I always thought that there were one or two who would be horror stricken if there were no maritime dimension, but of course there was.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="0802071000114"></a>I am a realist, although noble Lords do not always feel that I am. I know that you do not meet trouble half way and you should strike compromises&#151;I believe in compromise&#151;that are constructive, positive and dynamic. You should move relevantly to the future by taking a firm position on what you believe ought to be at the beginning. We are inclined to be too mealy-mouthed in our approach and to compromise too soon. Having said that, to go back to my experience with the Navy, I would then tell them, &#147;When you have done that, look over your shoulder and say, my God we've got this thing called the Navy&#148;. I told them to look at the Navy as it was and try to make the most dynamic, sensible compromise

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="0802071000115"></a>Why do I say all that? It is because I am getting to the same point of concern about our penal system. There is a big gap, constantly, between what all the research and evidence demonstrates and what we actually do. More and more, the evidence that is being collected and the work that has been done indicate that most progress towards rehabilitation can be made with people in small units appropriately designed to their particular needs. A variety of opportunities should be available for people with particular kinds of problems.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="0802071000116"></a>I know that my noble friend will say that that is misguided as we go into the next phase of vast expenditure on new prisons&#151;which I am inclined to think will end up as warehouses. He will say that because of economies of scale, we will be able to have much better services available within these warehouses to answer the specialists&#146; needs. But that is the issue. Technically and professionally there may be greater resources&#151;I do not argue against that. I can see in an arid way that there could be economies of scale in that sort of context. But if we take seriously the work that says that you make real progress with small units, and the point that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, always makes&#151;I hope he will make it again tonight&#151;about the importance of continuity in human relationships in the whole process, it is not much good having technical, professional services and expertise available if that cannot apply in a dynamic, ongoing, complete social experience that makes sense for the youngster concerned.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="0802071000117"></a>I go back to my experience with the Navy and the white sheet of paper. I put forward the thesis that if we could miraculously discard ourselves of the whole infrastructure of the penal system now, take a piece of white paper and say, &#147;What do we need?&#148;, we could come up with a tailor-made system to meet all the research and analysis that has been done, which would be not a penny more expensive than what we spend now desperately trying to shore up a system that is not working. I do not believe that we begin to do that rugged, tough exercise of really analysing how far what we have is cost-effective or completely the wrong model. I believe in compromise and am a realist. One has to meet the situation that has been inherited. It is tragic, but one has to. Therefore, there will be compromises, but that is the kind of discipline we need in our thought.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="0802071000118"></a>I am very grateful to the experts in drafting, and for their legal advice, who, as good professionals, without committing themselves to my amendment, explained how it must be phrased in order to be watertight in the context of the Bill. My amendment is intended to say that so much is at stake with children and young people, that the governing principle should be that they do not go to prison, or into the kind of custody we have seen too frequently in the past. Noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches, whom I greatly respect, have argued with me that I am being unreasonable because I go too far and what I want would be impossible. I think of one in particular, who is not with us this evening, with whom I quite often find myself in agreement. My anxiety is

It is the easy thing to do. One has, therefore, to introduce the approach that says no.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="0802071000119"></a>Of course, society must be protected. Of course, society must be protected. I hope that my having repeated myself comes out in the <I>Official Report</I> because I feel that very strongly. I believe, as we all keep saying, that if society is to be protected, it should not only be in the immediate or short term, but in the long term. That is why the success of rehabilitation work is so vital. I believe that. I accept that in some situations a young person will have to go into custody. In our society, surely, it is only acceptable if, when that happens, it should be into appropriate custody, which is part of the general care system. It has to be secure, but appropriate. I therefore move this amendment with some feeling, because I really have begun to feel exasperated at our failure to take a rugged, robust approach to what is necessary if we are to succeed in our oft-repeated objective of effective rehabilitation. I beg to move.</p>

It was a great privilege to be asked by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, to add my name to it. A number of arguments have been advanced about amending Clause 9 of Part 2 of the Bill, which deals with the purpose of sentencing. The purpose of the amendment is to probe in greater detail the Government&#146;s intentions. The Minister has stolen my thunder, because my last question to him was going to be, &#147;Is there anything in the pipeline that will address the issue of age and suggest remedies?&#148;. He has already answered that, but a number of issues need to be highlighted.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="0802071000121"></a>It is not my intention to repeat the arguments that have been put forward. In fact, in debate after debate there is a general consensus about the purpose of sentencing and so on, and I do not need to repeat that. I can well understand why the Government wish to promote the principal aim of the youth justice system when dealing with offenders up to the age of 18. The questions that I am always asking is, &#147;Do we have the right approach? Should it be restricted to 18? Would the raising of the age from 18 to 21&#151;which the noble Lord rightly put in the amendment for detention centres&#151;actually help to reduce offending and reoffending rates?&#148;. I have no doubt whatever that in the final analysis that is probably the reason that they would do so.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="0802071000122"></a>I sat as a magistrate in Sussex&#151;the county that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, comes from&#151;for a very long time. When you are sitting in the court, it is very difficult to distinguish particularly in relation to the age factor and sentencing. I say that because some youngsters aged 12, 13 or 14 are much more mature than some people aged 21. Is that factor important? Or should you not effectively be looking at what is most appropriate for the individual before you? That is fundamental to the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="0802071000123"></a>In various amendments to Clause 9, a number of noble Lords tried to establish a balance; but the balance that we are lacking at the moment is  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1149"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>effectively the age factor. I am not surprised, nor is the chief executive of the Youth Justice Board, that issues of youth justice continue to be very high profile, and we are increasingly focusing on this issue in the debates in your Lordships&#146; House. I am also aware that there is an ongoing 10-year plan to deliver the principles that have been set out in the Youth Justice Board strategy for the secure estate for children and young people.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="0802071000124"></a>There are obvious benefits, which include&#151;this is the suggestion that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has spoken about previously&#151;a single-site population of under-18s, small, flexible units, young people being located close to their home community and safe environments that better meet the needs of young people. It is equally important that such provision should apply to people who are under 21 years of age; but until the 10-year plan comes into force, we need to explore how best to provide suitable accommodation and premises where appropriate care and support are provided by the appropriate agencies. This requires amendment to the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, Section 27(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 and Section 43(2) of the Prisons Act 1952. We further propose revisiting Section 106 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. To avoid further technicality, we have identified suitable words to substitute that section and other relevant sections in previous legislation. I have not set out to criticise the work of the Youth Justice Board. In previous debates, I have always complimented the considerable strides we have made since the establishment of the YJB. If its success is to be carried forward, if the intervention is to reduce reoffending&#151;and offending&#151;then it is right that we should be able to fish out the Government&#146;s intention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="0802073000002"></a>I need to exercise some care as one or two issues cause me concern. There are some limitations, and that is why I say this should be probed deeply. First, should we limit the provision of accommodation by local authorities for those up to 21 years old? If that is the question, then we need to talk about capacity, as well as the differing needs of the sentence group, which can vary from between 10 and 21. Secondly, we need to take into account that we have in secure accommodation the most damaged children and their needs ought to be carefully examined. Any change in the age range would need to be carefully planned and properly resourced. It may also require parallel arrangements for the management of those young people in the community and in the court, for example where the respective roles of youth offending teams and probation need to change.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="0802073000003"></a>For these reasons, it would be helpful to have some indication of not only the Government&#146;s thinking but also what they have in mind. Then we will likely see some results in terms of the age factors, the special needs they have, and how we could adequately meet that.</p>

About three weeks  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1150"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ago, almost at the end of a day in Grand Committee, this amendment was called and there was insufficient time to raise it. I deliberately tabled it both in this Bill and in the Children and Young Persons Bill to emphasise the linkage between these two. My wish, having read all that is in the two Bills, is that perhaps this Bill had been brought by the Minister for Children, supported by people from other ministries, to make the point that there really was a holistic bringing together of what is needed.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="0802073000005"></a>I do not dissent in any way from what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. I am glad he brought those points out. I have a number of points to make in support of that, really based on my frustration during my five and a half years as chief inspector in trying to persuade the system to listen to what was actually happening, and to put people in charge who were responsible, accountable and making it happen. I will go on repeating that none of these systems will work unless those people are there. It is absurd that in the Prison Service there is no one responsible for children and no one responsible for the young offenders. There are planners, yes, but doers, no.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="0802073000006"></a>My amendment refers to one group which bridges them&#151;those young people sent into custody from care and so who come into custody without parents. Sensibly, when the Youth Justice Board introduced the detention and training order, an order spent half in custody and half in the community, it insisted that, at the beginning of the custody period, there should be a case conference involving those people responsible for planning what the sentence should be and how it should be carried out. It also invited parents to attend. There was another compulsory conference at the end of the sentence where the same people attended, with the idea of making certain that the transition to community was planned, and that it was overseen by the same people. Interestingly, I was finding that up to 60 per cent of those young offenders had parents attending those conferences. Who was missing? It was the people in care.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="0802073000007"></a>This amendment tries to ensure that if people go into custody from care, the person responsible for that care is responsible for them throughout the period they are in custody, to act in loco parentis, to attend conferences, most particularly to plan the resettlement and transition stage and to come with them out into the community. I am seeking to put that burden on the local authorities to make certain that they ensure that a named person who knows this young offender stays with them. I hope that will improve how things happen for them and that we will overcome some of the frightful problems of people in care having no one responsible for them when they come out and having nowhere to go and no one to look after them.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="0802073000008"></a>I am very glad that this amendment was grouped with that of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, because in each of the various clauses to which he refers the local authorities are mentioned. One lesson that I learnt from looking at young offender establishments is that the more local they can be, the smaller and the more linked to communities they can be. Then those communities can bring in their resources, their people, their work experience and so on. There is then much more chance of engaging with the young persons

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="0802073000009"></a>Yesterday I described such a situation being developed by the foyers of localising young offenders, which I really think is an opportunity for hope. I can see no place for these awful Trojan prisons in this context. Going back to what a child needs, lessons about what is needed must be learnt. I hope that in the spirit of these amendments the Minister will pick this up and pass it on to the people responsible and respond to the points that have been made.</p>

<p><a name="st_238"></a>
<a name="0802073000010"></a><b><a name="80206-0015.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0802073000047"></a>Baroness Linklater of Butterstone:</b> My name is attached to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. I gladly support it and him and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, who is my noble friend. I have been a social worker, a children&#146;s panel member and a magistrate. I have seen this from both sides. Since then I have had quite a lot to do with the theory of it.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="0802073000011"></a>The realities are a million miles from what they should be. As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, the transition from prison to the outside world is when all people, but particularly young people, are at their most vulnerable. He will know, as I do, that it is not at all unusual for people to come out with nowhere to go. It makes one&#146;s heart bleed to think of what that can mean for people.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="0802073000012"></a>This amendment deals with so-called looked-after children, whose total life experience and life chances are, at a stroke, diminished by being in the care of the state. That says a lot for the care of the state, does it not? Our amendment requires local authority representatives to visit a looked-after child, who is in care, who is then taken into custody. There was a Green Paper which vaguely said that local authorities should carry out an assessment of need of such a child,</p>
<ul><a name="0802073000043"></a>&#147;with an expectation that they will continue to be supported as a child in care&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0802073000042"></a>Not surprisingly, those expectations have not been realised.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="0802073000013"></a>A vast proportion of children in custody have been in care&#151;up to 49 per cent&#151;with all that that means. At the same time, we all know just how stretched our social services departments are. So the temptation for social workers, who may be miles from where a child has ended up in custody, to park their responsibilities for such a child until such time as he or she is realised is irresistible. That may be the reason&#151;indeed justification&#151;but it does not mean that it is right. Quite the reverse is the case.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="0802073000014"></a>For many children, going into custody is like falling into a black hole. Indeed, one of the three STCs that I have visited, some more than once, dissuaded families from visiting, and did not even invite them to come to see a production of a play that had been a great source of excitement and pride to the participants. Distance and cost were the explanations for the lack of any invitation. Distance and cost are also the explanation for lack of social workers, plus, quite rightly, pressure of work and the temptation perhaps to take comfort from the fact that for a while someone else has the responsibility for the child.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="0802073000015"></a>Clearly, continuity of care by those whose role it is to support vulnerable children in the community who  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1152"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are in theory being looked after by them is essential as well as desirable. There should indeed be, as the amendment proposes, a statutory duty to maintain contact, make an assessment of need and report annually. I have also heard from staff in STCs about the difficulty they have in making or keeping contact with their co-professionals outside, including at the point of release, which is deeply shocking.</p>

<a name="80206-0015.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="0802073000016"></a>These are children who need more, not less, continuity of care, and it is incumbent on all of us to see that that happens. Once again resources of time, money and manpower are at issue. But if the welfare of the child is indeed paramount and not just another form of words, action must be taken. These children should be at the top of the list, not the bottom where they so shockingly and so often are. We have a pressing duty to see that that is put right.</p>

Like my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham, we went through exactly the same process with the Children and Young Persons Act and became very aware of the postcode lottery and how many of those children were left without any sort of contact whatever.</p>

<a name="80206-0016.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="0802073000018"></a>There are two major reasons why the amendments are crucial. As we have all heard, this is the most vulnerable group of children we can think of. They have already been failed because we have not been able to stop them committing crimes so that they have ended up in custody. My noble friend Lord Judd spoke passionately about the group that we need to reclaim. We need to save them from themselves and their families, from the abuse they have received, and from their lack of learning and training&#151;all of which have been mentioned&#151;if we are to make any progress with the proposed plans. I hope very much that the two amendments will be accepted&#151;whether they are exactly right or not at this moment is almost immaterial. We are focusing on a group that needs maximum help and support.</p>

<a name="80206-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="0802073000019"></a>An aspect of one of these amendments refers to any contact that has happened in the past and where a relationship had been formed. That is the sort of person that children need to help them through the next period, to advise them on training and make certain that they have somewhere to live. They will engage the local authority and private sector bodies to help with jobs, training, and so on. I was particularly impressed by the Local Government Association. I agree entirely that we need to aim at local placement, whether prison or secure units. They must be increasingly local if they are to succeed. This will also mean that the whole community will gradually feel the responsibility to ensure that they turn into responsible citizens. If they do not, they will be a charge on their own local community. For all those reasons, and the fact that the Local Government Association applauds that approach, wants to see it happen and encourages it, I hope that the Minister will give reassuring answers to the amendment.</p>

<a name="80206-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="0802073000024"></a>I say to my noble friend Lord Judd, who is a great humanitarian, that I am sorry about his exasperation. I fully accept that after-care, resettlement and integration of the young person back into society after release from custody is critical to a successful outcome from the youth justice system. I welcome his acknowledgement that the new Ministry of Justice is in a good position, albeit in close co-operation with our friends at the Department for Children, Schools and Families. I acknowledged to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that I would be delighted for my noble friend Lord Adonis to be standing here today taking part. I have watched with interest the debates that he has been having with noble Lords on his Bill. Although it is early days, we are establishing a stronger relationship between the two departments, which is essential to achieving the integrated approach that noble Lords want to see.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="0802073000025"></a>I will not comment any further on the country house clean sheet of paper. I was tempted to talk about aircraft carriers to the noble Lord. I will not refer to Titans tonight, although I anticipate a good discussion tomorrow in the noble Baroness&#146;s debate, where my noble friend Lord Carter is also speaking. That should be extremely interesting.</p>

<a name="80206-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="0802073000026"></a>If young people have to go to custody, they should be placed in accommodation that is fully adapted to the needs of that young person. Noble Lords will know that we are not persuaded that local authority secure children&#146;s homes will be suitable for all young people, even if places were available for all of them, which is far from being the case.</p>

<a name="80206-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="0802073000027"></a>I will not go into the detailed reasons, as they were set out by my noble friend Lord Adonis, but I want to assure noble Lords of two things. First, the Government have taken on board the views of noble Lords who have spoken on the matter, both today and on earlier occasions. Secondly, the Youth Justice Board is committed to developing the secure estate for children and young people to ensure that the accommodation provided continues to become more closely adapted to the needs of those young people.</p>

<a name="80206-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="0802073000028"></a>In response to the interesting contribution by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, I say that, since the YJB assumed responsibility for commissioning and purchasing custodial places in 2000, it has created a diverse and secure estate. Of course, the balance of provision could be improved. We recognise that the provision for the needs of more vulnerable older boys is a particularly worrying issue, which the YJB is working on.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1154"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column 1154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80206-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="0802073000029"></a>As I said earlier, we are looking at options for developing the kind of provision required for the young adult offenders to which Members of the Committee have referred. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and other Members of the Committee who have spoken about looked-after children in custody and in general, that we are all aware that they represent some of the most vulnerable children in our society, and that their educational attainment can be pretty poor. In terms of offending, my understanding is that 9 per cent of children in care for a year or more have been cautioned or have committed an offence, compared to 3 per cent for the general child population. We know that many of these problems will continue into adulthood for many looked-after children.</p>

<a name="80206-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="0802073000030"></a>There are some signs of encouragement. The educational outcomes of children in care have improved quite dramatically: 49 per cent of looked-after children got one GCSE in 2000; it rose to 63 per cent in 2006. In 2000, 7 per cent got five A to C grades at GCSE. That is not a good figure at all, but at least it rose to 12 per cent in 2006. Clearly, there is an awful long way to go, but there are some signs of improvement. Of course, there is more to be done.</p>

<a name="80206-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="0802073000031"></a>We are listening very carefully to the comments that Members of the Committee have made, both today and when the Children and Young Persons Bill was being debated. The noble Lord referred to attending the sentence planning meetings, which was a very relevant point. Where the local authority shares parental responsibility for a looked-after child, we would expect its representatives to participate in sentence planning meetings. We will deal with this in future revised guidance to the Children Act 1989. That will be necessary; we will have to change the guidance in the light of the legislation currently going through the House, which offers a valuable opportunity.</p>

<a name="80206-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="0802073000032"></a>We have also made clear our intention to use the delegated powers to impose a requirement for local authorities to arrange visits to those looked-after children who lose their status when they enter custody; namely, those voluntarily accommodated under Section 20 of the Children Act 1989. That will ensure that these children continue to receive the support they need, and that local authorities are aware when they are likely to be discharged from custody. The purpose of the visits will be to assess the young person&#146;s needs and establish the kind of continuing support that will be necessary to resettle the young person back into the community. For some young people, this will involve ensuring that, on release from custody, they are provided with appropriate accommodation and that the local authority should therefore arrange for them to become &#147;looked after&#148; once more.</p>

<a name="80206-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="0802073000033"></a>The new requirements being introduced by the Children and Young Persons Bill will, as I have said, be supported by revisions to regulations and statutory guidance. We will use these revisions to set out that the person responsible for visiting a formerly looked-after child in custody will be an officer of the local authority children&#146;s services, rather than a member of the youth offending team and that, where possible, this officer should be a qualified social worker familiar with the child&#146;s case.</p>

I do not want to see this Bill as the end of the story. If we are serious about rehabilitation and about protecting the pubic in the long run by successful rehabilitation, it is inevitable that we will move to special provision in all cases for children and the 18 to 21 year-old age group. Anything else is, or is in danger of being, highly counterproductive.

<p><a name="080206107000010"></a>The noble Viscount said: I shall try to be as quick as I can, but this is a complicated point and, although I have given notice of it to the noble Lord, Lord Bach, other Members of the Committee might not be entirely familiar with it.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000011"></a>Clauses 61 and 62, towards the end of the Bill, list offences for which a regulatory body, including a local authority, may decide to impose a civil sanction, and for which there will be guidance. I understand that all this will be done through the usual fleet of statutory instruments, so we do not know at the moment which sorts of enforcement procedures will be included. Individuals who trade&#151;for instance, small farmers&#151;will certainly be included.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000012"></a>A local authority may well wish to use the powers in the Bill to use civil sanctions in a particular case in which it is allowed to do so under whatever guidance emerges. If it wants to accept an enforcement undertaking, for example&#151;to save time, I will not go into stop notices for the moment&#151;under Clause 40(2) it may do so only if it is satisfied to the criminal standard of proof that the person has committed an offence.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000013"></a>The notional doorstep salesman, whom I mentioned before, can take a great deal of money from vulnerable individuals; one of the jobs of the trading standards department is to spot that this is going on and to do something about it. One of the ways in which the department can trace this activity is to use the closed circuit television system to watch the people going up the street. Under the Bill, members of the department will have to go across the street where there is a local authority dividing line down the middle; otherwise, they are not regulated persons. It is perfectly possible that they will do this. This is covert surveillance.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC562"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC562</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000014"></a>The background to this is that when the Government introduced the Human Rights Act 1998, they did not incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights into English law, but they did require all public authorities to comply with it. There is nothing wrong with that; it is an excellent thing. The difficulty was that it was suddenly realised that Article 8 deals with privacy&#151;private life in the convention, and private information in the transposition to British law. There has never been any law on privacy in any part of the United Kingdom, unlike the situation for most of our European neighbours, who have provisions on privacy. The Government therefore passed the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000015"></a>RIPA attempts to incorporate into English law the provisions of Article 8.2 of the convention. That article protects a public authority if it infringes privacy rights by means of, for example, covert surveillance, provided that it does so in accordance with a given procedure, which is taken directly from the article. The original version of RIPA included, in Sections 28 and 29, practically all the grounds on which a public authority could seek this protection. Those grounds are public health, public safety, crime and disorder and economic well-being of the country, as well as a few others, but not the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, which is provided for in the convention but not in the Act.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000016"></a>In Scotland, to which this Bill also applies, a provision was passed by the Scottish Parliament equivalent to Part II of RIPA. It includes the grounds of prevention and detection of crime and disorder, public health and public safety. However, under the Scotland Act 1998, the entire European convention was incorporated into Scots law. Therefore, whatever is said in the Scottish equivalent of RIPA, people can use all the grounds under Article 8.2&#151;including the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#151;as indeed they do, and those cases are upheld by the courts. In other words, the legislation is bypassed by the Scotland Act.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000017"></a>In England, things went along all right until the Home Office decided that it would restrict the grounds on which public authorities could use covert surveillance. It did so through Statutory Instrument 2003/3171. The grounds that different public authorities can use vary, which I do not understand, but local authorities can now use only the ground of prevention of crime and disorder. Unless this ground can be conscientiously used, local authorities have no powers to carry out covert surveillance without forfeiting the protection that they are granted under RIPA. Conscientious authorising officers who grant the authority to carry out covert surveillance look to see whether the proposed action is in accordance with the permitted grounds.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000018"></a>One of the problems that arose in the earliest stages of RIPA is what one does about employees of a public authority if they are, for example, malingering or taking second jobs. On the face of it, one would think that that was fraud and therefore a crime. However, there was a long dispute about that, as authorising officers said that it would not be treated as a crime but would be dealt with by disciplinary means. I know of one big police force that was unable  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC563"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC563</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to get authorisation for covert surveillance in order to back up disciplinary proceedings, because one can get authorisation only if one has evidence. Again, one has to be satisfied to a reasonable standard that a crime has been committed, so one needs to get an authorisation.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000019"></a>This remained in limbo, as no one knew the answer, until the Investigatory Powers Tribunal was confronted with about 17 cases on what to do about covert surveillance for public authority employees. In one comparatively simple case, a police sergeant tripped over a mat in the police station. He said that he had hurt himself and he retired sick on a pension. Then he discovered that, as this had happened while he was on duty, he was entitled to an enhanced pension, which he claimed. The police authority did not believe a word of it and, when it went out with cameras and other methods of discovering what was going on, it found out that he was not sick at all; in fact, it was a complete fraud. The authority did not give him his enhanced pension and he complained.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000020"></a>Under Part II of RIPA, only one body can deal with complaints: the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, set up by almost incomprehensible verbiage in Section 65 onwards. It has its own special rules of procedure. There is a perfectly good reason for that: it deals with some highly sensitive matters to do with national security and so it cannot allow the public to know all the details of everything that it does. However, that does not give the other side an opportunity to see what the case is against them, the tribunal does not deliver reasoned judgments and the rules are most unusual. The tribunal has ruled for itself that it will comply with the rules of a fair trial under Article 6 of the European convention. However, only the tribunal can make that judgment because nothing it does is susceptible to being appealed or judicially reviewed in any way. Therefore, the tribunal has to do this sort of thing as a form of internal housekeeping.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000021"></a>The tribunal was confronted with the case of the police sergeant who complained that his pension had been withheld. It noted that it had an awful lot of similar cases and wanted to get to the bottom of the issue. I have promised the noble Lord that I would read out only a short part of the decision, but it is a very interesting one:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000392"></a>&#147;A coherent RIPA scheme includes the special procedures for dealing with claims and complaints about the use of investigatory powers in performing the core public functions of the public authority. The special procedures are not required for and do not fit a case like this. The application of the special procedures for adjudicating on claims and for investigating complaints would mean that the applicant would be deprived, for no sensible reason, of the protection of ordinary procedures of an open adversarial hearing, of a reasoned decision and of the right of appeal against or judicial review of an unfavourable decision. It is improbable that Parliament ever contemplated that these restrictions would apply in a situation in which there is no sensitive information or intelligence, and in which no national security or other public interest considerations could arise&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000361"></a>The tribunal declined jurisdiction, saying that the case did not fall within Part II of RIPA, and went on to say that the proper ground for investigating what the police sergeant had done was a matter not of crime  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC564"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC564</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and disorder but of the economic well-being of the country. That expression, like,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000441"></a>&#147;the protection of the rights and freedoms of others&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000362"></a>is a civil law expression; both are given a wide interpretation by the Strasbourg court and in this country as a result. The tribunal therefore declined jurisdiction and simply left it to the pension applicant and the police authority to go through other routes.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000022"></a>My fear about the bits of this Bill about which we are talking, particularly the list in Clause 62 and the range of alternative civil sanctions, is that authorising officers in local authorities will say, &#147;Parliament has said quite clearly that this is not going to be treated as a crime. There is now a huge statutory instrument that lists all these things and so we will be able to use these civil sanctions instead. We have no powers to allow covert surveillance&#148;. That being the case, there is no protection for the authority.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000023"></a>I wish to make it entirely clear that on this occasion Parliament is alive to the issue, which it plainly was not when the statutory instrument was approved in 2003. We must make absolutely certain that the introduction of civil sanctions does not reduce the ability of a local authority to fulfil the test under Clause 40(2) whereby it has to be satisfied to the criminal standard of proof. This will not make it a crime, because, although basically a criminal offence is involved, it will be known, because of the guidance given under later parts of the Bill, that the criminal procedures will not apply. Therefore, there will be a great deal of confusion.</p>
<h5><a name="080206107000457"></a>4 pm</h5>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000024"></a>I can tell the Committee that local authorities do not like to carry out covert surveillance unless they know that they have the protection of RIPA, because that means that they will have an answer to all problems, whereas it is impossible to know what an employment tribunal or some other court would say in other circumstances. My fear is that, unless we get this cleared up, local authorities will simply not use the enforcement powers that they have been given, or not the civil sanctions, anyway, because they will not know where they stand.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000025"></a>I hope that the noble Lord understands that. I am afraid that it is terribly difficult to explain, but I have done my best. There needs to be a solution. I do not put forward my drafting as necessarily the right one; the amendment was tabled to raise the point, because the only ground left is the prevention and detection of crime and the prevention of disorder. If there is some other way of doing this, I shall be only too delighted. I should be very glad to see the demise of Statutory Instrument 2003/3171. I should also be very glad to see the introduction into English and Welsh law of the ground of the protection of the rights and freedoms of others, which is already in Scots law. I cannot see why there should be a difference. That means that the Home Office will have to change its mind but, after all, we have joined-up government. If the matter arises in the context of the noble Lord&#146;s department and there is a problem that has to be resolved with the co-operation of the Home Office, I hope that that would not be beyond the wit of Ministers. Therefore,  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC565"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC565</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I place the amendment before the Committee as raising what I believe to be a serious difficulty about the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000026"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080206107000473"></a>Lord Bach:</b> The Committee will be very grateful to the noble Viscount&#151;the Government certainly are&#151;for raising this important issue and for the way in which he has put the case not just in Committee today but when Professor Macrory came to visit us, in his Second Reading speech and privately. It is an important issue. I am of course aware that my noble friend Lord Jones of Birmingham wrote to the noble Viscount on the matter after Second Reading; that letter has been placed in the Library. I do not know whether the noble Viscount found his response helpful; he clearly did not find it definitive.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000027"></a>We understand the noble Viscount&#146;s reason for wanting to make absolutely clear that, where surveillance is necessary for the purpose of preventing and detecting crime and is authorised appropriately under RIPA, such surveillance may be undertaken even when the new civil sanctions are being considered alongside the criminal sanctions. RIPA&#151;here I speak in shorthand and, albeit in not such a sophisticated way, put the point that the noble Viscount made in moving his amendment&#151;provides a framework for the authorisation of investigative methods, including conduct of covert surveillance and the use of informants where they are necessary and proportionate to achieve a legitimate aim.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000028"></a>As the noble Viscount said, we must ensure that proper respect is given to any interference with individuals&#146; human rights. Regulators have to obtain an authorisation to use these methods in their investigations when they are likely to interfere with convention rights. That authorisation must be for a specified purpose within RIPA&#151;as we understand it, a purpose such as the prevention or detection of crime, the interests of public safety and the interests of protecting public health. Most regulators are, frankly, as the noble Viscount stressed, restricted by order to authorising only conduct necessary for the purpose of preventing and detecting crime. However, where an authorisation is necessary for the prevention or detection of crime and the conduct to be authorised is proportionate to what is sought by carrying it out, the regulator may of course seek that authorisation even though an outcome of that criminal investigation might be the imposition of a civil sanction.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000029"></a>Let me put that in a different way. The conduct and powers that may be authorised and exercised under RIPA can be used for an investigation of a criminal offence within the scope of the Bill, regardless of whether the ultimate sanction is criminal or civil. The regulators are looking at a criminal offence. It may turn out to be dealt with either in the criminal courts&#151;as we think happens a little too often now&#151;or by a penalty that involves civil sanctions, but it still remains an offence; it is still a crime that is on the statute book.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000030"></a>That is on the basis that such conduct and powers are in accordance with the purpose for which the authorisation was given. In the case of regulators  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC566"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC566</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>covered by the Bill, the most relevant purpose will be the prevention or detection of crime because so many of the regulations that are breached&#151;the ones we are talking about here&#151;are all, in their own way, criminal offences. I am advised that other purposes, such as the interests of public safety, may be relevant for some regulators such as the Environment Agency. Whatever the purpose, any interference with an individual&#146;s rights must not be undertaken without proper assessment of whether it is legitimately in pursuit of that purpose.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000031"></a>The noble Viscount makes the point that councils are prevented from getting authorisation for covert surveillance when, for example, the matter in question is disciplinary proceedings, because of the civil sanctions that would arise from that. While RIPA can be used only for the prevention or detection of crime, I am advised that it is broadly interpreted. The fact that the sanction is civil does not, as I have attempted to argue, remove the criminal nature of the offence. The Government are therefore confident that local authorities can rely on RIPA in those circumstances.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000032"></a>The noble Viscount will know better than I that the Home Office is currently revisiting and consolidating all the RIPA orders for surveillance activity. I assure him that we will consider, as part of the review, the important point that he has made so eloquently to the Committee today. He himself says that the wording that he has used in the amendment may not be perfect drafting. I fear that it goes a little further than that: it could be misinterpreted as giving a kind of blanket authorisation to regulators to use these investigatory methods in every investigation that they conduct without making the proper considerations that are rightly required by RIPA and which the noble Viscount expects to see when exercising his responsibility to oversee public authorities&#146; RIPA authorisations in his distinguished role as an assistant surveillance commissioner. If there is a danger of misinterpretation, that would not be desirable.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000033"></a>That is why we cannot accept the amendment, but I want the noble Viscount to know that the Government as a whole, for whom I answer, are looking at how RIPA works in terms of surveillance activity. Although I cannot fully answer his point today to his satisfaction, the point that he has raised will be considered as part of our process.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000034"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="080206107000474"></a>Viscount Colville of Culross:</b> I thank the noble Lord for that reply. I know that a review is going on, but it has always been about the law enforcement agencies and nothing to do with local authorities, which have not been involved in it at all.

A number of the duties of public authorities are to do with public health and safety, as the Minister said, but they are not allowed to use that ground because the Home

I want to ensure that we do not get into a position whereby Parliament, having been faced with this situation, has not made it clear, as the IPT said in the previous case, that local authorities are still allowed to use covert surveillance authorised by RIPA in cases where civil sanctions are to be used.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000036"></a>I do not think that there is any point in pursuing this amendment any further, but I would like to see something in the Bill about this to make sure that Parliament has noted what the IPT said in its decision. We will never get any further with the IPT; its decisions cannot be appealed against or judicially reviewed. Therefore, only Parliament can do something about this. I hope that, perhaps at a later stage of the Bill, the noble Lord will after consideration find some form of wording that will ensure that Parliament really has considered this point and given local authorities the powers that they require to collect under Section 40 the evidence that they need to fulfil their duties. I am sure that the noble Lord will do that.</p>

He knows that I cannot make any promise at all that the Government will put something into the Bill; I have to be clear about that, not least because the review is taking place. As I understand it, the Home Office is also reviewing the applicability of IPT decisions. The noble Viscount is much more expert than I am on this; this seems to be a fundamental review that can hardly fail to cover the points that he made. I am told also that the Home Office is revising the codes of practice. We will be making it clear that prevention and detection of crime relates to the crime itself, not the penalty imposed, but I do not think that the noble Viscount is concerned about that issue. I wanted him to understand where we are at the moment.</p>

That was helpful, even if it did not quite go all the way. I asked for the amount and he stated the criteria, which I agree might do the trick if they are sufficiently tightly drawn and clearly set down. Will he tell the Committee whether the criteria in respect of the disciplinary procedure will again be specified in an order that is subject to the affirmative procedure? If so, will we be able to see the draft wording at least of the criteria before Report? I move the amendment to allow him to respond. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000044"></a>The noble Lord will know that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee accepted the absence of a limit for variable monetary penalties imposed for either-way offences and invited the Government to make a case for having no limit in summary-only offences. We do not feel that it would be appropriate to require the Minister conferring the power on a regulator to impose discretionary requirements to cap the variable monetary penalties. To do so would restrict a regulator&#146;s ability to tackle non-compliance effectively. The new sanctioning powers are designed to be flexible enough to cover a wide range of regulators. Regulators such as the Financial Services Authority already have the powers to impose unlimited financial penalties.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000045"></a>When giving a regulator access to variable monetary penalties, the Minister will need to design the regime to ensure that such penalties are flexible and, of course&#151;this is one of the crucial points behind Macrory&#151;able to capture the financial benefit to the business arising from the non-compliance in order to ensure, frankly, that compliant businesses have a level playing field with those that have not been compliant. This was a key recommendation not only of Macrory but of Hampton before him.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000046"></a>It may be difficult for a Minister to cap variable monetary penalties as he may not be able to predict the combination of aggravating factors and the level of financial benefit gained from the business&#146;s non-compliance. One example of a high-level penalty was the FSA&#146;s finding on Citigroup Global Markets Limited in June 2005. Citigroup was fined nearly &#163;14 million for failing to conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence and for failing to control its business effectively when it executed a trading strategy on European government bond markets in August 2004. The financial penalty was composed of two elements: first, a relinquishment of the profits earned from the bond trading of nearly &#163;10 million; and, secondly, an additional penalty of &#163;4 million.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000047"></a>If any cap on variable monetary penalties is applied, regulators may not be able to tackle in full some instances of non-compliance. It is worth noting  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC569"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC569</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that Professor Macrory specifically ruled out a cap based on a business&#146;s turnover, arguing that such an upper limit would place undue legal complexity on the system and could encourage regulators to set VMPs at inappropriately high levels. That is not to say that they will not be capped in practice. In making an order under Part 3 of the Bill, the Minister may consider that such a cap is necessary. However, we do not think that should be an obligation on the Minister in every case.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000048"></a>In the absence of a cap, the regulator will still be required by Clause 61 to publish guidance setting out the matters that it is likely to take into account when setting the level of VMPs so that there will be transparency in the process. The business will be able to make objections and representations about the level of penalty after the notice of intent is issued and will be able to appeal against the penalty.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000049"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendment makes a point in relation to summary offences. Not many summary offences will lead to a variable monetary penalty because, by their nature, they will be either-way offences or able to be tried only on indictment. The limit for summary offences in the magistrates&#146; court is &#163;5,000 per offence, so there may be a point in limiting summary-only VMPs to &#163;5,000. We have not reached a firm conclusion on that. I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising this issue. I hope that he will allow us to go away and consider that part of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000059"></a>The noble Lord said: The amendments that I propose to Clause 41 raise the same questions in the context of the discretionary procedure as I raised when we debated my amendments to Clause 38 in the context of the fixed penalty regime. They go to the issue of multisite businesses, to the need for independence and to an obligation on the enforcer to prove guilt rather than this rather more unusual need to prove innocence.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000060"></a>We understand that the discretionary procedure is to be used for a higher level of regulatory non-compliance than fixed penalties are. While the Minister may therefore give similar responses to those that he gave to my analogous amendments in respect of fixed penalties, does he not accept that the need for safeguards&#151;for example, allowing oral representations and providing for some level of independent referral&#151;is even higher where the penalty can be higher?</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000061"></a>I noted the Minister&#146;s objection to my phrase &#147;independent person&#148; when we debated my Amendment No. 126, as I did his objection to the phrase &#147;independent judicial person&#148; in response to Amendment No. 120 in the name of my noble friend Lord Cope. I do not wish to be pedantic about the wording&#151;I am sure that the Government can do better than I can&#151;but we are even more concerned in the area of discretionary penalties about a lack of flexibility and independence in the appeal process than we were in the fixed penalty environment. I move this amendment to allow the Minister to respond. I beg to move.</p>

In particular, it is extremely analogous to Amendment No. 143, as my noble friend Lord De Mauley has already indicated. I do not want to speak to it at length because, in effect, I spoke on the same point when we debated the earlier clause. Nevertheless, like my noble friend, I think that a degree of independence in the review is required. Whether that should be quite as strong as suggested by the words &#147;independent judicial person&#148; in my amendment is a matter for discussion. Perhaps it goes a little too far, but a degree of independence seems to be desirable if this part of the process is to have any point.</p>

This fundamental matter was debated at Second Reading. I think that the Government&#146;s basic response has been that someone different within the regulator will deal with the issue. I am reminded of the principle of Chinese walls that operates in the City: as we all know, they have chinks in them.</p>

With regard to Amendment No. 139, as the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, accepted, we have already said, in response to his Amendment No. 122, that we understand the concern that multisite businesses have about the service of enforcement notices. However, we do not feel that it would be appropriate for either the enforcing authority or the business for all notices across the country to be served  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC571"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC571</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>only by a primary authority and only on a designated person within a company. I hope that the noble Lord will forgive me if I do not repeat the arguments; he anticipated rightly that they are the same. I stress, though, that we consider these to be operational issues that do not need to be set out in the Bill. We feel that the policy aim behind both this amendment and Amendment No. 122, which we debated the other day in Committee, might be better achieved administratively through the primary authority notifying the business whenever a sanction is imposed.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000065"></a>On Amendment No. 141, the Bill requires a business to put its representations against the proposed imposition of a discretionary requirement in writing. We think that that is appropriate; we have had discussions in which the Government have given some ground on other matters that need to be put in writing under the Bill. However, there is nothing in the Bill to prevent the business from also making oral representations to the regulator. Indeed, we rather hope that such dialogue will be part of the more flexible ongoing relationship between the business and the regulator. The requirement for representations to be made in writing is to ensure clarity and to enable both parties to maintain a clear record of discussions that have gone on.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000066"></a>Amendment No. 143, which has been supported by the noble Lords, Lord Cope and Lord Razzall, proposes that the representations following a notice of intent to impose a discretionary requirement should be heard by an independent person. The distinction between variable and fixed monetary penalties is that a notice will be served on the business that there is an intent to impose a discretionary requirement. I repeat that it is not clear from the amendment who that independent person would be and what powers he or she would have. Unlike the amendment to which the noble Lord, Lord Cope, has just referred, which specifies that the independent person should be judicial, this amendment says simply that the person should be independent. Our worry with that is that, if the amendment were accepted, further provision would need to be made in the Bill for that independent person. We think that that would increase the complexity and bureaucracy of the process of imposing this higher sanction.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000067"></a>The amendment could also give businesses that have clearly breached the regulations two rights of appeal against a sanction, one before imposition and one after, possibly to two different bodies. There is a basic right of appeal and it is important to maintain that, but we think that two may be overly bureaucratic and not necessary in the interests of justice.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000068"></a>In the case of discretionary requirements, the notice-of-intent stage is part of an ongoing dialogue between the business and the regulator. Requiring the involvement of an independent person in the process would undermine it. In particular, with discretionary requirements a business may wish to offer undertakings in order to mitigate a penalty, and that can take place during the period of representations. If the amendment were accepted by the Government and such undertakings were made instead to an independent person, again a further period would need to be built in to allow those undertakings to be considered by the regulator. Once

We are trying to lighten the bureaucracy as much as we can.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000069"></a>We understand the concerns of noble Lords about regulators other than courts determining whether a person is liable to a sanction, which is precisely why we have a right of appeal against a sanction to an independent and impartial tribunal. I hope that what I have said goes some way towards reassuring the noble Lord.</p>

It gives powers to local authorities where it appears that the condition of the land by reason of substances in or under it may cause significant harm, or there is a significant possibility of harm being caused by the substance. It goes on to say that,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000443"></a>&#147;what harm is to be regarded to be &#145;significant&#146; shall be determined by guidance&#148;,</ul>

Our Amendment No. 152A, which is in this group, tests the same point as the noble Viscount is making. I shall also speak to Amendment No. 155, which raises a different point.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000087"></a>I am sure that it is common ground on all sides of the Committee that we fully support the inclusion of stop notices in the Bill. The stop notice enables regulators to put an immediate halt to activity that is causing or is likely to cause harm to human health, the environment or the financial interests of consumers. It is also common ground on this side of the Committee that the test as drafted that regulators must prove before deploying a stop notice is set so high that, we fear, the sanction will not be used in circumstances where it would be justified.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000088"></a>We can play around with the word &#147;serious&#148;; we can all think of examples. For example, there are circumstances when a small number of people may be badly affected by a business activity. Does that qualify as serious? It is obviously serious to that small number of people. Alternatively, a large number of consumers might suffer minor detriment individually as a result of a business activity, but the financial windfall for the company is huge. Again, does that count as serious?</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000089"></a>With the help of the National Consumer Council, I think that I can do slightly better than the noble Viscount&#146;s legislative precedent in relation to concern about the use of the word &#147;serious&#148;. We can go back to the Legal Services Act 2007, where&#151;on the advice of parliamentary counsel, I assume&#151;the Government used arguments about ambiguity to resist amendments that used words such as &#147;significant&#148; and &#147;serious&#148; in the same context as they are now being used in the Bill. The conclusion was that such words are difficult to interpret and that it was likely

I very much look forward to the Government&#146;s response on that point. I know that we have joined-up government, but do we have historical precedent-led government as well? The arguments that were used on one side of the coin on the Legal Services Act seem to be used on the other side here.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000090"></a>Amendment No. 155 raises another serious point of principle. As the Bill is drafted, if a stop notice has been served on a business, perfectly correctly, and the business has then rectified the peril that it has been asked to rectify, the regulator has a maximum of 14 days before that business has to be enabled to restart its business activity. That seems to us to be far too long. The business may well have immediately stepped in to rectify the activity or omission at which the stop notice was aimed but is none the less out of business for 14 days. We think that 14 days is too long, which is why we have proposed seven days in Amendment No. 155.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000094"></a>We on these Benches intend to oppose the Question that Clause 46 should stand part of the Bill. We do so on a probing basis so that the Committee may discuss the criticisms of this part of the Bill that were published in the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee report. Clause 44 enables an order to confer power on a regulator to stop activity in certain circumstances when he reasonably believes that the activity involves or is likely to involve the commission of an offence. This is a powerful weapon for a regulator and potentially of enormous significance to the regulated person.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000095"></a>The acceptability of the delegation depends on the robustness of the compensation arrangements, but Clause 46 leaves it to the order to state the case under which compensation will be awarded. In particular, there is a power for the order to provide that compensation is payable only in prescribed cases. However, I follow the committee in thinking that this is insufficient. For stop notice delegation to be acceptable, the Bill must specify the essential elements of the compensation arrangements that Parliament considers necessary. In particular, the Bill should specify the result that any order-making provision under Clause 46 needs to secure.</p>

It is a pleasure to be here in Committee. On the point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, about the definition of,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000445"></a>&#147;significant risk of ... serious harm&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000366"></a>this will be up to the regulators to determine in individual cases. The threshold has been set deliberately high so that the regulators are not serving stop notices indiscriminately. Regulators are already experienced in deciding what these tests mean. For example, the word &#147;serious&#148; already features in health and safety legislation; &#147;serious personal injury&#148; is the threshold for prohibition notices made under Section 22 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and, in time, we would expect the tribunal to establish case law on what constitutes significant risk of serious harm.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000098"></a>As to the specific question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, the Government resisted the use of &#147;significant&#148; in the case of the Legal Services Act 2007 because they felt that it would set the bar at too high a level for the purposes of that Act. The use of &#147;significant&#148; and &#147;serious&#148; in the Bill is limited to only one sanction&#151;stop notices. We are of the view that this is justified. Stop notices are the most far-reaching of the new sanctions and will require at least some part of a business to cease operating. In some cases, stop notices will require a business to shut down completely. These notices should be used only in the most serious circumstances. The threshold is therefore set deliberately high to ensure that regulators do not serve them indiscriminately. A number of less onerous civil sanctions are available to the regulators where the risk is not significant or the harm is not serious, and alternative sanctions such as the discretionary requirement should be used. This is in keeping with the principles set out in the Hampton and Macrory reviews. As I said, case law will establish this in due course.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000099"></a>On Amendments Nos. 152 and 153 and stop notices overall, it is important to be able to prevent an offence from occurring when there is a significant risk of serious harm to the public or to the environment. It would not be in the public interest for the regulator to have to wait until the harm has been realised before taking action. These measures were included following consultation on the draft Bill last summer. The concept of preventive notices received strong support in the consultation, with three-quarters of the respondents across the stakeholder group suggesting that they would be a useful additional power.</p>

Noble Lords may wish to note that there are already forms of preventive stop notices, such as the one provided in the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, which may be used when an inspector is of the opinion that an activity that is or is likely to be carried on involves or will involve a risk of serious personal injury. Preventive notices therefore have an important role to play. It would be perverse for a regulator to have to sit back and wait for a serious offence to be committed and for the harm to be realised where such an eventuality may well be obvious.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000101"></a>On Amendment No. 152A, as we have discussed, stop notices are the most far-reaching of the new civil sanctions and are reserved entirely for serious acts of non-compliance. The threshold has been set high. I should point out that we asked during the consultation on the draft Bill whether the thresholds were set at the right level. Almost 60 per cent of respondents, including many regulators, agreed that the test was set at the right level.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000102"></a>On Amendment No. 155 and the period of time that the regulator has to issue a completion certificate for a stop notice, Clause 45(2)(c) requires a regulator who is satisfied that a business has taken the steps specified in the stop notice to issue a completion certificate. In practice, we expect this to happen as soon as it is practicable for the regulator to do so. Indeed, we would expect the regulator to keep under review the operation of any stop notice that they issue to ensure that the business has taken the required steps towards compliance.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000103"></a>The procedure in Clause 45(2)(e), which allows a business to request a certificate from the regulator confirming its compliance, is a safeguard intended to ensure that there is ongoing monitoring of the operation of the stop notice. We stress that the 14-day time limit in subsection (2)(f) is the maximum time in which the regulator must decide whether to issue a certificate. A seven-day limit would not always give regulators sufficient time to assess fully whether a business had complied with the terms of their notice. In some cases, for example, a regulator may need to carry out tests to assess whether the business is in compliance. A leaking pipe that has emitted toxic waste might need to be tested for toxins to ensure that they have returned to acceptable levels. In such a case, the regulator may have to wait for test results.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000104"></a>There may also be other legitimate reasons for delay. For example, the regulator may need to contact a third party to ensure that it is no longer suffering harm. A 14-day time limit therefore strikes the right balance between providing a safeguard for business and allowing regulators sufficient time to assess whether the business has complied with the terms of the notice. I should add that the order giving a regulator access to the new powers may provide whether stop notices are automatically suspended when the business appeals against a notice or whether this decision should be left to the tribunal.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000105"></a>Finally, I understand the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, regarding the stop notice compensation. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC577"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC577</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Reform Committee has also expressed concern regarding the detail of this provision, but I hope that we can explain why such detail is best left to secondary legislation. Due to the serious nature of stop notices, we believe that compensation should, in certain circumstances, be available where a notice is wrongly imposed. Accordingly, orders giving regulators the power to serve stop notices will have to provide for regulators, on application, to compensate businesses where they have suffered loss because of the service of a stop notice. The order will determine the specific grounds for compensation and will be subject to the affirmative procedure, so noble Lords will have the chance to debate it. The order will also determine the types of loss that can be compensated. Compensation might be appropriate where a business wins an appeal against the imposition of a stop notice and where the regulator is considered to have acted unreasonably or in serious default. Compensation will not be appropriate in all cases&#151;for example, it may not be appropriate if an appeal is upheld on a technicality.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000106"></a>The Bill provides flexibility in allowing the order to prescribe the circumstances in which compensation might be payable. It would not be possible to prescribe in the Bill a detailed compensation scheme that would be appropriate for the wide range of regulators covered by the Bill. The provisions need to take account of any existing compensation schemes that regulators already operate, as well as the common law rights to compensation. The Bill is therefore not prescriptive on the form that any compensation scheme should take.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000107"></a>In the light of what I have said, I trust that the noble Viscount will now feel able to withdraw the amendment and I urge noble Lords to withdraw their opposition to Clause 46.</p>

This is really the corollary of her defence of the seriousness of the stop notice. If the Government&#146;s position is that regulators will issue a stop notice only for a serious matter, the regulator should be under an obligation, having closed down a business, to ensure that that business is restored to its business activity as quickly as possible once the remedy has been effected. I take the point that tests or third-party inquiries may be required, but if this is a serious matter and&#151;it may be cheeky of me to say so&#151;if the noble Baroness&#146;s friend can give independence to the Bank of England within three days of taking office in 1997, seven days does not seem to be too long to restore to the business its activity when it has remedied the defect.

I wonder whether the costs arrangements will be applied to fixed penalty notices, to all discretionary sanctions and to the stop notices. All these things cost time and money to get right, particularly if the person at the wrong end of the process is able to appeal.

When pursuing a criminal prosecution, a regulator can reclaim its costs through the courts in the event of a successful prosecution. Where a regulator chooses to impose one of the new administrative sanctions proposed in the Bill, an issue arises over how a regulator can then reclaim its costs.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000126"></a>I note the concerns that have been expressed. We want to ensure that there is no financial disincentive to using the new sanctions. There is a real possibility that regulators could simply continue to use the routes of criminal prosecution even when that was not the most proportionate or appropriate response and therefore we have built in safeguards on cost recovery. In particular, businesses will have a right of appeal to an independent tribunal against both a decision to recover costs and the amount of such costs to the business.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000127"></a>As has been said, bringing in any enforcement action generates costs. Non-compliant businesses should not escape having to pay these costs simply because the regulator has chosen the administrative sanctioning route. There should be considerable savings for businesses should a regulator choose to impose a civil sanction. In particular, businesses will avoid the cost of legal representation before the courts.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000128"></a>In response to Amendment No. 156 and the question asked by the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, I should explain that the power does not extend to fixed monetary penalties because these are designed to be used to sanction low-level, more minor instances of non-compliance. Investigation costs for this type of offence should be much lower than for discretionary requirements or stop notices and should be borne by the regulator. Enforcement undertakings are excluded because they are offered by the business. For example, if a business discovers that it has inadvertently breached a regulatory requirement, brings that to the attention of the regulator and offers an undertaking to put right any harm that has been caused, the regulator&#146;s investigation costs should, again, be much lower.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000129"></a>Amendment No. 179 is unnecessary given the cost-recovery scheme that I have just mentioned. However, there is a specific issue about the LBRO being the administrator for such a fund. The body was set up with the clear objective of promoting consistency of regulatory enforcement among local authorities. As such, it does not have the expertise in the administration of such a fund, which could amount to more than &#163;30 million, nor does it have the remit to involve itself in the funding of local and national regulators&#146; legal cases. It will not surprise the Committee that we believe that, as with fine revenues, the Treasury is best placed to determine the use of funds. In light of what I have said, I hope that the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I think that the answer was, yes, they will be able to get their costs back, but I could not swear to it because she went very fast and I was not entirely clear.

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000131"></a>I should like to ask two questions. First, stop notices are potentially going to apply to some quite serious matters of pollution, noise and so on that need to be stopped. A certain amount of skill and sophisticated instruments are required in order to carry out that kind of investigation, particularly if it has to be done quickly. I therefore believe that provision for the recovery of costs is needed for stop notices where they are successful. I see a certain amount of nodding; if that is so, I am very content.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000132"></a>Secondly, when the Bill says &#147;provision&#148;, which it does perpetually, will that mean another statutory instrument? If so, what form of parliamentary scrutiny will be provided? I cannot see anything in the Bill about provisions being subject to any kind of parliamentary scrutiny, and there are an awful lot of provisions. I should have asked about this before. Perhaps the noble Baroness can provide me with an answer.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000139"></a>The noble Baroness said: My noble and learned friend Lord Lyell apologises to the Committee that he cannot be present this afternoon. The object of Amendments Nos. 157 and 160 is to probe the wisdom or otherwise of excluding the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and allowing appeals only to a specialist tribunal.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000140"></a>As my noble and learned friend said last Thursday, the advantage of the ordinary courts is that they are part of a well established and trusted system and they exist all over the country. Provided that the prosecuting  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC581"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC581</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>authority&#151;that is, the regulator&#151;makes clear the reasons for the prosecution and the injury done and/or costs saved by the alleged wrongdoer, the courts are well capable of imposing the appropriate penalty. Those penalties can indeed be substantial. To oust the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts on such a wide scale is unprecedented and a serious attack on the liberties of the subject.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000141"></a>The Statistics Board&#151;the last regulator mentioned in Schedule 5&#151;provides a good example of how the present system is well capable of bringing pressure to bear on wrongdoers without even proceeding all the way to court. The Written Answer to my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell from the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, on 28 January shows that in past three years the Office for National Statistics issued 90 summonses but proceeded with only 17 prosecutions, in every case obtaining a conviction. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000400"></a>&#147;Businesses served with a summons can then choose to comply with the legislation, which accounts for the lower number of cases going to court&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/1/07; col. <I>WA 92</I>.] </p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000367"></a>In other words, in 73 of the 90 cases where summonses were issued, that alone was sufficient to bring about compliance, and in all the other 17 cases the wrongdoers were convicted.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000142"></a>However, it is said that the courts do not give adequate penalties. In his Second Reading speech, at col. 1242 of <I>Hansard</I>, the noble Lord, Lord Jones, cited a bad case of the unlawful disposal of 184 drums of toxic waste, for which the wrongdoer was fined only &#163;30,000 when he had earned &#163;58,000 for supposedly disposing of it lawfully and it had cost the waste authorities another &#163;167,000 to dispose of it themselves. It seems surprising that the court, had it been told of these facts, would have given such a low penalty. Can the Minister investigate and tell us before Report in which court this occurred and how much of the above information was put before it? Could the case have been referred to the Attorney-General to put before the Court of Appeal as an unduly lenient sentence? We look forward to these answers before Report.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000143"></a>I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the executive summary of the impact assessment, obtainable from the Printed Paper Office, which says at paragraph 75 on page 25 that the Macrory review identified anecdotal evidence of a compliance deficit whereby,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000446"></a>&#147;non-compliance ... is identified but no enforcement action is taken because the regulator lacks the appropriate tool to effectively sanction&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000368"></a>The evidence Macrory found pointed to,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000447"></a>&#147;the heavy reliance on formal criminal sanctions&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000369"></a>which,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000448"></a>&#147;makes the resolution of cases a costly and time-consuming exercise for both businesses and regulators&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000370"></a>However, the experience of the Statistics Board referred to above shows that the mere threat of prosecution or issue of a summons is highly effective. Furthermore, the impact assessment says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000401"></a>&#147;In instances where there has been no intent or wilfulness relating to regulatory non-compliance, a criminal prosecution may be a disproportionate response&#148;.</p>
</ul>



<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC582"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC582</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="080206107000371"></a>Quite so, but the mere threat is likely to be sufficient and is in no way costly. According to the impact assessment on page 24, even Professor Macrory simply says that he,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000449"></a>&#147;identified anecdotal evidence of a compliance deficit&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000144"></a>Paragraph 74, also on page 24, says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000402"></a>&#147;Current tools are not sufficient to deter the &#145;truly&#146; criminal or rogue operators, and equally when cases do reach the courts, sentences imposed are not considered by industry to be a sufficient deterrent or punishment for the offences in question ... A further concern from the business community is that some regulatory non-compliance is not sanctioned at all&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000372"></a>Is this not the likely effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the courts? The truly rogue operators should continue to be prosecuted, but the unintentional offender will find a host of penalties slapped on him under a new tick-box system. Alternatively, large penalties will be imposed on the rogues by officials, but they simply will not pay them.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000145"></a>Is the Minister aware that the analysis in the impact assessment is actually very slight? How many cases were analysed when the supposed costs and benefits were being worked out? The answer is one; I refer noble Lords to paragraph 87 on page 27. Yet the number of cases with large penalties is likely to go up. According to paragraph 89, the number will jump from a total of 15,000 prosecutions to almost 19,000 a year in order to close the anecdotal compliance deficit.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000146"></a>The impact assessment does not say what proportion of these penalties will be fixed and what proportion will be variable. How many cases will the appeal tribunals set up under Clause 52(1) be expected to hear? What will each tribunal cost per day simply to provide the tribunal? Unlike magistrates, the members of the tribunal will have to be paid. They will also have to be identified and trained. Will they be independent? Will the Minister give some examples of real rogues?</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000147"></a>Finally, could we have more explanation of the annexe to the full impact assessment issued by BERR? According to figure 4 at paragraph 36, the estimated savings in administrative burdens on business of this whole scheme are calculated at between &#163;45 million and &#163;65 million, as against administrative burdens imposed by regulators, the total cost of which is &#163;3.631 billion. The overall cost of administrative burdens has been estimated at &#163;13.7 billion. Out of 105 respondents, seven business representatives and 42 government and local authorities commented on the impact assessment. Will the Minister place these responses in the Library for us all to see?</p>

<a name="80206-gc0003.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000148"></a>In conclusion, our concern about this new administrative penalty system is well summarised in the peroration of the Minister himself when he talked about,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000450"></a>&#147;something that is, on the face of it, a well-intentioned piece of regulation&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000373"></a>going on,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000451"></a>&#147;to cause unnecessary expense, bog down wealth creation, kill enterprise&#151;specifically small businesses&#151;and drive commercial activity into a mire of bureaucratic compliance&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="080206107000374"></a>For the present, we look forward to the Minister&#146;s answers to our questions before Report, but at the same time we ask the Government to think again carefully about the whole of Part 3. They can achieve their laudable objective of better regulation without it. I beg to move.</p>
<h5><a name="080206107000462"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="080206107000149"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="080206107000505"></a>Lord Borrie:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, has dealt clearly, comprehensively and with an abundance of argument with these amendments, which would otherwise have been spoken to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell of Markyate. She will not mind my saying that, despite the ability with which she has put forward the amendments, I am sorry that the noble and learned Lord is not in his place; we have had one or two private conversations about this and I know how keen he is on what I might put simply as preserving the role of the magistrates&#146; courts and the Crown Court in any new role that they would have under this Bill were it not for the insertion of administrative tribunals into the procedure. He feels strongly about that and, in earlier discussions in Committee, I have shared with him an enthusiasm for the success of the criminal law in dealing with a lot of regulatory offences, particularly under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968, which will celebrate its 40th anniversary this year. Moreover, it is not just the bringing of an action but, as the noble Baroness indicated, the threat of an action and a criminal penalty that so often proves to be such a valuable deterrent and incentive to better business conduct.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000150"></a>But, and I suspect that the noble Baroness thought that there would be a &#147;but&#148; somewhere along the line, she will remember that my noble friend Lord Bach made it clear that&#151;along with the Macrory recommendations, the civil sanctions and the new remedies that may be sought and which we have been discussing in this Bill&#151;the criminal sanctions for breaches of food law, health law, trade description law and so on are all still in place. They have not been taken away and, in suitable cases, they are all available to be brought. However, the point of the Bill, as has been explained many times by my noble friend, is that, while the criminal law will continue to be used as appropriate, there will be more flexibility once it comes into force. If the distinction is going to be clear between, on the one hand, criminal sanctions and penalties&#151;the criminal aura and the burden that a businessman faces of having been found guilty of a criminal offence&#151;and, on the other hand, the new flexibility offered by the so-called civil sanctions of stop notices, discretionary and fixed penalties and so on, it is not a bad idea to have a separate group of bodies dealing with the procedures covering how those sanctions are to be imposed. Hence we come to the regulator, along with the right of the person on whom a penalty has been imposed to appeal, not to the magistrates&#146; court but to an administrative tribunal.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000151"></a>I suggest that the different administrative tribunals have had long experience over the years, whether they deal with social security or employment issues, for   


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC584"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC584</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>example, and have built up a certain expertise. Moreover, they have been given the training to do that. Magistrates are not without training, but it has to be of a much more general kind. However, if you are a member of an administrative tribunal dealing with the kind of cases that we have been discussing&#151;those turning on regulatory issues&#151;no doubt the training can be much more closely focused on the legislation that you will be dealing with.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000152"></a>Nowadays, 50 years on from the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1958, and following the tribunals Act last year, tribunals have equal status in the public mind; they are authoritative, fully a part of the judicial system, expert and apt for the jobs that they are asked to do. They are as trusted and established as the magistrates&#146; courts and the Crown Court.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000153"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080206107000506"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> I am second to none in my admiration for the intellect and understanding of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell&#151;and, indeed, for his handmaiden&#151;but on this occasion I cannot support him. The Bill is about implementing the principles of the Hampton and Macrory reviews. We cannot go through the Bill and with every amendment try to sneak back something that goes against those principles. We either accept the system of administrative sanctions, which the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, described better than I could, or we do not, but we cannot keep amending the Bill until we have a hotchpotch of the existing system and the principles of the Macrory review. I suspect that the best procedure for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell, would be to attempt to vote down the whole Bill. There is no point in having the Bill if we emasculate it by chipping away at the administrative sanctions in Part 3. On this occasion I cannot support him or the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000154"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="080206107000507"></a>Lord Cope of Berkeley:</b> In this clash of principles across the Floor, in which the Liberal Democrats have just lined themselves up with the Government, my Amendment No. 159 suggests a middle course. With the permission of the Grand Committee, perhaps I may speak to it now, because it covers very similar ground.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000155"></a>Whereas the amendment of my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell seeks to knock out the first-tier tribunal and replace it with a court of law, my amendment seeks to remove subsection (1)(b) and the reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000452"></a>&#147;another tribunal created under an enactment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000375"></a>It is unsatisfactory that we should sanction an appeal to an unknown tribunal. I am not sure whether these unknown tribunals are simply not specified&#151;obviously they are not specified&#151;or whether they have not been invented yet. Either way, we have no information about them and yet we are asked to sanction an appeal to them. It would be better if, while still allowing the appeal to the first-tier tribunal to remain in place&#151;I am to that extent moving a little nearer to the Government and the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, than to my noble and learned friend&#151;the ordinary courts of law remained within the loop rather than some new or unknown tribunal that we have yet to be told about.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC585"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC585</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000156"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, said, in effect, that these will become expert tribunals and that we should leave it to the experts. But, to a degree, the point of appeals in situations such as this is to bring the voice of the man in the street&#151;the ordinary person&#151;to bear on the decision being made rather than that of the experts. That is why we have lay magistrates and juries in the more important cases. I do not automatically jump to the idea that an expert tribunal can be expected to bring common sense to bear on a case that others may think to be unfair.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000157"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080206107000508"></a>Lord Bach:</b> We have had an interesting debate and I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, for raising this important issue. I will not comment on what the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, said. On the 100th anniversary of the day that women got the vote, it would be inappropriate to do so.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000158"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="080206107000509"></a>Baroness Harris of Richmond:</b> I made that comment to my noble friend Lord Razzall.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000160"></a>As the two noble Lords pointed out, this amendment, if carried, would absolutely be a stab in the heart of the Macrory principles. This is an important moment in a sense, because we know that the Government have accepted Macrory and obviously, given the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, the Liberal Democrats in this House have, too. I know that the noble Baroness was eloquently reading a speech written by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lyell of Markyate, but it is an important point for all Members of the Committee to come to a view about&#151;indeed, for Parliament to come to a view about. Is Macrory the way forward or is it not? If the amendment were carried, Macrory would effectively be a dead duck.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000161"></a>On the letters that have been asked for, of course I will write them. As for the details of the case that my noble friend Lord Jones of Birmingham graphically described at Second Reading, yes, it will be a pleasure to try to fill out a few more details, although, knowing how dangerous it is to take issue with a former Attorney-General, I do not think that offences&#151;the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, will know the answer to this&#151;such as those that we are talking about are likely to lead to any appeal against the lightness of sentence, because I do not think that the law allows for that. I see that the noble Viscount does not think so either; I am gratified by that. But we will see. We will look at that issue, too. That letter will be sent.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000162"></a>Professor Macrory found two main advantages in a tribunal hearing appeals rather than the criminal courts. First, a tribunal can comprise members with both legal and specialist expertise in the subject matter before it, thereby providing it with a fuller understanding of the regulatory issues. He pointed out that cases of regulatory non-compliance make up less than 1 per cent of all cases heard in magistrates&#146; courts, making it more difficult to provide specific training to magistrates and legal advisers&#151;not impossible, but more difficult. Secondly, a tribunal would not consider regulatory cases alongside cases  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC586"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC586</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of conventional crime, which should constitute the main workload of criminal courts. Regulatory cases could be concentrated through one tribunal, enabling expertise to be built up over time.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000163"></a>Professor Macrory specifically ruled out some form of hybrid system&#151;or &#147;hotchpotch&#148; system as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, accurately said&#151;with appeals against civil sanctions heard by the criminal courts. Professor Macrory argued for a clear separation between the criminal and civil systems. Tribunals were set up in the first place because they were considered to be more accessible than the courts and less formal. Businesses would be able to present their cases, should they wish to do so, without the greater need for legal representation. Tribunals will also be independent from regulators and will be able to ensure that the procedural and other rights of businesses are protected. For those reasons, and for the ones better set out by my noble friend Lord Borrie and the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, we could not accept the amendment.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000164"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Cope, as always, seeks the middle way between one view and another in order to help the Committee to come to a firm view. He asked when we would know which tribunal would hear appeals; he talked with a man-on-the-street perspective. That will be set out in the order giving the regulator access to the new powers. The order will be subject to consultation and the affirmative resolution procedure. Lay members can and do sit on tribunals.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000165"></a>The first-tier tribunal is to be set up under the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and will consolidate the jurisdictions of a number of existing tribunals&#151;for example, the VAT and duties tribunals, the Financial Services and Markets Tribunal and the Pensions Regulator Tribunal&#151;but a number of tribunals will remain whose jurisdictions will not be incorporated into the first-tier tribunal. The Explanatory Notes give the example of the employment tribunals, which currently hear some appeals on health and safety matters, but other tribunals, such as the Competition Appeal Tribunal, will not come within the first-tier tribunal.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000166"></a>The Bill is not prescriptive in determining which tribunal will hear appeals and I understand the noble Lord&#146;s concern about which body the Minister may specify in the order. However, the exemptions are limited to statutory tribunals and would therefore exclude administrative tribunals or other less formal hearing panels. I hope that that is of some comfort to the noble Lord, although I take his point about it not being entirely satisfactory that we do not know at this stage which tribunal this will go to. However, it will not be an administrative tribunal; it will be a statutory tribunal.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000403"></a>&#147;We support the view that a distinction must be drawn between matters of regulation and criminal offending.

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000404"></a>&#147;EEF supports the principle of alternative penalties for regulatory offences as a mechanism for reducing demands on court time, speeding up the process of enforcement and sanctioning, and reducing the costs associated with this for business&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000173"></a>The object of the amendments was to probe the wisdom or otherwise of excluding the jurisdiction of ordinary courts. Based on my noble and learned friend&#146;s experience, he feels passionately about this. As he has said, the ordinary courts are part of a well established and trusted system. They exist all over the country and they provide the prosecuting authority. We know from many other instances that, although a move away from the tried and tested can sometimes be exciting and more fun, it often turns out to be very sad. It is for this reason that the final amendment to be moved by this side of the Committee will propose a sunset clause to see how things develop as time goes by. For the moment, however, it is only right that I should withdraw this amendment. We shall read what the Minister said. I thank him on behalf of my noble and learned friend Lord Lyell for undertaking to go into the detail in a letter to be placed in the Library. We are most grateful for that.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000405"></a> After Clause 53, insert the following new Clause&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000409"></a>(3) The second condition is that a local authority has imposed a non-compliance penalty under section 43 and no appeal has been made within the specified time.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000410"></a>(4) The third condition is that a local authority has imposed a stop notice under section 44 and no appeal has been made within the specified time.&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000180"></a>The noble Lord said: After those great clashes of principle, this proposed new clause is rather more probing in nature. It is obvious to anyone who knows anything about it that when breaches in these various laws occur, the sanction of a fine can be extremely important to the business concerned. But a fine is more likely to do real damage to a business, making it difficult to carry on, if it is a small concern. A giant supermarket chain finding one of its stores in trouble in the local courts or under this new arrangement can quite easily pay the fine and either forget about the problem or take steps to tighten up its procedures to avoid the breach happening again. Such an event is not necessarily damaging to the business overall. What is damaging is the publicity of being taken to court and dragged into the public arena for having caused a breach of, say, a food safety arrangement. It is this disparity between small and large businesses that I want to draw attention to with the amendment.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000181"></a>Nowhere in the Bill is it provided that the new system will involve any publicity at all. I thought I would suggest the new clause to see whether that is intended. Once the new arrangements get going, a cosy arrangement may develop to some degree between the regulators and the large businesses that are being regulated. In part that is what is intended and wanted. Indeed, the Minister said earlier today that the regulators and the regulated bodies will talk to one another more frequently than is the case at the moment. But if there is a breach and a cosy arrangement exists, we may not hear much about it having taken place. It may be hushed up after a quick payment is made, and on we go. In reality, that is no sanction against a giant firm&#151;or at least it is only a very small sanction. On the other hand, it could crush a small firm or seriously damage its business. For many businesses, it would be a personal fine on the proprietor, as opposed to a big corporate entity, for which such a fine would be a microscopic proportion of its turnover or profits.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000182"></a>I am merely probing what publicity there will be to preserve both an effective sanction over and above fines and the balance of sanctions which seems to exist in the present system between small and large businesses. I beg to move.</p>

We agree that local authority regulators&#151;and, for that matter, all regulators, whether local authority or otherwise&#151;should publicise the details of their civil enforcement activity. That would lead to greater transparency and could prove to be a useful tool in encouraging compliance from those keen to maintain their public reputation. We very much take the noble Lord&#146;s point about how publicity affects some more than others, in the same way that penalties affect some more than others.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000184"></a>Publicising details of enforcement actions was a recommendation of the Macrory review. Amendment No. 179A, which we shall come to later, replicates the wording of Macrory&#146;s recommendation that regulators should publish details of all enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions. This recommendation formed part of a wider discussion on improving the transparency and accountability of regulators.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000185"></a>The Government accepted all Professor Macrory&#146;s recommendations and it is agreed government policy to improve the transparency and accountability of regulators. We therefore have some sympathy with the amendment, although the noble Lord will forgive me if I say that we do not accept the precise drafting. If he will withdraw the amendment, we will consider it further and return to this issue on Report.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000200"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 163B to 163D. This group of amendments was originally drafted by LACORS and focuses the requirement to issue guidance about the use of civil sanctions on the Minister with responsibility rather than on the various local authorities as is proposed in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000201"></a>These amendments are crucial to the removal of bureaucracy and inconsistencies from the proposed system. They would ensure that national guidance regarding the appropriate use of civil sanctions is issued by Ministers with responsibility for legislation and not by every regulator and every local authority. A requirement for every local authority and every national regulator to issue its own guidance about the use of civil sanctions under the same legislation is unnecessary and would lead to inconsistency and misunderstanding.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000202"></a>The amendments focus the requirement on the government departments, so there would be a single set of national guidance on how civil sanctions should be used for specific legislation. This would reduce costs for local authorities, assist regulated persons and entities, particularly multi-site businesses, and help ensure consistency in approach. It would help the Bill achieve one of its stated aims, which we have, again and again, seen left by the wayside on our journey through Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000203"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="080206107000521"></a>Viscount Colville of Culross:</b> I support the amendment. To impose the burden on local authorities of having to go through the hundreds of provisions covered by the Bill is unreasonable and it should not be imposed. I have looked at the guide to which we have been referred before and I see in paragraph 67 that the LBRO is going to do this. I wish it luck.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000204"></a>I have a copy of a letter from the noble Lord, Lord Jones, which he wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, as chairman of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, concerning the European instruments referred to in Clause 4. In the letter the noble Lord, Lord Jones, said:</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC591"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC591</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000414"></a>&#147;I believe that listing all the regulations whether in the Bill or by statutory instrument would be impractical: regulations under ECA 1972 are made very frequently and any list would very quickly be out of date&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000378"></a>That relates only to European communities legislation by subordinate instrument; it does not take account of the copious new penalties that are imposed in primary legislation and which come from all kinds of departments over the whole range of government. The LBRO could probably do this but I would like an assurance that it will have the manpower and resources to do so and the lines of communication to all the government departments who create these penalties to make sure that it has covered the field.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000205"></a>I do not mind whether it is the solution of the noble Lord, Lord Jones, or the one in the guidance, but local authorities should not have to do this. They are not responsible for the great deluge of legislation that is put upon them to enforce and they are capable of missing some, as I fear I know. Therefore it would be very much better if it was done by a central authority.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000206"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080206107000522"></a>Baroness Vadera:</b> I have some sympathy with the comments made and the intent behind the amendments. However, we do not believe that they are necessary.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000207"></a>I should start by explaining that the requirement in Clause 61 is to publish guidance and that the issue of burden and bureaucracy that has been mentioned is about who prepares that guidance ahead of publication. We believe that the regulators rather than the Minister should publish guidance about the way in which they will individually apply and enforce the provisions. This will provide regulatory certainty and clear lines of accountability to the regulated community who look to the regulators for this. Although we expect the relevant government department to have a role to play in preparing the guidance, we envisage that this will be a collaborative process involving the department, the regulator and, where appropriate, the LBRO.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000208"></a>It may be helpful if I outline some possible scenarios. Where there is a national regulator, we would expect that regulator to prepare and publish the guidance. If a national regulator is working in partnership with local authorities, such as on food safety, we would expect the national regulator to prepare the guidance in consultation with the LBRO and local authorities. The national regulator and the local authorities would then publish the guidance.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000209"></a>Where there is no national regulator, such as on environmental health or trading standards, we would expect the LBRO to take the lead in preparing guidance, working with the relevant government department and local authorities. Each local authority, as a regulator, would then be required to publish the guidance. This approach should help to reduce the workload for local authorities, to which the noble Viscount, Lord Colville, correctly pointed, and help to ensure consistency across the board. Indeed, that was the purpose of the structure that was set up.</p>

Clause 63 puts this requirement on a statutory footing, and requires the review to take place within a three year period. In conducting the review, the Minister will have regard to such issues as whether there are any obstacles to the use of the new sanctioning powers, whether the drafting of the order has caused any unintended consequences, or whether the way in which the sanctions have been implemented has created incentives to use particular sanctions.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000225"></a>The review will benefit both regulators and the regulated community, as it will ensure that any deficiencies in the order can be identified and put right. This is a one-off review. There is no requirement to conduct further reviews, although we would expect the Minister to monitor a regulator&#146;s performance as part of existing governance arrangements.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000226"></a>On the specific detail of Amendments Nos. 165 and 166, the Bill requires the Minister to consult such persons as he thinks fit when conducting a review under Clause 63. This would not preclude the Minister from consulting the National Audit Office, which we all hold in high regard. Indeed, we expect this to be good practice. However, the NAO may not be the most appropriate consultee in all circumstances. Where the regulators in question are local authorities that are audited by the Audit Commission, the NAO will have no remit to decide how they have exercised the new sanctioning powers. The Bill is therefore deliberately silent on whom the Minister should consult.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000227"></a>As a result, I hope the noble Lord will now feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000235"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 168, I shall also speak to the amendments in my name and that of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles. The amendments seek to address the fact that the Bill would allow Ministers to suspend legal powers conferred on the regulators and to revoke that suspension by direction, rather than by order. The original statutory instrument, which conferred the power in the first place, will remain even while the power is suspended. It will therefore not be possible to tell which powers are suspended by looking at the statute book.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000236"></a>As your Lordships&#146; Select Committee on the Constitution said in paragraph 6 of its report on the Bill which it published on 4 December last year:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000421"></a>&#147;At any given time, primary and delegated legislation ought to show clearly which institutions&#151;courts or regulators&#151;may exercise sanctioning power in relation to criminal offences&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000379"></a>In a letter to your Lordships&#146; Select Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, noted that this provision was added following consultation on the draft Bill and is intended to act as a safeguard against a regulator&#146;s persistent misuse of the new powers. &#147;The clause&#148;, he said,</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000453"></a>&#147;is intended to act as an interim, temporary measure that is designed to allow the regulator an opportunity to put right any failings. It will provide a practical and flexible alternative to full revocation of the legislative order&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000237"></a>Under the provisions of the Bill, the Minister will have to report any suspension or revocation of powers to Parliament, and the regulator will have to publish details of the direction. I respectfully submit that consideration should be given by the Committee to these amendments because they would require the Secretary of State to obtain parliamentary approval by order before suspending a regulator&#146;s power or revoking that suspension, rather than allowing him or her to do it through simple direction. I beg to move.</p>

<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC595"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC595</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>every shop having a different primary authority, so, as my noble friend Lord Goodlad tells us, the Bill&#146;s outcome will be a patchwork of statutory instruments made by Ministers to empower some regulators to impose sanctions in relation to some offences. That sounds pretty confusing. The Bill will create a situation in which Ministers may at a later time suspend a regulator&#146;s power to impose sanctions by issuing directions. They may then revoke that suspension by further directions. The Bill needs to set out clearly which institutions, courts or regulators may exercise sanctioning powers in relation to criminal offences, and which may not.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000239"></a>Given the views of the Select Committee on the Constitution, we fear that the arrangements in the Bill are at risk of being too complex and inaccessible to conform to one of the most basic requirements of the rule of law; that is, that all laws should be reasonably certain and accessible. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000240"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0005.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="080206107000531"></a>Lord Bach:</b> The suspension power is intended to provide a safeguard against any improper use of the new sanctions and was added to the Bill in response to concerns raised by the business community during the consultation on the draft Bill. It is designed to be simple to operate either when removing or restoring sanctioning powers. The power will be exercised by the Minister who made the order giving the regulator access to the new sanctions. It is not intended that the power will be used to challenge a decision in an individual case of regulatory non-compliance. It is designed to tackle persistent failings by a regulator, and I should add that the reference to &#147;an offence&#148; in Clause 64 is not to individual cases.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000241"></a>In particular, Clause 64 is intended to act as an interim, temporary measure that is designed to give the regulator an opportunity quickly to put right any failings, but stopping short of full revocation of the order that gives it access to the new powers. Our fear is that subjecting this process to the affirmative resolution procedure, which would be the effect of these amendments, would offer little advantage over full revocation of the order. It would mean that a Minister would not be able to respond as quickly to address the serious misuse of the sanctions by a regulator, nor&#151;more significantly&#151;would a regulator be able quickly to regain the use of the sanctions once any such misuse had been addressed if each time it had to go through regulations laid in Parliament. As such, it is doubtful whether the suspension power would ever be used. It is not intended that it will be used often but, if it is necessary to come to Parliament each time, we wonder whether it will ever be used.</p>

We are grateful to him for coming to the Committee today to move his amendment but our concern is that we disagree with the committee on this point. We understand its specific concern about the procedure for the suspension of the proposed new sanctioning powers. From what the noble Lord said, the intention behind  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC596"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC596</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the amendments is clear&#151;to ensure that there is sufficient parliamentary scrutiny of any decision made by a Minister to suspend a regulator&#146;s access to the powers.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000243"></a>Perhaps I may give some reassurance that, while the Minister&#146;s direction will not be subject under the Bill to direct parliamentary oversight, the Minister will be required by Clause 64 to report to Parliament on any direction that he gives to a regulator either suspending or revoking suspension of the powers. There will have to be consultation before making any direction and the regulator will have to publish the details of the direction.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000244"></a>As has been said by all Members of the Committee, the Bill will allow regulators access to a range of important powers, and that is obvious from looking at the Bill. Some of the new sanctions could be particularly significant. Business needs to be assured that regulators will use these sanctions in a correct, consistent and proportionate manner and that, if they do not, their powers will be suspended, if only temporarily. That is why we think that this clause provides an important additional safeguard.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000245"></a>Our view is that the process outlined in Clause 64 gives those that are subject to the regulatory regime the transparency and certainty which the noble Lord&#146;s amendments seek to provide. To make it a necessity for a Minister to come to Parliament and lay an order here would, in practical terms, make the suspension power very difficult to operate.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0005.htm_para35"></a>

<p><a name="080206107000257"></a>A live example of the reputational regulation is set out in pilot schemes sponsored by the Food Standards Agency. In the scheme, local authorities publish the details of food hygiene inspection results. If food retail businesses think that consumers will refuse to eat at restaurants with low food hygiene scores, their publication obviously provides a real incentive for them to meet acceptable standards. I do not want to go into the position in the United States, but it has taken the principle to a further level. But we know that compliant restaurants in the United States attract more business and the rates of food poisoning are decreasing. We therefore propose that this final McCrory principle should be in the Bill, and that is the purpose of this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

Publicity is the key to stopping other companies and organisations from falling into the same trap and being fined or otherwise taken to task by a regulatory body. About a year ago, Network Rail was fined something like &#163;2 million for overstaying its possessions on Portsmouth signalling. While the fine was not that large, the effect on Network Rail was very significant, although I expect that it will be given a much larger fine over its problems during the Christmas holiday. Whether the company is big or small, it is important that people should know about the problem because more steps will then be taken to prevent it happening again.</p>

When he talks about completed enforcement actions, will this reveal where enforcement actions have failed because appeals have been successfully made against an action? I ask this because it seems very unfair for people to be listed if in fact appeals were made and the enforcement action was found not be appropriate. People should be able to justify their actions, and indeed from time to time it would be a major sanction on the regulator acting capriciously.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000268"></a>My noble friend Lady Vadera, to whom I am pleased to add my welcome today, and my noble friend Lord Bach know that various economic regulators&#151;Ofcom, Ofwat, the Office of Rail Regulation and the Office of Fair Trading&#151;have been active behind the scenes in securing the kind of changes to the Bill sought by my amendments. They are principally concerned that any new obligation imposed by this clause should not adversely affect their statutory duties under existing legislation.</p>

The objectives of my amendments are threefold: first, to impose a clear obligation on regulators to keep under review their regulatory functions to ensure that burdens are not imposed which are unnecessary; secondly, to achieve legislative consistency in the statutory obligations imposed on the various regulators and, in particular, consistency between this Bill and Section 6 of the Communications Act 2003 that set up Ofcom; and, thirdly, to clarify the meaning of &#147;unnecessary&#148; burdens.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000426"></a>&#147;OFCOM must keep the carrying out of their functions under review with a view to securing that regulation by OFCOM does not involve ... the imposition of burdens which are unnecessary; or ... the maintenance of burdens which have become unnecessary&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000382"></a>I do not think it is very closely modelled on Section 6 of the Communications Act at all. I submit that Amendment No. 180 and the other amendments are much more closely modelled on it and therefore more in accord with the intentions of the Bill as stated by Her Majesty&#146;s Government in their guidance, and closer than Clause 68 as it stands.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000271"></a>Under the current Clause 68, it is not clear whether a review by the regulator is actually required or is sufficient, or is merely one of several possible actions by the regulator. The regulators will be left in some uncertainty on the basis of the present clause. Lack of clarity is particularly inappropriate for the competition functions of the Office of Fair Trading and the other regulators because it might leave open the possibility of legal challenge in respect, for example, of the allegedly burdensome way&#151;unnecessarily burdensome, it might be argued&#151;in which investigations for the purposes of competition law are being conducted.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000272"></a>Hampton was keen on legislative simplification. It is not helpful if businessmen have to familiarise themselves with a variety of legislative provisions, all supposedly dealing with the same problem. Ofcom, in the four or five years that it has been in existence, interprets Section 6 of the Communications Act as requiring it to be constantly aware of the need to minimise regulatory burdens. That has influenced the culture of the organisation: from time to time Ofcom publishes details of progress in reducing regulatory burdens and plans to make further progress as set out in its December 2007 simplification plan. I know, because it is in the guide to the Bill, that the Government are keen on simplifications plans from regulators. They are expressly praised by Her Majesty&#146;s Government on page 49 of the guidance.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000427"></a>&#147;In determining whether a burden is necessary or unnecessary for the purposes of complying ... the person exercising the relevant function shall, when exercising that function, have regard to those matters to which they are required to have regard under or pursuant to any other enactment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000274"></a>Finally, while Clause 68(2) makes it clear that the duty does not require the removal of a burden where its removal would be &#147;impracticable or disproportionate&#148;, there is a need to cover similarly the imposition of new burdens. One of the economic regulators, Ofgem, occasionally has to approve changes to gas and electricity industry codes. They are pretty complex agreements which govern, for example, terms of connection with gas and electricity networks. Ofgem has no powers to alter or modify proposals that come from industry or from consumer representation; it must accept or reject them, and must judge them as a whole in the public interest. Under the current Clause 68, it is not clear that Ofgem can do that if the proposals involve imposing

Ofgem needs clarity to continue to do its work. At the moment, the clause could do with my Amendments Nos. 182 to 184 to ensure clarity about what is meant by &#147;unnecessary&#148; burdens and what the existing statutory requirements are, as well as those that the Bill seeks to impose. I beg to move.</p>

Part 4 poses a significant issue for the Government. We on these Benches have taken the easy way out and have simply proposed that Part 4 should not stand part of the Bill rather than attempting to amend it in the learned way that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has done. It is a shame we have got to this point with regard to Part 4. The Government to some extent have fallen down on their own procedures. In draft, the Bill was well considered and well commented on by all interested parties. However, Part 4 was put into the Bill at a very late stage so the Government did not have an opportunity to consult on it as they did in their pretty detailed consultation on Parts 1 to 3. I am sure the Minister will accept that as a result of that consultation, those parts of the Bill are in a much better form than they would have been without it. The Government should take the opportunity between now and Report to think again about Part 4, either by taking on board our proposal to exclude it altogether or, if they do not wish to do that, by taking on board a number of the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Borrie.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000276"></a>The Food Standards Agency has been particularly vociferous in its opposition to Part 4 because it believes that these provisions could potentially limit a regulator&#146;s ability to protect the public. The question whether a regulation designed to protect consumers is necessary&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, touched on this&#151;will always be hotly contested by organisations representing either the consumer or the business interest. The provisions in Part 4 may well be used by business organisations to put unreasonable pressure on regulators to remove essential consumer protection measures. Indeed, they might also give third parties too much control over the regulatory agenda and distract regulators from working on their key priorities.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000277"></a>My fundamental point, as I have indicated, is that it is a shame that Part 4 has appeared without the opportunity for proper consultation on it. We do not think that it is not in the right form and we hope that the Government will either accept what we suggest and delete it altogether or take on board the points that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has made and attempt to amend it in a more satisfactory manner.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000278"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080206107000541"></a>Lord Bradshaw:</b> Briefly, I support what the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has said. The principal economic regulators have duties placed on them somewhere in the Acts which set them up to have minimum standards. They also have a set of public interest objectives. I am worried that the Government are seeking, in this and other legislation, to interfere in the independence of some of these regulators. They

This falls outside the general presumption that we are trying to ease the burden of regulation. In fact, one could interpret this part of the Bill as adding to regulation, not subtracting from it. It does at least make it very much more complicated.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000279"></a>I join my noble friend Lord Razzall in hoping that we may persuade the Government to take away this whole part of the Bill and look at it again, because doing so would not detract from the main purposes that they intend.</p>

I support what my noble friend Lord Borrie and other noble Lords have said about Part 4, which clearly compromises the independence of economic regulators. I spoke about this at Second Reading, and I received a letter from my noble friend Lord Jones of Birmingham on 18 December&#151;I hope all noble Lords received a copy&#151;that tried to answer some of the points I made. My noble friend cannot say which regulators will be included in this part because they are to be specified by statutory instrument and he has not said when, how, and what are the criteria for choosing them, which is quite serious.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000281"></a>My noble friend Lord Jones stated that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000428"></a>&#147;It is not our intention that Part 4 should be used to frustrate the work of the regulator&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000383"></a>but as another noble Lord said earlier, we are in the territory of the law of unintended consequences here. It may not be the intention, but it is quite possible that it will happen. My noble friend goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000429"></a>&#147;It is, of course, not possible to preclude vexatious complaints by a business&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000384"></a>It is not, but if we did not have these two clauses, they would not arise. I get very worried about that.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000282"></a>I am also really worried about the big companies that are regulated, not the small ones that other noble Lords talked about earlier. The big ones have unlimited resources to put in complaints and frustrate the work of regulators, which is quite serious. That would undermine the competitiveness of UK business.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000283"></a>I have had many discussions with the Office of Rail Regulation and, as the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, says, it, along with the other economic regulators listed in my amendment, believes that the clause duplicates the duties that they have already. One of the existing duties on the ORR is to impose on operators of railway services the minimum restrictions consistent with the performance of their functions. Surely this is clear evidence of duplication. If it is in the original legislation&#151;the Railways Act 1993&#151; why duplicate it? We shall get into a terrible knot here.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000284"></a>Clause 69 allows the Government to interfere. I take very seriously the independence of economic regulators because they are the bedrock of getting private sector investment into the industries they regulate. We saw in the London Olympics Bill, although it did

This is extremely serious. If these clauses remain, all regulatory decisions could be subject to re-opening if the Government are not satisfied with the result. That power completely takes away the independence of the regulators.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000285"></a>As I have said, the Bill is intended to implement the Hampton agenda. Phillip Hampton was careful to avoid compromising the independence of the economic regulators and that is why, as I understand it, he did not include these clauses in his recommendations. I hope that my noble friend will look again at these clauses. If the Government will not remove them both, perhaps the amendments proposed by my noble friend Lord Borrie, who is much more expert at this than I am, or mine, could be looked at again for the Report stage.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000286"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080206107000543"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, that, unfortunately, the &#147;as amended&#148; version of Clause 68 did not arrive on my desk. However, having listened to him, what he says seems to be most sensible.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000287"></a>The intention of my Amendment No. 191A goes to a rather smaller issue than some that have been spoken to: it is to make certain that Part 4 applies only to regulators other than local authorities&#151;that is, to national regulators and government departments and agencies as the makers of regulations.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000288"></a>Other noble Lords have mentioned that Part 4 Bill was not subject to consultation. The imposition of a regulatory burden is first and foremost applicable when new legislation or government guidance is issued that imposes the regulatory requirements. This is done by government departments, agencies and national regulators; not by local authorities, which are simply charged with enforcing the legislation or guidance that has been issued nationally. The exercise of regulatory functions and activities by local authorities and their performance in this regard is already subject to an established regime of overview and public accountability. This existing regime includes a raft of checks and balances to ensure that local authorities do not impose or maintain unnecessary burdens and that their use and application of regulatory powers is reasonable, proportionate, fair and accountable. Local authorities are already held to account in the exercise of their regulatory functions by a whole host of parties and processes and so the duty imposed by Part 4 is unnecessary for them. This part of the Bill should be amended so as not to apply to them.</p>

On the amendment of my noble friend Lord Berkeley to exclude a certain list of specific regulators, I feel that she may not be inclined to support the idea of an exclusion list. If that is her view, would she comment on the possibility of stating in the Bill which

If that clause is not amended as I suggest, I would rather it disappeared altogether.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000290"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0006.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="080206107000545"></a>Baroness Vadera:</b> I welcome this opportunity to discuss Part 4 and set it in the context of the whole better regulation agenda. The aim of Part 4 is to help regulators ensure that they do not impose or maintain unnecessary burdens and that they deliver an efficient regulatory system with greater transparency. The intention is to provide for more effective enforcement of the regulations that Parliament has decided should be created.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000291"></a>My noble friend Lord Borrie is right to say that this duty was not included in the draft Bill, but our intention to introduce it was highlighted in the Government&#146;s document, <I>Next Steps on Regulatory Reform</I>, published in July. We had extensive meetings with many regulators throughout the summer and autumn. We listened to what they had to say and amended our proposals: for example, adding the provision on practicability and proportionality of the removal of unnecessary burdens in Clause 68(2). The Government do not intend that the regulators should, as a result of this duty, divert resources from their core function in a way that compromises their effectiveness or independence. We expect that, in reviewing their functions and removing unnecessary burdens, regulators should be able to target their resources more effectively and enhance the regulatory protections and outcomes.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000292"></a>Given the wide range of comments here, I will take the amendments in turn. The Committee will note that the duty is to secure that unnecessary burdens are not imposed or maintained. That requires a process of identification and planned action, and it is for the regulator, following a review of the burdens that it imposes, to determine those that are unnecessary. As set out in Clause 68(2), where it is practicable and proportionate to do so, the regulator must remove those burdens.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000293"></a>Amendments Nos. 180 and 181 would insert into the duty wording that would focus it on reviewing functions rather than on removing burdens. We accept that the duty should not require regulators to undertake an immediate review of all their functions nor to engage in endless detailed reviews of them. Nevertheless, we think that the impact of burdens on the regulator should be assessed on an ongoing basis. The aim is to require a meaningful review within reasonable time scales, and we will consider that part of the amendment. However, we feel that allowing the regulators to review, with a view to securing that unnecessary burdens are neither imposed nor maintained, would significantly dilute the duty and would not achieve the Government&#146;s aim of better regulation. While that is the term of the duty to which Ofcom is subject, we are not here drafting a duty for Ofcom or indeed only for economic regulators, but rather one that would be applied to a diverse range of regulators. In light of that, I ask my noble friend to withdraw the amendment so that we may return to it on Report.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC604"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC604</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000294"></a>Clause 68(2) recognises that there might be legitimate reasons not to remove unnecessary burdens where it would be disproportionate or impractical. That provides a safeguard, which regulators asked for during our consultation with them, that unnecessary burdens could be maintained if it was not practical or the cost or effort would be disproportionate to remove them.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000295"></a>Amendments Nos. 182 to 184 would broaden that significantly to allow new unnecessary burdens to be imposed if not doing so would be impracticable or disproportionate. That is not necessary and would significantly widen the exemption to the duty. We considered it unattractive to specifically authorise the imposition of unnecessary burdens by regulators in the Bill. Again, I hope that will provide a basis for my noble friend to consider not moving these amendments.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000296"></a>Amendment No. 185 seeks to establish who determines what is an unnecessary burden. I have already said that it is for the regulator, following the review of the burdens it imposes, to determine what is unnecessary. That is clear from the current provisions. I hope that my noble friend will agree that the regulator must always have regard to its other statutory duties and consequently will understand that we do not feel that it is necessary to state that fact here.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000297"></a>With regard to the point made by my noble friend Lord Borrie about Ofgem, we are currently in discussion with it on ways in which its function might potentially sensibly be excluded from application of the duty where it has no discretion but to impose the burden.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000298"></a>Additionally, the guide to the Bill provides examples of what might be considered unnecessary, and it is intended that that will remain in the published guidance. What is necessary or unnecessary will be specific to the circumstances, and it would not be helpful or appropriate to seek to specify this matter in the Bill. However, we are willing to consider clarifying that it is the regulator who decides what is unnecessary following a review of its functions, and I hope that that will enable my noble friend to consider mot moving this amendment.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000299"></a>The aim of Clause 68(3) to (6) is to provide transparency. The Bill has no other enforcement mechanism; action is leveraged by way of transparency. The provisions in the Bill require a regulator to whom the duty has been applied to publish a statement, as soon as is reasonably practicable, setting out what it proposes to do in the following 12 months about any unnecessary burdens that have been identified. Subsequent annual statements should also report on what has been done in the previous 12 months in connection with any unnecessary burdens that were identified on the previous statement, and should explain why a burden that is unnecessary has not been removed. Thus the report should look forward, as well as back to what has been done.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000300"></a>My noble friend&#146;s Amendments Nos. 186 to 188 would dilute those reporting provisions by removing, first, the requirement to report on what has been done by the regulator since the previous statement and, secondly, the requirement to explain why unnecessary burdens have been maintained where it would have been impracticable or disproportionate to remove them. That would compromise regulatory accountability.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC605"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC605</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000301"></a>Amendments Nos. 189 and 190 would introduce the ability to revise a statement in the period to which it applies. Although it may be unpalatable for a regulator to report that progress has been less than expected, we believe that such transparency is essential. Allowing regulators to produce a revised statement part-way through the year could effectively allow inconvenient goal posts to be shifted.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000302"></a>We acknowledge that the Bill requires regulators to have regard to the statement throughout the period to which it relates. If the regulatory environment changes during that period, they will be able to take that into account in their statement. The extent to which they justifiably depart from the statement can be reported in the next statement.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000303"></a>The Bill allows regulators to publish a single statement every 12 months in the manner that is most appropriate to them; for example, in annual reports. I trust that the Committee agrees that there is nothing to be gained from requiring a duplication of statements, especially from those regulators that already produce annual reports about their regulatory improvements.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000304"></a>My noble friend Lord Berkeley, in his Amendment No. 191, seeks to exclude a number of economic regulators from having the duty applied to them at all, ever. I thank my noble friend for the opportunity to say what we believe this part should not capture. Some regulators&#151;in particular the Office of Fair Trading, the Competition Commission and some economic regulators&#151;have expressed concern that the potential application of the duty to some of their regulatory functions might undermine their effectiveness.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000305"></a>Let me assure them that we do not intend the power to be exercised over their competition functions in a way that would give scope to undermine or second-guess their decisions in competition and merger cases. Consequently, we do not see a case to apply the duty to the Competition Commission. However, the clause provides an avenue for implementing a recommendation made by the Select Committee in its recent report on economic regulators that:</p>
<ul><a name="080206107000456"></a>&#147;economic regulators be statutorily required to facilitate the competitiveness of UK firms by ... removing regulatory burdens from firms wherever possible&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000306"></a>I am very sympathetic to the view expressed by my noble friend Lord Berkeley about the perceived infringement of regulatory independence, should a Minister decide to apply the duty to those regulators listed in the amendment. The power does not allow a Minister to direct the operational decisions of a regulator; it only allows a Minister to require the regulator to conduct a review of the burdens that it imposes in exercising the regulatory functions listed in the order, and to act on the findings of the review. Nevertheless, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Borrie for his suggestion that we apply the duty in Part 4 to economic regulators in the Bill. That will be one way to address the concern about independence. We would like to take that point away and consider it. I suggest to the Committee that we come back to it on Report.</p>

On a point of clarification, my amendment would not exclude the five regulators completely from this section; it would exclude them from the involvement of a Minister of the Crown giving instructions or directions. That is because when the Government have financed an investment subject to  a regulatory decision&#151;nothing to do with competition&#151;it could be seen to be compromising the independence of the regulator if the Government are not satisfied and use the imposition of the duty as a threat. That is the reason: I am not looking to have them removed completely, only to remove the government involvement in Clause 69.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000309"></a>I refer to Amendment No. 191A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, which would exclude local authorities from ever having to have that duty applied to them. The Government&#146;s view is that the duty should be able to be applied to any person carrying out a regulatory function where it would further the better regulation agenda to do so. We are not convinced that local authorities should be exempt from even the potential application of the duty for all time. Although we accept that local authorities are already subject to overview, as LACORS suggests in its briefing, the duty, which is specifically targeted at the removal of unnecessary burdens, could provide some additional focus. In his review, Hampton established that around 80 per cent of regulatory inspections are carried out by local authorities, and are a source of significant irritation to businesses.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000310"></a>The Committee need only refer to Schedule 3 to see the numerous and diverse Acts of Parliament already referred to that local authorities enforce. It is possible that unnecessary burdens result from local authority regulatory activities and, on that basis, I hope that the Committee agree that we would not want to give the impression that this part has no relevance. In the light of that, I hope that my noble friend will be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000313"></a>A couple of points that she made struck me. More than once she mentioned that it is for the regulator to determine what constitutes an &#147;unnecessary burden&#148;.

When the regulator is under a duty that is put in this bold and bald way in Clause 68, it is a matter of concern. I said that Clause 68 as it stands is not based on the model of Section 6 of the Telecommunications Act, despite what the guidance says, because it talks about Ofcom having a duty to &#147;review&#148; not &#147;remove&#148; unnecessary burdens. That is a different matter. Ofcom in particular will notice the difference.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000314"></a>Although assurances from Ministers are often all that a person moving an amendment from whatever part of the Committee can reasonably expect, the assurance of my noble friend that competition powers were not intended to be got at here is all very well; but what is that worth when one of the regulators determines to investigate and there is the possibility of some huge fine involving millions that can be 10 per cent of turnover? The businessman will not be much impressed by an assurance by the Minister on what the clause was intended to mean if he can arguably argue in court that &#147;unnecessary burdens&#148; include the unnecessary way in which he has been treated by a competition authority and it is not possible by ministerial assurances for the legislation to be altered or to be interpreted solely in that way when it gets before a court in judicial review proceedings.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000327"></a>My amendment seeks to replace Clause 71, which currently reads:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000434"></a>&#147;This Act extends to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000385"></a>To the non-legal reader, that is a travesty of the reality: it flatters to deceive. It is hung around the legal distinction between extent and application&#151;something with which Sir Humphrey Appleby would have been pleased to bemuse the luckless Jim Hacker with in the television series. That it is extremely difficult is reflected in the fact that it takes up a page and a half&#151;paragraphs 12 to 19 inclusive&#151;of the Explanatory Notes. Even there, the drafting is extraordinarily obscure in that paragraph 17 says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000435"></a>&#147;Parts 2 to 4 apply in Scotland but only in respect of reserved matters&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000386"></a>and paragraph 19 says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000436"></a>&#147;Parts 2 to 3 apply in Northern Ireland but not in respect of transferred matters&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000387"></a>It would be very difficult to find a way to make that harder to understand. However, these Explanatory Notes will disappear and we will be left only with the Bill. Therefore, my amendment seeks to reflect in the Bill what is in the Explanatory Notes by making it clear that only Part 5&#151;itself a very slim part of four short clauses&#151;applies to the United Kingdom as a whole. This is not just about appearances or the niceties of parliamentary draftsmen; I wish that it were. It is about the candour of the Government&#146;s approach.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000328"></a>The Bill claims to be about local better regulation but nowhere have the Government accepted that. In fact, a proper and more accurate title for the Bill would probably be &#147;The England and Wales Local Better Regulation Bill&#148;.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000329"></a>If they do their job properly, the bulk of the work for LBROs will be on devolved or transferred matters. As such, we do not have a UK-wide level better regulatory playing field; we have potentially three different levels of better regulation. I have looked in vain for any acknowledgement of this grey weakness by the Government. Far from it&#151;in fact, rather the reverse. On 28 November in our Second Reading debate, the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000437"></a>&#147;Local authority enforcers sit at the centre of a system that has grown up over decades within a framework set by multiple government departments, initiatives and regulators. It is a very complex system and, because of this very complexity, it has not always been as effective as it might have been. Parts 1 and 2 of the Bill aim to strike a careful balance by ensuring that the legitimate expectations of business are met within the system while at the same time ensuring that local authorities retain the freedom and flexibility that they need to get on with doing their job effectively&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/11/07; col. 1239.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000388"></a>To make this claim without mentioning the exclusion of Scotland and Northern Ireland is extraordinary and, indeed, it strikes at the strategic purpose of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000330"></a>Worse still, I am afraid that the Government know that that is the case. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, and I have had discussions in this room about a parallel example, which we already have, of how the absence of a UK-wide level playing field can lead to difficulties. He and I discussed at some length the  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC609"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC609</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issue of charity law. Charity law is a devolved, &#147;not reserved&#148; matter. The Charities Act 2006 is administered in England and Wales by the Charity Commission but there is a separate charities Act for Scotland, which is administered by the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator&#151;OSCR. These two authorities are now producing different regulations for England, Wales and Scotland. This has posed enormous problems for national charities. After some considerable discussion, the noble Lord was prepared to write to me, which he did on 17 December, placing a copy in the Library. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080206107000438"></a>&#147;However, the introduction of a new regulator in Scotland has created an additional burden that did not exist before for charities operating there, and whilst the legal frameworks are similar, the different Parliamentary routes have inevitably led to some differences&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080206107000331"></a>We are heading for precisely the same result here. We have no co-ordination, leading to extra administrative burdens on firms which are operating on a UK-wide basis.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000332"></a>So what solution do I see? Some time ago, when we discussed Clause 12, the possibility was raised of the LBRO building relationships with regulators through Memorandums of Understanding. I hope that we can find a way for relationships with Scotland and Northern Ireland to be dealt with in this way. I would like the Government to say that they are not going to introduce these provisions until they have reached agreement with the Scottish and Northern Ireland regulators so that we can have a level playing field. Without that, a large measure of the grand strategic design that the Government have set out for the Bill will fail because they have not thought through how it will work in a devolved structure.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000333"></a>If the Government are not going to do that, let us at least have candour and honesty about how and where the Bill will apply and how it will operate. This is half a loaf only but it is better than the present situation, when we are being almost economical with the actuality. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000334"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="080206107000550"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> I support my noble friend&#146;s amendment. To the lay businessman, the obvious place to look in an Act of Parliament to see whether it applies to him, at least by virtue of geography, is in the section entitled &#147;Extent&#148;. Clause 71 suggests that the Bill applies uniformly across the whole of the United Kingdom. As my noble friend said, that is misleading.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000335"></a><b><a name="80206-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080206107000551"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I should not be surprised that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, has raised this point and we are grateful to him for doing so.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000336"></a>The stakes have been raised too high over this issue, so let me explain what we are doing. Part 1 of the Bill applies only to England and Wales. This is achieved by the definition of &#147;local authority&#148; in Clause 3. Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill apply to England and Wales in respect of all matters, including matters for which Welsh Ministers have responsibility; they apply to Scotland in respect of matters that are  


<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC610"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column GC610</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reserved; and to Northern Ireland in respect of matters that are not transferred. The extent of the Bill as a whole, as provided in Clause 71, is England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000337"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, knows better than me that the terms &#147;Extent&#148;, referred to in Clause 71, and &#147;Application&#148; have different legal meanings. Let me explain what those meanings are. &#147;Extent&#148; relates to the jurisdictional reach of legislation; &#147;application&#148; relates to its geographical reach. All parts of the Bill must extend to all jurisdictions&#151;England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland&#151;although the parts apply differentially throughout the United Kingdom. For example, while Part 1 does not apply except in England and Wales, it must extend to Scotland and Northern Ireland because the LBRO, which has functions in relation to Scotland and Northern Ireland under Part 2, is subject to certain general duties and obligations under some provisions in Part 1. I refer the Committee to Clauses 13 and 14.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000338"></a>The application of each part of the Bill is set out. In Part 1, Clause 3 defines a local authority in England and Wales; in Part 2, Clause 21, which deals with the definition of &#147;local authority&#148;, includes a local authority in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; in Part 3, Clauses 54 and 55 exclude Scottish devolved and Northern Ireland transferred functions; and in Part 4, Clause 60 does not apply to Scotland in respect of devolved, and to Northern Ireland in respect of transferred functions. It does not require a genius to realise that the Bill therefore extends to all the countries of the United Kingdom, but its application is limited to different parts of the United Kingdom depending on which part of the Bill we are talking about. I do not think that anyone who will have to use the Bill will be fooled into thinking, as has been suggested, that because Clause 71 puts this as it does that it somehow applies in every regard and every respect to all parts of the United Kingdom. Those who study and know the Bill will surely realise, simply from looking at the clauses to which I have referred, what we mean by Clause 71.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000339"></a>Let me assure the Committee that it is essential that the Bill should extend legally to all UK jurisdictions, even though the application of Part 1 is restricted to England and Wales. The Bill is drafted in a way that reflects and respects the devolution settlement. I cannot help but think that somewhere in the amendment is an element of not liking the devolution settlement very much&#151;the settlement that concerned Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. I should say straightaway that I know the noble Lords, Lord Hodgson and Lord De Mauley, are trying only to make life easier for those who have to use the Bill, but I argue that that is clear from the Bill itself and that nothing in Clause 71 is in any way false, which seems to be what the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, suggested.</p>

I made no reference at all to anything to do with the Scottish Parliament or, indeed, the Northern Ireland Assembly; that is not part of what I am trying to do. I am trying to clarify the Bill and the fact that the Minister had to read an extensive and quite confusing brief to explain how the Bill applied shows that it is not easy to understand. If he could see the point that I was driving at, which is to make a relatively short amendment to Clause 71, clarity could be achieved not only for the legal cognoscenti but for someone looking at the Bill as a layman. At the moment, the clause is very confusing for the layman. I am extremely disappointed that he could not even bring himself to accept that. A lot more could have been done to make this particular law accessible and understandable.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000349"></a>If Her Majesty&#146;s Government are hell bent on pursuing the Bill, it is essential that the Local Better Regulation Office and all that goes with it should start out as a pilot scheme that can be reviewed and then dissolved if the worst fears of many noble Lords turn out to be true. To create an inefficient and ineffective body is dangerous enough, but to sustain it

However, if the Local Better Regulation Office surprises us all, it can continue in its good work of better regulation, something we are desperately in need of and which of course we support. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080206107000351"></a>It will come as no surprise to noble Lords that we on these Benches have consistently argued for sunset clauses in legislation and regulations.

I have championed them in the past and I will do so in the future. It is a provision that we look at case by case. Nevertheless, I do not think that such a clause would be applicable here. Sunset clauses are for where legislation includes proposals designed to address time-limited issues where specific requirements might become out of date, and where there is a focus on a certain set of measures based on market conditions that might change as those markets develop. Neither of those applies here.</p>

<a name="80206-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080206107000353"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, has said, the purpose of the Bill is to create certainty and consistency, and to reduce regulatory burdens. A sunset clause that is intended to create less regulation over a period of time would have the opposite effect in this case. The Bill is intended to deliver benefits to business and we believe that it will do so. A sunset clause would create huge uncertainty, and indeed would be resisted by business, as we have been told repeatedly by representatives. However, I assure the noble Baroness that we understand the intention behind the proposal, which is to create a requirement to review whether the legislation is achieving its objectives. I should like to reassure her that the Bill has ample provision for ongoing review of the way in which it will be implemented.</p>

As we discussed earlier today, Part 3 places a duty on the Minister to make an order to conduct a post-implementation review within three years. Additionally, Clause 64 in Part 3 is a suspension clause that enables a Minister making an order to confer sanctioning powers on a regulator to be able to direct it, not to issue any further sanctions where there is clear evidence that that regulator has persistently failed to act in accordance with its duties

We are very worried that this is yet one more layer. No consolidation has taken place.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="08020688000095"></a><b><a name="80206-wms0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08020688000167"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Tom Harris) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="08020688000096"></a>On the 22 February 2005 the then Secretary of State for Transport (the right honourable Member for Edinburgh South West, Alistair Darling) introduced a hybrid Bill to provide for the construction, maintenance and operation of Crossrail. At this time, directions were also issued for the safeguarding of the main Crossrail route, from Maidenhead to Shenfield and from Whitechapel to Abbey Wood, for the associated construction worksites, and for the possible extension of Crossrail from Abbey Wood to Hoo Junction. This safeguarding protects the route from any conflicting developments which could interfere with the construction or operation of Crossrail.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="08020688000097"></a>As a result of negotiations with affected parties and the development of engineering design works, there have been changes to the land needed for the construction and operation of Crossrail. This means that some land that has been safeguarded will no longer be needed, while we are proposing to use other sections of land that are not currently safeguarded. Accordingly, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has issued revised safeguarding directions for the main route that reflect these changes.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="08020688000098"></a>In July 2005, the department consulted on the possibility of safeguarding land between Maidenhead and Reading West Junction, which would protect land potentially required, should it be decided to extend Crossrail services to Reading. The department also consulted on updating the safeguarding directions in the Abbey Wood to Hoo Junction corridor, to allow for additional works considered necessary for an extension of Crossrail services to Ebbsfleet. A decision was deferred following an instruction by the House to the Select Committee, where it considered appropriate, to consider any petitions on the extension of Crossrail to Reading (and Ebbsfleet) and to report to the House whether there was a case for the extension to be made by an order under the Transport and Works Act 1992. The committee heard some evidence but did not make any recommendation on these matters in its Special Report, published on 23 October 2007.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="08020688000099"></a>I have now decided to safeguard additional land between Maidenhead and Reading. While I am clear that Crossrail services will terminate at Maidenhead and have no plans to extend them to Reading, this measure gives the flexibility to be able to extend Crossrail in the future, should there be a business case. This safeguarding of the route would also protect the possibility of undertaking electrification works on the route to Reading, even without the extension of Crossrail. Again, this keeps this option available should a decision be taken to electrify the railway beyond Maidenhead.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_86"></a><a name="08020688000100"></a>There is no need for works powers to extend to Reading to be included in the Crossrail Bill, which would seriously delay the passage of the Bill through Parliament. If such powers were needed these could

There is also sensible advance planning through designing station improvement works at both Reading and Maidenhead to allow for the possibility of the future extension of Crossrail services.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a><a name="08020688000101"></a>The next step on safeguarding is to consult Network Rail on which sites should be protected if any works were to be undertaken on the safeguarded route.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0001.htm_para88"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a><a name="08020688000102"></a>The department is still considering updating the safeguarded route to Ebbsfleet and will continue to discuss this matter with Cross London Rail Links and the relevant local authorities further. The department will make an announcement regarding this in due course.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a><a name="08020688000104"></a>The Government will today&#151;Wednesday 6 February 2008&#151;publish their initial response to the public consultation on UK Strategic Export Controls.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a><a name="08020688000105"></a>On Monday 18 June 2007, I announced to the House the launch of a public consultation on strategic export controls. In this consultation, the Government sought views both on the controls they introduced in 2004 under the Export Control Act 2002&#151;to establish whether they are having the intended effect without imposing unnecessary or disproportionate burdens on business&#151;and on a range of options for further change.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a><a name="08020688000106"></a>Prior to the closure of the consultation period on 30 September 2007, the Government received a total of 23 substantive responses from a range of groups, including industry and non-governmental organisations, and over 5,000 brief emails and letters. These have now been published on the BERR website at <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/europeandtrade/strategic-export-control/legislation/export-control-act-2002/review/index.html">www.berr.gov.uk/europeandtrade/strategic-export-control/legislation/export-control-act-2002/review/index.html</a>.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a><a name="08020688000107"></a>Since the public consultation period closed, the Government have been analysing the responses and considering the case for change. The initial response commits the Government to introduce change in a number of areas of significant concern. Notably it puts into action the commitment announced by the Prime Minister, in his Mansion House Speech on  12 November 2007, to extend export laws to control brokering and trafficking of small arms by UK persons anywhere in the world and to give consideration to extending these controls to cover other weapons of concern.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a><a name="08020688000108"></a>The initial response also commits the Government to:</p>
extend the coverage of extra-territorial trade controls to include trading in MANPADs (ie portable weapons designed to fire missiles at aircraft) and those cluster munitions which cause

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a><a name="08020688000109"></a>The Government are currently undertaking further research and consultation with a view to reaching an agreement on some of the other change options that have been proposed. We hope to publish a further response to the change proposal in spring 2008.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="08020688000110"></a>Once the Government have finalised their position, they will aim to introduce the new legislation in three stages. The addition of sting sticks to the UK list of torture equipment is relatively straightforward to implement; this will be our first priority and we will act with immediacy. In the next stage we will then focus on the more complex changes to the controls on small arms, MANPADs and cluster munitions, so that change in these areas of high concern is also implemented speedily. In the final stage, the Government will introduce any further changes that may be necessary following further consideration, for example the potential extension of extraterritorial trade controls beyond small arms, to other types of weapons; the case for strengthening of controls on the export of non-controlled equipment for military end use in destinations of concern and introducing a register of traders in military equipment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="08020688000111"></a><b><a name="80206-wms0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="08020688000169"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office &amp; Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Lord Jones of Birmingham):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Consumer Affairs (Gareth Thomas) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a><a name="08020688000112"></a>The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) is the UK&#146;s independent regulator and standard setter for accounting, auditing and the actuarial profession. The FRC&#146;s remit was expanded in 2004 as a result of the Government&#146;s review of audit and accounting regulation, and again in 2006 to include actuarial standards and regulation.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a><a name="08020688000113"></a>The Government believe the FRC has adapted well to its new responsibilities, and in particular welcome the recent changes it has made to its governance arrangements to increase its effectiveness and efficiency. The Government remain strongly supportive of the FRC. The FRC&#146;s operating bodies continue to exercise functions delegated to them by the Secretary of State, and indeed the Secretary of State is in the process of updating the delegation of functions concerning audit regulation in line with the Companies Act 2006 and the Audit Directive.</p>




<notus-date day="6" month="2" year="2008" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS92"></a><b>6 Feb 2008 : Column WS92</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a><a name="08020688000114"></a>Corporate reporting and governance in the UK are widely recognised domestically and internationally as being of a very high standard generally. The FRC&#146;s integrated and market-led approach to regulation underpins these standards. This approach continues to receive strong support from companies, investors, the accountancy profession and other stakeholders.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_99"></a><a name="08020688000115"></a>For many years the Government contributed one-third of the FRC&#146;s core operating costs for its responsibilities for accounting, auditing and corporate governance. However, this position is not consistent with the funding arrangements for other similar regulatory bodies such as the Financial Services Authority and the Pensions Regulator, or with funding for the FRC&#146;s actuarial regulation. Nor does it sit well with the FRC&#146;s new board, which is now composed largely of private sector rather than ministerial appointees. The Government have therefore concluded that, as a market-led regulator, the FRC should in future be funded largely by market participants.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_100"></a><a name="08020688000116"></a>The FRC will consult market participants on the options for new funding arrangements. In order to allow an orderly transition to stable, new, long-term funding arrangements, the Government have confirmed that they will continue to make a substantial contribution to the FRC&#146;s costs for at least the 2008-09 financial year.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_101"></a><a name="08020688000118"></a>Over the next year, the Government will deliver the biggest shake-up of the immigration system for over 45 years. As part of these reforms I am today laying the first of a series of new immigration rules implementing the points-based system (PBS). The PBS will build on a package of measures already being introduced to deliver our four objectives of protection, prevention, accountability and compassion.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_102"></a><a name="08020688000119"></a>Steps to strengthen our border protection will include; checking fingerprints before we issue a visa, screening all travellers against watch-lists and introducing a single border force with police-like powers for frontline staff. The PBS will form part of a robust system that is designed to prevent illegal migration. Associated measures will include big fines for employers who don't make checks and compulsory ID cards for foreign nationals make checks easier. We will continue to welcome those who promise to abide by the rules but we will hold to account those that break the rules, including automatic deportation for those who commit a serious offence.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a><a name="08020688000120"></a>The new rules for the points system strengthen our power to automatically refuse applications in which deception is used. Those who breach our immigration laws will be barred from returning to the UK for a fixed period of up to 10 years. The new rules also begin to implement the PBS Tier 1 (General) route for highly skilled migrants.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a><a name="08020688000121"></a>Separately from the PBS changes, we are laying today amendments to the immigration rules that will restrict migrants in certain circumstances from taking employment as a doctor in training.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_106"></a><a name="08020688000123"></a>The highly skilled tier will let Britain recruit some of the most successful people in the world. At the same time, we are toughening the immigration rules to make it easier to keep out migrants who we do not want. All PBS migrants will need to provide original documents to prove that they are entitled to the points they claim. Where we have any suspicions about the documents, we will conduct rigorous checks and will disregard any document that we cannot verify. Any application in which deception is used will be refused automatically.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a><a name="08020688000124"></a>Under the new rules, those who try to cheat their way into Britain by lying in their immigration applications will automatically be refused. Those who breach our immigration laws will be barred from returning to the UK for a fixed period of up to 10 years. This sends out the message that, although we welcome highly skilled migrants who wish to contribute to our society, we will not tolerate those who do not play by the rules.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="08020688000125"></a>Anyone who has used deception when applying for a visa will have any future applications to come here refused for 10 years. Anyone who has used deception in any other application, or committed any other breach of the rules, will be refused permission to come back for the following periods, depending on how they left the UK after doing what they did:</p>
ten years if they were removed or deported;five years if they left voluntarily at public expense (eg through an assisted voluntary return); orone year if they left voluntarily at their own expense.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="08020688000126"></a>Where migrants have left the UK at public expense, we will also require them to repay the cost of their departure if they want to return, once we have introduced primary legislation that allows us to do so.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a><a name="08020688000128"></a>We are implementing the PBS Tier 1 (General) route for highly skilled migrants, and their dependants. The route will be open to migrants applying in-country from 29 February 2008; and open to applicants applying overseas in India from 1 April 2008. The route will be opened to all applicants applying overseas by the summer. Tier 1 (General) builds upon the success of the highly skilled migrant programme (HSMP) in attracting and retaining the most talented migrants who have the most to contribute economically.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_114"></a><a name="08020688000131"></a>The points-based system will be simpler, with clearer and more consistent outcomes for all parties. We are laying immigration rules today that will support those objectives by:</p>
simplifying the process for introducing specified application forms and procedures for applications or claims in connection with immigration.amending the rules for indefinite leave to remain as a work permit holder to allow time spent as a highly skilled migrant or PBS Tier 1 (General) to count towards the current five-year qualifying period for settlement. This will correct an inconsistency in the immigration rules whereby time spent as a work permit holder can count towards an application for indefinite leave to remain as a highly skilled migrant, but time spent as a highly skilled migrant does not count towards an application for indefinite leave to remain as a work permit holder.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_126"></a><a name="08020688000145"></a>The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has today announced the end of its immediate requirement for testing on live goats as part of its hyperbaric research in support of the MoD's submarine escape rescue and abandonment system (SMERAS).</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_127"></a><a name="08020688000146"></a>This research programme has been aimed at improving the accuracy of the information relating to the likely risk of the incidence of decompression illness following escape from a submerged submarine in varying depths and internal submarine pressures. Information obtained from these trials has been used to provide advice to submarine crews in the event of early abandonment of a disabled submerged submarine. This information enables the crew to make an informed judgement of the relative risks of delaying abandonment until rescue

The welfare of its personnel is paramount to the MoD and this advice forms an integral part of MoD's duty of care to its submarine staff.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_128"></a><a name="08020688000147"></a>The MoD only conducts animal testing where absolutely necessary and all work involving animals is carried out in strict accordance with the requirements of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Therefore, all testing using animals is subject to regular review to assess the need to continue with such work.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_129"></a><a name="08020688000148"></a>The MoD has recently reviewed the requirement for further such hyperbaric research. The testing programme was aimed at improving the accuracy of the information relating to the likely probability and consequence of decompression illness following escape from a submerged submarine in varying depths and internal submarine pressures. This requirement has now been achieved, and the review has concluded that the remaining associated areas of uncertainty in submarine escape and rescue relate to events that are considered highly unlikely, and do not therefore need to be addressed by means of animal testing. The MoD has endorsed these recommendations and as a result, it has no immediate need to continue animal testing of this type.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_7"></a>
<a name="08020688000149"></a><b><a name="80206-wms0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="08020688000173"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Ruth Kelly) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_130"></a><a name="08020688000150"></a>As part of the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, I was able to agree a funding settlement with the Mayor of London for Transport for London (TfL) through to 2017-18. This settlement included details of funding for Crossrail and provision for costs relating to Metronet in the light of its move into administration.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_131"></a><a name="08020688000151"></a>This 10-year funding settlement underlines the Government&#146;s commitment to deliver the transport investment central to our continued growth and prosperity. It carries forward our commitment to modernising and extending the capital's public transport system, including the upgrade of the London Underground. It sustains our support for transport projects central to our preparation for the Olympics in 2012. And it supports the delivery of Crossrail. I am taking this opportunity to place copies of letters setting out details of the TfL settlement in full in the Library of the House and on my department&#146;s website.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_132"></a><a name="08020688000152"></a>I can set out these details now because those elements of the settlement that relate to Metronet are no longer commercially sensitive. As the House will know, in 2003, the Metronet companies (Metronet Rail BCV Ltd and Metronet Rail SSL Ltd) entered into public-private partnership (PPP) contracts with London Underground Ltd (LUL), which is now a subsidiary of TfL. Under the PPP agreements, the Metronet companies were responsible for the maintenance, renewal and upgrade of discrete parts of LUL&#146;s infrastructure. LUL remains responsible, in the public sector, for delivering services to customers.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_133"></a><a name="08020688000153"></a>The PPP contractual arrangements were accompanied by put option agreements, whereby LUL could be required to purchase Metronet&#146;s debt six months after any defined &#147;insolvency event&#148;. This borrowing was undertaken to finance the maintenance and renewal of the Tube network under the PPP contracts, and was already reflected in planned public spending.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_134"></a><a name="08020688000154"></a>In advance of the entry into the PPP contracts, the Transport Secretary at the time wrote on 7 March 2003 to the providers of finance of Metronet stating:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08020688000164"></a>&#147;The Secretary of State will take into account, amongst other factors, all the obligations of LUL under any PPP contracts (including obligations under the Put Option Agreement or the Stand Still Agreement) in considering and setting transport grant for the GLA under section 101 of the GLA Act, or in making grants to LRT under Section 12 of the LRT Act.&#148;</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_135"></a><a name="08020688000155"></a>This letter of comfort was notified to Parliament as a contingent liability, and the existence of that letter of comfort has been recorded in successive resource accounts for the Department for Transport, without quantification of the amount in question.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_136"></a><a name="08020688000156"></a>On 18 July 2007, the Metronet companies entered into PPP administration, following a lengthy period of poor performance which led to their insolvency. This constituted an &#147;insolvency event&#148; for the purposes of the put option agreements.</p>

<a name="80206-wms0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_137"></a><a name="08020688000157"></a>The put options were exercised yesterday (5 February), and I have today been advised by TfL that all the conditions for their exercise have been met.  Having regard to the commitments in my predecessor&#146;s letter of March 2003 and to the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review, I will make available to the GLA a grant under Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003 of &#163;1.7 billion specifically for the use of LUL for the payment of the put option price.</p>

In addition to the sums associated with the put option, this funding provides:</p>
additional grant payments to replace planned Metronet borrowing up to 2010&#151;these borrowings were already provided for in planned public expenditure aggregates and so the additional grant does not involve any net increase in public expenditure; and additional grant payments to give TfL short-term flexibility while the costs associated with Metronet's administration remain uncertain.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_140"></a><a name="08020688000160"></a>The settlement gives London Underground the resources needed to manage Metronet&#146;s administration, and support moving toward a more stable long-term footing and continue the work to maintain, renew and upgrade the Underground.</p>

The study was commissioned later following growing interest within the road freight industry, elsewhere in Europe, and by the European Commission who are considering these vehicles as part of the Community&#146;s Freight Transport Logistics Action Plan to improve the efficiency of transport and logistics.</p>

Awards are based on the percentage degree of disablement due to service, which is assessed by comparing the condition of the claimant with a normal healthy person of the same age and sex. In cases where the evidence shows that an individual's degree of disablement due to service has changed since the last assessment was made, the assessment may be revised on review and the pension rate changed as appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="08020689000060"></a>The Service Personnel and Veterans Agency (formed 1 April 2007), which is responsible for making this decision, strives to ensure that all decisions made are in accordance with the rules of the scheme and in accordance with the evidence. It is with regret that not all the correct procedures were followed in this case. In light of that error, any case where a reduction in war pension assessment is proposed is now subject to a further check to confirm that the new decision is appropriately supported by the rules and in line with the evidence before the reduction is implemented.</p>

I have every confidence in the PSNI's ability to combat the threat posed by these individuals.

Under the Government's current climate change guidance for future sea level rise the Thames Barrier, with some modification, may even continue to provide protection to London through to the end of the century.</p>
