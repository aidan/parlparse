I am sure that that pleased everyone in the House and that they thoroughly understood what he was talking about. May I put a simpler equation to him? If the banks, which are supposed to be lending and have been promised to lend, equal all the money that has gone in, rightly, to try to help them to do so, but they still do not lend, will my noble friend assure us that his policy of an arm&#146;s-length relationship with the banks will change and that he will scrap that arm&#146;s-length policy, or at least moderate it, and see that they do lend?</p>

He brings considerable experience to these issues and I always welcome his questions, as indeed I welcome those of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins; they are a truly impressive duo. The negotiated lending commitments with the Lloyds Banking Group and the Royal Bank of Scotland have reached totals of &#163;48 billion of new and additional loan commitments. After careful scrutiny of the plans of those banks and assurances from them on the basis of their economic forecasts for the next 12 to 24 months, and having regard to prudent lending criteria that they are entirely achievable goals, those banks will report to the Treasury on a monthly basis, and we will submit an annual report to Parliament on those lending commitments. All parties entered into them on the basis that they believed they were achievable.</p>

I did, however, come prepared, because there are different formulations of this equation. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is absolutely correct that in previous days it was expressed as MV=PT. However, in more recent economic textbooks, I am told, it is now expressed as MV=PY. The basic concept remains the same.</p>

Perhaps he will clear up a confusion in my mind. In his speech yesterday, the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform said that the taking of up to a 35 per cent share by the private sector would still ensure that the Royal Mail remains in public ownership. How can the Royal Mail remain in public ownership when the private sector has 35 per cent, whereas banks appear not to be in public ownership when the state has significantly greater than two-thirds of the shareholding?</p>

Clearly, a number of banks became substantially overleveraged throughout the world. One has to have regard to the quality of the assets and the nature of the funding. The approach to gearing levels and leverage must be particular to the specifics of the institution, rather than a generic statement that a certain figure is either appropriate or a maximum acceptable level. I look to the Financial Services Authority and other global regulatory bodies to provide more guidance on leverage levels.</p>

That is the combination we have sought to achieve. I believe I can state with confidence that UK banks, which have already increased their lending over the past 12 months, will further increase that lending over the next 12 months because they can do so from a very confident background.</p>

But the support we have provided in terms of capitalisation, funding and liquidity puts British banks among the best capitalised in the world and the most effectively positioned to provide their critical economic function in supporting British jobs, British families and individuals in the pursuit of their goals and objectives.</p>

It is very encouraging to see that LIBOR, which at one stage was somewhat isolated from the base rate, has come down as we expected. We have grounds for some encouragement in the way in which that trend is developing.</p>

We are working to establish an energy services development network to promote the energy services market in this sector. We are also working with Business in the Community and the Small Business Consortium to consider what further steps the Government can take, and they will be making their recommendations later in the spring.</p>

Around 20 per cent of our energy is consumed in industrial buildings owned by the SME sector. The Government used to have a good scheme which allowed insulation and other energy-saving measures to be carried out in the sector but that disappeared several years ago. Will they introduce a scheme similar to CERT, which covers domestic dwellings, so that SMEs can play their full part in saving energy in the economy?</p>

The scheme to which he refers was very small indeed: my understanding is that between 1994 and 2000 it raised about &#163;5 million to &#163;10 million to help small businesses. However, CERT is having a huge impact on domestic households, and it should be remembered that many SMEs actually operate from domestic premises. The support which we think it is better to focus on is the excellent advice given by the Carbon Trust, which also runs a loan scheme which has proved to be successful, while the enhanced capital allowance scheme is also available to small businesses. We think that that is the best way to provide support for these companies.</p>

However, the challenges for small and medium-sized businesses in this country are now so urgent that perhaps I may ask the Minister whether he will have a good look at the study which the Conservatives put into the plan for action that is on his table and get the country moving again?</p>

I am surprised to hear that the Government are thought to be cavalier about consultation when my experience is that we consult until the cows come home. We pay careful attention to what the small business sector says to us and we recognise that in the current circumstances it is coming under very great pressure indeed, which is why the Government have taken the action they have. On energy, however, we want to encourage smaller businesses to look at their energy costs. A lot of advice is available. Many energy saving measures cost hardly anything at all for businesses to take up. We will do everything we can to encourage small businesses to take advantage of that advice.</p>

As the noble Lord will know, the global nature of these sites and the ability of users to hide their identities mean that national limits of jurisdiction hold little sway.

On a more serious note, the group is posting messages that identify individual police officers, their families and their addresses, as well as sometimes posting photographs, and is threatening them with violence. Does he agree that this is an unacceptable abuse of freedom of speech and an intolerable attack on front-line police officers and their families? These officers are doing a difficult and dangerous job and this amounts to an undermining of the rule of law in a liberal democracy.</p>

Having reviewed the content of the site, I share my noble friend&#146;s view that it is deeply unacceptable. My understanding is that that particular site was originally a so-called open group, so the volume of members, as he will be aware if he has looked at the site, is of a greater magnitude than that of other comparable groups. We understand that some of the more offensive and racist remarks have been taken down within the site&#146;s conditions of service.

None of its servers is hosted in the United Kingdom and they have no capability in the United Kingdom.

While this particular site borders on the offensive, many other sites show excellent examples of effective self-regulation, notice and takedown, control and self-discipline.

This is a classic example of an area that is far better dealt with on a pan-Europe basis because of the international nature of these sites. There are seven basic principles contained in that document.

Each of these service providers and sites has its own acceptable use policies, but these vary. For example, Yahoo!&#151;a site of which many noble Lords may be aware&#151;has a policy that it describes as recognising dignity in death. For example, when the hanging of Saddam Hussein was available as video material, it did not allow it on its site. By contrast, other sites, which have a freedom of speech principle enshrined in their terms of use, did allow it. These are in part matters of interpretation and in large part the world we are now living in.</p>

Does not the provider have some responsibility in that regard?</p>

There is a degree of policy and legal debate and discussion around what is called the &#147;mere conduit&#148; principle as it applies to service providers specifically and to host sites. In large part, when notification of illegality or offence is received, the host will, as long as it matches either the terms of use or the rules, withdraw the content.

It would not be appropriate for the Government to pre-empt NICE's final guidance to the NHS. Until NICE issues its guidance, decisions on the funding of these drugs must be taken locally.</p>

It is amazing that NICE continues to review these two drugs at such inordinate length, which means that the 1,500 people with advanced stage bowel cancer and the 2,000 with advanced breast cancer&#151;both of which are terminal&#151;are still suffering. Taking that into consideration, does it make sense for the Government, in the past five years, to have funded an increase in clerical staff in the PCTs from 54 million to 115 million? The House will accept that these drugs are expensive, but, after all, do these National Health Service patients not deserve the best? Surely, they can be funded from a reduction in clerical staff in the PCTs.</p>

The noble Lord will appreciate that Tyverb comes under the heading of a very difficult area. If Tyverb were to be considered by NICE under the flexible approach it is now taking to end-of-life drugs, it is still unlikely that it would be recommended under the quality-adjusted life years measurement used by NICE.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="09031163000040"></a>NICE is issuing guidance that Sutent should be available on the NHS to those who have renal cell carcinoma. In the past week, Macmillan Cancer Support has said that this will make an enormous difference to those patients. Every year, 7,000 people are diagnosed with kidney cancer in Britain, and 3,600 of those patients will be eligible to receive Sutent.</p>

Despite that, is it not the case that, if an oncologist can persuade a local health authority or a primary care trust to prescribe one of these drugs for a patient, he or she can do so? Will the Government also confirm that, in the light of their recent decision, in an extreme position any patient wishing to purchase these drugs will not be denied continuing NHS care as a result of doing so?</p>

The timetable outlined by the Secretary of State on 4 November 2008 means not only that we will deal with issuing guidance faster on these drugs, but also that the flexibility referred to by the noble Lord is built into the system.</p>

As I said, my honourable friend the Secretary of State outlined a new appraisals timetable which will mean that, by 2010, the average time taken by NICE to produce draft or final guidance on new cancer drugs will fall well below six months after licensing.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09031163000048"></a>We are determined that the fast-track, single-technology appraisal process will shorten the time taken to bring on new cancer drugs.

In many cases, patients may be quite content to have just a few extra weeks or months of life for some family event they are looking forward to. The drug company that manufactures the drug has offered 12 weeks of treatment free to those patients whom the clinicians think may benefit from it if the Government will take up funding thereafter. If the national institute is right, those patients will be dead in a very short time anyway, so why do the Government not take up the offer of the drug company?</p>

Even if the Government were to take up the offer of the drug company, NICE&#151;this is on the website and in the published draft guidance&#151;estimates that the cost of Tyverb per quality-adjusted life year is around &#163;70,000, compared with the normal NICE threshold of around &#163;30,000. The renal drug Sutent, which NICE has recently recommended, costs around &#163;50,000. The noble Baroness will appreciate that we are talking about very difficult and expensive drugs. The matter is still under consultation. The final decision has not been taken. I am sure that this short debate will be fed into the process. Those are the economics of the drugs.</p>

It is tragic that on the first two occasions when the House has addressed this Bill, we have had to begin proceedings by expressing our condolences in that way. Let us hope that it will not happen again.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09031163000056"></a>I had an opportunity at Second Reading to outline the substance of my amendment. I merely intend to underwrite those remarks by providing your Lordships with a little more detail. In this group of amendments we have Amendment 1 and Amendment 12. It might be helpful to the Committee if I began not at the beginning but at the end, by reading out the text of Amendment 12.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09031163000057"></a>This amendment seeks to amend Section 42(1) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, which refers to the independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. As many of your Lordships are already aware, the subsection reads:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09031163000135"></a>&#147;The functions of the Director shall be exercised by him independently of any other person&#148;.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09031163000058"></a>Amendment 12 seeks to amend Section 42(1) as follows:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09031163000136"></a>&#147;The Director must exercise his functions under the superintendence of the Attorney General for Northern Ireland in relation to devolved matters and the Advocate General for Northern Ireland in relation to retained matters and is subject to any directions given by either of them thereunder, but a failure to comply with this subsection does not affect the validity of anything done by or on behalf of the Director&#148;.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09031163000059"></a>Your Lordships will be familiar with the relationship between the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions in England and Wales and, indeed, at present, in Northern Ireland. This amendment simply mirrors our own constitutional practice. We believe that Section 42(1) needs this amendment because if it were not so, the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland is likely to be exposed to an unacceptable degree of political pressure over at least some of the prosecutorial decisions that he will have to make. In particular, I fear that he is likely to be accused of bias. Under the 2002 Act, the director has no access to the Northern Ireland Assembly to explain and justify his prosecutorial decisions.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09031163000060"></a>That brings me to the other amendment in this group, Amendment 1, which is in substitution of Section 22(2) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. It may be helpful if I read out that subsection before I come to the amendment. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09031163000137"></a>&#147;The First Minister and deputy First Minister, acting jointly, must appoint a person to be Attorney General for Northern Ireland&#148;.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09031163000061"></a>So the Attorney-General is appointed, in effect, by a political deal between the two leading politicians in Northern Ireland. That deal does not even have to be sustained or justified by any reference to the Assembly, because there is no requirement in the 2002 Act to refer the deal to the Assembly.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09031163000062"></a>We submit that that subsection should be replaced by the following:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="09031163000138"></a>&#147;The Attorney General for Northern Ireland shall be appointed by the Lord Chief Justice and the provisions of section 5 (as amended) shall have effect for the procedure governing such appointment&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1176"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09031163000122"></a>Section 5 provides that listed judges, and that includes High Court judges, shall be selected in the following manner. After interviews, they will be nominated by the Judicial Appointments Commission in Northern Ireland. That appointment will then be endorsed by the Lord Chief Justice. That is the selection procedure for High Court judges and below. We propose that that procedure should now be used also to appoint the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09031163000063"></a>I think that it is plain to your Lordships why we have done this. Superintendence works in this country because, although the Attorney-General is a member of the Government by constitutional convention, in our jurisdiction he is nevertheless under a quasi-judicial duty to exercise his superintendence over the Director of Public Prosecutions entirely independently of political pressure. That constitutional convention does not exist in the Northern Ireland jurisdiction, or will not exist once devolution occurs. Therefore, this amendment is intended to inject our convention into the devolved system of justice in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09031163000064"></a>Once Amendments 1 and 12 are read into the 2002 Act as a result of amending the Bill today, we will have injected into devolution precisely the same arrangements as we have here. That means that, in an often highly charged situation, the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland will have the proper protection in relation to his decisions that our own Director of Public Prosecutions receives here.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09031163000065"></a>The Government have taken issue with this and set out their reasons for doing so in the debate on Second Reading. The basis of the Government&#146;s view is that the 2002 Act is the consequence of an investigation which took place right at the end of the previous century and crystallised itself in to what is termed the Northern Ireland Criminal Justice Review. The review was completed in 2000 although it was not published until 2002. The 2002 Act is, in effect, a carbon copy of the Criminal Justice Review. The Government contend that it would be a monumental mistake to seek in this Bill to change the conclusions of that review, as the Lord President said unequivocally to your Lordships&#146; House on Monday.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09031163000066"></a>Our response is twofold. The first, which was extremely eloquently expressed by my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew, is that the review was completed nine years ago and a great deal has happened since then; and it would be a mistake to lash ourselves to the tiller of the review without giving ourselves any room for manoeuvre to respond to the many events that have happened since.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09031163000067"></a>My second response is that, in any case, in one significant manner, this Bill alters the recommendations of the Criminal Justice Review 2000 and the content of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002. It changes the way in which High Court judges are selected, and much for the better. If your Lordships glance at Schedule 3 to the Bill, you will see that, once judicial matters are devolved in Northern Ireland, judges will be selected by a procedure that differs significantly from the 2002 Act. In the 2002 Act, High Court judges are selected first by the Judicial Appointments Commission, and then

We deplored that at the time and have continued to deplore it in a variety of amending Acts.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09031163000068"></a>I congratulated the Government on what they have done in Schedule 3. The Northern Ireland Bill has removed the First Minister and Deputy First Minister from the selection procedure and replaced them with the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. This is a very significant change. Here is a major example of the Government being prepared to think again about the 2002 Act. If they can think again about a matter as significant as that, why can they not think again about the relationship between the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland and the Director of Public Prosecutions?</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09031163000069"></a>We are of course in some difficulty in dealing with this Bill today, as many noble Lords said at Second Reading. It is emergency legislation and takes place against a backcloth of recent events which give rise to great concern&#151;although not, I hope, about the future of devolution. I remain confident that we will achieve that objective. Certainly, it is not a time to start tearing apart arrangements that have been carefully crafted over a long time, even if some of us disagree with some of those arrangements. After all, the implementation is not yet to take place and we may have other opportunities to change the character of the 2002 Act.</p>

<a name="90311-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09031163000070"></a>That consideration&#151;together with the fact that under Section 22(2) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister have already chosen the person who is to become the first Attorney-General for Northern Ireland under these arrangements&#151;has led the Opposition, despite our strong support for this amendment, to take the view that it would be wrong, at this juncture, to press this amendment to a vote. However, I hope that we will get another opportunity to look at this in calmer legislative circumstances. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09031163000072"></a>I have a brief comment on Amendment 1. We agree that there could be difficulties if the Lord Chief Justice appointed the Attorney-General. One of the roles of the Attorney-General is of course to give legal advice to the Executive, and it could be very uncomfortable for the Lord Chief Justice to appoint the person who is to give legal advice to the Executive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09031163000073"></a>On Amendment 12, the Minister in the Commons reassured the House that the DPP is independent and that his independence is written across the criminal justice system. Members from Northern Ireland also said that the independence of the DPP has been accepted across Northern Ireland. We are in some difficulty about whether any specific instances have led the Conservatives to worry that the DPP is not independent, other than that stated by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that there could be an unacceptable degree of political pressure and that the DPP could be accused of bias. In both cases the word &#147;could&#148; made us a little concerned. I should be grateful to hear whether any specific instances have led to their concerns.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09031163000077"></a>I believe it would be inappropriate for a judge to make an appointment to a post that sat in part of the Executive arm of government. That would be to undermine a fundamental tenet of the UK&#146;s constitutional framework&#151;the doctrine of the separation of powers. I appreciate the noble Lord&#146;s concern that the Attorney-General should be safeguarded from inappropriate political pressure. In response, I should highlight that the appointment is made jointly by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister. That balance should provide reassurance. The First Minister and Deputy First Minister have also made public who they are minded to appoint to this post, and their proposal has been widely welcomed.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09031163000078"></a>Although the Attorney-General will be appointed by the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, and as such is clearly appointed by politicians, Section 22(5) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 states that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="09031163000139"></a>&#147;The functions of the Attorney General for Northern Ireland shall be exercised by him independently of any other person&#148;.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09031163000079"></a>This is in line with the criminal justice review, which recommended that the Attorney-General should be &#147;a non-political figure&#148; and concluded that an Attorney-General appointed under these arrangements was,</p>
<ul><a name="09031163000149"></a>&#147;less &#145;political&#146; than almost all counterparts in other common law jurisdictions&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031163000123"></a>The <I>Criminal Justice </I><I>System </I><I>Review</I><I> Report</I>, published in March 2000, was the most important and far-reaching survey of criminal justice in Northern Ireland in more than 30 years and flowed from the Belfast (Good Friday) agreement. The Government do not believe there is evidence to support a move away from these arrangements which were approved by Parliament as part of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09031163000080"></a>Again reflecting the criminal justice review, the 2002 Act provides for a consultative relationship between the DPP and the Attorney-General for Northern Ireland, and between the DPP and the Advocate-General. This was considered the best way of ensuring visible independence of prosecutorial decisions by the DPP. Indeed, giving the Attorney-General the power of superintendence and direction would be contrary to the criminal justice review. Noble Lords will therefore understand why the Government also oppose the removal of Section 41 of the 2002 Act, which transfers certain functions from the Attorney-General to the DPP. The transfer was provided for in the 2002 Act to ensure that the Attorney-General&#146;s functions would be consistent with his new consultative role post devolution.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1179"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90311-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09031163000081"></a>This consultative relationship is a statutory obligation. It allows a wide range of matters to be discussed, with a particular duty to consult on the code of practice for prosecutors which informs so much of the prosecution process. I would expect such discussions to involve challenge and a full and frank exchange in both directions. Also under Section 25 of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002, the Attorney-General may participate in the proceedings of the Assembly. Although it will be for the Assembly, through its standing orders, to set out how this will work in practice, this will provide a line of accountability from the Director of Public Prosecutions, through the Attorney-General to the Assembly. This is in addition to the fact that the DDP is answerable in Assembly for the finance and administration of the Public Prosecution Service.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09031163000082"></a>Some things have most certainly changed since 2000, when these arrangements were first envisaged. Indeed, a great deal has happened. The reactions to the recent atrocities from both sides of the political spectrum are testament to this. The political progress we have seen since 2000 is something we can all welcome. However, the review group designed these recommendations to ensure that justice could be transferred to the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland on a sustainable basis. The fundamentals of these devolved institutions, including the joint nature of the office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and the mandatory coalition that makes up the Executive have not changed.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09031163000083"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, said at Second Reading:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="09031163000140"></a>&#147;It comes down to a question of judgment concerning the atmosphere in Northern Ireland today<I>&#148;.&#151;</I>[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/3/09; col.974<I>.</I>]</p>

<p><a name="09031163000124"></a>I think that we must respect the views and the judgment of the Northern Ireland Assembly.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09031163000084"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, drew our attention to the arrangements for judicial appointments and removals, dealt with in Clause 2 and Schedules 2 to 6 to the Bill. Unlike these arrangements, however, the First Minister and Deputy First Minister have not proposed that the post-devolution arrangements relating to the prosecutorial system should be changed. The Government believe that those who will be taking responsibility for the system are the best judge of whether the time has come to move away from the accountability arrangements put in place in 2002. If, in due course, the Assembly decides that the time has come to put in place new arrangements, they will be able to do so. It is not our job today to pre-empt their decision on the substance or timing of such a change.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09031163000085"></a>I believe that with the commitment of those involved, the arrangements in the 2002 Act will ensure an effective relationship between the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney-General and Advocate-General. The arrangements will preserve the director&#146;s independence and promote confidence in prosecutions in a jurisdiction where justice has been a contested space. I am therefore, extremely grateful to the noble Lord for signalling that he would not wish to pursue these amendments and I ask him to withdraw them.</p>

I recall that, when we had a debate, back in 2002, on the recommendations of the criminal justice review committee, I supported the proposition that is reflected in the Bill, that the Attorney-General should be appointed in that way and that the DDP should be subject to no ministerial supervision. I do think, however, that it is very important to realise that it is not just a question of instances in which a DPP can be brought under political pressure; perception is almost as important in Northern Ireland as fact, and it was therefore entirely understandable and helpful that my noble friend&#146;s amendments should be put forward as alternatives. After all, they reflect a structure that has been tried over very many years in England and Wales and has been found to serve very well, in my estimation. It does, however, as we have just been reminded, turn upon the question of what the political atmosphere is like in Northern Ireland today, because the criminal justice review committee, back in 2002, specifically referred to the highly charged political atmosphere in Northern Ireland as a justification and an explanation for the proposal that it made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09031163000087"></a>We all know&#151;I add my condolences to those expressed to the family of PC Carroll&#151;that things have taken a very regrettable turn for the worse but we hope that they will go no further in that direction. Therefore, it is very helpful that this amendment will not be put to the vote. As I said on Second Reading, I would be content with either solution. Perhaps the sensible thing is to wait to see how we get on. In those circumstances, I do not think that I have anything more constructive or useful to add to this short debate.</p>

I should like to respond briefly to her remarks, as well as to the observations made by the noble Baroness, Lady Harris.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09031163000089"></a>I cannot overemphasise the degree of isolation of the DPP in the system. I have already drawn your Lordships&#146; attention to Section 42(1) of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 which refers to the obligation on the director to exercise his functions,</p>
<ul><a name="09031163000150"></a>&#147;independently of any other person&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031163000125"></a>That is starkly underlined by Section 22(5), to which the noble Baroness briefly drew our attention. It states, almost in the same terms as Section 42(1):</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="09031163000141"></a>&#147;The functions of the Attorney General for Northern Ireland shall be exercised by him independently of any other person&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031163000126"></a>To the extent that he makes any remarks about prosecutions&#151;he is allowed only to make observations about the prosecutorial system generally, not about particular prosecutions&#151;he is not in any way obliged to take the view of the DPP. This underpins the degree of the DPP&#146;s isolation.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09031163000090"></a>Moreover, Section 42(3) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="09031163000142"></a>&#147;The Attorney General for Northern Ireland and the Director may (from time to time) consult each other on any matter for which the Attorney General for Northern Ireland is accountable to the Assembly&#148;.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1181"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09031163000127"></a>The Attorney-General for Northern Ireland is not accountable to the Assembly for particular prosecutorial decisions taken by the DPP. So the DPP is forbidden by Section 42(3) from even consulting the Attorney-General if he has some concerns about a decision he is making.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09031163000091"></a>Some concern was expressed&#151;it was cast under the grand principle of &#147;separation of powers&#148;, which I remember being referred to frequently by the Government in the course of the Constitutional Reform Bill&#151;about the selection of the Attorney-General under our amendments as being made by the Lord Chief Justice. Actually, that is not in practice so. We are suggesting that the appointment of the Attorney-General should mirror the appointment system for High Court judges under Section 5 of the 2002 Act, as amended by this Bill. The selection of the Attorney-General would be as follows: the name, after interviews, would be put forward by the Northern Ireland Judicial Appointments Commission. The Lord Chief Justice would either accept it automatically or refer it back. But if the same name is put forward again by the JAC, the Lord Chief Justice has to accept it&#151;he has no alternative. It is exactly the same as the new system for High Court judges introduced by the Constitutional Reform Act. So although the Lord Chief Justice appears to have powers in relation to the selection of judges, in practice the real choice is made by the Judicial Appointments Commission. With respect to the noble Baroness, it is not fair to apply the analogy of the separation of powers to this process.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09031163000092"></a>However, I agree with the noble Baroness on perhaps the most important thing that she said: these are testing times. It may be that we will have an opportunity in future to influence the devolution process on this matter. After all, although we are talking about a devolved Administration, this is an alteration to the United Kingdom constitution and we have a duty to consider it in that context. However, for the reasons that I gave when I moved the amendment, this would not be an appropriate time to vote on it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09031163000094"></a>I feel totally inadequate in the company of noble and learned Lords. For 26 years in Parliament, I had the benefit of the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Trimble. I am not a lawyer, hence my feeling of inadequacy when dealing with technical points that are exceedingly complex and involve a series of pieces of legislation. At the same time, I am deeply concerned that your Lordships&#146; House is being asked to legislate for a fix. The ideas that are enshrined in the Bill, whatever may appear to be their strengths, are designed to create a very narrow and restrictive approach to justice and policing in Northern Ireland. I believe that the approach is based on a deal that has been done between two major parties to carve up, in their separate interests, what needs to be done in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09031163000095"></a>I will attempt in a moment to address the amendments that I propose. In the mean time, we have only to look at five months of inactivity by the Executive in Northern Ireland to realise that the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein are not brothers in arms&#151;or out of arms&#151;except when it is expedient for them to show some sort of joint approach, as we have seen in the past day or two. That is not the basis on which we should be taking forward legislation that concerns the administration of justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09031163000096"></a>My Amendments 1A, 1B and 1C illustrate alternatives to new paragraph 3A(1)(b)(i) in Schedule 1, in which we are being asked to approve a situation where a single Member of the Assembly could nominate the Minister. That is there for a reason. The reason is that if we arrange for one Member to propose who will be the Minister, we do not have the embarrassment for either the DUP or Sinn Fein of having to be seen to nominate someone outside their party. That is unsatisfactory. I do not know which would be best. It might be an idea to put that responsibility on the First and Deputy First Ministers and to test their sincerity in that respect. Alternatively, if we are going to leave it to Members of the Assembly, it should be not just one Member but perhaps eight Members of the Assembly. The third option is that nominating officers from each of the four main parties come together to decide whom they will nominate. That would not let Sinn Fein and the DUP off the hook and out of the responsibility that they should be exercising jointly for the benefit of those in Northern Ireland.

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09031163000097"></a>If I may, I shall briefly allude to Amendment 2A, which deals with one of the strangest aspects of the Bill, where the Minister appointed Minister for Justice could in fact be the First or Deputy First Minister. If he were the First or Deputy First Minister, he would for ever have a veto on whether he could be removed as the Minister for Justice. That appears to me to be an injustice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09031163000098"></a>Amendment 4A deals with the strange provision for a resolution to remove the Minister, where cross-community and separate majorities give the DUP and Sinn Fein power not exercisable by anyone else in any other circumstances. Again, we are being asked to endorse the carve-up of a power. Similarly, Amendment 5A would leave out the words,</p>
<ul><a name="09031163000151"></a>&#147;is moved by the First Minister and the deputy First Minister acting jointly&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031163000128"></a>In this instance, total power would be given to the leader of the DUP and the leader of Sinn Fein to act in a carve-up.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09031163000099"></a>Those points, I admit, though understood by me, have not perhaps been adequately addressed in technical language. However, they are relevant and applicable. Hence, I ask the Lord President to say whether &#147;made in Northern Ireland&#148;, as the Secretary of State says, actually means &#147;contrived in Northern Ireland&#148;, but put into a form that, in the longer run, will present us with problems that could ultimately cause the Assembly to crumble.

On Amendment 1C, we feel that there is nothing in legislation to provide that four parties must always be in the Executive. The d&#146;Hondt formula just needs to be applied until all ministerial posts are filled. If one or two parties have a sufficiently large number of Members, that could result in only two or three parties being in the Executive. Indeed, there could come a time when there are fewer than four parties in the Assembly.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09031163000101"></a>Amendment 2A would prevent the First Minister and Deputy First Minister from holding the post of Justice Minister. Although we agree that this probably would not be ideal the first time that policing and justice powers are devolved, there may come a time when it is entirely appropriate. I remind the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, that my noble friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness, while Deputy First Minister for Scotland, was also the Justice Minister. Although this model is drafted as being temporary and in effect only until 2012, the Assembly could like this model and agree to continue with it after May 2012. In the future, there may be a case for the post being held by the First or Deputy First Minister, so, with regret, we are not able to support the noble Lord in his amendments.</p>

We may actually have the justice and policing responsibility&#148;. The other party&#151;this is the carve-up between the two parties&#151;will say, &#147;Vote for us, because we are the one party that can prevent Sinn Fein from having the responsibility for policing and justice&#148;. This legislation turns Northern Ireland once again, and more starkly than ever before, into a sectarian society where the electoral contest is purely sectarian.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09031163000104"></a>The Bill is one of eight models that have been designed to establish a new Northern Ireland department to exercise functions that consist wholly or mainly of devolved police and justice powers. This model has received the majority support of the review committee at the Assembly. More important, it has been passed by the whole Assembly by a cross-community vote. That means that more than 50 per cent of the Members who are designated as unionists, and more than 50 per cent of the Members who are designated as nationalists, have given their approval. It is very important, particularly at this time, that the Bill is passed through this House as quickly as possible without amendment, so I do not intend to refer entirely to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis.</p>

His arguments are sound, and I shall have a few more later. My reason for not supporting the noble Lords, Lord Maginnis and Lord Browne, is not intellectual; it is purely because I believe that, given the situation that we are in, now is not the time to start dissecting a Bill as important as this. I still think that it is an awful shame that it did not have longer in the Commons and here, but that is where we are and where we must stay and go from. Although it is not really my job, I ask the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, whether he would be good enough to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09031163000108"></a>I recognise that noble Lords have concerns about how the Bill provides for the appointment and removal of the justice Minister under this new model, and I have heard the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis. I must stress that I do not agree with his assertion that the Bill is all about a deal. It is not. As the noble Lord, Lord Browne, quite rightly said, it reflects an agreement between the democratically elected representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, as set out in the agreement that was announced by the First and Deputy First Ministers in November and built on by the cross-party Assembly and Executive Review Committee. The report of that committee was approved, as the noble Lord said, by the Assembly on a cross-community basis on 20 January. The Government believe that it is right and proper that they should take their lead from this agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09031163000109"></a>Amendments 1A, 1B and 1C would remove the possibility of a nomination for the justice Minister being made by any Member of the Assembly. Instead,  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1185"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the nomination would have to be made either by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister acting jointly, by at least eight Members of the Assembly, or by at least one Member of each of the four largest parties in the Assembly. The Assembly and Executive Review Committee did not seek to restrict who could nominate the justice Minister, and for that reason we have not done so in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09031163000110"></a>Another of the models provided for by the 1998 Act in Section 21A(3) already provides for a single elected Minister nominated by the First and Deputy First Ministers, which replicates the effect of Amendment 1A. But, in any case, the key test that needs to be applied is whether the nomination commands cross-community consensus, as expressed through a cross-community vote in the Assembly. That is what the Bill provides; therefore, there is no need to impose the additional hurdles within the nomination process which would be created by Amendments 1B and 1C.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09031163000111"></a>The noble Lord also asserted that having a single Member of the Assembly nominate the justice Minister saves the DUP or Sinn Fein from having to lose face by doing so. I do not accept that these provisions let anyone off the hook. It is simply a way to ensure that any Member of the Assembly can nominate a justice Minister and that there should be no restriction on that right. The nomination still requires cross-community support to be carried.</p>

<a name="90311-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09031163000112"></a>Amendment 2A, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass, would prevent the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister from being nominated to hold the office of justice Minister. It is a feature of all existing ministerial models for the department of justice and the other executive ministerial offices that neither the First Minister nor the Deputy First Minister is precluded from holding these offices. Members of the Committee may recall that the honourable Member for Foyle simultaneously held the office of Deputy First Minister and that of finance Minister under a previous Assembly mandate. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, for giving the example of her noble friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness, in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09031163000113"></a>To amend the Bill in the way proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, would create an inconsistency between the model set out here and the arrangements that Parliament has already put in place for existing models. I would draw the noble Lord&#146;s attention to Section 18(7) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 and to paragraphs 3(7), 7(7), 11(7) and 11F(1) of Schedule 4A to that Act. It is important that the Assembly should have no less flexibility to appoint a justice Minister under this model than under any of the others. In response to the noble Lord&#146;s suggestion that, if the First Minister and Deputy First Minister were to be nominated as justice Minister they would have a veto over their own removal, that is not necessarily the case. On current Assembly arithmetic, the DUP or Sinn Fein would be required to carry a cross-community vote. However, that arithmetic would not always be the same. Given that the DUP and Sinn Fein have committed to not nominating the justice Minister until after 2012, the Government believe that the noble Lord&#146;s concerns are misplaced. I therefore ask him not to press his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09031163000114"></a>Amendment 4A would make it possible for the Assembly to remove the justice Minister on a straight majority vote, dispensing with the need for cross-community support. The requirement of cross-community support for the removal of the justice Minister was recommendation 11 of the AERC report, approved by the Assembly on 20 January. Not only would I advise caution to the Committee before unpicking arrangements which already have support across the Assembly and will fall to them to implement, but this amendment goes beyond the spirit of the Belfast agreement. The agreement sets out the principle of taking key decisions within the Assembly on a cross-community basis which it defined as either parallel consent, as is provided by the Bill, or a weighted majority; namely, 60 per cent of members present and voting, including at least 40 per cent of the nationalist and unionist designations present and voting. It would be hard to argue that the removal of a justice Minister could not be construed as a key decision of the Assembly. For those reasons, the Government do not agree with this amendment.</p>

<a name="90311-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09031163000115"></a>Amendment 5A would remove the roles of the First and Deputy First Minister in removing the justice Minister. This would mean that removal could be brought about only by a Motion supported by a minimum of 30 MLAs, which would then need to be passed by the Assembly on a cross-community basis. The provisions included in the Bill for the removal of the justice Minister replicate the arrangements put in place and approved by Parliament in the Northern Ireland Act 1998 for the exclusion of a Minister under Section 35. Given that the arrangements are suitable in that scenario, the Government consider that they should also be suitable here. Again, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

It appears that no provision is made in the legislation for a situation where more than one nomination is made in the Assembly.

The amendments are partially inspired by the arguments made by the honourable Member for Foyle in Committee in the other place. As Mr Durkan accepted, there is nothing in the Bill to protect a Minister of Justice from being ousted from office on a somewhat capricious basis. In the Commons, the SDLP proposed that the nominating officer of a political party should be involved in the appointment and removal of the Minister. We saw a lot of merit in that proposal but we were worried about what would happen if the nominating officer was in fact the Minister himself. There may be circumstances where he might not agree to remove himself from office even if that was the will of his own party. Therefore, we have tabled amendments to provide for an extra component in the cross-community vote.</p>

<a name="90311-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09031171000002"></a>Amendments 2 and 5 provide that a Minister of justice has to be appointed and removed by 50 per cent of the unionists voting, 50 per cent of the nationalists voting, 50 per cent of the Assembly voting, and the majority of the members of the Minister&#146;s party voting. We believe that these amendments provide the Minister of justice with a degree of security while maintaining the right of the Assembly to remove him from his post. It also provides the synchronisation between the appointment and removal which the Government are keen to maintain. This is a fairly modest amendment and we urge the Government to accept it. As I said at Second Reading, we believe that the Minister of justice is a special Minister in circumstances which are particularly fraught at the present time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09031171000003"></a>I will now address Amendment 4. The Liberal Democrats tabled this amendment in the other place and we made representation to the Minister, Mr Paul Goggins, at our meetings last week. The amendment takes inspiration from the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 which allows the Secretary of State to remove a political or independent member from the Policing Board if he has been convicted of a criminal offence since his appointment, if he has become bankrupt, if he is not committed to non-violent and exclusively peaceful and democratic means, or if he is unable or unfit to discharge his functions. We believe that putting such a qualification into the Bill would prevent vexatious attempts by Members of the Assembly to remove a Minister of justice from office. The Assembly would need to resolve that a Minister filled one of the four criteria listed in the amendment before they could remove him. This gives a Minister of justice more protection than is afforded in the Bill as it stands. As we know from our daily experience in this place, Justice Ministers and Home Secretaries are often called on to make difficult decisions that, in an ideal world, they would choose not to make. They make these decisions because they are in a secure position and because they have to. If a justice Minister is vulnerable to a populist movement within the Assembly, he might not be able to make the difficult decisions required of a justice Minister. The amendment would ensure that the Assembly still has the right to remove the Minister of justice from office, but it would give him protection in that he could not be removed for frivolous or populist reasons but only for serious reasons of grave misdoings. I beg to move.</p>

Amendment 6 is another modest amendment. It was moved in the other place and it is an attempt to limit the possibility of vexatious Motions being tabled by Members of the Assembly. It gives the Assembly the ability to set out in Standing Orders a limit on the number of times a Motion to remove a Minister can be made during a specific period of time, again to be specified in Standing Orders. Westminster is simply giving the Assembly the ability to address this problem in its own Standing Orders. The amendment does not specify a limit or a time frame; it respects the remit of the Assembly to determine its own business. We are not prescribing how the Assembly should operate; we are merely giving it an option which it may wish to use.</p>

As I recall it, the Minister said that this safeguard was built into the Good Friday agreement so that there would be a

But surely we have moved beyond the conditions of the Good Friday agreement&#151;we would not have this legislation before us if we had not&#151;into a rather more mature situation in Northern Ireland, where those who determine what goes on are not only those representing the nationalist and unionist sides but also others who declare themselves on neither side. Surely that is what we wish to see grow.</p>

<a name="90311-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09031171000007"></a>Future Ministers of justice very likely may come from the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland, which does not declare itself as part of the nationalist or unionist side but sees itself as representing all of Northern Ireland and what you might call the broader civil society of Northern Ireland which we would wish to see established. It is curious, therefore, that the Government are proposing that we should allow such Ministers of justice to be dismissed by what would basically be a vote of the two sectarian parties of Northern Ireland. That would be folly. It also does not respond to the conditions we see developing in Northern Ireland, thanks in large measure to this Government&#146;s courageous moves, and that is not wise. It does not respond to the present circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09031171000008"></a>It was right in the context of the Good Friday agreement that we should ignore this third quotient of Northern Ireland; that in order to prevent and stop the Troubles we should place this counterbalancing power in the hands of those who see themselves as representing either the nationalists or the loyalists. That was right for that moment, but surely it is not right for this moment. It was right for that moment that those who regarded themselves as being out of the nationalist/loyalist division should be essentially weightless, but surely they should not be weightless now. To allow a justice Minister, who for very good reasons will probably come from a party that is neither nationalist nor loyalist, to be dismissed by a conspiracy between the nationalists and loyalists who dominate is folly of the highest order.</p>

<a name="90311-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09031171000009"></a>Imagine a situation where you have a justice Minister from the Alliance Party presiding over a corruption investigation into the Executive, made up necessarily of both nationalists and loyalists. Under these provisions, it would be open to both of those parties to dismiss the justice Minister without it having anything to do with the preservation of the ethnic balance of Northern Ireland but simply because it was politically convenient to do so. Is that the kind of circumstance the Government wish to promote? This provision is like asking a domestic cat to preside over the administration of justice between two tigers on the basis that the tigers have an absolute right to eat it whenever they conclude it is convenient to do so. Who would take such a job under such provisions? More importantly, who could do a good job, in those circumstances, under such provisions? This is not to respond to the movement made by Northern Ireland, to the present climate or to the requirement to bring in others into the Government of Ireland&#151;not just nationalists and loyalists. It is absolutely not to respond to creating appropriate conditions in which a Minister of justice could do their job effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09031171000012"></a>I ask the Government to think again. It seems unwise to put a Minister of justice, who comes from outside that division, into a position where they could be dismissed, for reasons that are nothing to do with the preservation of the balances in Northern Ireland and nothing to do with putting them in that position. This seems unwise and inappropriate and I hope the Government will think again.</p>

There is a party called the SDLP. There is a party called the Ulster Unionist Party. Neither is sectarian. Neither wants to be associated, by the noble Lord or by anyone else, in sectarian terms. If he decides that he can pick out the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland as the one non-sectarian party, he errs.</p>

Many in Northern Ireland have a huge desire&#151;not least those of us who negotiated at the coalface of the Belfast agreement&#151;for a non-sectarian, pluralist society within Northern Ireland. Hence to suggest that provision is made within this Bill to facilitate one small party that will simply be the buffer between Sinn Fein and the DUP, appears to be an act of folly.</p>

Even with the existing provision, the Justice Minister could still be removed through the normal exclusion procedure or through a Section 17(1) resolution rearranging departments. It is important that some removal power is in place apart from the normal provisions because it is consistent, first, with the letters of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister. It is also important that there is consistency between appointment and removal. I would point out that permitting a removal of the Justice Minister by a cross-community vote is entirely consistent in that it mirrors the manner of the appointment of that Justice Minister. This power again is highly unlikely to be used and other departmental models already provide for analogous arrangements for removal by those who appointed.</p>

<p><a name="09031171000033"></a>The purpose of the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Smith of Clifton was simply to add to that a majority of the party from which the Justice Minister was drawn. To vote otherwise would really leave this entirely in the hands of those who would be able to describe themselves as either nationalists or unionists. That would not include, for instance, in the case that I raised earlier, Members from the Alliance Party and indeed other political parties that did not see themselves as sectarian in nature.</p>

The Government wholeheartedly agree that the Justice Minister is extremely important and we understand that concerns about the arrangements exist, but we continue to believe that the arrangements provided for in the Bill are appropriate. Therefore, we are not able to support the amendments under deliberation.</p>

<a name="90311-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09031171000019"></a>Amendments 2 and 5 would require, in addition to cross-community support, the support of the majority of the Justice Minister&#146;s party before he or she could be appointed or removed from office. The Assembly and Executive Review Committee dealt explicitly with the question of how the Assembly should approve the appointment and removal of the Justice Minister. Recommendations 10 and 11 make it clear that appointment and removal would require a cross-community vote and specify that it should be a parallel consent vote requiring a majority of designated nationalists and a majority of designated unionists as well as an overall majority.</p>

<a name="90311-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09031171000020"></a>The Government agree that the justice portfolio is special and may require different treatment from the other ministerial portfolios. That is why we have provided  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1192"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1192</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for a series of alternative models for the structure of a justice department. However, as I explained at Second Reading, we do not accept that cross-community votes are, to use the noble Lord&#146;s words, simple or routine. The principle of taking key decisions within the Assembly on a cross-community basis was one of the safeguards set out in the Belfast agreement of 1998. We have moved a long way since that agreement. I heard the arguments expressed forcefully by the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, but I do not believe that today is the time or the place to start a re-examination or unpicking of the Belfast agreement by the addition of further layers of protection to the definition of cross-community support.</p>

<a name="90311-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09031171000021"></a>The Belfast agreement defined cross-community support as either parallel consent, which we are discussing here, or a weighted majority&#151;that is, 60 per cent of Members present and voting, including at least 40 per cent of the designated nationalists and unionists present and voting. The safeguard was designed to meet the particular circumstances of Northern Ireland, given its difficult history, and it was intended to apply in relation to key decisions, not to all routine matters. The appointment and removal of a Justice Minister could certainly be characterised as such a key decision.</p>

<a name="90311-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09031171000022"></a>While I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Smith, and the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, are keen to ensure the most stable framework possible for an incoming Justice Minister, I suggest that the best way of providing for that is to put in place the framework recommended by the people who will be operating within it.</p>

<a name="90311-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09031171000023"></a>Amendment 4, again tabled by noble Lords from the Liberal Democrat Benches, sets out criteria that would need to be met before a motion could be tabled to call for the removal of the Justice Minister. Again, I understand the desire of those who have tabled this amendment to head off any suggestion that the Justice Minister could be removed at the whim, as it were, of the two largest parties. However, for the reasons that I have set out, the Government believe that a cross-community vote&#151;in particular, the requirement for parallel consent, or 50:50:50&#151;is sufficient to safeguard the power from being used trivially or malignly. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, for drawing our attention to page 6, sub-paragraph (11).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09031171000024"></a>The belief that I mentioned was strengthened by the words of the Northern Ireland First Minister, speaking as the right honourable Member for Belfast East during the debate on this Bill last week in another place. I referred to them at Second Reading, but they are worth repeating because, in the Government&#146;s view, they clearly illustrate the commitment of both the First and Deputy First Ministers to making the framework workable. The right honourable Member said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22"></a><a name="09031171000040"></a>&#147;Neither the First nor the Deputy First Minister will wish to do anything other than give ... support to a Justice Minister, especially a Justice Minister who will have been appointed by a more democratic method than any other Minister in the Executive and who will therefore be harder to dismiss&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 4/3/09; cols. 940-41.]</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09031171000025"></a>The Government believe that those words clearly indicate that there is no intention on the part of the two largest parties in the Assembly to misuse the power to remove a Justice Minister from office.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09031171000026"></a>Amendment 6 proposes that Assembly standing orders might limit the number of removal motions that could be brought against the Justice Minister in a given period. As I have set out, the Government recognise the concern that the noble Baroness expressed, which is that the power to seek removal of the Justice Minister could be used vexatiously. That is why, at line 5 on page 7, we propose to restrict the circumstances in which such a motion can be tabled in new paragraph 3D(13) of Schedule 4A to the 1998 Act. Any motion would require the support of 30 or more Members of the Assembly, or to have been tabled by the First and Deputy First Ministers acting jointly. These filters replicate those used for exclusion motions under Section 30 of the 1998 Act, and the safeguards that the Belfast agreement set out should apply to votes on key issues in the Assembly.</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09031171000027"></a>Should the Assembly wish to provide further protection against such vexatious requests via standing orders, it is already permitted to do so. Section 41 of the 1998 Act provides a broad power for the Assembly to regulate its own proceedings by standing orders. Providing an additional explicit power for the Assembly to do so for removal motions is not necessary and could call into question the generality of the power in Section 41. The Government are, therefore, unable to support this amendment.</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09031171000028"></a>Amendment 10 would prevent a removal motion against the Justice Minister being brought before 1 May 2012, or, if the Assembly resolved before then to continue with the departmental model in the long term, from the date of that resolution. As with my earlier comments on Amendments 2 and 4, the key here is recommendation 11 of the Assembly and Executive Review Committee, which explicitly recommended that the arrangements for removing the Justice Minister by cross-community vote should apply until May 2012. Once again, this amendment contradicts the express wishes of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive Review Committee and the Government are thus unable to support it.</p>

I heard what other noble Lords said. We are not unpicking the Belfast agreement; we are adding a new provision in the light of changed circumstances. My noble friend Lord Ashdown vividly described a situation where a Minister of Justice could find himself having to investigate, say, two quite different cases of corruption, which might be enough to unite the two main parties in seeking his removal. The Lord President has not given a satisfactory answer there. As for the assurances given by the First Minister, as I said at Second Reading, we have had categorical assurances from Ministers in Great Britain that were not, as it turned out, worth the breath that was expended on them. For these reasons, I wish to test the opinion of the Committee.</p>

This is vital. I have spoken again with the chief constable and, given the way in which things happen when terrorist activity and serious criminal activity gear up in Northern Ireland, he must have a guarantee of those freedoms. At Second Reading, I asked whether, had these recent murders taken place post-devolution, the chief constable would have the powers&#151;the freedom&#151;to call in resources independently, and I think, unless I am wrong, that the noble Baroness&#146;s answer was in the affirmative. We believe that the amendment would clearly strengthen the Bill and give a lot of comfort to everybody involved in the process. I beg to move.</p>

We have made great progress with the Bill since the first elusive reference to it in the Queen&#146;s Speech, but this is a most essential matter. In our debates this afternoon, noble Lords have disagreed on the possible pressures that a Minister of Justice, an Attorney-General or the DPP might come under with the new arrangements. There is genuine room for disagreement and uncertainty about the political context in which those officers might operate. However, there can be no doubt at all, in the light of the past few days, that the operational integrity of the chief constable could come under challenge. We saw a bitter debate, before the tragic murders of the past few days in Northern Ireland, when the chief constable made his decision to call in Special Forces, and it is to be remembered that the anger expressed over that came from one of the key parties to the agreement we are moving to implement today. It is therefore vital that we do what we can to underline the operational integrity of the chief constable. In this case, it is not a matter of speculation or debate. This is a fraught political position and everything we can do or say, every signal that the Government can send&#151;I am sure the Government fully accept the validity of the point that the chief constable should have operational freedom of manoeuvre&#151;is vital.</p>

These are accepted realities in Northern Ireland and they are implicit in existing arrangements. Section 1 of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 already places a duty on those responsible for the administration of justice to uphold the continued independence of the judiciary. In addition, all Ministers must take a pledge of office, which is also in the <I>Ministerial Code</I>. I therefore believe that this amendment is unnecessary.</p>

The Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Browne, has said, simply says that there must be an affirmation of,</p>
<ul><a name="09031175000102"></a>&#147;the terms of the pledge of office&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09031175000078"></a>Where in the Bill is that pledge of office defined and what exactly is this pledge of office? The wording seems very vague: we would be agreeing to something which is not explained. The solemn declaration in the amendment to respect the operational independence of the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland and to uphold the independence of the judiciary in Northern Ireland is common sense. Incidentally, when the Lord President says that the appointment has already been made by the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister and been widely welcomed throughout Northern Ireland, can she put on the record the name of that appointee? Obviously, it must be widely known if it has been widely welcomed.</p>

As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State said in another place, the Government understand fully the sentiments behind this amendment and agree completely that all Ministers, whether in the UK Government or the devolved Administration, should be fully committed to these fundamental principles of independence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09031175000007"></a>I turn first to the issue of resources raised by the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran. On the current atrocities, the Prime Minister has said that we will provide whatever extra resources are necessary. Post devolution, the chief constable, like any other chief constable, will be able to request extra resources. That is the position.</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09031175000012"></a>In respect of the judiciary, Section 1 of the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 already places a clear duty on those with responsibility for the administration of justice to uphold the continued independence of the judiciary. The duty applies today to my right honourable friends the Prime Minister, the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State. Post devolution, it will also apply to Ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive. The duty will be underpinned by a concordat between the UK Government and the devolved Executive that underscores the core principles of the independence and impartiality of the judiciary in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09031175000013"></a>In respect of the police, the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland, known as the Patten commission, was clear that the chief constable must  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1198"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have sole operational responsibility, and that neither the policing board nor the Government of the day, be it a devolved or direct-rule Administration, should have the power to direct him or her on how to conduct an operation. Section 33 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 makes clear that the police come under the sole direction and control of the chief constable. Sections 3(4)(a) and 69 of the Act require that the duties of the policing board and the Minister respectively must be carried out with regard to the principle that the policing of Northern Ireland is to be conducted in an impartial manner.</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09031175000014"></a>Noble Lords will recall that the policing board itself was a central element of the Patten reforms. It is made up of 19 members: 10 political members drawn from the parties in the Assembly, selected using the d&#146;Hondt formula; and nine independent members currently appointed by the Secretary of State but, post devolution, to be appointed by the Minister of Justice. It holds the chief constable to account on ordinary policing matters, and also supports the network of district policing partnerships that link the police and the community at local level.</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09031175000015"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Browne, informed us, in addition to these provisions, the pledge that must be sworn by all Northern Ireland Ministers when they take office contains a commitment to,</p>
<ul><a name="09031175000103"></a>&#147;uphold the rule of law based as it is on the fundamental principles of fairness, impartiality and democratic accountability&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90311-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09031175000016"></a>These existing guarantees enable me to be very clear: statute already safeguards the chief constable&#146;s operational independence and the principle of impartial policing after the devolution of policing and justice. The Government therefore do not believe that it is necessary or appropriate to replicate the guarantees in the Bill. Additionally, we believe that it is important that the Justice Minister should be subject to the same pledge of office as other Executive Ministers. Therefore, while we support the principles on which the amendment is based, we do not consider that the amendment itself is necessary.</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09031175000017"></a>I apologise if I unwittingly misled noble Lords on the earlier question of technical resources. The chief constable will request additional financial resources from the policing board, but requests for technical support will be made to the military and to the British Government.</p>

However, knowing that it is there, if it can be found&#151;I am sure that people will find it whenever it is needed&#151;I feel able to withdraw the amendment. Of course, I would be delighted if, between now and Report, the noble Baroness would agree that it went in. That would be very helpful. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

The base of it is that I have been concerned ever since I started working on the Bill with the possibility of there being quite long periods after devolution without the appointment of a Minister. In other words, we could have criminal justice and policing devolved and even have a Ministry put together but if we do not have a Minister appointed, the department will be rudderless. It is a very serious department to have rudderless. My amendments attempt to cover that by setting time limits on how long the Assembly has to get its act together and agree to the Minister, the leader, on all occasions that the post becomes vacant. I am concerned that in the Bill there are at least two opportunities for sluggishness in making the appointment and for hanging around. Then we will not have direction in what is probably the most important department in that Executive. I beg to move.</p>

The Government recognise that there are concerns that, both after the transfer of powers and after the 2011 election, the Assembly will be unable to agree on whom to appoint as the Justice Minister. I hope that what I said at Second Reading, and what I am about to say, will reassure the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09031175000021"></a>Amendments 7, 8, 9 and 11 provide that if a Justice Minister has not been appointed within six months of responsibility for policing and justice being devolved, or within six months of the Assembly election in 2011, or if the department is dissolved in 2012, the Secretary of State should assume the direction of the department or of the functions that it previously exercised.</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09031175000022"></a>The amendments are addressed at the absence of a deadline for appointing a Justice Minister during the transitional period up to 1 May 2012. The Government agree that having no Justice Minister in place is unsustainable in the long term. However, we have taken the view that it is not appropriate during that initial period to be prescriptive about deadlines. We disapplied the normal seven-day deadline for appointing the Justice Minister following an Assembly election to avoid a situation where a slight delay in reaching cross-community agreement on the prospective Justice Minister triggered a further Assembly election, disrupting the newly formed Executive just as they were bedding in.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1200"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90311-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09031175000023"></a>We deliberately did not put in its place an alternative deadline. The reason for that is two-fold. First, we have confidence that the parties in the Assembly will be able to reach agreement on a Justice Minister in a timely fashion and there is no need, during that transitional period, for us to impose specific deadlines: they will just get on with it without the need for us to set limits.</p>

<a name="90311-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09031175000024"></a>The second reason is that the Government believe that, in the event that the Assembly was unable to appoint a Justice Minister, it is right that the Government and Parliament should have the maximum flexibility to decide both when and how to intervene. It is unhelpful to speculate at this point as to exactly what the nature of that intervention might be and when it might prove necessary. Such prescriptive amendments would prevent the necessary flexibility in deciding how to deal with the situation. For that reason, the Government do not feel able to support the amendments.</p>

I would expect that, if devolution of policing and justice takes place, this will only happen where there is agreement on who the Minister will be. The operation of the triple lock is such that we would not devolve without the matter being agreed. Indeed, it may even be possible to elect the justice Minister in advance of devolution, to be in post upon devolution. In the event, six months would be a very long time for such an important position to remain vacant. It would be constitutionally odd to have the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in charge of a Northern Ireland department. Although the Secretary of State is given certain powers under the Northern Ireland Act, I believe that this would not be a very good precedent. In such circumstances, it would be preferable for Westminster to resume control.</p>

We have tabled this amendment to probe the expedited process for designating marine conservation zones. Clause 116(1) states very clearly that there is a due process for designating, which is described in subsections (2) to (9). This process involves publishing proposals and consulting the appropriate persons, including the Secretary of State. Subsection (10), however, allows the appropriate authority to miss out all the stages of the publication of the proposed site and the consultation on it if the area in question requires urgent protection.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09031175000030"></a>Will the Minister say what he considers to be &#147;an urgent need&#148; to protect an area? Having waited so long for a marine Bill, what could be so urgent that it cannot wait to go through the normal stages, and who would decide this urgency? Having asked the question, I acknowledge that there will be times when it is crucial to designate a marine conservation zone to stop irreversible damage and the time needed to publish the notice and complete the consultation exercise is unacceptably long. It would be helpful if the Minister could say what he expects the timeframe to be from identifying an area as a possible marine conservation zone and its actual designation as an MCZ. Will he also make it clear to the Committee what other occasions might be needed and what safeguards will be put into place to make sure that subsections (10) and (11) cannot be exploited by one group or another?</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09031175000031"></a>We support the principle of the Bill, and we want MCZs to be able to protect areas as quickly and effectively as possible. We do not wish harm to befall

Nevertheless, we are nervous about the power that subsections (10) and (11) could afford. Perhaps the Minister can reassure us and put on to the record when and in what circumstances these two subsections might be used. To this end, I also declare our tentative support for Amendments A148 and A196, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Greenway. Before he speaks to them, however, I note that on day six of Committee the Minister said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031175000104"></a>&#147;in developing the network ... it will be subject to monitoring, review, amendment and, I am sure, improvement beyond 2012 ... the network will evolve after 2012 and even after 2020 as pressures on our marine environment change&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/3/09; col. 684.]</ul>
<p><a name="09031175000081"></a>With this in mind, it seems that the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, are very relevant, and I look forward to hearing him speak to them. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_103"></a>
<a name="09031175000032"></a><b><a name="90311-0006.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09031175000133"></a>Lord Greenway:</b> My Amendments A148 and A196 are grouped with Amendment A146. Amendment A148 refers to Clause 118, which deals with the amendment, revocation and review of orders designating marine conservation zones. The amendment would insert a new subsection, because the process for giving effect to amendments to an existing MCZ should be in line with the initial designation procedures, including consulting interested or affected parties. As an MCZ will already be in place in such circumstances, the provision under Clause 116(10) for making an urgent designation without consultation should not be applicable but the opportunity given for representations to be made at a time when original conditions might have changed and/or other persons or interests are affected.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09031175000033"></a>Amendment A196 refers to Clause 128, which deals with interim by-laws. Again, the amendment would insert a new subsection. Representations can be put forward when an interim by-law is made initially. However, the process is less clear when it is subsequently determined to designate the area or part of the area as a permanent MCZ. In such instances subsection (11) requires an order to be made under Clause 113, while the interim by-law may remain in force pending the outcome of the decision. It is not clear whether in such circumstances an order under Clause 113 would be subject to the requirements of Clause 116. But if that is the case, and the by-law can be expected to remain in place, it would not be appropriate to include the procedures in subsection (10) for making an urgent designation without consultation. My amendment is designed to ensure that the opportunity is given for full representations at a time when a permanent order is to be made but conditions might have changed and other persons or interests become affected.</p>

I agree that their anxieties need to be allayed because there is not the slightest doubt that public engagement is fundamentally important to the way in which these sites will be designated and protected. It is the best way to ensure that we come to the right decision on the best available evidence and secure wide understanding

I am of course at one with the sentiment expressed by the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, and the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, that consultation should be the norm and that, for the policy to be effective, consultation needs to be full and thorough.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09031175000035"></a>The noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, asked questions which focused around several issues, the main one being the provision for urgency in the Bill. I agree with the noble Duke that that should be a rarely used provision, but we allow designation to take place on an interim basis, solely for protection, without prior public consultation. We would want to create the space for that consultation to take place. I am entirely at one with the anxiety that the noble Duke has expressed.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09031175000036"></a>He also asked in what conceivable circumstances urgency would be the issue. We feel that it is necessary to make this provision. Certainly, the powers are likely to be used very infrequently, especially as interim by-laws can be made to protect an area before it is formally designated. But by-laws will not be able to protect nature conservation features from all potential threats. The ability urgently to designate an MCZ means that the duties on public authorities are given effect and the general offence of intentionally damaging a protected feature of a site will apply. It is prudent that the Government should have provision for urgent action.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09031175000037"></a>I agree entirely that when such action has been taken the process should be in place before anything permanent is established for the proper consultation. But there can be occasions when a threat is presented, and we want the power to carry out urgent action. I want to reassure noble Lords that we do not expect this procedure to be used in any other than wholly exceptional circumstances. I follow entirely the thinking behind the amendments, that consultation ought to be the norm and that we will only bring about the effective operation of these zones with full public consultation leading to acceptance and an understanding of them.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09031175000038"></a>However, I want to defend the concept of the urgency provision. Clause 113 as it stands will achieve the same outcome as Amendment 148, spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway. The amendment would ensure that any changes to the designation orders follow the transparent consultation and designation procedures in the original order. The clause will achieve that because it applies to amending orders as much as it does to the original designation orders.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09031175000039"></a>Amendment 196 seeks to ensure that the public have the right to make representations before an area is designated. The existing duty in Clause 116 to carry out public consultation carries with it the implied right of members of the public to make representations, as well as an implied duty on the appropriate authority to have regard to them. That is certainly our intention and our reading of the clause. I hope that that reassures the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09031175000040"></a>I understand the motivation behind the amendments and I hope that I can interpret them as probing in nature. We have thought about these issues carefully, and I want to make one point about the urgent provision.  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1204"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>If we had no capacity at all to act except through existing procedures and consultation, and there was anything like an urgent threat necessitating prompt action, we would be remiss.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="09031175000094"></a>&#147;The objective is that the MCZs designated&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09031175000082"></a>have to &#147;form a network&#148;. I think that most, if not all, noble Lords agree that a network of MCZs will be vital in promoting sustainable development and in the protection and improvement of marine flora, fauna and habitats.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09031175000043"></a>In establishing MCZs, it is important that the purpose and objective of each zone be made clear so that the management and level of protection will vary from zone to zone, and even between zones according to their purpose and objectives. So there will be highly protected zones and at the same time other zones designated with different aims and protection. If this is an accurate reflection of the Government&#146;s intention, where is this reflected in the wording of the Bill?</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09031175000044"></a>I want to make it absolutely clear that this amendment in no way diminishes the importance of the previous debates that we had regarding marine conservation  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1205"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1205</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>zones, namely the designation of conservation zones in order to contribute to an ecologically coherent network of sites which will include highly protected sites. This need for an ecologically coherent network, including highly protected sites, was highlighted by the Joint Committee and, when debated earlier in this Committee, was supported by one and all. Indeed, this consensus was even supported by the Minister.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09031175000045"></a>He emphasised a number of points, using the word &#147;categorical&#148;. First, after taking legal advice, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="09031175000095"></a>&#147;Clauses 113 and 119 together clearly place a duty on Ministers to exercise the power in Clause 113 to designate sites&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/3/09; col. 683.]</p>

<p><a name="09031175000083"></a>Secondly, he confirmed that the establishment of an ecologically coherent network of marine protected areas is vital. Thirdly, he confirmed that the shape of the network will clearly be driven by science. Fourthly, he confirmed:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="09031175000096"></a>&#147;The ecosystem-based approach also includes the concept of connectivity between zones&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/3/09; col. 710.]</p>

<p><a name="09031175000084"></a>Fifthly, on highly protected marine reserves, the Minister, in answering my noble friend Lord Eden, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="09031175000097"></a>&#147;I am absolutely clear that that is possible ... The Bill makes it clear that there is a requirement for the Secretary of State to report on the number of marine conservation zones designated where any licensable marine activity has been restricted and the taking of animals or fishing has been prohibited&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/3/09; col. 711.]</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09031175000046"></a>These five areas are all matters where there is complete consensus in the Committee, even, as I have tried to illustrate, with the Minister. So why are these matters not in the Bill? Clause 119, under discussion now, seems an obvious place to put that right. I am not asking the Minister to agree today to put these matters in the Bill&#151;though that would be nice&#151;but to agree to take them away and consider whether they can be included. That seems to be the will of this Committee, and where there is a will there is a way. One advantage is that it would save an enormous amount of time at Report. I apologise to the Committee for going over old ground but I find it difficult to debate Clause 119 without doing so. The five points I have mentioned seem to fit nicely within this clause.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09031175000047"></a>As I said, Amendment A150A raises a different point. The Minister talks about the need for flexibility, but as Clause 119(2) is written it gives a strong impression that for an MCZ to be designated it must be part of a network. I am sure that this is not the intention of the Government.</p>

<a name="90311-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09031175000048"></a>Because of time restrictions, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, talked to her Amendment A151 earlier; it inserts Ransar sites and sites of special scientific interest. I remind the Committee that Ransar sites are protected wetlands. The Minister responded by saying:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="09031175000098"></a>&#147;There has been an oversight here. I shall reflect further on that proposal between Committee and Report&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/3/09; col. 684.]</p>

<p><a name="09031175000085"></a>Our amendment develops the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, and highlights that not all MCZs need to be part of a network. The Minister has already said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="09031175000099"></a>&#147;Marine conservation zones will therefore be designated for the purpose of conserving marine flora and fauna, marine habitats or types of marine habitat, and features of geological or geomorphological interest&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/3/09; col. 678.]</p>

<p><a name="09031175000086"></a>I would add heritage sites. As should be obvious, there is no need for a network to be in place in order to protect these features. Not all MCZs need to be part of a network, although the vast majority will be. I ask the Minister, when he looks at Amendment 151 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Young, to consider this amendment at the same time. I beg to move.</p>

This debate takes us on to matters concerning ecological coherence and what we mean by &#147;representational&#148; and I am glad to be able to respond to it. In probing this matter, Amendment A155 seeks to remove one of the conditions of an ecologically coherent network that requires that the features protected within the marine conservation zones represent the range of features present in the UK marine area. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, suggested that &#147;representational&#148; might mean some very uninteresting areas.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09031175000061"></a>We are putting in place a network of sites for our seas and we want to ensure that we represent the range of features that we have. In subsection (3), we have included three core design principles as developed for the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic and the International Union for Conservation of Nature. &#147;Representativity&#148; is defined under OSPAR to mean that the MPA network should represent the range of marine habitats and species through protecting all major habitat types and associated biological communities throughout their geographical variation in each of the seas around the UK. This important principle will underpin development of the UK network, but we will need to think further about what we consider representative features to be within our UK seas to ensure that we reflect our precious marine environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09031175000062"></a>The noble Lord might have asked for examples of a representative feature. We are thinking about rocky reefs, which might contain a wide variety of attached organisms; sublittoral muds, which are important in nutrient cycling; kelp forests, which contain high biodiversity and can be nursery areas for fish; littoral rock, where rocky seashores provide an important link between the land and the sea; biogenic reefs, which contain reef-building worms and molluscs and provide an important habitat; and salt marshes and saline reed beds, which can provide a natural form of coastal defence and act as nursery areas for fish. Those are some examples of what we have in mind but, as I said, more work needs to be done to understand the matter more fully.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09031175000063"></a>We have, of course, worked hard to learn more about our marine environment but we still have some way to go. Ecological coherence and the definition of the UK network inevitably are evolving concepts that we cannot define on the face of the Bill because they will be out of date very soon. However, we will provide guidance in our draft strategy, to be published for consultation around Easter, which will reflect our thinking on what the network should look like. It will, of course, pick up the issue of &#147;representational&#148;.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09031175000064"></a>Let me be clear on Amendment A164, because I take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on behalf of his noble friend. The purpose of Clause 120 is to establish a duty on the Secretary of State to report to Parliament on progress in designating an ecologically coherent network of sites. The report, initially made in 2012, and then at least every six years thereafter, will set out the number and type of marine conservation zones designated, as well as any measures that could be taken to further the conservation objectives for a site.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09031175000065"></a>Paragraphs (a) and (b) of Clause 120(1) state that the report to Parliament must include the extent to which the objectives of Clause 119(2) have been met and any further steps that are required to be taken in order to contribute to the achievements of the objectives. On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, Clause 119(2) sets out the objectives of the ecologically coherent network and suggests that these must meet the conditions set out in subsection (3). From advice that I have had and from my reading, I understand that, because of that, the Bill requires the report to Parliament to include any further steps that, in the opinion of the authority, are required to comply with the conditions in Clause 119(3). That is a roundabout way of saying that we think that we have the point covered.</p>

Clause 119(3)(b), to which my noble friend&#146;s Amendment A155 refers, is self-evident. If the features are present in the network, they are present in the marine area. That stands to reason. Presumably, what the Government in fact want is a range of features that are more widely present in the marine area. That may not be the precise drafting needed, but it would be better than this. My noble friend is right. This paragraph does not say anything. The Government really should look at it. It is a drafting point; we all know what we are trying to do, but that paragraph will not do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09031175000072"></a>Amendment A157 would add that the purpose of designating a network is to implement an ecosystem-based approach. It deals with issues that have been discussed before, but are nevertheless important, regarding the proportion of the seas that may end up being part of the conservation zone network and how long it may take to achieve that.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09031175000073"></a>Clause 119(3) does not state that one purpose of the designation of the network of conservation sites is to implement an eco-based approach to marine management. UK marine management is required to implement the eco-based approach by the EU marine strategy framework directive 2008 and the UK&#146;s OSPAR commitment. Accordingly, this requirement ought to be incorporated into the Bill. My noble friend believes that this is the appropriate place to put it.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09031175000074"></a>Clause 119(3) also does not set a size for the coverage of the UK marine area by the network of conservation sites. The Minister has already explained why he does not think that it is appropriate to set out a specific percentage in the Bill. However, we challenge the Government to explain their vision of what there might be in 10, 20 or 25 years&#146; time. What are they setting out to achieve? They seem to be remarkably coy about doing this. They say that they want marine conservation zones and more environmentally friendly&#151;or healthy&#151;seas around the shores of this country, but they do not seem to have a vision.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09031175000075"></a>The other day I was thinking about the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, in which some of us have been taking an interest recently in order to try to understand later parts of this Bill. At that time, there was a clear vision. That legislation was similar to this Bill in that it set out pioneering ambitions for part of the terrestrial area, or land, of this country, particularly in the form of national parks and long-distance trails. As far as the national parks were concerned, the Government of that time had a clear idea of what they wanted to do and of where those national parks were going to be. By and large, we got them&#151;although one or two were added or taken off. With one or two, there was a vision and it has come back again; I am thinking of the South Downs in particular. However, by and large, the Government knew what they wanted: the Lake District, the Peak District, the North Yorkshire Moors, Dartmoor and so on. They produced the legislation with a clear idea in mind of what its results would be.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09031175000076"></a>We do not have that here. We have a general wish and ambition to have these marine conservation zones but no clear idea of how much of the sea they will cover, how much of them will be highly protective&#151;whether they are called that or not&#151;and how much of them will be lesser protected. That is crucial to the Bill. This amendment challenges the Government to say that.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09031175000077"></a>I should add that, in working out these amendments, my noble friend was working closely with, and had assistance from, the MARINET network of Friends of the Earth organisations. I beg to move.</p>

Although I cannot agree with every detail of the amendment, we agree with the concept of using an ecosystem approach when designating the MCZ network. We should very much like to see the Bill changed to reflect that. I hope the Minister will agree with us that the lack of a definition of what a network represents is a weakness in the Bill. I also hope that he can return with an improved drafting which seeks to define it.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09031185000002"></a>We do not, however, agree with the statutory target of 30 per cent. We therefore cannot support the amendment. Setting an arbitrary target of the sea area to be covered would go against our view that MCZs should be established on a clear scientific basis and have the flexibility to respond to improving scientific research and changing circumstances on the ground. From a legislative point of view, we prefer to see an effective conservation network put in place by ensuring that duties and expectations laid upon the Secretary of State are clear.</p>

I am just slightly shocked that he thought that the Government, moving with their usual precision and expedition, got through the previous business in a reasonable amount of time so that we would be ready for this Bill&#151;on which we shall proceed with the same degree of expedition and precision. I have not the slightest doubt that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will be making his full&#151;I emphasise the word full&#151;contribution to that expedition.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09031185000004"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, identifies that there should be an ecosystem-based approach to the work we are involved with in the Bill. Of course we agree with that; that is the intention behind the Bill. We will take that into account in designating a network of sites. However, like the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, we have the greatest difficulty in accepting that some percentage of the sea could be identified at this stage. I realise that I am treading on dangerous ground by debating the subject of national parks with the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, but if he is saying that there was a full vision of every aspect of the United Kingdom that would designated as a national park when the national parks were introduced, I can only disagree with him. That is not so. It is certainly the case that the principles behind the concept of the national park were identified, and it is certainly the case that the Government made relatively early and rapid steps in the designation of certain national parks, but, as the noble Lord knows as well as anyone in the Chamber, the designation of national parks is ongoing.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09031185000005"></a>The same principle, even in extenso, applies to the sea. We are not able arbitrarily to identify a percentage of the sea that needs designation and protection in these terms. We are dealing with an evolving situation. The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, is emphatic that there should be a scientific basis to this work. He accords with that. It will be recognised that science evolves. We are dealing in this situation with at least two dimensions that have great fluidity. &#147;Fluidity&#148; is perhaps the wrong word to use when trying to describe the sea, so I shall withdraw it. Two dimensions have a great deal of variability. The first is advances in science that will  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1212"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>take us beyond the positions we can foresee at this stage. If we were operating within the parameters of science in this year of grace 2009, it is likely that, even within the timetable that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, has set, we would find ourselves constrained by such a concept. The other variable aspect is the sea itself and the demands that are made on it.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09031185000006"></a>I believe that the noble Lord must recognise that the Government, in setting the Bill out in the way that we have, share entirely those objectives about what is to be achieved. However, we are seeking to avoid the very rigidities to which he is trying to direct us by this amendment. It is not the case that experts agree on what proportion of the sea needs to be designated. There is considerable debate about those issues and experts have given different figures. The noble Lord must give the Government credit for wanting to produce legislation that will be effective for a substantial period. To have a prescribed target of this kind on the face of the Bill would therefore be very limiting.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09031185000007"></a>Now, what about the timetable? Ah, the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will get me on the third point. I hope I am standing on relatively firm ground regarding scientific and public opinion, but what about the fact that we have a timetable for the Bill? The Bill sets out that Ministers will have to report to Parliament on progress. They will have to start reporting in 2012 to show how much progress has been made with the Bill once it becomes an Act of Parliament, and they will have to report at least every six years thereafter. The report will highlight the achievement of the network and include not only details of the marine conservation zones designated but also any further steps that could be taken to achieve a network of conservation sites.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09031185000008"></a>I want to defend the Bill as it stands against an amendment that would be crippling in its limitations. I may not take the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, with me every step of the way, and I am not asking him to subscribe to such an advanced position as that of the Government, but I hope that I am taking him with me in relation to his anxiety about being too prescriptive, as the amendment is. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I do not know very much about fish, but if these conservation zones cover too big an area, the fish are going to begin to rumble where they can go so as not to be caught. If it were a third of the sea area, I would have thought that Mother Nature and her wonders would mean that the fish would soon discover that they could cluster in that third, and the European fishermen, the Russians and so on would have a very poor time.

He suggested that I thought the Government were being evasive on two points. He was wrong: I think they were being evasive on all three points. The ecosystem point, as an issue and a concept, will clearly come back for further discussion on Report somehow, so I shall say nothing more about it now. Whether it is at this point in the Bill or some other remains to be seen, but I am quite sure that there is further debate and discussion to be had on it. The point of view will, clearly, have to be put on Report that ecosystems ought to be more overtly placed in the Bill as the basis for marine conservation.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09031185000012"></a>The noble Lord chided me for my historical suggestion that in the historic and iconic 1949 Act on the national parks, people had a much clearer vision of what the end result might be than appears in this Bill. I stand by what I said, and if the noble Lord were to go back and read the <I>Hansard</I> of those debates from 60 years ago, he would find lots of references to the likely size and shape of the national parks that were to be set up. They did not all happen exactly as everybody wanted. There was much controversy, for many years, about the north Pennines and there is in what the Minister mentioned about the network continuing to evolve, which is about the South Downs.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09031185000013"></a>Many people had the vision, 60 years ago, that the South Downs should be a national park. For all sorts of reasons, that was resisted and did not happen, but it is probably happening now. Although the network has evolved, I am absolutely certain that its basic size and shape was a vision that existed at that time, and the Minister was wrong in chiding me over that. Meanwhile, that vision is simply not there for marine conservation zones&#151;or perhaps it is. I accept the remarks from the Conservative Front Bench and from the Government that putting a precise figure in the Bill is not appropriate, but many of us would be much more reassured if the Government were prepared to talk about the likely size or range of a network.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09031185000014"></a>We know&#151;or at least we hope&#151;that the network will probably not be below 5 per cent, or it will not fit the criteria of the Bill, and we know that it will not be 80 per cent. There is a range, then, but its likely range at the finish is clearly a lot narrower. Are the Government thinking of 10 per cent, or 30 per cent, or 50 per cent? They will not tell us. They are not being as visionary, ambitious or clear in the purposes or likely outcome of this legislation as many of us&#151;the many who have for so many years been working, campaigning and hoping for this legislation&#151;would like.</p>

<a name="90311-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09031185000015"></a>Finally, the Minister said that putting 2020 in the Bill would be &#147;crippling in its limitations&#148;. I thought that this Government were full of targets for amounts of things by certain dates. The rest of the world is inundated by targets that are heaped on them, yet they are not prepared to provide targets here for themselves. What is wrong with targets, or with saying, &#147;This is our ambition; this is what we want to do&#148;? Many people out there, and some of us in here, fear that without that kind of discipline&#151;not a crippling limitation, but a discipline&#151;everything will drift. Reasons will be found, as time goes on, for why it has to go slower and slower. That is the fear, and it remains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09031185000016"></a>The target does not have to be in the Bill, but it would be wonderful if the Government were to tell us much more clearly what ought to happen in the next 10, 15 or 20 years. If they did that, everybody would be a great deal more confident and it would challenge other parties&#151;who might, by some conceivable stretch, get into government instead&#151;to say whether they agree with it. Do they think it too slow, or too fast? Then, when we are in government, we would know what we are supposed to do, as would the Conservatives, who might by some freak win the election. Having said those things, the issues are clear and the debate was worth having, but I beg leave to withdraw.</p>

<p><a name="09031190000054"></a>However, under EU law, with the marine strategy framework directive and the legal obligation to deliver good environmental status through the UK marine area by 2020, and under international law such as the OSPAR commitment, it is clearly essential that the report required by Clause 120(1) includes a specific requirement to report upon actions by the appropriate authority to deliver on all its EU and international legal obligations. We believe this to be the appropriate place for this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

We on these Benches agree with the noble Lord; we should comply with EU and international law and meet the target given by the EU directive of &#147;good environmental status&#148; by 2020&#151;we come back to that point. Nevertheless, as we have said, we should achieve that not simply because of the target from the EU directive but as a matter of course from the provisions in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09031190000004"></a>Furthermore, while it seems sensible that any further steps necessary to achieve compliance with our EU or international obligations are laid out in the report, we would argue that those obligations should be met from the beginning, because they are not objectives or aims but legal requirements. The obligations that would be required for the report proposed by the noble Lord&#146;s second amendment are really covered by the first in the group. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

I hope to reassure the Committee on both points.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09031190000006"></a>As the noble Duke suggests, the UK Government are committed to meeting their EU and international obligations and this is why we have referenced these on the face of the Bill. The Bill primarily establishes a new UK tool that will complement our EU and international commitments and ensure that we designate a network of sites specific to the UK marine environment.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09031190000007"></a>Amendment A162 relates to the duty on Ministers to designate marine conservation zones and seeks to insert a reference to good environmental status and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive into the Bill. It is normal practice for European legislation to be transposed through secondary legislation made under the European Communities Act 1972, and for this reason we do not want to depart from that position. In addition, the Marine Strategy Framework Directive is, as it says, a framework directive which sets the overall goal of achieving good environmental status for Europe's seas by 2020, as the noble Duke said. The directive came into force on 15 July 2008 and the first task is to transpose the requirements of the directive into UK law by July 2010. We intend to do this outside the scope of this Bill by: making an initial assessment of the current environmental status within UK marine waters by July 2012; determining what good environmental status means for UK waters, and establishing targets and indicators by July 2012; conducting a monitoring programme to measure progress towards achieving good environmental status by July 2014; and establishing a programme of measures designed to achieve or maintain good environmental status by July 2016. In addition, although we do not believe that a specific reference to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive is appropriate here for the reasons I have just given, I assure noble Lords that, in as much as the provisions of that directive require improvement of the marine environment, the terms of Clause 119(4) already cover those obligations.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09031190000008"></a>We must also be clear that there are links between marine conservation zones and European sites&#151;that point was made in previous debates&#151;and that is why we have included Clause 119(4) in the Bill. The authorities designating marine conservation zones will do so to contribute to a network of sites, which will include EC sites, so it is appropriate to state here that they should have regard to relevant obligations under EU and international law. Our duty to meet these obligations applies in any event and is not dependent on what we and others do under the Bill.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09031190000009"></a>Amendment A163 seeks to require the report to Parliament set out in Clause 120 to include any further steps that should be taken to comply with our EU and international obligations. My reply in this case is very similar to my reply on the previous amendment. The purpose of Clause 120 is to establish a duty on the Secretary of State to report to Parliament on progress in designating an ecologically coherent network of sites. The report, initially made in 2012 and then at least every six years thereafter, will set out the number and type of marine conservation zones designated as well as any measures that could be taken to further the conservation objectives for a site. I pray in aid again Clause 120(1)(a) and (b), which specifically state that the report to Parliament must include the extent to which the objectives of the network have been met and any further steps that are required to be taken in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives. Ministers must have regard to our EU and international commitments when designating marine conservation zones, and the report to Parliament will reflect this. I am certain that, as a result, the report will give an evaluation of how far our network goes towards meeting our EU obligations. I hope that I have reassured the noble Lord on that.</p>

He said that the initial assessment will be completed by 2012. Is there assessment knowledge now covering the whole of the area, or will it have to be worked on in the years up to 2012? I am not certain what evidence we have now, and how big a task this will be. I presume that the evidence will have to be updated by 2012. If he has any further information on that, it would be helpful.</p>

I have tabled this set of amendments to probe various parts of Clauses 121 to 123, which relate to the duties of public authorities in relation to the marine conservation zones and the role the statutory conservation bodies will play in the ongoing protection and management of these zones. They seek to test the wording of the Bill against the ambitions of the Government.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09031190000014"></a>I am sure it will come as no surprise to the Minister or the Committee that we have received many representations from the conservation stakeholders, including the Marine Conservation Society and the Countryside Council for Wales inter alia, seeking to confirm their influence in this area. They are understandably worried that once the network has been established and objectives set, responsibility will pass entirely to the local public authorities which might be tempted to downgrade the priority of conservation in favour of other interests.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09031190000015"></a>Clause 121 establishes a duty on the public authority to inform the relevant conservation body, but only after a damaging event has taken place. This is not quite the same as the duty in Clause 122, where a potentially damaging authorisation cannot be given until 28 days after a similar notification. Will the Minister explain this discrepancy? What action does he expect a conservation body, or, indeed, a relevant authority, which will also be informed, to take after a damaging event has taken place? My amendments would also boost this duty to a requirement to consult the conservation bodies before undertaking damaging actions, thus ensuring an ongoing dialogue between the public authorities and the bodies best placed to know exactly what damage is likely to be caused and what measures might be taken to reduce or prevent that damage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09031190000016"></a>Other amendments in this group look at the many difficult assessments the public authority must make, the assessment of whether the harm done by an event is insignificant, the establishment of whether there are ways to avoid the harm or repair the damage and so on. It is to be hoped that these decisions and assessments would only be made after proper consultation with the statutory conservation bodies, where expertise and experience lie. I beg to move.</p>

The purpose of the amendment has to do with the advice and guidance that conservation bodies should bear in mind. They should think about any matters that might be detrimental to, or might hinder, the achievement of the objective. That might seem a little abstract. In tabling this amendment, we have drawn comparisons, as before, with terrestrial conservation legislation. This amendment would enable conservation bodies to do a bit more horizon-scanning. They would have a duty to do so, and to think about some of the threats that would come down the line. That is the particular reason for tabling this amendment.</p>

I say to the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, that I have also read a number of letters on these points from statutory conservation bodies. I hear what the noble Lord says about their fears that, once the first phase of the work has been carried out, they will no longer be listened to by the public authorities. I hope I can allay those fears. Clearly, we believe that the statutory conservation bodies have a vital role to play and I pay tribute to their work.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09031190000019"></a>By way of introduction, Clauses 121, 122 and 123 set out the roles and functions of public authorities and statutory conservation bodies. There is a different aspect in each clause. It is important to draw the distinctions between them, because these answer some of the points raised by the noble Lord. The purpose of Clause 121 is to place a general duty on each public authority to exercise its functions in a way that best furthers the conservation objectives for a marine conservation zone. Where the public authority thinks that exercising its functions is likely to conflict with its duty to further site objectives, it must inform the statutory conservation body.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09031190000020"></a>Clause 122 is more specific. It sets out that where a public authority thinks that an individual activity may significantly hinder the conservation objectives for a marine conservation zone, it must notify the statutory conservation body, which will then have 28 days to provide its advice. This clause essentially deals with matters on a case-by-case basis. I make it clear that a statutory conservation body need not wait to be asked for its advice. It can give it at any time under Clause 123(2) and all public authorities are required to have regard to that advice. My experience of the statutory conservation bodies, from my time at Defra, suggests that statutory conservation bodies are well able and well prepared to give such advice.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09031190000021"></a>Turning to the proposed amendments, I start with Amendments A167, A173 and A174. These concern the duty placed on public authorities to carry out their  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1219"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1219</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>functions in a manner that best furthers, or least hinders, the conservation objectives for a marine conservation zone. Subsection (2)(b) of Clause 121 recognises that, from time to time, public authorities will be unable to carry out their functions in a way that furthers that conservation objective. In such circumstances, the most that we can ask is for those authorities to least hinder the objectives. We cannot ask public authorities to do what is impossible. Furthermore, paragraph (b) makes clear to public authorities that if they cannot further the conservation objectives, they must still carry out their functions so as to do least harm.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09031190000022"></a>One example might be a case where the Environment Agency does work to build or maintain coastal flood defences. While it may not be possible for the agency to further the conservation objectives of a marine conservation zone, it may be able to choose not to carry out its operations at the time of year when there are large populations of migrating birds, or during fish-spawning. Building on this, Amendments A173 and A174 seek to relax the protection for a marine conservation zone by allowing a public authority to permit a potentially damaging act when the public benefit outweighs the risk of environmental damage. I accept that these are probing amendments, but there is a risk here. This part of Clause 122 says that once a site has been protected, the hurdle that needs to be jumped before permitting damaging activities is much higher than elsewhere. If an area is precious, we may permit damaging activity, but only if there are no alternatives; it is clearly for the greater public good; and we secure equivalent environmental benefit elsewhere. It is important to have that kind of safeguard.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09031190000023"></a>Amendments A168, A169, A170 and A172 focus on the relationship between public authorities and statutory conservation bodies. Essentially, the changes proposed by the amendments would require public authorities to wait for the advice of the statutory conservation body before carrying out any of their functions that might hinder the achievement of conservation objectives. We want public authorities in the marine environment to work closely and co-operatively with the statutory conservation bodies, but we are wary of introducing very bureaucratic procedures unless there is a good reason to do so. The clause is designed to ensure that if a body thinks that exercising its functions in general will cause problems for the marine conservation zones, it must inform the statutory conservation body. In effect, it must start a conversation about the problem.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09031190000024"></a>It gives the statutory conservation body the chance to address the problem and provide its advice. If the problems are difficult to resolve, this will take much longer than the 28 days foreseen in the amendment. One can envisage circumstances in which problems might be very difficult to resolve, given some of our previous debates on some of the tensions that are inevitable in such designation. The risk is that such advice might then be of limited value. However, this will not leave the statutory conservation bodies without a proper role in specific cases, or leave conservation zones unprotected. That is why we have Clause 122. Where, for instance, specific activities raise a problem,  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1220"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1220</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the relevant public authority must inform the statutory conservation body and give it 28 days to respond before taking a decision. Where the problem is defined and discrete, and specific countermeasures can be taken, the statutory conservation body has ample opportunity to provide its advice. That is why we draw a distinction between the two clauses and why 28 days is appropriate in one case but not the other.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09031190000025"></a>Amendment A172 would remove the significance test from the requirement to inform the statutory conservation body. I would argue that it should remain. The significance threshold performs a vital role in ensuring that public authorities and the statutory conservation bodies are not overwhelmed with notifications. Requiring the public authority to wait 28 days before authorising all applications would be an unnecessary level of caution and bureaucracy, and would not be proportionate. As I have said, the Bill already allows the statutory conservation bodies to provide advice and guidance where they have concerns about the collective effect of a number of insignificant activities. Clause 123(1) provides for conservation bodies to give advice and guidance, which public authorities are required to have regard in exercising their functions. The conservation bodies may choose to target their advice as they see fit, perhaps to specific sectors or issues and to the points where it will have the greatest influence possible. We think this provision is important; we do not want to lose this flexibility; we think that Amendment A178 might risk that by seeking to oblige statutory conservation bodies to give advice and guidance on all matters listed in Clause 123(1), either in relation to a particular marine conservation zone or marine conservation zones generally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09031190000026"></a>It is likely that that advice will normally cover the range of subjects listed in subsection (1), but it will clearly not be necessary to address all possible matters in every case. It is sensible to retain flexibility and to rely on the judgment of the statutory conservation bodies as to the need for and content of a particular piece of advice and guidance. The record of statutory conservation bodies would give me confidence that this flexibility was sensible.</p>

<a name="90311-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09031190000027"></a>Amendment A171 would mean that public authorities notified only the statutory conservation body, not the MMO or Scottish or Welsh Ministers, where appropriate, when a criminal offence had occurred that might or would significantly hinder the conservation objectives for a marine conservation zone. However, it is important that these bodies, which are responsible for enforcement, are made aware of damaging acts so that they can take any enforcement action necessary. There is a persuasive argument for retaining paragraph (a) of subsection (4).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09031190000028"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that it is also vital that the statutory conservation bodies report to the Secretary of State on any results from monitoring marine conservation zones. Those bodies are already required to give advice to the Government, so the Secretary of State can report to Parliament on progress on designating a network under Clause 120(1)(a). Therefore, I understand the reason for the amendment, but we think that the issue is already covered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09031190000029"></a>Amendment A175 is on the definition of damage relating to the roles of public authorities and statutory conservation bodies. &#147;Damage&#148; is already defined in Clause 122 as including,</p>
<ul><a name="09031190000069"></a>&#147;the prevention of an improvement&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031190000055"></a>What could &#147;improvement&#148; mean in the context of a zone&#146;s objectives other than movement towards or reaching them? That is certainly how we understand the word &#147;improvement&#148;, so we think that we have covered the concerns addressed by this amendment.</p>

I certainly want to reiterate the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, at the beginning of this debate that this is not a situation whereby the statutory conservation bodies will be heavily involved in the process of designation but will not be seen to have a continuing role. They will have such a role, and it will be an important one.</p>

He will remember, as will all other noble Lords who considered the CROW Act, that we debated at length why so many SSSIs were in an unfavourable condition. Very often a breach of duty by a public authority had led to that situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09031190000033"></a>We seek in this amendment to make sure that we have learnt the lessons of what happened to SSSIs and that public authorities think of their duties absolutely all the time. This amendment introduces a penalty to be imposed if authorities breach that duty. It aims to focus minds on the importance of being scrupulous about all their duties regarding an MCZ. In the beginning, when the MCZs are terrific new things, no doubt lots of effort will be made to fulfil those duties but, over time, as other pressures come up the agenda, a similar situation to what happened with SSSIs may arise. Their perceived importance gradually dropped and they were no longer as much a focus for people&#146;s attention. That led to the priority of SSSIs being rather ignored. We do not want that to happen to MCZs and that is why this amendment has been tabled. I beg to move.</p>

Our Amendments A183A and A183B are designed to tackle similar difficulties. The duties laid out in Clauses 121 and 122 make very clear the position of public authorities in relation to MCZs and certain decisions. We support the noble Baroness&#146;s new clause, which would specify the nature of the offence and the fine that it would be possible to incur if the public authority breached this duty. Does the Minister agree that the severity of the offence should be made clear? Does he think that the level of fine is appropriate and may act as a deterrent for any public authority that is hoping to breach its duties towards MCZs in order to meet another requirement?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09031190000035"></a>The Bill as it stands enables the appropriate statutory conservation body to request an explanation in writing from a public authority that has failed, or is perceived to have failed, in its duties. We are in full support of this clause, but it does not go far enough. Our Amendments A183A and A183B would require that the explanation must be forwarded to the &#147;relevant authority&#148; and that this body must be allowed to publish any explanation that it receives.</p>

Amendment A176, moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, would mean that a public authority that, without reasonable excuse, failed to comply with one of the duties would be guilty of an offence. I note that the duties relate mainly to the requirement to inform the statutory conservation body of something that may significantly hinder the conservation objectives of a marine conservation zone.</p>

<a name="90311-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09031190000038"></a>The duties also relate to the requirement not to authorise acts where there is a significant risk to a site, unless certain conditions are met. I hope that noble Lords will appreciate that we have taken great care to ensure that these duties are clear and unambiguous. Clauses 121 and 122, which the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, spoke about favourably, refer to actions that public authorities must undertake.</p>

<a name="90311-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09031190000039"></a>When Parliament, if this Bill becomes an Act, places this statutory duty on a public authority, it expects that body to comply with the legal obligation created. It is unusual for a breach of a statutory duty by a public authority to be made an offence, which is the objective of the amendment. The usual remedy against any public authority that fails to meet its commitments, obligations and duties is judicial review. We have constructed these clauses on that premise.</p>

<a name="90311-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09031190000040"></a>The noble Baroness raised the issue of SSSIs and her concern about enforcement. She will appreciate, however, that SSSIs are fairly different from marine conservation zones. She is shaking her head, but she has not given me the chance to deploy the difference, so I shall try to persuade her to revise her opinion. The big difference is obvious. With SSSIs, there can be a number of overlapping authorities with different competences and those authorities may, therefore, undertake actions that impact on SSSIs. The relationship between the authorities and their responsibilities may become the subject of real concern. That is a bit different from the situation at sea. We are not talking about a range of different authorities that will be involved; the number of authorities with statutory duties at sea is, by definition, very limited. That means that saying who has the obligation or duty and against whom it must be enforced is that much clearer than with SSSIs. I respect the noble Baroness&#146;s knowledge of SSSIs and attendant issues and I understand that she has anxiety in certain areas, but this is a different configuration of public responsibility and the degree of confusion that she is worried about will not occur.</p>

Is there to be a range of bodies to which functions can be delegated and, if so, is the Minister saying that it would always be quite clear who would be in breach of their duty? It seems to me that, given that clause early in the Bill, it would be possible for some confusion to arise as to who was responsible. Once the MMO had delegated a function, which authority would become responsible for its breach of duty?</p>

I am trying to reduce the effect of the argument that says, &#147;The trouble with the marine conservation zones is that they will run into some of the difficulties that we have with terrestrial definition&#148;. Well, terrestrial definition can give rise to conflicting responsibilities with regard to land&#151;there are landlords and there is ownership of the land, which in itself creates an important dimension of the designation of such sites. That is not the case with the sea. The MMO does not delegate its authority in quite the same way. It will be delegating to other public bodies responsibilities that are clear and limited in number and which do not raise these issues in the same way. Under Clause 15, it is answerable for its responsibility as a public body; it cannot devolve that to another authority and not be held responsible. The challenge to the MMO will not be a fine; the challenge to the MMO, a body of that significance and salience, is bound to be judicial review, as it would be in all cases of a public body of that stature.</p>

All his emphasis on the different circumstances of SSSIs and MCZs is a bit of a red herring, frankly. The suggestion that there might be different authorities involved in SSSIs is not really the key issue. What will be the remedy if a public authority does not do its duty? The noble Lord&#146;s reliance on judicial review is a bit worrying. So often in this House&#151;in this building&#151;Ministers spend their time trying to avoid circumstances where the only remedy is judicial review, which is tortuous and expensive.</p>

What is significant will have to be worked through as we operate the zones. Scientific evidence on that which is doing, or potentially doing, such damage will condition the issue. The conservation zones will be different from each other in this respect, according to what the objectives are. It is not possible for us to specify what is significant. However, we are seeking to identify that if a public authority is not carrying out its duty, judicial review is the normal way of resolving the matter.</p>

I recognise that the process is not entered into lightly because it is costly and complex. But we are talking about a public authority in action, in a very significant way, charged with not fulfilling the duty that has been laid upon it by the legislation. If it had to be identified which authority was negligent, I can see a case for suggesting that judicial review might not be appropriate. I understand why in many cases people argue against it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09031196000004"></a>The number of authorities involved is very limited. The MMO does not devolve authority; it stands as the responsible authority.

<a name="90311-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09031196000005"></a>Under Clause 124, the statutory conservation bodies can require a public authority to explain its actions. The question of being able to get from a public authority an explanation of what has occurred and therefore the evidential base for any future challenge is contained there. Proposing, as the amendment does, that fines should be imposed on a public body with clear obligations is an odd concept of a sanction. It should be more significant than that, which is why judicial review is the only appropriate remedy.</p>

After all, those who use the sea and are public authorities might have very significant interests which could not be put into the public domain. I am thinking of our defence institutions as well as Customs and Excise. If there is an exercise on a role being carried out which relates to smuggling, putting into the public domain a demand for an explanation of what is going on and the reasons why it is being carried out might not be in the public interest in those rather more specific circumstances. In general terms, I accept the concept of the amendment. Generally, as Clause 124 provides, the public authority can be held to account if it is negligent and that alone, in terms of naming and shaming, will be an important sanction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09031196000013"></a>It will help if the Minister writes to us, because, like the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, I am still confused about who will face sanctions under the scheme of delegation. The Minister prays in aid Clause 124, but it is a pretty feeble stipulation that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031196000119"></a>&#147;on a request the authority can provide an explanation in writing&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031196000102"></a>That does not constitute naming and shaming. Even if it did, naming and shaming a quango is not the same as naming and shaming a council that is subject to election every four years, where the sanction may have some effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09031196000014"></a>We are giving immense power to the MMO and ought to think seriously about the sanctions that will be applied when it fails: when it has not pursued its duty as it should, or when it has delegated a duty that has fallen between two public authorities. That is an issue that this debate has opened up&#151;the fact that there may be a hole down which important duties may fall in some circumstances. I look forward to receiving the Minister&#146;s letter giving more detail on that matter. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="90311-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09031196000016"></a>Under Clause 125, the MMO is allowed to make by-laws,</p>
<ul><a name="09031196000120"></a>&#147;for the purposes of furthering the conservation objectives stated for an MCZ in England&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031196000103"></a>There are a number of by-laws prohibiting certain activities. Clause 125(3)(b) prohibits or restricts,</p>
<ul><a name="09031196000121"></a>&#147;entry into, or any movement or other activity within, the MCZ by recreational vessels or (where appropriate) vehicles&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031196000104"></a>Recreational vessels are singled out only in this paragraph. Elsewhere, &#147;any vessel&#148; is the term used. I looked up the interpretation and saw that &#147;vehicles&#148; refers to hovercraft or bicycles. In more than 50 years of maritime meanderings all over the world, I have on occasion come across a hovercraft, but I admit to never having come across a bicycle. I do recall an occasion when, after a particularly good lunch in a French port, two of my fellow crew members decided that it would be a good idea to hire a tandem, and proceeded to ride straight off the edge of the quay into the sea. Happily, they both resurfaced, one still with a cigar in his mouth. The tandem, unfortunately, did not, and only some nifty work with a grappling hook placated a rather enraged Frenchman. There is also a saying that the three most useless things on a yacht are a bicycle, a stepladder and a naval officer. Looking quickly around the Chamber, I hope that we have none of the latter present.</p>

<a name="90311-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09031196000017"></a>Does this prohibition refer to an MCZ that comes up to the high water mark? At low water, the beach would be exposed, but presumably there would still be an area of sea at the end. I understand the need to exclude bicycles and recreational craft such as canoes or things that you can haul up the beach; but surely, if it goes into the sea as well, why should the prohibition apply only to recreational vessels? I would like an explanation. Amendments A224 and A225 are subsequential. However, on reflection, the drafting of A225 leaves something to be desired.</p>

<a name="90311-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09031196000018"></a>Amendments A208 and A209 refer to something quite different and come under Clause 137, where exceptions are mentioned to offences committed under Sections 135 and 136. One exception stipulates that someone is not guilty of an offence when the action taken,</p>
<ul><a name="09031196000122"></a>&#147;was necessary for the purpose of securing the safety of any vessel, or of preventing damage to any vessel or cargo, from any danger which could not have been foreseen or anticipated&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031196000105"></a>My amendments would alter that to read,</p>
<ul><a name="09031196000123"></a>&#147;was necessary for the purpose of securing the safety of any vessel or cargo, or of preventing damage to or by any vessel or cargo, from any danger&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09031196000019"></a>The reason for the first amendment is that the safety of the vessel will invariably be at one with the safety of the cargo, but occasions may occur where action is needed only in relation to the cargo. This may arise where part of the cargo has to be destroyed or rendered innocuous if it represents a danger to other goods, for example by drifting, leakage or contamination. The first amendment is designed to cover this eventuality.</p>

<a name="90311-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09031196000020"></a>The second amendment relates to damage by a vessel and would cover a situation where it was necessary, for example to enter an otherwise prohibited area to preserve the safety of the vessel. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, talked about recreational vessels. Extent might be important where you have an MCZ that goes out from 10 nautical miles to 14 nautical miles and is particularly valuable for dolphins and basking sharks. The by-law-making powers stop at 12 nautical miles.</p>

<a name="90311-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09031196000022"></a>In summer, when you have an interesting pod of dolphins, you will often see recreational vessels going to look at them. We hope that they observe the guidance on behaving properly around whales and dolphins, but they do not always. Sometimes they do not slow down and sometimes they follow the creatures, which they are not supposed to do. In fact, if you stay still, you will often be much luckier, because the creatures will come right up to you and you will get a fantastic view of them.</p>

<a name="90311-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09031196000023"></a>The purpose of the by-law-making powers is to allow the MMO to make whatever by-laws it thinks necessary to protect the features for which the MCZ was designated. I understand that as far as international shipping and fisheries that come within the CFP are concerned, the powers have to stop at 12 nautical miles. However, for conservation purposes, I would like to explore with the Minister why they should not extend beyond 12 nautical miles.</p>

If we make it too complicated, we will look as if we are somehow penalising comparatively small operations without proper justification. Although it is obviously important that we identify a potential problem, if we do it in an especially complicated way, there will be a lot of resistance.</p>

I especially enjoyed hearing about his antics with a bicycle in the south of France.</p>

<a name="90311-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09031196000028"></a>One point has already been touched on by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. On Monday, we discussed the inability of the Government to impose fishing restrictions outside the 12-mile limit. Can the Minister be similarly helpful today by telling us what rights vessels have as to free navigation and so on that British authorities will be unable to restrict?</p>

<p><a name="st_160"></a>
<a name="09031196000029"></a><b><a name="90311-0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09031196000143"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this debate, especially the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, whose group of amendments relate to a very important dimension of the life of our nation. As a maritime trading nation, it is vital that we get the treatment of shipping and other vessels in the Bill correct. I am grateful to noble Lords for identifying areas of concern.</p>

<a name="90311-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09031196000030"></a>Amendment 184 is intended to ensure that recreational vessels are treated in the same way as commercial vessels. I should stress that the Bill is designed to introduce the power to make by-laws so that activities that would not otherwise be regulated can be controlled if necessary. At the same time, we do not want to put an unreasonable burden on industry. Shipping is a vital part of the British economy and a very high percentage of British trade is carried by ship. The differential application of the prohibition contained in Clause 125(3)(b) is valid on economic and better regulation grounds. I hear what the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, says: let us be careful that we do not make prescriptions for some that complicate matters which do not obtain for others.</p>

<a name="90311-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09031196000031"></a>It will be recognised that the Government operate under significant constraints in certain aspects as regards by-laws. The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, raised that issue. For example, we considered whether by-laws should extend beyond 12 miles from the shore, but concluded that they should not because the features occurring there tend to be less sensitive or vulnerable to human impact because they occur in deeper water or over large areas, so fewer unregulated activities occur. Damaging activities that occur tend to be dispersed over much wider areas of sea, which is well beyond the 12-mile limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09031196000032"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Greenway and Lord Tyler, asked about commercial vessels. The simple fact of the matter is that, as the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, knows better than anyone else in this House, we have obligations under international law that restrict our power to regulate commercial vessels. Those vessels can be regulated under mechanisms set up under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, but they are not subject to the by-laws of an individual nation following its particular and narrower objectives.  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1231"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I emphasise that we have limited competence in the waters beyond 12 nautical miles which restrict the use of by-laws, about which the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, was asking me. We also have differences under international law between commercial vessels and what we identify as recreational vessels, so some parts of the complexities that noble Lords, with their usual perceptiveness, have identified as difficulties in this area, are genuine difficulties born of British power in relation to the law of the sea.</p>

<a name="90311-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09031196000033"></a>That does not mean to say that we are without any means to regulate commercial shipping if we need to do so. Other mechanisms are available that can be used to constrain commercial shipping. Where there is a compelling case for the designation of an area of sea as an area that ships should not enter, it is open to the Government to make a submission to the International Maritime Organisation to that effect. An IMO-adopted area to be avoided can be designated in such a way as to apply to all types of ships, commercial and recreational. It will be recognised what a significant action it would be to seek the definition of an area in those terms. Consequently, it will be appreciated why the Bill provides for by-laws operating for a more limited area from the shore, the 12 nautical miles, which does not raise those more crucial matters of the law of the sea.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09031196000034"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked me about the enforcement of MCZs. We sent a note yesterday to all noble Lords who are involved in the Bill and have participated in our debates about how by-laws and other measures protect the MCZs. We hope that that document will explain how enforcement measures fit together. It is a complex issue. The document runs to several pages, so I hope that the Committee will not ask me to read it out. I am not sure that I could do so accurately, as it is also in tabular form and with a whole range of abbreviations of which I am not a master. If the Committee will forgive me, I shall not attempt such an arduous exercise. However, that document is on its way to noble Lords; it was sent out yesterday. I hope that it is appreciated that we recognise that there are issues in the amendments to which we need to respond, and that we are doing the best we can to identify accurately the issues involved.</p>

<a name="90311-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09031196000035"></a>In addition to accepting necessary action taken to secure the safety of a vessel, Amendment 208, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, would extend the exception in Clause 137(1)(e) to securing the safety of cargo. Amendment 209 would exempt damage done to a marine conservation zone by a vessel acting in emergency. Of course, we should not criminalise those whose actions unavoidably harm the environment in the course of emergency involving the saving of lives. We discussed that aspect earlier and of course the Government are four square with the noble Lord in his concern on that. However, we are not so sure about securing the safety of a cargo. Is that sufficient reason to cause harm in an area which we ought to take into account? Cargo, after all, is replaceable and insurable. It is not obvious that we should put on cargo as high a valuation as we put on the protection of valued parts of the environment, which we cannot insure or replace. So we have, as the noble Lord will appreciate, reservations about that amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09031196000036"></a>On Amendment A209, I can assure the noble Lord that Clause 137 as drafted provides that where a person takes necessary action to secure the safety of a vessel in an emergency and in so doing damages a marine conservation zone or contravenes a by-law, that person will certainly benefit from the exception described in that clause. As for the issues raised in Amendments A224 and A225, we address the issue of the meaning of a recreational vessel. I listened very carefully to the noble Lord, and I have to admit that when I heard the phrase &#147;recreational vessel&#148; I did not think of a bike. I am glad for his reassurance that bikes do not prove very effective at sea.</p>

<a name="90311-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09031196000037"></a>I would like to offer a further reassurance. Although the term &#147;recreational vessel&#148; is defined separately from &#147;vessel&#148; and is not as a subset of it, the two definitions are clearly related. There is no risk that a recreational vessel would be considered as a vessel and bound by the same rules. We want to make clear that distinction.</p>

<a name="90311-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09031196000038"></a>Noble Lords will forgive me if I have not answered all the points. I have to say that I have had from the Box a proliferation of more than helpful notes, rocketing its success rate to an unparalleled level. Therefore, if I have not satisfied noble Lords, it is my fault alone. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The part of the coast that I am thinking of is not one to which the Bill applies. However, there must be areas in the inshore waters where small businessmen, in a small way, in small boats, regularly set lobster pots very near the coast. Would that disturb a conservation zone? Would that be something for which a by-law would be required&#151;not an emergency one, but one under the other clause?</p>

However, the answer to the noble Baroness&#146;s question has to be framed in terms of the nature of the marine conservation zone and the conditions established for it. She is right to express anxiety: there may be circumstances, though I am not knowledgeable enough to describe them, where that form of fishing did present a challenge to the conditions of a particular zone.

I was trying to reassure him on why we have a distinction between commercial vessels and recreational vessels, since we are all concerned about the necessary obligations to keep commercial shipping as free as possible. The issue of recreational vessels makes the mind boggle; one thinks, for example, of vessels that plies the Thames and then drives up Whitehall. I do not know how that DUKW-type vessel is identified, but I do know that the capacity and genius of inventors and developers of transport know no bounds. If we tried within the framework of this Bill to be at all precise about that which we circumscribe, we would get into great difficulties almost immediately. So he will have to accept the intent of the broad divisions in the Bill, and the issues of contention will be on the margins.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Montrose, has identified an issue, and I am grateful to him for that. When drafting this subsection, we were concerned to maximise the chance of everyone with an interest having the opportunity to express views. That is the objective. However, the noble Lord is right that we are in danger of imposing disproportionate burdens on the MMO. Indeed, he described them in such a way that it is clear that they could be not only disproportionate but absolutely indefensible. He is right that, in the most extreme case, anyone who could remotely be said to express an interest could be expected to receive their copy. We will look at this again in the light of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09031196000053"></a>On the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, I emphasise that emergency by-laws are intended to be a contemporary measure. They should not normally remain in force for more than 12 months, as this is generally sufficient for a permanent by-law to be made if necessary. A longer period may be needed, however, and Clause 127(7) allows the MMO to extend the protection for up to six months by making a further by-law. I emphasise that the MMO could do so only when it intends to make a permanent by-law and has already published notice of it. I reassure noble Lords that Clause 126 makes it clear that, to comply with Clause 127(7), the MMO must ensure that its notice complies with the requirements of Clause 127(8). I hope that that gives the noble Lord the assurance that he seeks and that, having scored bull&#146;s-eyes, both noble Lords will feel able not to press their amendments to a vote.</p>

The amendments in this group have been tabled to explore the penalty levels set by the Government in Clauses 135 and 138. They could well have been tabled to Clause 136, but the noble Baroness, Lady Young, has tabled her Amendment A199, which highlights the discrepancy between the penalty levels in Clauses 135 and 136, and will do just as well. The difference between &#163;5,000 and &#163;50,000 is enormous, and I look forward to hearing the Minister explain his reasoning behind it.</p>

<a name="90311-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09031196000056"></a>Amendment A217A deals with the penalty level in Clause 138, which sets the level of monetary penalty that the enforcement authority can impose. This level is very low. We do not necessarily disagree with this; fixed monetary penalties may be a cheap and quick method of getting through a large case load without clogging up the courts, but they should not be seen as a substitute for proper legal proceedings where the circumstances warrant. Where a serious breach of by-laws has occurred, the enforcement authority should proceed under Clause 136 rather than Clause 138.</p>

<a name="90311-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09031196000057"></a>I am curious as to what sort of situation the Minister thinks a maximum penalty of &#163;200 will be effective in. It is too small to be a meaningful deterrent for many of those who might intend to breach the by-laws for commercial gain, but enough to be a significant and not necessarily useful nuisance for those who accidentally breach a by-law. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment in this group is an interesting possible alternative and I look forward to hearing the response that it receives. I beg to move.</p>

Those mistakes might be dealt with better, and a far better relationship might be built up between the stakeholders using the sea and the authority trying to enforce this regime, if, instead of going straight to a fine, a caution was an option. Beyond the simple mistake that might get overlooked, there very likely could be a next stage where a person repeats an activity that they have done

They may not understand that what they are doing is serious and that there is a good reason for not continuing to do it.

The noble Duke who led on this group presented it for me admirably, but I should like to add a few things. In the draft Bill, the penalties for offences against by-laws or orders were the same as in Clause 136 and were as tough as the penalties already in the Bill for damaging protected features. Between the draft Bill and the Bill as introduced, the offence of breaching MCZ by-laws or orders has been downgraded. It was an either-way offence with a maximum fine of &#163;50,000 in the magistrates&#146; court and an unlimited fine in the Crown Court. It has now been downgraded to a summary-only offence with a maximum fine of &#163;5,000.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09031196000060"></a>I can imagine the Minister&#146;s defence. He will say that these penalties for offences against by-laws or orders are merely intended for minor offences of the sort that by-laws might generally represent, and that there are other penalties for the much more serious offence of damaging protected features or offences caused and enforced by other bodies in line with the briefing that he indicated had been sent out yesterday, which gives in quite great detail who can do what to whom. But this is not the case.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09031196000061"></a>The reality is that contravening by-laws or orders can be extremely serious on occasions. Reverting to an either-way offence with a maximum fine of &#163;50,000 in the magistrates&#146; court and an unlimited fine in the Crown Court would leave it to the courts to decide how serious individual cases are and provide a much wider, more flexible range of individual penalties for the by-law offence. That does not mean that the courts will necessarily hand out the maximum on every occasion. They rarely do. But &#163;5,000 is hardly any deterrent for the sort of things that could be represented by by-law or order contraventions. I hope that the Minister, in whatever way he was swayed to accept the change between the draft Bill and this Bill, might now be swayed back to his original intent, which was by far the better one.</p>

It is important that we get this right. I fully accept that we do not want a situation in which there are not adequate penalties for appropriate transgressions. Perhaps I might explain the decision that we reached. It is right that we should explore the level of the penalty. Interestingly, as I understand it, Amendment A198, to which the noble Duke spoke, would make the breach of by-laws a matter of civil law and therefore not subject to prosecution in the court. On that, I am with the noble Baroness, Lady Young. In that case, we need to retain the threat of criminal conviction and a fine of up to &#163;5,000 to act as a deterrent. We agree that without that by-laws are likely to be less effective, since the only sanction would be a fixed monetary penalty up to level 1 on the standard scale, which is currently &#163;200. I appreciate that  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1238"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1238</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Amendment A217A would remove that upper limit and I certainly can see that a single form of sanction to deal with all breaches of a by-law might be simpler, but we do not think that it would be fairer or as effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09031196000063"></a>Relatively modest monetary penalties may be fair and proportionate in most cases and act as a deterrent for most people, but we need the deterrent of higher fines and a criminal record to deal with people who recklessly or repeatedly risk causing harm to a site. I well understand that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, thinks that we do not go far enough in relation to that and wishes to go higher. Certainly, there needs to be a hierarchy. The noble Duke asked me to give an example of an activity that might attract a &#163;200 penalty. As Members of the Committee know, it is always dangerous to answer something like that and I would rather resist, but an example might be a person exceeding the speed limit on a wretched jet ski or entering a prohibited area but not causing damage.</p>

Jet skis and conservation have long had difficulty coexisting. There is a difference between a jet skier going at a moderate speed in a prohibited area and the flagrant mass jet skiing at high speeds in very sensitive areas that sometimes occurs. That would be an example of a by-law or order where a judge, if he had the option, could take advice and apply higher penalties where necessary, particularly in the case of repeat offenders. In some recreational activities, the problem is that people repeat-offend and regard it as a legitimate cost of their sport to shell out the odd low-level fine.</p>

However, does she not see that there is a difference? A fixed penalty notice might be appropriate for a jet skier who inadvertently goes into an area where he or she should not, but if someone acts in the way that she described, we have the ability to pursue them under Clause 135(2). I think that the noble Baroness is saying that she does not think that level 5 is sufficient.</p>

However, a prosecution for intentional damage, which is a serious matter, will be brought against people who commit acts of environmental vandalism that cause significant harm to a site.

<p><a name="09031196000107"></a>That, essentially, could be an unlimited fine. I shall come the point about cautions in a moment, but we have a hierarchy here and we consider that, in relation to by-laws where a fixed penalty notice is not appropriate, a level 5 fine is the right potential fine and would act as a deterrent.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09031196000068"></a>On the question of enforcement, I agree entirely with the noble Baroness that there will be people who make simple mistakes, where a caution is entirely the right approach. I shall not bore noble Lords by praying in aid the Health and Safety Executive, but its approach to proportionate regulation is entirely right. The executive starts from the premise that, unless an act has clearly either caused harm or is likely to cause serious harm, everything is done to encourage people to do the right thing, and from there you can move up the hierarchy of sanctions. The noble Baroness is right about that.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09031196000069"></a>I can assure the noble Baroness that we do not need to make express provision. A simple caution is non-statutory and can be administered by prosecuting authorities without the need for an express power. The conditional caution has a statutory basis in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and Section 27 makes provision for prosecutors other than the CPS to administer conditional cautions if a need is identified for giving them such a power; the mechanism exists and the noble Baroness&#146;s point is very well taken.</p>

It may be a Freudian slip that indicates that he is willing to accept some of the amendments being put forward today.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09031196000072"></a>I shall speak first to Amendment A201. We should welcome the idea of a general offence of causing damage to the protected features of MCZs, but as drafted you would need to prove all three elements beyond reasonable doubt. That is going to be a pretty tall order. Did the person actually commit the prohibited act without lawful excuse? Did he know or should he have known that the feature to which the act relates is part of an MCZ, and has the act significantly hindered or will hinder the achievement of the MCZ conservation objectives? There are two difficulties here. It is going to be hard enough trying to prove that someone committed the act out at sea, and you also have to prove that he knew or ought to have known that the feature was in an MCZ. That will be extremely difficult because the zones will not have notices erected at their entrances stating, &#147;You are entering an MCZ&#148;. I cannot think of legislation governing any other walk of life that I have had experience of where ignorance of a particular protection or designation is a suitable defence. Under many other pieces of legislation, to say, &#147;I am sorry, but I didn&#146;t know it was against the law&#148;, would on many occasions have both the lawyers and the police laughing as you said it. That is a real stumbling block.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09031196000073"></a>Equally difficult is the provision that it has to be demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt that the act has significantly hindered or will hinder achievement of the conservation objectives. The reality of the marine environment is that, if you wait long enough, there is a strong possibility that what is wrong in it will ultimately recover. There are some examples where that is not the case, such as the Newfoundland cod stocks, but we could see hours of legal argument as people try to demonstrate that, in the long run, the conservation objectives would be met and therefore their act has not significantly hindered them. I am concerned that we are putting three tests into place that will make it almost impossible to prove a case beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09031196000074"></a>My other amendments are Amendments A202 to A206, and I am delighted to be joined by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, on these. We ought to learn from a history of failure in the protection of SSSIs in terrestrial conservation. The offence as currently drafted applies only to deliberate damage, which was the approach of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981&#151;indeed, this Bill is threatening to come perilously close to being almost as long in terms of our debates. The reality was that very few prosecutions were brought under the Act because it was abominably difficult to prove deliberate damage. You have to get inside someone&#146;s head and prove intention, which is notoriously difficult, and sites continued to be damaged.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09031196000075"></a>The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 changed all that by strengthening the provisions for SSSIs to cover reckless damage and indeed disturbance, which is the point of Amendment A203. Disturbance  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1241"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>can be a real cause of damage both in the short and the long run for wildlife. So far as SSSIs were concerned, the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 also strengthened the protections by removing the requirement to prove that a person who caused the damage to an SSSI knew that it was so designated, reflecting the provisions in Amendment A201, which talk about knowing when you are in an MCZ and causing damage. We have ample evidence from the terrestrial environment that an offence that will apply only to deliberate damage, which does not include disturbance, and will exempt people from blame if they can demonstrate that they did not know that it was an MCZ will be a pretty weak element in the Bill. Since the protected features of MCZs are the absolute fundamentals of the conservation elements of this Bill, I believe that the Government need to strengthen these provisions considerably. I beg to move.</p>

She is understandably concerned about the limited circumstances in which the more stringent offences in Clause 136 become liable. I am not sure that I agree with the removal of subsection (1)(b) completely for fear that enforcement authorities will not take the appropriate steps to inform the public about MCZs, but certainly subsection (1)(c) is a stringent burden to be overcome. The way this is drafted makes successful prosecutions unlikely. I hope the Minister will take account of what was said by the noble Baroness in reviewing this subsection.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="0903126000002"></a>Why has the Minister decided that it is only an offence if significant hindrance is caused? It is the accumulative effect of many damaging acts, often small in themselves, which has harmed the marine environment up until now. This clause would seem to allow this to continue. How significant would an act have to be for Clause 136 to apply? I know the Minister is reluctant to detail this but I hope he can see the importance of the point the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness makes.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="0903126000003"></a>As the noble Baroness pointed out, we are joint signatories to the majority of the amendments in this group. They also extend the definition of &#147;injure&#148; to include &#147;disturb&#148;. As the noble Baroness set out, disturbing many species is akin to injuring them. This is in line with other marine protection legislation. I would like to hear the Minister&#146;s views on &#147;recklessly&#148;, particularly as he used that word, as the noble Baroness pointed out and I noted down. The word &#147;recklessly&#148; can be an indictable offence and I would like to see it included in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="0903126000004"></a>I would also like to take the opportunity to ask about the possibility of somebody being caught with clear intent of committing a prohibited act.

In the interests of the expedition wished upon me earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, I do not have anything to add, but the Minister should be aware that there is considerable support for these amendments around the House.</p>

<p><a name="st_191"></a>
<a name="0903126000006"></a><b><a name="90311-0011.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="0903126000035"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> This carries on our debate about whether we have the balance right and whether there are sufficient sanctions contained in the Bill to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent damaging or reckless behaviour. I fully accept the importance of this.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="0903126000007"></a>I will start with the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Young. Essentially, it widens the scope of the general offence by removing the defences in Clause 136(1). I understand where she is coming from and why she is concerned about the effect of the defences. If we were to go down the route that she suggests, the problem is that the person would be deemed to have committed an offence even if they could not have been expected to know that a feature was protected, and even where no significant harm occurred. Our concern is to get the balance right. We clearly want there to be deterrents so that there are sufficient sanctions and sufficient confidence that when prosecutions are taken, they will be successful if the evidence is there. We are concerned about well-intentioned and responsible people finding themselves unwittingly in breach of the law. That is the reason for the defences as they are set out. We do not want to criminalise people whose behaviour is unlikely to have discernable conservation impact.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="0903126000008"></a>Giving examples is dangerous, as I have already discovered tonight. Clause 136(1)(b) is an important matter and states:</p>
<ul><a name="0903126000030"></a>&#147;at the time of doing the act, the person knows, or ought to have known, that the feature to which the act relates is in, or forms part of, an MCZ&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903126000027"></a>This part of the clause relies on what a person actually knows or what it is reasonable to expect the person to know in the light of the activity they are carrying out. If the person knows that a feature is part of a marine conservation zone and intentionally damages it, clearly they should be guilty of the offence. In other cases, it may well be that a responsible person would take certain steps to inform themselves about any restrictions on any activities they wish to pursue in an area. It is reasonable, for example, to expect a person to inform themselves about the conditions of a marine licence under which they are operating. It would also be reasonable for a person who was diving to collect shellfish to check whether there were any restrictions on what shellfish might be collected from the seabed in an area. This is not a carte-blanche defence. It is entirely reasonable to expect a responsible person to take steps to inform themselves. An example of what might not be caught by this defence might be damage caused because relevant information was not readily available, although it was sought about protected features or restrictions on activities in appropriate places.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="0903126000009"></a>On the question of reckless damage, I find myself in sympathy with the point the noble Baroness raised, which is fortunate since I used that word perhaps unguardedly a moment or two ago&#151;indeed recklessly.  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1243"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1243</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I agree that people who know about a marine conservation zone but simply do not care if they damage it should be subject to this offence. I will take the amendment away and give serious consideration to it before Report because I think the point has been well and truly made.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="0903126000010"></a>Amendment A203 extends the general offence to include intentional disturbance of animals. This is an important amendment linked to Amendment A222, which provides a definition of disturbance. I do not disagree with the point put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor: the question is how to deal with it. The Government&#146;s approach is that because the kind of activity that might cause disturbance will differ between sites, it is better dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The Bill allows for potentially disturbing activities to be controlled through by-laws, which have the advantage of being easier to enforce and provide greater clarity for sea users. Disturbance might be caused, for example, by people straying too close to a group of animals through innocent curiosity or as part of an organised wild-life watching trip, or perhaps through using machinery which emits a loud noise or is fast-moving, such as our favoured jet skis. Where a site is considered vulnerable to such disturbance, the Bill allows for by-laws to be made. We believe that these can control the doing of anything which will disturb any object, animal or plant within a marine conservation zone.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="0903126000011"></a>Why do we look to by-laws? Because they can be readily adapted to deal with a specific threat and will often be a more effective means of protecting a site than a general offence. For example, where a community of seabirds is vulnerable to disturbance during a particular time of the year, a by-law could prohibit particular activities in a specific area during that time of the year. In that way, restrictions will be kept to the minimum necessary. They will be expressed in ways which are clearly understood by everyone and it should be clear whether or not an offence has occurred.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="0903126000012"></a>The definition of disturbance proposed in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment would make it difficult to prosecute offenders. The measure of noise which may disturb a plant or an animal, or the extent to which an organism has been stressed by it, can be difficult to prove. There are other aspects to disturbance which we think make it better controlled through by-laws. A single act of disturbance is likely to have a temporary impact and . may become a problem only when combined with other sources of disturbance over a period of time. Therefore disturbance is different in character from the kind of intentional damage that we consider merits the introduction of a general offence. That is why it is probably better approached through by-laws, which can be much more specific and almost on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="0903126000013"></a>I recognise that this is very important but we think that we have got the hierarchy right. We understand the point about recklessness and that we need some defences, but we do not intend these defences to be used in a way that enables wrongdoers to get off, if I can put it that way. I hope it is clear, from the way I have explained the paragraph (b) part of the defence, that it is not good enough to plead simple ignorance. There are expectations that go alongside that defence.</p>

Given what is contained in Clauses 125 and 126, do I take it that the by-laws would be brought into being only by the MMO? If not, who else would bring them in? It is clearly different from terrestrial zones where it might be brought in by other people. I accept the Minister&#146;s argument that the Government are trying to get a balance within the Bill&#151;that is extremely important&#151;but a difficulty may sometimes arise where people should have known, but did not know, that they were committing an offence. That is a very fine point.</p>

<a name="90311-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="0903126000015"></a>In our earlier discussions, we were talking about foreign vessels coming into our zones. It will be quite a challenge to ensure that international shipping and the people who use our waters are aware of the by-laws&#151;I remember we had a long discussion on buoys and markers&#151;and I seek clarification on who is entitled to make the by-laws and on the way in which the Government anticipate getting that information out into the public domain. Sometimes offences are committed by people who have no understanding that they are committing them, and sometimes people deliberately and knowingly commit offences. A certain amount of flexibility to deal with such situations is sensible and I am happy with that, but I seek guidance on the by-law situation.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="0903126000029"></a>&#147;The MMO may make one or more byelaws for the purpose of furthering the conservation objectives stated for an MCZ in England&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0903126000028"></a>It is for Welsh Ministers to make by-laws in Wales. Scotland is not covered under these provisions because they deal with inshore waters, which is a devolved matter. Therefore it is a matter entirely for Scotland in that respect. By-laws can be made alongside the creation of MCZs, but, equally, further by-laws can be made in the light of experience. Issues around disturbance might be anticipated or they might be made in the light of experience, so there is sufficient flexibility.</p>

They are the authorities that might well be making by-laws on that area not covered by the marine conservation zone but running adjacent to it. Disturbance of the sort mentioned by the Minister, such as excessive noise, may well originate from outside the marine conservation zone and it may be that a local authority might have by-laws on access and things of this nature. They might not be part of this Bill, but will the Minister clarify that?</p>

The point made by the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, is that, for example, there may be disturbance which disturbs people on the land as much as the animals in the sea. I think that is what he is saying. He indicated that as regards the sea, in a marine conservation zone, the by-laws would fall to be made by the MMO, but that one might hope for a consistent approach from the relevant local authority. They are different bodies and will have to take their own decisions, but, as we have discussed in so much of this Bill, let us hope that they will work together.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="0903126000022"></a>I accept the Minister&#146;s argument about the efficacy of by-laws applying locally to specific situations over blanket legislation. It is extraordinarily difficult. Most of us would like to think that we knew a villain when we saw one, but it is difficult to actually describe one in legislative form. Some of the difficulty we are having with this is not in disagreeing about what we are trying to achieve, but about the nuance of trying to exclude innocence from punishment and, at the same time, identifying guilt and, indeed, recklessness.</p>

As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has suggested, where it is appropriate to point out to people that they are doing the wrong thing, but no particular harm has been caused, we want a system that encourages people to do the right thing. We have already heard how caution might also be brought into play. Equally, it is clear that where real damage has been caused, strong action needs to be taken.</p>

The amendments in this group are very important probing amendments in a sensitive area. They probe the Government&#146;s intention on their future policy of including a defence of sea fishing. Environmental groups are, unsurprisingly, unhappy about a blanket defence, especially in the light of the more precise definition used elsewhere in the legislation, such as the offshore marine conservation regulations of 2007. That blanket defence is included in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="0903121000002"></a>Other stakeholders, such as those involved in sea fishing, are worried that despite this subsection the Government have a long-term intention to restrict sea fishing. Can the Minister provide an explanation for the differences between these various bits of legislation? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_203"></a>
<a name="0903121000003"></a><b><a name="90311-0012.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="0903121000035"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> We, too, think that it is very important to probe the Government&#146;s intentions in this area. In its context, it may not look very difficult to deal with. However, to exempt a specific set of actions from offences under Sections 135 or 136 means that we are making some specific exemptions in an important territory. I think we are right to probe the objective and purpose of the exemptions.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="0903121000004"></a>A few minutes ago, the Minister referred to consistency of approach. By definition, when you start making exceptions you are not being consistent. Therefore, it is extremely important that the rationale behind these exemptions should be fully explained.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="0903121000005"></a>At present, Clause 137(3) is remarkable in that it refers to specific activity,</p>
<ul><a name="0903121000030"></a>&#147;in the course of, sea fishing, or ... an act done in connection with such an act&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903121000027"></a>That is a curious phrase. Then with the condition that,</p>
<ul><a name="0903121000031"></a>&#147;the effect of the act on the prohibited feature in question could not reasonably have been avoided&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903121000028"></a>However, this refers only to sea fishing.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="0903121000006"></a>I have, I think, a reasonable record of trying to support the sea fishing industry and fishing communities, but anybody who has any concerns with the particular broad scope of the Bill must wonder why they are being singled out. Bearing in mind our previous debate, why should not those involved in recreational activity be listed? They are often the same people. In the summer, small-scale inshore fishermen often indulge in a bit of recreational activity for their local communities, and no doubt make a reasonable return on that operation. Why should sea fishermen be given this special dispensation while in the summer when they turn to recreational activity they are not?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="0903121000007"></a>As I hope is apparent to all Members of the Committee, I am not a lawyer. I am proud of that fact. My legal friends who look at this clause will have great fun. I think they can make some useful money out of it. This is the sort of exemption that will provide them with many opportunities profitably to exercise their talents before the court in seeking to demonstrate that the offence was committed for the purpose of, and in the course of, sea fishing and was done in connection with such an act. There is an obligation on us in dealing with any legislation of this sort. When a group of individuals is targeted either for a special penalty or special exemption, the Government should explain why they are singling that group out. On that basis, I gladly support the amendment moved by the noble Duke; we are entitled to a fuller explanation that is immediately apparent.</p>

<a name="0903121000008"></a><b><a name="90311-0012.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0903121000036"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I agree that this is an important consideration, and fully understand why noble Lords want an explanation. Perhaps I might give that explanation before coming to the amendment. Essentially, the common fisheries policy regulates the environmental impacts of fishing as well as the methods and level of catches permitted. Under EU law, it therefore already factors in environmental damage and deems that to be acceptable to the extent that it is a necessary consequence of fishing.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="0903121000009"></a>The defence in Clause 137(3) is provided to make it clear that the Bill is not seeking to challenge that position, because we are in no position to do so, and to reassure fishermen that the nature conservation provisions in the Bill will not criminalise their activities. If fishery restrictions are necessary to protect a marine conservation zone in an area where additional domestic measures are permitted under the CFP regime, specific fisheries legislation&#151;such as by-laws made by an inshore fisheries and conservation authority&#151;will be used.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="0903121000010"></a>As a member of the EU, if there is a conflict with national law EU law must take precedence. The common fisheries policy covers both the exploitation of fish stocks and the environmental impacts of fishing. As such, if a fisherman is fishing according to the conditions of his licence, we have to consider any environmental impacts as being already taken into account and acceptable. I do not pretend that that is an ideal situation. The fisheries defence in Clause 137(3) does no more than reflect that situation. That gives the fishing industry important clarity, and its presence in the Bill does not necessarily weaken the protection that we can give to marine conservation zones.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="0903121000011"></a>While some form of commercial fishing can, no doubt, damage the seabed, and seabed-dwelling plants and animals, there is an obvious risk that uncontrolled fishing activity might undermine our conservation objectives. I fully understand that point, and that we face that risk. Indeed, we discussed at length last week the clear need for any integrated marine policy to bring fisheries and conservation policies together. The common fisheries policy already provides a mechanism for seeking the agreement of other member states and, as I have said, for restricting fishing activity for environmental reasons. We will use that mechanism when sites outside UK territorial waters need such

I acknowledge that other member states may not always see such restrictions as being compatible with their interests.</p>

Clause 143 has a wonderful list of definitions of what this section contains. I can see no definition there of sea fishing. Given the view of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, on what fun lawyers will be having with a phrase like this, does the Minister know whether sea fishing is defined anywhere in law? It seems to me that it could apply to somebody trawling for fish in the sea. I have spent time trawling a line for mackerel; I do not know whether that counts as sea fishing.</p>

I certainly understand the point made by the noble Duke, but he will know that the reason for the defence, in essence, is that the common fisheries policy and European legislation take precedence. I do not know whether that defines sea fishing, but I shall certainly find out.</p>

I think that in a previous debate his noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham laid great stress on the fact that the common fisheries policy is under review&#151;we hope that it will move on in a more sensible direction&#151;and is about to be devolved in a number of important ways. I wonder whether the explanation that the Minister is giving us could be incorporated in the subsection, because then it would make sense. As it stands, it baldly states that, for reasons that are unexplained, sea fishing is given special treatment. If it were linked to the superiority&#151;that is a dangerous word&#151;of the CFP in its current form, I think that we would all accept that it had logic. However, as it stands, I do not think that the Minister&#146;s explanation&#151;valid though it may well be&#151;is sufficient to justify the incorporation in the Bill of this very special treatment.</p>

At the end of the day, this is about ensuring that the fishermen involved are not subject to two conflicting pieces of legislation. That would place them in an absolutely impossible position, and that is what we seek to avoid. I shall certainly consider the noble Lord&#146;s point, which I understand. I think that last week I referred to the discussions in Europe on the common fisheries policy. The advice I have received is that the mood around the Fisheries Council table may be changing due to the provisions of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which imposes on maritime member states, including the UK, an obligation to create a network of protected areas. We expect that other member states will also need to provide adequate protection for their protected areas if they are to meet their legal obligations. Therefore, we hope that there might be a mutual interest in adopting a slightly different approach from marine nature conservation in the future.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="0903121000016"></a>Commissioner Borg is aware that we are faced with a very fine balance between achieving a sustainable future for the fishing industry on the basis of a healthy marine environment, and the current state of EU fish stocks. He has stated his desire for an integrated maritime policy and recognises that the common fisheries policy has a crucial role to play in achieving that aim. This is essentially what is also envisaged by the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. As I indicated last week, it is a priority of the Government to secure a better alignment between European fisheries policy and the UK&#146;s objectives for the marine environment. That point will be uppermost in our minds when we go into the negotiations.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="0903121000017"></a>I am right: there is no definition of the relevant phrase in the Bill. If there is no definition, it is intended, as ever, to have its natural and broad meaning. It applies to any person fishing in the sea.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="0903121000018"></a>This is a clearly acknowledged problem which the Government wish to tackle through negotiations in Europe on the common fisheries policy. However, the existing measure does not provide any protection for a person who is fishing illegally, nor does it provide any protection for those who are using fishing gear solely and deliberately to damage a marine conservation zone. Therefore, it is not a blanket defence. Where the balance of evidence merits it, we will of course take the necessary steps to regulate fishing.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="0903121000019"></a>Provided we control fishing where necessary, the defence that is afforded by this clause is appropriate. Essentially, it says that fishing, which is a legitimate activity, has already had its environmental impact taken into account through the common fisheries policy. It should not be prosecutable under two pieces of legislation for the same offence, if such offence is caused. Illegal fishing, though, would be prosecuted under fisheries legislation&#151;for example, through inshore fisheries and conservation authority by-laws, as provided for in the Bill. I know noble Lords are concerned about the situation, but I have tried to explain the logic of why we are where we are. It is not ideal. Clearly, we could have a general debate about the common fisheries policy. Rather as with the CAP, we would all agree that reform is necessary. We will pursue this matter in Europe.</p>

He should confirm, and I am sure he can, that&#151;by definition, since this is still a Bill&#151;there are no marine conservation zones yet. There is absolutely no reference to such zones in any fisheries legislation, either EU or UK.</p>

What about the Russians off Shetland? The noble Lord says that the Bill cannot protect us from what might come from Europe, but could there not be something to make us a little safer from that? As far as the general point of this clause is concerned, the Government will not have political problems about it where I live because there is a great deal of sympathy for fishermen. There is rather more than there is for dolphins and seals. From my own experience, it will not present a huge problem among the population generally. What about the Russians?</p>

Clearly, there is a general issue around the enforcement of provisions outside our territorial waters. It depends on the nature of the activity that takes place. We wish to have the tools that will enable us to deal with those matters. My understanding is that the position of Russian trawlers&#151;if that is the point&#151;would be no different in relation to marine conservation zones from their position in relation to fishing at the moment. That is not changed by the Bill.</p>

In fact, what the Minister has been telling us is that anyone carrying out the operation known as fishing&#151;which may not always involve extracting fish, but may include octopuses, crabs or all sorts of other things&#151;has an exemption under the common fisheries policy. There is a fine point when you are fishing in an estuary as to whether that is the sea; we shall have to find out where the boundary of the sea lies in that sort of situation. This debate has been most revealing and I am grateful to the Minister for providing explanations. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

They are probing amendments to call into question the status of third-country vessels. As the Bill stands, an offence of damaging protected features of MCZs, under Clause 136, specifically does not apply, under Clause 137, to,</p>
<ul><a name="0903123000058"></a>&#147;anything done in relation to an MCZ lying beyond the seaward limits of the territorial sea by a person on a third country vessel&#148;. </ul>
<p><a name="0903123000041"></a>Does the Minister agree that, as the Royal Yachting Association has argued, this,</p>
<ul><a name="0903123000059"></a>&#147;unfairly and unreasonably prejudices UK and member State vessels&#148;?</ul>
<a name="90311-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="0903123000002"></a>According to the RYA, under Article 56 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea the coastal state has jurisdiction in the exclusive economic zone with regard to the protection and preservation of the marine environment. The convention does not prevent the UK from extending Clause 136 to have reference to third-country vessels. Can the Minister tell us whether this is the case? Can he account for the fact that it has not been included in the Bill? Does he not agree that it would be sensible to maximise protection and preservation of the marine environment and that inclusion of third-country vessels would be sensible and desirable?</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="0903123000003"></a>Clause 137 deals with exceptions to offences that contravene by-laws and orders or damage protected features of marine conservation zones. However, it does not include any reference to a situation whereby an offence may be committed even despite the best efforts of the person involved to avoid doing so. We have therefore tabled Amendment A214 to insert a new clause stating that, for any offence under Clause 135 on contravening by-laws or orders, the defendant is allowed to use as a defence the fact that they took &#147;all reasonable precautions&#148; and &#147;exercised all due diligence&#148; in order not to commit an offence.</p>

<a name="90311-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="0903123000004"></a>Does the Minister agree that there may be situations where an offence is committed despite the best intentions and most concerted efforts of those involved? Does he concede that a person should then be allowed to use this argument in their defence? The circumstances of this offence and the fact that all reasonable precautions were taken may have an impact on the severity of the penalty, or may at least bring up important considerations that should be taken into account. Therefore, we on these Benches think that it is important that this new clause be included in the Bill.</p>

<ul><a name="0903123000062"></a>&#147;anything done in relation to an MCZ lying beyond the seaward limits of the territorial sea by a person on a third country vessel&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903123000044"></a>What does that mean? It is not in the Clause 143 interpretation.

We would like clarification. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0903123000008"></a><b><a name="90311-0013.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0903123000073"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am inordinately grateful to the noble Earl for moving these interesting and challenging amendments and I shall do the best that I can to reassure him. We have, after all, spent some time discussing the general offence provisions in Clause 136 and the exemptions in Clause 137. Let me start by addressing Amendment A212, which proposes the deletion of Clause 137(4), about which the noble Earl was emphatic. Amendment A213 is a consequential amendment, which would make sure that vessels are treated equally, irrespective of the flag that they fly or are entitled to fly.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="0903123000009"></a>The reason for Clause 137(4) is that the UK is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Where waters outside a state&#146;s territorial sea are concerned&#151;that is to say, in the exclusive economic zone or an equivalent zone, such as the pollution control zone&#151;the emphasis in UNCLOS is on the coastal state&#146;s power to enforce applicable international rules and standards or national laws conforming to and giving effect to such rules and standards. Clause 137(4) is needed to fulfil our international obligations and removing it would leave us falling short of them. The strength with which I intend to defend that subsection will be recognised.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="0903123000010"></a>The clause provides exceptions to the offences of contravening a by-law, under Clause 135, or the general offence in Part 5 of the Bill, under Clause 136. Amendment A214 would provide a due diligence defence for contravention of the by-law in Clause 135. By-laws themselves can be drafted in such a way as to provide an element of due diligence, if that is appropriate. However, in most cases, by-laws will be clear that a certain type of activity is prohibited. A due diligence offence in those terms would not be appropriate. In addition, if there were legitimate reasons why a by-law had been breached, proceedings might then not be in the public interest. I would need some persuading that there was a need for a general provision of a defence here when it can and should be provided, where appropriate, in the by-law itself.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="0903123000011"></a>Amendments A223 and A226 seek to highlight that, while the definition of England and Wales includes the inshore area, it excludes the English and Welsh offshore marine regions. England and Wales are already defined in existing legislation. The definition of England is set out in the Interpretation Act 1978 to mean,</p>
<ul><a name="0903123000063"></a>&#147;the area consisting of the counties established by section 1 of&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0903123000045"></a>the Local Government Act 1972,</p>
<ul><a name="0903123000064"></a>&#147;Greater London and the Isles of Scilly&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903123000046"></a>Such legislation defines England in relation to land and does not extend the definition to include any of the marine area. Noble Lords will appreciate the reason  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1253"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1253</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and logic behind that definition. I am not going to leave the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, out of this. Wales is defined in the Government of Wales Act to include,</p>
<ul><a name="0903123000065"></a>&#147;the sea adjacent to Wales out as far as the seaward boundary of the territorial sea&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90311-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="0903123000012"></a>The current drafting in Clause 143 reflects the definitions that already exist, therefore extending the definition of England to include the inshore marine area and to restate that Wales includes the land of Wales and the inshore marine region. As the existing definitions of England and Wales do not include the offshore marine areas, it is unnecessary to exclude the offshore areas in the Bill. The definitions that we have already exclude them.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="0903123000013"></a>I understand noble Lords&#146; expectations that the Government will clarify these matters and hope that I am succeeding in doing so at this Dispatch Box. I am seeking to clarify which areas are included and excluded from the definitions that were handed to us before we drafted the Bill and are included in it. In terms of legal drafting, we cannot exclude a region that is not already included in a definition. We already have the definitions established and therefore have to follow that pattern. That is because we need to have consistent definitions of Wales and of England written into the Bill. That is why I cannot accept the amendments, despite understanding the intention behind them: &#147;Here is an excellent opportunity for a further definition that would clarify matters&#148;. However, we already have the definition of England and Wales, which constrains us in the framing of the Bill.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="0903123000014"></a>I think that the amendments were prefaced by the adjective &#147;probing&#148;. I hope that they were, because we have worked hard to meet legitimate anxieties that we should make clear the definitions in the Bill and why Clause 137(4) must be retained. I hope that I have given satisfactory explanations.</p>

The Welsh Ministers would obviously have to be consulted before this change was made. However, thinking about what these orders and by-laws will say, I doubt that it is sensible to say that every one must have a let-out section. It would help, in drawing up the by-laws, to include the defence that is outlined in Amendment A214. Perhaps the Minister could look at that. The Bill has been drafted without that idea, which is a new one. However, in consultation with people in Wales, the Minister might see whether this is a more effective way, as it seems very sensible. It is a normal defence that occurs frequently in legislation and these by-laws and orders are the equivalent. Could the Minister look at the issue, rather than polishing it off in the way that he has?</p>

I will start in reverse order and thank him for explaining the definitions of England and Wales, including the English and Welsh inshore regions. He made them very clear.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="0903123000018"></a>Like my noble friend Lady Carnegy, I am not completely sure about his explanation of Amendment A214, which refers to someone who has taken,</p>
<ul><a name="0903123000066"></a>&#147;all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903123000047"></a>However, I would like to read what he said and think about it.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="0903123000019"></a>I am stuck on the first part of the Minister&#146;s answer. I talked about third-country vessels. Perhaps I was being thick or not listening attentively, because I did not understand the Minister&#146;s answer. The Royal Yachting Association says that the exemption,</p>
<ul><a name="0903123000067"></a>&#147;unfairly and unreasonably prejudices UK and member State vessels&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0903123000048"></a>The Royal Yachting Association went on, as the Minister did, to cite Article 56 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. That implies that the UK can go after third-country vessels. What does the Minister say? Is the Bill unfair to UK vessels or does the convention hold sway? That is where I am stuck.</p>

<a name="0903123000020"></a><b><a name="90311-0013.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="0903123000077"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I have sympathy with the noble Earl, because these are complex areas. I reiterate that I have an extremely useful note from the Box on this highly specific legal matter. There are rights under UNCLOS to regulate foreign vessels to protect the environment, but that has to be balanced case by case against the innocent rights of passage that the convention sets out. The significance of Clause 137(4)&#151;this is why I was emphatic about it in my original reply&#151;is that it identifies the international obligations that we have and need to observe.</p>

I re-emphasise that we clearly have to comply with international obligations. Of all powers to abrogate in any way the significance of UNCLOS, the British would be in the worst position to do so because, as such a significant maritime nation, we depend on it for the effective operation of our trading relationships. As I said earlier, so much of our trade goes by sea.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="0903123000023"></a>We undertake to ensure that we will do the most that we can, within the bounds of UNCLOS&#151;I think that the noble Earl accepts the basic point&#151;to meet the anxieties expressed here under the amendment. This is not the only time that the issue has been raised. We think that we have it right. I hope that the Committee will give us due respect for the fact that, in this exceedingly important area, very strenuous efforts have been made.

It amends the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 in relation to marine boundaries of SSSIs and national nature reserves. Part 2, in which lies paragraph 9, refers to SSSIs.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="0903123000026"></a>Paragraph 9 of Schedule 13 amends Section 28D of the Wildlife and Countryside Act to cover the denotification of a SSSI on designation of the same area as an MCZ. In other words, the proposal is that the same area cannot be part of both a SSSI and an MCZ. Where SSSIs and MCZs overlap, the overlap between the features of these two designations may be only partial such that some SSSI features of national importance may not be features of the relevant MCZ. In addition, it is not clear whether the features of Natura 2000 sites, special protection areas classified under the birds directive and special areas of conservation designated under the habitats directive will be eligible as features of MCZs.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="0903123000027"></a>Natura 2000 sites on land and inter-tidal areas are underpinned by SSSIs, with the lists of operations requiring consent associated with those SSSIs providing the mechanism by which the effects of management operations of Natura 2000 sites are regulated. There is concern that the prospect of denotification of SSSI land, whenever an MCZ is designated over the same area, may well raise a number of legislative complications and confusions. If MCZ designation over an area of SSSI led to the denotification of that part of the SSSI, we believe that sites could be left vulnerable in several ways.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="0903123000028"></a>The first of these is that beaches hitherto protected might be left unprotected if the SSSI was denotified but the MCZ in its place was not designated specifically for the same features. Secondly, SSSIs and their features offer protection from developments on land and in inter-tidal areas due to the explicit link between the  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1257"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1257</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>SSSI system and the terrestrial planning system. Indeed, SSSIs are a material consideration in the terrestrial planning system. There is no explicit link with the MCZ system and the planning system, so if a SSSI area was designated as an MCZ and the SSSI was denotified as a consequence, some clarity of protection from development under the terrestrial planning system would be lost.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="0903123000029"></a>The third area of concern is that, where a SSSI underpins a Natura 2000 site, the ability to regulate management activities that may adversely affect that Natura 2000 site would be lost if the area, or part of the area, were to be designated as an MCZ and the SSSI were to be subsequently denotified. Where a SSSI underpins a Natura 2000 site, the route by which the habitat regulations are applied to activities that do not require any other form of consent&#151;these include bait digging, cockling, wildfowling, grazing and other forms of salt marsh management&#151;is via the list of operations that require consent and the explicit link between the habitat regulations and the CRoW Act. There is no explicit link between the habitat regulations and MCZs.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="0903123000030"></a>There are very clear areas of concern about what happens to the regime that operates on a SSSI if the SSSI is denotified as a consequence of the creation of an MCZ. This is clearly a very technical matter. Indeed, it is one of the many important matters that we have been discussing in our debates on the boundary between the land and sea: that is, the coast. I am not sure whether the Minister will be able to give a clear and comprehensive answer to all these questions this evening, but I will listen to him with interest. If he cannot, I will be very happy if he will write to me and explain it all. Then we can decide what to do about it at a later stage. Meanwhile, this is an important matter, and I beg to move.</p>

Holbeach is a marine parish in the sense that Holbeach Marsh stretches right out into the Wash. The Wash is a site of special scientific interest and, indeed, a textbook example of where such a transition from an SSSI to a marine conservation zone might occur. However, I am not entirely sure that I share the anxieties of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, about these matters. To me, once you get over the sea-bank, you are in a marine environment, not a land-based environment. There are no developments or people. There are plenty of seals, and there are birds in vast numbers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="0903123000032"></a>I share the noble Lord&#146;s concern that we must ensure that the transition to a marine conservation zone means no dilution of protection, because the Wash is the largest estuarial system in the UK. It is also a special protection area and a Ramsar site, it is preserved under the EC wild birds directive, and it is part of Natura 2000&#146;s special projects for grey seals, mudflats and sub-tidal sands. The whole of the Gibraltar Point National Nature Reserve is a particular point of interest.</p>

<a name="0903123000034"></a><b><a name="90311-0013.htm_spnew14"></a><a name="0903123000087"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am enormously grateful for that latter contribution. I thought that my worst nightmare was about to be realised: the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, assailing me with his anxieties about sites of special scientific interest. Then the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, brought his insight to bear on land and sea issues in the Wash. Had the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, reinforced the position of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, my nightmare would have been realised, and I am grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, has spoken so intelligently and perceptively about the issue. He has also, I think, reassured the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, who seemed to understand what the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, had to say.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="0903123000035"></a>Let me make the most obvious point first. This Bill is a conservation measure to enhance protection of a significant part of our environment. As the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, indicated, that which we seek to do for the sea inevitably has an interrelationship with that which we already do for the land. Where the boundary is to be drawn is a matter of great difficulty and interest, and natural forces ensure that that boundary moves from time to time.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="0903123000036"></a>I want to reassure the noble Lord that the decision on whether a site of special scientific interest should be denotified will be made by a conservation body, and that it will do so only on the basis of effective consultation with those who are concerned with these issues on land. When these bodies meet, they will not be distant government or arbitrary bodies concerned with issues other than conservation; they will be bodies concerned with conservation. We all know about the success of the sites of special scientific interest and we all know how jealously they are guarded, how much they are respected and how important they are to conservation on land. Is it conceivable that such sites would be threatened by the action of a conservation body which has responsibility for the contiguous marine part and is itself concerned about such protection?</p>

<a name="0903123000037"></a><b><a name="90311-0013.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="0903123000088"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> The Minister asked whether it would be conceivable. The answer is: yes, it is. If a site falls into a state whereby it is in a very unfavourable condition, there could be great pressure to denotify it. As my noble friend has clearly explained, in that instance the site would be promoted for denotification by the very conservation bodies that the Minister is talking about. That is what happens when a site falls into an unfavourable condition. It is then liable to all the vulnerabilities that my noble friend has explained.</p>

Clause 115 sets out the limited circumstances in which the marine conservation zones can extend above the mean high-water spring tide. Conversely, Schedule 13 sets out the  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1259"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column 1259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>circumstances in which SSSIs can extend below the mean low-water mark. We have adopted a pragmatic and flexible approach to ensuring that sites are protected through the most appropriate arrangements. The Government intend to publish draft guidance on sub-tidal SSSIs and national nature reserves, which will explain in more detail how we envisage the marine and terrestrial systems working together.</p>

<a name="90311-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="0903123000039"></a>It may even be that there are circumstances when it will be appropriate and desirable for a SSSI and a marine conservation zone partially to overlap. Nothing in the Bill would prevent that overlap. However, where an overlap would provide no conservation benefit and cause unnecessary duplication or potential confusion for sea users, it is important that the conservation body has the power to remedy the situation by denotifying the SSSI. That is the purpose of paragraph 9 of Schedule 13, to which of course the amendment refers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="0903123000040"></a>I want to emphasise that we have taken care to ensure that the denotification of an SSSI is a power and not a duty. The Bill leaves the decision where it should be, with the conservation body. So I understand the noble Lord&#146;s expression of anxiety. It is right that when we are dealing with the definition of the boundary between land and sea and all its difficulties, we should be assured that the Bill addresses those issues fully and satisfactorily. However, I hope the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, will accept that the Bill is a conservation measure in the same way as SSSIs represent conservation and that we have the power vested in the conservation body. I hope he will also accept what the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said in his remarks. It is inevitable that issues will arise about responsibility for the boundary between land and sea, and the Bill takes due cognisance of that by addressing the issue with due thoroughness. I therefore hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I do not think that we disagree very much about this. What matters is what management regime and rules are set up for each particular stretch of shoreline and inshore area where land and sea meet. Clearly, where SSSIs meet marine conservation zones, special care will have to be taken in deciding how to set up the regime. The noble Lord said that the Government are going to publish draft guidance. Could he indicate whether its publication is imminent, something for the distant future or somewhere in between? Does he have that information with him?</p>

I declare an interest as vice-president of a charity called Quit, which helps people to quit smoking.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000004"></a>My amendment seeks to make plain packaging mandatory for all tobacco products, removing all branding and leaving the health warnings and, in plain text, the name of the product. Tobacco packaging, sometimes called the silent salesman, has always been an important part of tobacco marketing, communicating attributes such as style and sophistication to the would-be smokers.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000005"></a>As some of your Lordships may have noticed, I was interested by an article from the <I>Times</I> of Monday 9 March, which said: &#147;Branding on cigarette packs under fire from MPs&#148;. I was glad to see the article say that the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford, was going to move this amendment. More importantly, the writer of the article referred to:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031186000050"></a>&#147;Tobacco companies&#151;for whom branded packs are the only remaining form of advertising in the UK&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031186000031"></a>I shall not quote further, but it interesting that this comes not just from me but from journalists.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000006"></a>Tobacco branding should be prohibited because it is plainly advertising. It recruits young people into a lifetime addiction and misleads smokers about the relative safety of different brands. So is it advertising? According to legal opinion from Sir Richard Buxton, a former Lord Justice of Appeal, the packaging being used by the tobacco industry meets the definition set out by the 2003 EU directive for tobacco products, which is,</p>
<ul><a name="09031186000053"></a>&#147;any form of commercial communication with the aim or direct or indirect effect of promoting tobacco products&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031186000032"></a>Since the advertising ban of 2002, the pack has acquired even greater importance as a tool that the tobacco industry uses to recruit smokers to replace those who have quit or died. The ban on advertising therefore did not lead to an end of the influence of the cigarette brand but rather the displacing of its potency to the cigarette pack.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000007"></a>There are many examples of how the tobacco industry has risen to the challenge of carrying the whole message on the pack. Examples include Silk Cut; the number  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC441"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC441</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of advertised variants within the Silk Cut &#147;brand family&#148; has doubled since the advertising ban, allowing the logo to appear repeatedly in a variety of colours. They have also used creative packaging, such as the &#147;perfume pack&#148;, as it is called, to target particular markets. Camel is another brand, marketed as a &#147;natural flavour&#148;. This new youth-oriented brand variant was launched in 2007. Speaking to the trade press, Jeremy Blackburn, communications manager of Gallaher Group, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031186000051"></a>&#147;Camel is the smoking style statement for young adult smokers&#148;.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000008"></a>Then there is the Lambert and Butler &#147;celebration pack&#148;. When this was introduced into the market, Imperial Tobacco was able to see just how much difference packaging made; with nothing else changing in the marketing mix, it added &#163;60 million in its sales.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000009"></a>I remember when I used to smoke some 38 years ago that brands such as Peter Stuyvesant were my favourite, because the cigarettes were slightly longer. At weekends occasionally, if you could afford it, you bought what were known as black Sobranies to the student ball, for example, to impress ladies. There were &#147;cocktail&#148; Sobranies, with green, black, yellow and cream-coloured cigarettes. It did not make any difference to the ladies, but they were certainly cool to carry.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000010"></a>The cigarette pack is plainly a sophisticated form of advertising. It seduces young people into a lifetime of addiction. The majority of smokers start smoking before they are 18. The younger a smoker starts to smoke, the more addicted they will become by adulthood, the harder they will find it to quit, and the more likely it is that they will die from the habit. Findings from a UK study, reported in a 2008 report for Cancer Research UK, showed that the number of cigarette brands that 15 year-olds could recall increased the chances of them expressing an interest in trying smoking by 35 per cent for each additional brand. Research conducted for ASH by the University of Nottingham has further shown that young people found branded packs more attractive than plain packs. That demonstrates the appeal of packaging and branding independent of the appeal of the tobacco product itself.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000011"></a>Branding on cigarette packs has a powerful impact on young people, and different brands are used to perpetuate and reinforce the ideas that young people have about themselves. Therefore they become powerfully totemic in themselves. Tobacco branding is designed to confer status and sense of belonging. This is a quotation from a young person in the north of England that was gathered for the recent Department of Health consultation on tobacco control:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031186000052"></a>&#147;At school the type of cigarettes you smoked depended on what group you were in. The &#145;cool kids&#146; smoked Lambert and Butler because they liked the silver packet and the cards that came with it, and the people who liked rock music smoked Marlboro. The &#145;Goths&#146; smoked John Player Special because of the black packets. What you smoked said a lot about you and it was all down to what was on the packet&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031186000012"></a>Packaging misleads smokers about the relative safety of different brands. The use of branding, particularly the colours or livery on packs, also misleads smokers into thinking that their favoured brand or brand variant is a safer product than other brands. With the removal

In the Nottingham study, young people were shown pairs of cigarette packs in the same brand family and asked which cigarettes were lower tar, less harmful to health and more attractive. Young people and the adult smokers were more likely to perceive the lighter coloured packs as less harmful and less addictive.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000013"></a>Large, bold, written health warnings are effective in motivating smokers to quit, and new picture warnings may be even more effective. However, tobacco branding lessens the impact of the warning message, as colourful branding detracts attention from health warnings.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000014"></a>If young people and smokers are to be given a real, free and informed choice about whether they smoke, we should prohibit branding as it inhibits that choice. On-pack branding undermines the existing tobacco advertising law, misleading smokers and continuing to promote tobacco. It dilutes the impact of health warnings designed to ensure that smokers were making a more informed choice. Most importantly, it seduces young people into taking up a habit that in their youth they see as something that expresses who they are, but in their adulthood could kill them.</p>

At Second Reading, I said that I had reservations about cigarettes being sold in plain packaging because I felt that it would not help individuals to identify which cigarettes had the greatest and lowest nicotine content. However, I discovered that my comments were ill advised; for some considerable time, it has been illegal for anyone to identify a brand as &#147;mild&#148; or &#147;light&#148;, so that reservation is no longer valid.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000016"></a>Since the introduction of the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002, packaging has become increasingly sophisticated and appealing, with careful use of imagery, colours and design. Each smoker displays their brand every time they take their pack out to smoke. Cigarette packaging has been called &#147;the silent salesman&#148;. Since 2002, the number of cigarette brand variants has more than doubled as tobacco companies increasingly use the pack itself as a promotional tool.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000017"></a>The importance of pack design in branding and promotion is explicitly recognised by the tobacco industry in its own documents. For instance, Imperial Tobacco in the UK has stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="09031186000054"></a>&#147;additional brands and pack design in the United Kingdom have a significant impact on profit improvement&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031186000033"></a>Imperial&#146;s global brand director, Geoff Good, said in December 2006 that pack redesign had been worth,</p>
<ul><a name="09031186000055"></a>&#147;over &#163;30 million in additional turnover and a significant profit improvement ... the UK had become a dark market, the pack design was the only part of the mix that was changed and therefore we know the cause and effect&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031186000034"></a>That is a compelling comment.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000018"></a>Members of the Committee may not be aware that Professor McNeil of the University of Nottingham and Dr Hammond of the University of Waterloo in Canada have a research paper shortly to be published on the effect of tobacco branding on young people.

It is illegal to mislead people about tobacco products in this way, which is of course why the terms &#147;light&#148; and &#147;mild&#148; are prohibited. The only solution to this problem is plain packaging.</p>

I do so partly because of what my noble friend Lady Howarth said about the fascination of children with colourful packaging, of the kind that is displayed on Rothmans and Marlboro packaging and the like. I repeat my interest as a trustee of the Adolescent and Children&#146;s Trust, a fostering agency.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000020"></a>I recently visited a children&#146;s home. A 15 year-old young woman was saying over lunch that she was getting fatter and fatter. Young people who have had a poor experience of parenting can feel particularly worried about their weight and have low self-esteem. They are particularly vulnerable to marketing of all kinds, including package design of cigarettes. I am particularly concerned that, for this girl, for instance, a brand like Silk Cut Slims, with its elegant white packet, will suggest to her that if she smokes she will become more elegant and slimmer. Of course, there is a danger that, as a young woman, she may feel that smoking will reduce her appetite, making her less fat.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000021"></a>I remind Members of the Committee that, according to the Office of National Statistics, two-thirds of children in care smoke&#151;far higher than the national average. The rates of teenage pregnancy for those in care are far higher. This is a risk for young women, such as the woman in care I met last night who started smoking at the age of eight, had a child while in her teenage years and continued smoking throughout her pregnancy; I think she was 17. These young children are encouraged to smoke by marketing, including the packaging of cigarettes. They do not have parents to guide them. They are therefore more susceptible to marketing messages. They become pregnant and their children are further at risk of being underweight at birth, suffering from disability and being premature. The children grow up with a mother who smokes in the house and the child is therefore at risk of respiratory illnesses and more likely to miss time at school and possibly to fall behind. He is also far more likely to pick up smoking if his parent smokes.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000022"></a>I urge Members of the Committee seriously to consider the amendment and consider curtailing marketing in this way. If we look back, we have to say that we have not looked out for our most vulnerable children as well as we should have done. If we look back at the fostering and social work services we have provided, we have not invested in social workers and foster carers. What the Government and Conservative Party are now considering in terms of social work is encouraging. This is a small but important step in improving the chances for these children and their children to do far better than they have in the past.</p>

This should be in the legislation. I am convinced it would have the support of the majority of the British people. It is constructed in the normal language of legislation.

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031186000024"></a>One reason why I support the amendment is because, if used in the way I would like it to be used, it would isolate imports. If we had a standardised, single-colour pack for all cigarettes with the name of the manufacturer in very small print on the side, it might make life a little easier for those who want to help others stop smoking. To be even more radical, if we are intending somehow to isolate imports&#151;we have an opportunity to deal with that on the next amendment&#151;perhaps we should have coloured cigarettes. My noble friend Lord Patel referred to Sobranie Black Russian, which I remember from when I was a boy. We used to smoke them behind the bike shed at school. A cigarette that is individually identified&#151;it might be yellow&#151;could be a cigarette distributed within the United Kingdom, so those who smoked non-yellow cigarettes would be indicating to others that they were smoking imports that had come through under the ludicrous European regime we have at the moment. The system that operates now is that I can ring up a tobacconist in Italy, order my fags and they are sent to me through the post. I understand that is now within the law. I have just checked with a relative who told me that that is the case and that you can buy cigarettes on the phone and have them posted to you in the United Kingdom. It seems to me that we have lost total control over cigarette consumption from abroad. Smuggled imports and, indeed, legitimate imports that do not turn up in our figures probably play havoc with the statistics on the domestic market in the United Kingdom. I hope that this amendment goes through when it comes to Report. I am sure that it will have a lot of support on the Floor of the House of Commons.</p>

It is a formidable amendment with a formidable array of sponsors, only some of whom we have heard from so far; others may speak shortly. One reason why I oppose the amendment is that while the Government, as we know from earlier debates, have been only too eager to impose various restrictions, especially the one on the display of tobacco products in retail premises, they themselves are not impressed by any evidence that the introduction of plain packaging would reduce further the number of young people smoking. Of course I have heard what the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, whom I respect, the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, and others have said; they have argued strongly that smoking among young people is wholly undesirable. But this is not a debate about how undesirable smoking is among young people; it is about whether it would assist in the objective of reducing the number of young people smoking if we had so-called plain packaging.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031172000029"></a>The principal reason I want to concentrate on in my opposition to Amendment 105 is the express provision within the amendment that the regulation should be introduced to ban the use of registered trademarks on packaging. Brand names, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, indicated, are typically registered as trademarks. I trust that the Committee is aware that in order to get a trademark you have to pay application fees, registration fees and renewal fees, which are all paid to the state. The trademark is a right of property. Trademarks are of course a common feature of competition in all sorts of products quite apart from tobacco, but without trademarks the producers&#151;of tobacco, in this case&#151;would have to depend entirely on price competition rather than on differentiation by way of quality, innovation and reputation.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031172000030"></a>Interference with trademarks by one country within the European Union&#151;in this case, the United Kingdom&#151;or, for that matter, one country within GATT&#151;again, the United Kingdom&#151;seems to be contrary to the harmonised EU and international system of trademark protection. I ask those who are going to speak on this amendment, such as other sponsors or the noble Lord, Lord Patel, whether they have satisfied themselves that there is some overriding basis for allowing such infringement of trademarks as is involved in the amendment. I would be glad to hear the Government&#146;s view. What is their attitude to the 1994 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Agreement entered into by this country? The agreement states that the nature of the goods&#151;that is, how desirable or undesirable they are&#151;is not an obstacle to trademark registration. Have they taken into account the view of Christopher Morecambe QC, an expert in intellectual property

Prohibiting the use of trademarks&#151;in other words, brands&#151;on tobacco packaging would, first, impose restrictions on the registration and use of trademarks based on the nature of the goods and services for which such marks are registered, contrary to the harmonised European international system of trademark protection. The noble Lord has already mentioned the European Court of Human Rights and TRIPS. Secondly, it would be unlawful interference with the human right, established by the European Court of Human Rights, to free speech between the manufacturer and the consumer of a product. Thirdly, it would constitute a barrier to the functioning of the internal market, which is contrary to EU law. Fourthly, it would undermine the very basis of intellectual property rights, which are, as the noble Lord said, of a global nature and of great significance and which need to be protected internationally, with implications far beyond the tobacco industry.</p>

The UK Government are not entitled to interfere with trademarks and related intellectual property rights in respect of lawful products by reference to the nature of those products, because such interference would be contrary to the harmonised EU and the international system of trademark protection, with which we are obliged to comply. The protection of trademarks is harmonised at the EU level by means of the trademarks directive and Community trademark registration. The UK may not introduce measures that are inconsistent with that harmonised regime, which requires the consistent protection of trademark rights across the EU. Plain packaging regulations would be contrary to the harmonised regime.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031172000037"></a>Accordingly, the UK Government cannot introduce plain packaging without breaching its obligations under EU and international law. Such breaches would render the regulations liable to be struck down. Furthermore, plain packaging regulations would amount to deprivation of a manufacturer&#146;s valuable property rights, in the trademark, copyright and designs incorporated in the packaging, as well as in the good will arising in the resulting brand, which would be contrary to Article 1 of the First Protocol of the ECHR. Such deprivation is unlawful, and it would require the payment of compensation to those who had been deprived. Given the commercial value of manufacturers&#146; trademarks and related rights, it is clear that the compensation due in these circumstances would be very substantial.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031172000038"></a>Plain packaging would inevitably inhibit the ability of manufacturers to communicate with consumers in relation to&#151;I emphasise this&#151;a lawful product. That ability, both of the manufacturer to communicate and of consumers to receive information, is protected by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which recognises free speech, including commercial free speech, as a fundamental right. Prohibiting a rights holder enjoying his intellectual property rights in respect of a lawful product creates for the first time globally a pariah class of goods, in respect of which the universal protection of intellectual property rights does not apply. If the principle of such discrimination by reference to the goods themselves were established, its application would not logically be limited to tobacco products. It would probably be extended to alcohol and, surely, to certain food products. That seems to me to be the situation.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031172000039"></a>If it ever happened&#151;a totally unlawful prospect&#151;first, the competition would be on price, as the noble Lord said; the price would come down and consumption would go up. Secondly, if we have a problem now with the illicit importation of cigarettes&#151;27 per cent of cigarettes are already imported illegally&#151;once there is plain packaging, it will be as easy as wink for any distributor, any retailer, any car-boot seller anywhere in the United Kingdom to ensure that they have their illegal sources and you will not be able to tell where on earth the cigarettes have come from. Once again, Her Majesty's Government will lose &#163;3 billion or &#163;4 billion. Referring briefly to the question asked on the Floor of the House, if we are so short of money that we cannot provide drugs for those two categories which I mentioned this afternoon, I am sure that we should be saving on &#163;3 million or &#163;4 million-worth of illegal importation.</p>

Existing trade obligations protect the property rights of trademarks. On the other hand, a key agreement used by the industry to make the argument is the 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, often known as TRIPS. The agreement makes provision for Governments to act to protect public health and to provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark where that is appropriate. As I interpret it, that means that the rights of trademarks are subject to the wider public good and, therefore, can be constrained when shown to benefit public health.</p>

However, he needs to look very carefully at the creation of a pariah group of products. Society may decide that there are a number of areas where there should be pariah goods but the law, as it stands, requires lots of evidence to meet the public interest, as the noble Lord has suggested, and significant compensation if there is to be any advance in that area. I think Her Majesty&#146;s Government will want to think long and hard and I am not sure that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would welcome any advance on that front.</p>

I take the Committee back to remarks which I made earlier. I quoted Mr Geoff Good, the brand director of Imperial Tobacco, speaking at a conference in December 2006. He spoke of the UK, as my noble friend Lord Walton pointed out, as a dark market, meaning that former open advertising channels had been blocked by the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002. He said that the industry had to be more creative in devising other methods of marketing. He then went on to show that Lambert and Butler had found that their new design for their celebration pack to mark their 25th anniversary had been most successful in increasing their brand share of the market. The pack design is recognised by the industry as a really important factor in increasing sales, especially now that all other forms of advertising have been prohibited.</p>

The noble Baroness asked where we had all been. I had been around the shops and, despite never having been a smoker, I now know new brands of cigarettes because huge branding can be seen across brightly lit and colourful displays.

Why do we want advertising that will entrap children at an early stage into a brand which they will then smoke continually as they grow up? I shall not repeat all the arguments about the effects that that will have on their health. We have had that debate and the arguments have been made. Anyone who works with children day in and day out will know how they are impressed. All cognitive behavioural psychology now tells us about the way in which children learn. I simply want to make the point again that, whatever intellectual argument we have about property rights&#151;and I know that there is a possible legal argument there&#151;the underlying reason for wanting plain packaging is to ensure that children are not caught at an early age, that they do not then continually smoke that or another brand, and that we have a healthier nation in the long run.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Naseby, gave an extremely interesting speech. I, too, am very concerned about whether we break the law. I am not so concerned about manufacturers bringing down the price of cigarettes because the Government could always put the tax up, which would mean that they could be just as expensive. I make it clear that I have nothing at all against adults doing what they want to do with each other in private. Here, we are trying to stop young people taking up smoking, which will injure their health and kill them prematurely if they carry on. That is what we are trying to do. We do not want to stop adults.</p>

<p><a name="09031172000046"></a>From my experience as a student and as a mother of a big family, and from my experience of my children&#146;s friends and of working for many years in a youth counselling centre in Kentish Town, I know that young people are dedicated followers of fashion. They always go for what the herd is doing, what the herd is smoking and what the herd is wearing. That is what they are meant to be like. My brothers taught me to smoke when I was about 16 because they did not want to be embarrassed by a sister who might make a fool of herself if offered a cigarette. I was taught to smoke outside the back door of someone&#146;s house. As I said, young people need to follow fashion. As the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours said&#151;indeed, we are of the same opinion&#151;Black Russian were definitely the vogue when I was a student, but we moved on to Gauloise, which then became extremely chic and everyone went around smoking them.</p>

<p><a name="09031172000047"></a>I wanted to intervene following the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Golding, because for a moment it made me think of my brothers. I thought that she was going to hand out free samples to us all to try to get us all going again, which for people who were smokers would be very easy to do. She obviously collects empty fag packets, which is very sad.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031173000005"></a>We are supposed to be a free democracy in favour of freedom of speech and against censorship, yet we have this new clause before us today. What does it do? I will not read it all out, as the Committee would be a bit bored by that. However, in essence it says to the Government, &#147;Here are a list of things you must do&#148;&#151;after consultation, true&#151;but the list involves not only manufacturers but purveyors of tobacco. It does not really give Parliament the proper opportunity to discuss the matter, because, right at the end, it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031173000037"></a>&#147;The powers of the Secretary of State under this subsection shall be exercisable by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031173000035"></a>In other words, it is a negative instrument, not an affirmative instrument, so carte blanche is being given to a Minister of the Crown to do exactly as he or she likes, without proper parliamentary discussion or approval. In the House of Commons, they would have an hour and a half&#151;is that still right?&#151;to discuss this important matter, which takes away the right of manufacturers and purveyors of a legal product to display it in a way that they think will make it attractive. It does not matter whether the product is cigarettes or anything else; a right is being taken away from people, affecting their ability to sell a legal product.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031173000006"></a>I find it amazing and absurd that the Government are in favour of covering up displays in the shops so that people cannot see the packaging anyway. But they are not satisfied with preventing retailers from displaying a legal product&#151;they now want to say that what is hidden must be in terms agreed by the Secretary of State without parliamentary approval. Where on earth are we going in this country? Do we no longer believe in individual freedom or choice? It is going so far as to become frightening. Of course, once you do it with tobacco, it sets a dangerous precedent. Tobacco is not the only product dangerous to health, we are told, day in and grinding day out in the newspapers. One day they tell you something is bad for you, the next day that it is good for you. I am talking about chocolate, sweets and, of course, alcohol. Last Monday the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, was telling us that although she agrees with the non-display, or the covering up of displays, of tobacco products, she does not believe that the same sort of thing should happen with alcohol.</p>

<p><a name="09031173000036"></a>That review, I suspect&#151;I will confirm this if the Committee wishes&#151;will address the points raised by my noble friend Lord Borrie and the noble Lord, Lord Naseby. We have committed to developing the evidence base on whether selling tobacco products in plain or generic packaging could change behaviour and, in particular, protect young people from tobacco industry marketing. However, we consider it premature at this stage to take this major step. To be completely clear, the UK is perfectly capable of being in the vanguard

We will work hard to ensure that the emerging evidence on plain packaging is kept under review, and the Government&#146;s policy will change if and when that is appropriate.

<a name="90311-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031173000026"></a>This is a key amendment, which I hope will find favour from all sides. It would create a licensing system for the sale of tobacco, so that it is only sold by those with a valid licence. As a harmful product, tobacco is age restricted. However, although it kills many more people than alcohol or fireworks, you do not need a licence to sell it. Young smokers are sold cigarettes by both legitimate and illicit suppliers. One in five so-called test purchases by those under 18 from legitimate retailers results in a sale. It is likely that the success rate in buying from illicit providers is even higher.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90311-gc0003.htm"/>


<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031173000027"></a>The Bill introduces much needed additional restrictions on the marketing of tobacco products. Creating a licensing system that is clear and transparent will help to restrict the availability of tobacco to young people, both through retailers and the smuggled market. Licensing of the sale of tobacco would be a positive move for all retailers selling legitimately to adults. It will result in greater revenue for legitimate retailers as illegal traders are forced out of the market. New regulations are coming into force that will mean heavier penalties, including a ban on sales of tobacco for persistent offenders. However, as a lethal and addictive product, there is a need for coherent, systematic regulation.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031173000028"></a>Is there therefore a case for a tobacco licensing scheme? The Bill introduces additional restrictions on tobacco marketing. If it and the amendments are successful, new offences will be created, including displaying tobacco products at the point of sale, selling tobacco products in vending machines and adults purchasing cigarettes on behalf of children. In addition, there are existing requirements not to sell tobacco products to people aged under 18, not to display tobacco advertising larger than one side of A5 and to display signs warning that tobacco products may be sold only to those over the age of 18. Last year, new penalties were introduced for the repeated sale of tobacco products to minors, which now results in the suspension of a retailer&#146;s right to sell tobacco products. This amendment will improve

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031173000029"></a>So far, the effort to restrict the sale of tobacco products to young people has focused on legitimate tobacco retailers, but we know that vending machines and retailers are important sources of cigarettes for young people, as are illicit outlets ranging from sellers of smuggled tobacco to adults who believe it is acceptable to provide cigarettes to children. This amendment gives powers to create an offence of selling tobacco without a licence. It would apply to all those who sell tobacco to young people. The measure is extremely popular with the general public. According to a YouGov survey conducted last year, 87 per cent of adults support requiring businesses to have a valid licence to sell tobacco, which can be removed if they are caught selling to underage smokers. A strong licensing system will support trading standards officers in implementing tobacco sale laws and enable them to support retailers to understand their role in preventing sales to underage children and enforcing the law where retailers continue to fail to comply. Licensing will help tackle smuggling. Retailers say that one of the biggest challenges they face is competition from illicit sources of tobacco. Smuggled tobacco currently makes up a significant proportion of the market share&#151;13 per cent of cigarettes and over 50 per cent of hand-roll tobacco.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031173000030"></a>This amendment will allow trading standards officers to prosecute illegal sellers of tobacco for selling without a licence and so improve local enforcement. This is a measure that protects responsible retailers at the expense of those who are breaking the law. The system will be straightforward and transparent. Retailers who comply with the law will not be further inconvenienced and the measure will minimise the illegal competition from retailers selling to underage children and those selling illicit tobacco. A commitment to review the system of licensing for tobacco should be part of any comprehensive strategy being developed. The availability of tobacco to children from shops represents a significant problem and clamping down on it is key to achieving a reduction in the number of young people smoking and, in the long term, in overall prevalence.</p>

<p><a name="09031183000004"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09031183000034"></a>Lord Stoddart of Swindon:</b> I thought I had better just say a few words. When I ran a grocery shop, I actually had a tobacco licence. I am not at all sure that it did any good but, nevertheless, it was a licence, which could be removed. But of course these are different times; the tobacco licence was abolished after the war.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000005"></a>We are talking here about a licence that puts further pressure on retailers. They are under huge pressure at the moment not to sell to young people. They can be fined &#163;2,500 if they do sell&#151;and now, under this, they would be under threat of losing their licence, although they might innocently have sold a packet of cigarettes to an underage person. Frankly, I think that we need to nurture our small shops at the moment, whatever they sell. We are already in recession and are in danger of going into depression. The last thing that we should be doing at this point is adding further burdens to retailers and to put them under further pressure of fines, and perhaps even imprisonment&#151;but, worst of all, losing their livelihoods.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000006"></a>We need to be very careful about what we are doing, as the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, pointed out. We have a duty to protect the freedoms of the individual. That is one main reason why Parliament exists, apart from raising money for the Government. Parliamentarians are there to protect the individual liberties of people&#151;and, unfortunately, some people appear to have forgotten that.</p>

<p><a name="09031183000007"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09031183000035"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> I certainly agree that it is Parliament&#146;s duty to protect people&#146;s individual rights, but Parliament prescribes the limit of those freedoms when there is a greater public good to be gained from their being restricted. The more we take measures that make it more difficult for tobacco to be sold to children and thus make it more difficult for children to start smoking and become addicted to this terrible product, the better it is. That is a legitimate aim of Parliament. It is legitimate to restrict freedoms when the greater good benefits as a result from it.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000008"></a>Far from attacking retailers, I would see this as a huge benefit for them. The reputable retailers will be delighted that the retail sale of tobacco is licensed, because they will all I am sure take every effort to ensure that the product is not sold to people to whom it should not be sold, such as children, and it will do something to drive out the illegal selling of tobacco&#151;</p>

It is sold in all sorts of other places, and it will be very difficult to find them, because it is illegal anyway at present to sell contraband items. How they are sold at present is already illegal and, in spite of what the noble Lord says, this will not injure the criminals who sell contraband, but it will hurt law-abiding retailers, who will be under threat if they make a little mistake.</p>

<p><a name="09031183000010"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="09031183000037"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> I do not agree with the noble Lord at all. One of the effects of having a positive licensing system for the sale of tobacco is that it will distinguish much more clearly the legal sale to adults from the illegal sale. I have no doubt that the incidence of illegal sales will decrease if there is a positive licensing system. The other benefit is that it would help the purposes of the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, debated last Thursday in which he proposed that adults who buy cigarettes for children should be subject to a particular law and penalised for that. If anyone were selling to adults for the purpose of selling on to children, the licensing system would catch them as well. I would hope  that he would see that there is merit in this  proposal.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000011"></a>The point made by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours about smuggling is one which I also endorse. Therefore, I think that the proposal put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, in this amendment, to which I put my name, should be considered very carefully. As I did on Thursday and earlier, I declare my unpaid interest as a director of Action on Smoking and Health and a trustee of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation.</p>

<p><a name="09031183000012"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="09031183000038"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> This amendment would provide powers to introduce a wholly new approach to the sale of tobacco in this country. It is an issue on which the Government consulted in 2006, following the 2004 public health White Paper <I>Choosing Health. </I>While many stakeholders supported licensing, particularly health groups, there was much opposition from retailers worried about the cost and work involved in applying for a licence. As noble Lords have mentioned, we are concerned about imposing extra burdens on business in the current economic climate. Many local authorities were also concerned about the extra administrative burden and cost involved in running such a scheme. There are almost 100,000 tobacco retailers in the UK and as many as 90,000 in England alone. Running such a scheme would be complicated and costly.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000013"></a>We responded by bringing in a negative licensing scheme in which a retailer can sell tobacco unless and until they have been found to be persistently selling tobacco to young people. This new law comes into effect from 1 April this year. We would like to see how it works and what happens. We think that the negative licensing system is a more cost-effective alternative to the positive licensing system proposed in this amendment. The new scheme will be a powerful deterrent to retailers selling tobacco to young people under 18 while avoiding the additional burdens on business.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000014"></a>Noble Lords have asked what effect this will have on tackling the illicit tobacco trade. It goes without saying, as I reported to the Committee in full on Monday, that this continues to be a vital element in our strategy on tobacco. It is important to note that very little smuggled tobacco is made available through formal retail channels, but rather through other locations such as workplaces, car boot sales or even people&#146;s homes. Positive licensing would be unlikely to add further tools in that direction.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000015"></a>However, we are committed to keeping the position under review. As promised in the debate on restricted sales orders last March, we intend to report on the impact of these orders next year. If there is still a problem with the illegal sale of tobacco to young people under 18, we will re-consider the merits of an enhanced licensing scheme. For these reasons, I hope the noble Lord feels able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Amendment 107 would give the Government extra tools to evaluate more effectively measures which are aimed at controlling marketing by the tobacco industry, especially that which may be aimed at young people. I am extremely glad that, whatever side of this debate that we are on, there seems to be general agreement that children should not start smoking and that cigarettes are not a good, even if they are, for historic reasons, lawful. All of us approve any decline in consumption. I therefore hope that I can command support for the amendments.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000018"></a>Amendment 107 would give the Government powers to require tobacco manufacturers to disclose the scale and scope of their marketing activities. This information is essential if the Government are to identify and develop effective policy responses to marketing tactics used by the industry to get round the ban on advertising, promotion and sponsorship. All the information will be published in aggregate at industry level, as in the case of the US and Canada, rather than identifying individual companies.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000019"></a>As we know, the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 sought especially to reduce the power of tobacco manufacturers to recruit new, young smokers.   


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC458"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC458</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The Act has dealt effectively with the conspicuous marketing which is generally described as &#147;above the line&#148; advertising. It failed to deal with what the industry calls &#147;below the line&#148; advertising such as price promotions, retailer incentives and point-of-sale display&#151;we have heard a bit about that.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000020"></a>The evidence suggests that there has been an expansion of below-the-line promotional activity. It is possible to identify a number of activities which are designed to get round the advertising ban. We heard last Thursday and on Monday from the noble Lord, Lord Rea, and from the noble Lords, Lord Patel and Lord Rea, today about the famous Mr Good of Imperial Tobacco. I remind the Committee that he spoke of the 2002 ban and the need, as he put it, for its marketing team to become more creative. We have heard a little about how he sought to do that. He noted the increase in sales from changing the appearance of a particular pack. Mr Good has become very famous in these Lords debates during the past few days. I feel that he may be rather more reticent in future, but I welcome his openness on this point. Whether he is still with Imperial Tobacco, I would be very interested to know. Requiring the industry to provide information on these activities is essential if the Government are to monitor the creative measures that the industry will develop and to which Mr Good referred.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000021"></a>The Canadian reporting regulations require the industry to report on how much it pays to retailers, which has been extremely useful in providing evidence that, even after a retail display ban is implemented, the industry continues to pay retailers for handling and selling tobacco products. My noble friend Lady Barker asked some extremely pertinent Written Questions in this area, seeking to find out whether the UK Government had figures on how much tobacco companies had spent on marketing within the United Kingdom in the past five years, whether the figures were based on estimates, were collected by the Government or supplied by the tobacco companies, and related questions.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000022"></a>The Answer came that the department had requested information from the tobacco industry on its payments to retailers for the display of tobacco products in shops, but the tobacco industry has for some reason refused to provide such information. The Government do not have the powers to require the tobacco companies to report on marketing expenditure and, therefore, given such lack of co-operation, hold no such information. I therefore trust that the Minister will see the amendment as a very useful tool to have at her disposal or that the tobacco industry will decide that it is best to reveal that information.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031183000023"></a>Amendment 107B was also mentioned in an exchange on Monday. The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control is an international treaty of the World Health Organisation to which the UK is a party. Article 5.3 seeks to protect public health policy from the influence of the tobacco industry. It states that when parties to the treaty are setting and implementing public health policies related to tobacco control, they shall,</p>
<ul><a name="09031183000028"></a>&#147;act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry&#148;.</ul>

<ul><a name="09031192000034"></a>&#147;act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031192000030"></a>As I was saying, we are extremely well aware of these tactics, which are very understandable as this extremely strong industry battles further for its sector. The kind of methods that it uses include casting doubt in the minds of the public about what they can trust or believe, suggesting that cause and effect is not necessarily the case, that statistical data do not provide answers, that their seemingly unbiased research undermines the public health case, and of course&#151;that easiest of things&#151;seeking delays in the implementation of what, to others, is self-evidently right. We know them all and saw them in the debates on the 2002 Bill, which I remember extremely well.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000002"></a>Years ago, I was an historian of 20th-century medicine. You cannot study and teach that without being extremely well aware of how the tobacco and health debate was played out in the 20th century prior to and beyond the definitive researches of Sir Richard Doll. He published before I was born, and here we are still. We are fortunate that we do not have to rely on a few personal stories but have extremely wide-ranging, incontrovertible statistical evidence. However, if noble Lords want a personal story, perhaps I may add to those that we have already heard.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000003"></a>On Monday night, I was waiting for my son at a sports centre. As I watched, a man sitting outside took a long draft on a cigarette, then his whole body convulsed in pain as he coughed. His body slowly recovered and, as soon as it had done so, he drew in the cigarette smoke once again. He had to do it, even with the excruciating pain that it was causing his body then and there. If noble Lords ever doubted addiction&#151;the absolute need to smoke, even with a terrible immediate pain&#151;they should have seen him. I was quite glad that my son, along with other kids, saw him as they came out of the sports centre. My heart went out to him because, if you like, there was no free will about that.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000004"></a>I am now a spokesperson on international development and, as the Committee heard, the parent of teenagers. Therefore, I am immensely grateful for the regulation of tobacco and the public health messages promoted in the UK. At the same time, I am appalled by the spread of the sale of tobacco in the poorest developing countries, as I know what a time bomb in health terms they have coming down the track. We need all the tools at our disposal to counter in the UK&#151;and, I hope, overseas&#151;this particular problem. We are not

The World Health Organisation has observed that even when tobacco companies devote portions of their profits to corporate social responsibility projects, things are not quite as they may seem. The WHO states that so-called,</p>
<ul><a name="09031192000035"></a>&#147;socially responsible initiatives ... sit side by side with their continued involvement in aggressive advertising and sponsorship campaigns directed at young people, financial pressures they impose on countries that attempt to limit tobacco marketing, their deliberate deception in many developing countries concerning the dangers of second-hand smoke, and attempts to actively undermine the tobacco control activities of the World Health Organization&#148;.</ul><h5><a name="09031192000038"></a>5.15 pm</h5>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000005"></a>Of course, the tobacco industry is actively lobbying against UK health policy on this issue now. As we heard on Monday from the Minister, last autumn MPs received postcards from the Save Our Shops campaign. Nowhere on those postcards was it disclosed that the campaign was industry-funded. Save Our Shops was branded as &#147;Responsible Retailers&#148;, which was actually a campaign of the Tobacco Retailers Alliance. The Tobacco Retailers Alliance is funded by the Tobacco Manufacturers&#146; Association, which in turn is funded by the three UK tobacco companies. Why am I not surprised?</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000006"></a>I offer these amendments to the Government to try to help them. The second amendment would enable them to establish a review of their guidelines on their engagement with the tobacco industry in respect of tobacco control and see the extent to which we are adhering to the important and hard-fought-for WHO convention. Government action to protect tobacco control policies from the commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry requires the insulation of tobacco control policy development from the tobacco industry to the greatest extent possible. Engagement with the tobacco industry should be limited to only those areas where it is strictly necessary; for example, to regulate tobacco products and the industry itself. Such engagement must be transparent and recorded. As I mentioned on Monday, the FCO has guidelines and makes it clear that it should not be involved in the promotion of tobacco products.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000007"></a>As was referred to earlier, we have a particular responsibility as the UK Parliament to protect public health, especially the future of our children. I offer these amendments to the Government as a couple of tools to help them in their primary concern. I beg to move.</p>

I put my name to one of them and am happy to support the other. If I might be allowed a small party point, I hope that her presence in this debate alongside the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge, indicates that the Government and those of us who believe in tobacco control will be able to count on substantial support from the Liberal Benches when we debate these issues on Report. It is important that these measures get through for all the reasons that have been expressed in successive debates in this Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09031192000009"></a>We do not need to go over old ground or to describe why the tobacco industry and tobacco products are not normal. It is unlike any other industry because of its product&#146;s uniquely deadly characteristics. If I might add my own personal anecdote to that of the noble Baroness, when I first started working in a consultancy in the early 1970s, the firm I worked for had Imperial Tobacco as one of its clients. Since I knew a bit about Parliament, I was encouraged to get involved in some of its parliamentary relations activities. I can tell the Committee that the main objective of Imperial Tobacco&#146;s parliamentary activity was to be sufficiently nice to a number of Members of Parliament in all parties to ensure that on a Friday, when Private Members&#146; Bills came up in the House of Commons to limit tobacco advertising and sponsorship, there would always be two or three of them there to say &#147;Object!&#148; at the crucial moment. For many years, this tactic worked brilliantly. The Government did not have the courage to introduce their own legislation at that time, and it was easily possible to block Private Members&#146; Bills in this way.</p>

If they were not able to get along to the function in the Palace, no doubt they would have been invited to Glyndebourne, Wimbledon, the test match, rugby league or many other activities that they were then allowed to sponsor. As I understand it, invitations are still made available to Members of the House of Lords and the other House. A number of them appear on the Register of Members&#146; Interests.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000012"></a>Indeed, I was astonished to discover last year that British American Tobacco is a corporate sponsor of Glyndebourne, which is apparently not covered by the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002. When I went to the Glyndebourne website, I found the BAT logo and clicked on it, which took me straight to the BAT company website where its various products were advertised. Members of the Committee may think that I am a spoilsport, but I am afraid that I reported it to the trading standards officer in Sussex who immediately insisted that the link be removed. Although the emblem remains, it is now no longer possible to get to the BAT site via the Glyndebourne site.</p>

<p><a name="09031192000013"></a>Today&#146;s amendments are timely. Nobody has yet mentioned that today is national No Smoking Day. I take this opportunity to congratulate my noble friends on my left on reducing smoking in the United Kingdom to its lowest-ever prevalence level, 21 per cent. This shows that the successive legislation that we have passed is working. A further important statistic that relates to national No Smoking Day is that, according to the Office for National Statistics press release, 66 per cent of smokers say that they are desperate to give up smoking. We should be doing everything that we possibly can to help them do that. We should ensure that nothing is done to encourage young people to start. Above all, we must watch what the tobacco

As we have heard from the noble Baroness, its efforts to get round legislation and sell to vulnerable markets, outside Europe if necessary, in order to keep its business going is utterly scandalous and needs to be exposed. I very much hope that my noble friend will be able to accept at least the spirit of these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="09031192000014"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031192000044"></a>Lord Naseby:</b> I address the Committee because I have yet to hear in all our deliberations any evidence that any of the tobacco companies based in the UK are pitching any of their activities to under-18s. They pitch tobacco as an adult product; it is a legal adult product. If there is evidence, I would be the first to complain and bring it to the attention of the Minister. I imagine that others would as well.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000015"></a>On Amendment 107, we are taking about the idea of reporting all promotional activities not to get around the young people, but in order to live with the existing Act. I repeat: cigarettes are legal products. The sort of activities that come to mind would affect all packaged goods. They are to do with price, handling, fees, promotional orders, pack sizes, pack shapes, new products, promotional offers and so on&#151;whatever below-the-line activity is available. I wrote a book on below-the-line activity with the University of Bradford many years ago. All those things are perfectly legal.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000016"></a>I think it was the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, but certainly somebody referred to the Prime Minister&#146;s appeal for an enterprise economy with the importance of brands and so on. An enterprise economy requires companies competing with each other, not totally regulated by the state. I do not think that Amendment 107 is legal, and it would certainly be resisted by the whole of the packaged goods industry.</p>

Do the Government pay the companies to put warnings on the packs? Do the Government pay them to put horrendous illustrations on packs? Do the Government pay them to put the amount of tar in cigarettes on the packs? The companies do everything they should do.

I apologise, first, to the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, as I did not hear the whole of her speech. The reason is that there was a huge delay on the L to Z side of the Voting Lobby, hence I was unable to get here within the 10 minutes. Perhaps I may suggest that when there is a Division in the House, the rule should be that the Committee adjourns until a Vote has been declared. That would be more sensible and would ensure that Members of the Committee do not miss part of the proceedings.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000022"></a>I honestly believe that the attacks on the tobacco industry are becoming a scandal. As the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, other noble Lords and I have pointed out, the whole tobacco industry is a legal business whether people like it or not. If one wants to stop the industry producing and selling the commodity, it will have to be banned. If tobacco is not banned, the companies must be allowed to sell it and promote it. The industry has been under considerable pressure over a very long period, including the banning of sponsorship.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000023"></a>I interject that I have not been invited to Glyndebourne&#151;I probably would not go anyway&#151;and the sponsorship of events by other tobacco companies must now be very small because it is against the law for them to do so. Again, I say, having had contact with the industry, that it is entitled to put its point of view. This is still a free country, or I thought it was a free country. Apparently if an industry, although legal, is not thought to be quite the thing, it is not allowed to be heard. I demand that it is allowed to be heard, which is why I supported the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment last week. It will give the industry the opportunity to be heard. I have to say, too, that the tobacco industry has been&#151;it is not going to like this; how shall I put it?</p>

It has not, in fact, put its point of view forward as it should have done or protected its customers as it should have done. It has allowed its retailers to be abused and allowed smokers to be abused and made pariahs. When is it going to get a say? Why should it not be able to promote its product in a free commercial sense, in a free country?</p>

I, too, tabled Questions about smoking. In fact, I have a file on smoking about so high, because I have been around the subject for well over 20 years. I asked a Question recently,</p>
<ul><a name="09031192000036"></a>&#147;whether the Action for Smoking on Health Group (ASH) or other anti-smoking organisations have received Government funding in 2006, 2007 and 2008; and, if so, how much in each year&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/1/09; cols. WA22-23.]</ul>
<p><a name="09031192000032"></a>The Answer was &#163;180,000 in 2005-06, &#163;185,400 in 2006-07, and &#163;191,000 in 2007-08. That is a total of &#163;556,400. Of course, it has gone from being a voluntary organisation to one with a chief executive. It has really grown in importance as the Government continue to support it.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031192000027"></a>That is not all. As was mentioned earlier, this is No Smoking Day, which is going to cost the taxpayers &#163;250,000. All sorts of other people are being promoted, the anti-smoking lobby in particular.</p>

He asked why the industry should not be able to promote the sale of its products. It is because the product kills. It is the greatest single cause of ill health now valid in the United Kingdom, and we must do everything to prevent promotion of sale. To answer the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, and the noble Baroness, Lady Golding, about why the industry is not targeting those under 18, I should say that the reason is very simple: it is not legal for people under 18 to buy tobacco. If it were legal, I have no doubt at all that it would target them as well.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000005"></a>I am always told that smoking kills. However, I am sure that it would be agreed that smoking does not kill everyone who smokes. Indeed, as I have pointed out before, 78 per cent of those who die from smoking-relating diseases are over 65 years of age. Under that age, the number is very small indeed.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000010"></a>I believe&#151;I shall finish on this point&#151;that, of the other products, the most damaging in this country is alcohol. Let us make no mistake about it; that drug does more damage to the social fabric and to families and individuals than anything else. Smokers do not go outside to have a cigarette and then knife someone in the back; nor do they usually go home and beat up their families, which many drunken people do&#151;not only men but women as well. It is the most dangerous drug, yet the sale of it is allowed to be promoted in virtually every way except on television.</p>

The noble Baroness may be interested to know that I prepared a Bill, which had its First Reading, to ban alcohol advertising, so I am well ahead of her. However, I have come to the conclusion that when we ban people from promoting legal products, we have to be very careful and, with regard to tobacco, much less hypocritical.</p>

It tends to kill people who smoke heavily and people with the wrong sort of genes, but people who do not smoke very heavily and have the right sort of genes can smoke and live to a great age. He will remember Madame Calment of Arles who lived to the age of 122 and smoked two or three cigarettes a day until she was 116, and she was not alone in that sort of thing.</p>

We have considerable sympathy with the intention behind these amendments. They seek to support and protect public health policy development by ensuring it is informed about the tobacco industry&#146;s activities or that it is protected from tobacco industry interference.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000015"></a>I turn first to Amendment 107. Experience has shown that if you clamp down on the tobacco industry in one area of promotion, it will actively look for alternative means of promotion. Knowing what promotional activities are being planned, developed and implemented by tobacco companies would clearly be an advantage and allow public health policy to keep pace with developments. On the other hand, some noble Lords vociferously said that they consider that such a requirement would go beyond the bounds of a proportionate and appropriate burden on business and be likely to compromise sensitive commercial confidences. I have to ask whether we need to ensure that commercial confidence is protected in this area. There are arguments on both sides but, on balance, I do not feel able to accept this amendment. Nevertheless, I have listened carefully to all the points made during this debate. I would be interested to hear more on the subject and will be happy to meet noble Lords to listen further to their views on this topic.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000016"></a>I now turn to Amendment 107B, which seeks a review and published guidelines on interaction with the tobacco industry. As the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, explained, Article 5.3 of the World Health Organisation&#146;s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031194000189"></a>&#147;In setting and implementing their public health policies with respect to tobacco control, Parties shall act to protect these policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry in accordance with national law.&#148;</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000017"></a>The UK is a signatory to the framework convention and takes its obligations under the agreement very seriously.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000018"></a>In November 2008, we played a part alongside European Union colleagues in developing and agreeing final guidelines for the implementation of Article 5.3. I shall not quote any more of it because the noble Baroness did so. The guidelines promote accountability and transparency when Governments interact with the tobacco industry on public health matters. In practice, this means that meetings between the Department of Health and the tobacco industry are held on an exceptional basis only where that serves the purpose of public health policy development. It is made clear to attendees of a meeting that it will cover the specific subject in question only and that details of the meeting will be made available to any individual on request. I am not sure how a review and the publication of more guidelines would improve how we abide by those obligations, but I am always happy to look at ideas about how that could happen. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I am also touched that the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, minded that he missed part of what I said, and I am encouraged by what the noble Baroness, Lady Golding, and the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, who is not in his place, said, which recognised the harm caused to children by beginning to smoke. I look forward to them playing an active part overseas in ensuring that the tobacco industry does not target young people. Their assumption is built on the knowledge that this is Russian roulette. When people take up smoking, they do not know whether they will live to 95 or to a much younger age as a result of taking up that habit. The fact that they recognise the danger of tobacco smoking is welcome. Therefore, I would not wish to promote advertising to any age and certainly not to children. I look forward not only to their defence of children in Britain and elsewhere, but also their defence of the adult population in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000027"></a>The aim of this group of amendments is to seek assurances from the Government that revised regulations enabled by the Bill will not undermine the ability of dispensing doctors to provide services to patients in rural areas. Additionally, it seeks to ensure that patients' preferences are fully taken into account when deciding how pharmaceutical services are to be provided in rural areas.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000028"></a>The development of pharmaceutical needs assessments will change the way that applications to provide pharmaceutical services are judged and the future shape of these services. Where this impacts on other health services&#151;for example, if PNAs grant many more pharmacy applications and lead to closures of dispensing doctors' services&#151;that needs to be taken into account. It is vital that the impact on existing services is assessed to produce a complete picture rather than making decisions in isolation.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000029"></a>The reason for mentioning services provided by dispensing doctors in particular is that they stand to be directly affected by decisions to open new pharmacies and provide a range of essential medical services to 4 million people across the country. Recently, we have seen that dispensing doctors' services are highly valued by patients. More than 99.9 per cent of responses received by the Department of Health to its recent consultation on the subject advocated no change to these services. It is important that PCTs do not overlook this service, when conducting a PNA, and this amendment would ensure that that was the case.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000030"></a>The needs of the elderly and disabled patients are unique. Not only do they have a greater need to access pharmaceutical services, but also they face greater difficulties in doing so due to mobility problems. It is therefore important that, when assessing pharmaceutical needs, PCTs take particular care to recognise the needs of these vulnerable groups and attribute them due weight.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000033"></a>I recently tabled a Question in your Lordships&#146; House on this very issue and was greatly reassured by the Government&#146;s reply. They said that there was no intention of changing the present arrangements in relation to dispensing doctors because that service in that area in particular and in many others like it is vital, particularly for elderly and disabled people. That is not least because the only retail pharmacist in the village or town is open for only a relatively short number of hours. The dispensing practice is open for much longer hours and is therefore readily accessible and a vital service.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000034"></a>I simply seek the Government&#146;s assurance that the principle underlying this amendment is accepted and that no change in relation to the services provided by dispensing doctors will be contemplated.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000035"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031194000251"></a>Baroness Masham of Ilton:</b> I, too, support the amendment. I live in rural North Yorkshire when I am not in London, and the difference between the services in London, where there are many pharmacists, and those in the rural areas of North Yorkshire, which is the same size as Belgium, is vast. This affects not only the elderly and disabled but the many people who do not drive, and that must not be forgotten. When my noble friend asked his Question and the Government gave us an assurance that rural doctors would still be able to prescribe, that was very welcome.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000036"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09031194000252"></a>Earl Howe:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, has very capably outlined some of the concerns which I am aware are current among members of the pharmacy profession in the community. In speaking to my own Amendment 112, which is grouped here, I should just like to add a few words to what he has said.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000037"></a>Life in rural communities has a number of features which need to be considered&#151;almost automatically&#151;whenever health services of any kind are planned. The distances that people have to travel to access services are greater than in urban areas; access to community services, including the voluntary sector, is more difficult because of the nature and sparseness of public transport links; and there can also be considerable degrees of social deprivation in rural areas, and hence greater health inequalities. It is for those reasons that there has been such support for the retention of dispensing GPs.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000038"></a>One worry that many people have is that the Bill now before us could have adverse consequences not only for dispensing doctors but also for rural communities more generally. The reason for that worry is the lack of clarity about how well PCTs are equipped to gauge the needs and preferences of those who live in less populated  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC470"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC470</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>areas, and what information they will draw on as they make these assessments of need. Experience of PNAs to date suggests that their quality is generally mediocre to poor. The White Paper concluded that existing PNAs were highly variable in their, &#147;scope, depth and breadth&#148;, which I read as a rather damning indictment.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000039"></a>This finding represented a number of concerns raised in the earlier consultation exercise. One concern of the pharmacy community was that PNAs, as they exist at present, are disproportionately focused on cost-effectiveness and not enough on health need. It seems to me that, if that concern is to be dispelled, ways have to be found of reconciling the duty on commissioners to be cost-effective with their duty to meet perceived health need and to do this in a transparent manner that will command public confidence. The prospect of bringing this about is by no means assured. We simply do not know enough about how the needs assessment will actually work, nor whether PCTs will be fully up to the task of carrying them out. In particular, there is a fear that the way in which needs assessments are translated into service delivery could once again cause dispensing GPs to be under threat, this time as a direct consequence of decisions taken which would permit new pharmacies to provide NHS services.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000040"></a>Additionally, there is concern about the ability of PCTs to adapt with sufficient speed to the changes that are needed in the commissioning of enhanced and advanced services. It is quite telling that the latest available data from the NHS Information Centre suggest that, between 2006-07 and 2007-08, the number of out-of-hours services commissioned by PCTs from community pharmacy declined by 9 per cent. In the same period, the number of home delivery services commissioned from pharmacy declined by 47 per cent, and only 138 community pharmacies out of more than 10,000 were commissioned to provide prescribing services to GPs. Those figures do not give one much confidence that enhanced services are currently high on the agenda of PCTs, whether for rural areas or for the country more generally.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000041"></a>Like the noble Lord, I would be grateful for any reassurance that the Minister is able to give on this set of concerns. The next group of amendments will provide an opportunity to debate the subject matter of these clauses in a more general way, but this is undoubtedly a useful lead-in to a topic which is perhaps less straightforward than it first appears.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000042"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09031194000253"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> When I was a Minister in the department, it was drummed into me that doctors prescribe and pharmacists dispense. The reason given was that it was good practice because it avoided the conflicts of interest that could arise when doctors were perhaps tempted to prescribe drugs that played into their financial interests.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000043"></a>The exception to that has of course been in rural areas. That is absolutely right, and I take on board what the noble Lord, Lord Walton, and the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, said. We need some exceptions. However, I am confused about what a &#147;rural area&#148; is. I can certainly understand that, in the highlands of Scotland, on the top of Dartmoor and in the Yorkshire

But what are those distances?</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000044"></a>I seek the definition of &#147;rural&#148; from the Minister. Voltaire said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031194000191"></a>&#147;If you wish to converse with me, define your terms&#148;,</p>

<p><a name="09031194000182"></a>so I seek the terms of &#147;rural&#148;. The Oxford English Dictionary describes it as &#147;pastoral&#148;, which sounds a bit old fashioned to me, or &#147;agricultural&#148;, which is also rather vague. The Minister might say that it is up to the PCTs to define what is rural. That is not good enough. This is a basic block of government policy and we need to know what we are talking about.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000045"></a>The present system appears to define &#147;rural&#148; as one mile from a chemist shop, because GPs are allowed to dispense to patients who live more than one mile away from a pharmacy. This is a nonsense, especially when car ownership has increased considerably over the past few years and many pharmacists provide doorstep deliveries of medicines that they dispense. I have not found many GP practices that do that. Contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Walton, was saying, I have seen pharmacies with much longer hours than GP practices. It is interesting that GPs talk about out-of-hours. Whose hours? It may be their out-of-hours but they are actually my in-hours. My in-hours are evenings and weekends, but that apparently is not what doctors have.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000046"></a>We know that pharmacists are experts in their field and, unlike dispensing doctors, we know that a pharmacist is dispensing the medication. A dispensing doctor does not have to have a trained pharmacist. A young person with an NVQ, with perhaps just a year&#146;s training, could do it. Where a pharmacist does it, you get a second view, a check. Certainly, in my area, that second check has proved to be very valuable. Pharmacists also do medicine-use reviews, which have been useful.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000047"></a>The Government produced a very good White Paper, <I>Pharmacy in England: Building on </I><I>S</I><I>trengths</I><I>&#151;</I><I>D</I><I>elivering the </I><I>F</I><I>uture. </I>I am an officer of the All-Party Pharmacy Group, from whose work quite a lot of that document arose. The document has 139 pages and a very interesting annexe, which is about health challenges and how pharmacy can contribute. The health challenges are healthy weight, healthy lives, smoking&#151;which is of interest to this Committee&#151;sexual health, alcohol use, an ageing population&#151;which is perhaps also of interest to this Committee&#151;long-term conditions, mental health, healthcare-associated infections, medication-related harm, drug misuse-related harm and health and work. Alongside every health challenge is a column on the long-term impact if it is not addressed. There is then a column which sets out how pharmacy can contribute, followed by one on the likely benefits and outcomes. It is very clear, very good and puts the whole matter into context. It is therefore clear that the Government feel that pharmacy has a future and that it has untapped potential. Having received the RCN&#146;s briefing, I was interested to see how it welcomed the integration of pharmacy into primary care.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000048"></a>It is wrong to confuse dispensing doctors and their service with the wide range of services that pharmacy provides, especially in health promotion. I receive the

On the front page of the issue of 28 February is a picture of a very large boot stamping on a packet of cigarettes beside the headline, &#147;Stamping out smoking: are targets achievable?&#148;. In the document is an extremely good, comprehensive report on how to encourage smoking cessation. The author, Andrew McGeogh, gives tips on engaging more clients and re-engaging those who have failed in previous attempts to give up. He writes of the smokers that they say, &#147;I tried to quit before&#148; and that you say, &#147;Not with me. This is our first attempt&#148;. So some very strong messages are going through that subject of smoking.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000049"></a>Pharmacists provide over-the-counter medicines, which a dispensing doctor does not, and they give advice. Very often, the advice one receives in a pharmacy is much more accessible than in a doctor&#146;s surgery. You are on neutral territory, as opposed to a doctor&#146;s waiting room or consulting room, which feels like their territory.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000050"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09031194000254"></a>Baroness Howarth of Breckland:</b> That is a question of opinion. I am likely to sit in my doctor&#146;s waiting room and read the various pamphlets; I am certainly not going to do that in the chemist. I need the noble Baroness&#146;s help, because I have got a bit lost on where we are in relation to the amendments. I would be grateful if she could point me in the right direction. However, I just wanted to challenge her on what I thought was an assumption, not evidence.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000051"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09031194000255"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> The noble Baroness is absolutely right to some extent, but this is anecdotal evidence. One talks to pharmacists and sees young people go into a pharmacy and get products from them that they would not dare to ask of a GP because they or their parents are known in the GP&#146;s area. One only has to think of sexual health and other such matters.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000052"></a>I am contributing to this debate because we are talking about dispensing doctors in rural areas. I am drawing a distinction between what dispensing doctors provide and what pharmacists provide. The two are often in conflict. That is a pity, but that is the way we are.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000053"></a>I am concerned, and again this comes from personal experience. In my area the GPs decided to go for dispensing, which would have closed our chemist&#146;s. We would have lost a whole range of services because of the local GPs taking that action. When the chemist became very purist and stocked only medicines and things that were to do with ill health, the village rose up and said, &#147;No. We want our toothpaste, soaps and creams back&#148;. The pharmacy, which is part of a chain, reacted to that and we got the products back.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000054"></a>The GPs wanted to introduce dispensing, despite the fact that the whole village rose up and did not want them to dispense because they recognised what they were losing. The GPs went ahead with an appeal, but people in the village were fantastic about appearing at that appeal and won it by a margin of 80 per cent. I am anxious that, although I understand some of the strengths of dispensing doctors, we do not lose pharmacies as a result of the extraordinary system whereby the rural area is defined by one mile.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000055"></a>I ask the Minister to have another look at all this. I know it is a sensitive and difficult subject. One also ought to take into account value for money: when GPs dispense they get more per medicine dispensed than does the pharmacist. They get a grant to set up a new service and an added income of, on average, &#163;127,000 each. GPs are not on the breadline&#151;they have done pretty well out of past contracts. From the Government&#146;s point of view, bearing in mind their expenditure and the financial situation we are in, some of these points need to be addressed, and it takes courage to do that.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000056"></a>What are we talking about when we say &#147;rural&#148;? And what are the Minister or her colleagues going to do about some of the anomalies that need to be addressed?</p>

I cannot help feeling that the noble Baroness&#146;s experience is in some way exceptional. In the dispensing practice to which I refer in my town in Northumberland, and in several others in the same rural area, it is not the doctors who dispense; they employ a qualified and trained dispenser in a separate part of the surgery which is quite independent. The doctors themselves are not producing the medicines, the tablets and so on; they have a dispenser who is part of the practice. That is a good arrangement.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000058"></a>In passing, I ask that, if this amendment is to be pursued further, could we please have a correction of the two spelling mistakes?</p>

<p><a name="09031194000059"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09031194000257"></a>Baroness Cumberlege:</b> I am delighted to hear what the noble Lord has said, but it is not the norm for a qualified pharmacist to be employed by the GPs. They can employ anyone who has something like a year&#146;s training, which is what many of them do, and of course you lose all the other advantages that pharmacies offer.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000060"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09031194000258"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> The amendment of my noble friend Lady Gibson, spoken to by my noble friend Lord Faulkner, would amend this clause in two ways. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, seek to amend the clause in a slightly different way. My noble friend&#146;s amendment would require, first, that regulations made provision so that the services provided by dispensing doctors were included by the primary care trusts in their pharmaceutical needs assessment along with the circumstantial needs of older and disabled patients everywhere, but with particular mention of rural areas. Secondly, they would enable the regulations to make provision so that the pharmaceutical services to which an assessment must relate would include in particular the services of dispensing doctors.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000061"></a>The Government have always recognised the importance of dispensing services for those who cannot easily access a pharmacy, and recognise the value that patients put on them, as so eloquently expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham. That is why, following consultation, my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Care Services Phil Hope made clear last   


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC474"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>December that there would be no change to the arrangements currently in place under which doctors are authorised to dispense to their eligible patients. Indeed, in response to a Question in the House, I repeated that.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000062"></a>Like my noble friend, I fully accept that the needs of older or disabled people must form part of a comprehensive assessment of pharmaceutical needs locally. After all, we know that older people are far more likely to be frequent users of their pharmacies, as are those with long-term conditions, but important as these users are, they are not the only groups to be considered. The important thing must be that primary care trusts undertake comprehensive needs assessments that are specific to their areas. I am not convinced that we assist them in this task by laying down in the Bill the types of needs or the kinds of services that they must or must not take into account beyond what we have already proposed. We run the risk of undermining their work or of omitting some aspect of critical importance locally that we may be unaware of nationally. I would not wish to fetter their discretion in this way, but I reassure my noble friend that it would, in my view, be a very odd assessment that did not, for example, consider the needs of older or disabled people or did not include, where appropriate, the services of dispensing doctors. It might be appropriate to make specific provision for such matters in the regulations to come&#151;it is certainly appropriate for the information and guidance now being produced for primary care trusts&#151;but that is best decided by all interested parties when drawing up the detailed regulations that will support implementation rather than it being in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000063"></a>I turn now to the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, which is closely linked to that tabled by my noble friend. Their amendment adds a specific provision that the regulations require primary care trusts to have particular regard to the needs of rural populations when making their pharmaceutical needs assessment. Rurality is not defined by one mile. The rule is that patients in designated rural areas who live within one mile of a pharmacy should, with limited exceptions, use it. There is no intention to change the dispensing doctor arrangements. I am not sure that I am going to satisfy the noble Baroness in the definition of &#147;rural&#148; when I tell her that rurality&#151;I am not sure that is a real word&#151;is determined by PCTs. PCT decisions are appealable, and guidance has been issued to them on factors that they may consider. I will send it to the noble Baroness. I suspect that we will continue this discussion.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000064"></a>I shall address the more general points raised by the noble Earl about the capabilities of PCTs in the next group of amendments, which relate specifically to them, and shall not go into detail here. As noble Lords may be aware, in 2004-05, all primary care trusts in England were advised to develop a pharmaceutical needs assessment in preparation for the community pharmacy contractual framework and the reform of the existing control of entry regulations. It was envisaged that these assessments would equip each primary care trust to deal with control of entry applications for   


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC475"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC475</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>their area, including urban, suburban and rural areas. Under this new power, we expect to require primary care trusts to include a full assessment of the needs of their area, whether it covers rural, urban or suburban areas, and the population mix. I thank the noble Baroness for referring to the report of the All-Party Pharmacy Group, because it helped to shape the pharmacy White Paper.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000065"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, made a point about out-of-hours services and home deliveries. PCTs commission according to their assessment of local needs. A decline in numbers might be an issue, or it might be attributable to more pharmacies opening with extended hours or to pharmacies voluntarily providing home deliveries. I am not sure we have evidence of what is behind the decline. I listened carefully to what noble Lords said, but I am not, at the moment, persuaded of the necessity of including in the Bill the consideration of the circumstances of the rural population. However, I reassure noble Lords that any pharmaceutical needs assessment will have to consider the overall needs of the whole population in the primary care trust&#146;s area and be as comprehensive as possible. I stress that we expect primary care trusts that have rural populations to ensure that they take full account of their particular needs and circumstances. I hope I have been able to reassure the noble Lords sufficiently on these matters and ask them not to press their amendments.</p>

For a number of years, as my noble friend Lady Cumberlege mentioned, the Government have spoken of pharmacy as an untapped resource. The reforms that have so far been put in place have not really changed things appreciably, in the sense that patients use pharmacy in a way that might lead to improved health outcomes. For that reason, last year&#146;s pharmacy White Paper, <I>Pharmacy in England</I>, and the <I>Review of NHS </I><I>P</I><I>harmaceutical </I><I>C</I><I>ontractu</I><I>al A</I><I>rrangements</I> published by Anne Galbraith were welcome developments. Both those documents found that effective commissioning by PCTs in the area of pharmacy was still some way off. Four structural changes were recommended. I shall not go through them, but the fourth one is the only one to be contained in this Bill&#151;that is, proposals to change pharmaceutical needs assessments.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000070"></a>The White Paper and the Galbraith report identified major shortcomings in the ability of PCTs to commission pharmacy services. The strong implication of the White Paper was that PCTs needed to embrace what amounts to a cultural change if they are to come close to approaching world-class commissioning standards in this area. As we have just debated under the previous group of amendments, many in the pharmacy community do not think that PCTs are capable of writing accurate or robust PNAs that are kept up to date and respond to locally changing patterns of demand or need. The sort of thing that I hear from the pharmacy world is that very few PNAs have been updated since they were first introduced in 2005, largely because of a lack of resources. I am told that it is common practice for PNAs to be largely ignored in appeal cases&#151;that is, cases heard to consider applications for new pharmacies to be included in the pharmaceutical list. Some PCTs do not have a PNA at all and many that do exist are simply a commentary on what services are currently on offer, rather than anything more forward-looking. Could the Minister tell us of even one example of a new pharmacy contract being awarded as a result of a specific need being identified for a new pharmacy within a PNA? There may be one, but I have not heard of it.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000071"></a>If this system is to work as it should, it is essential for PNAs to be continuously updated and to be linked to a PCT&#146;s wider strategic services delivery plan. The relevant regulations need to be quite specific on this score. In Amendment 111A, therefore, I am proposing that in order to make faster progress in the long run we should initially take things more slowly by introducing PNAs by means of pilot schemes. The Government have so far ruled out piloting PNAs on the grounds that that would delay their full benefits. I think I see things a bit differently&#151;in fact, I know I do. We embark on this exercise from where we are, not from

We need to monitor progress closely, which is why there is a good case for enabling PCTs to refine their approach over a limited period of time, and then for those PCTs that have taken part in the pilots to share best practice with others. It would be helpful to hear the Minister&#146;s thoughts on all that.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000072"></a>The basic problem with the creation of PNAs is that they do not address the areas of major concern that were raised during the Government&#146;s consultation exercise. For example, we do not know the extent to which PNAs will in practice be based on robust, high-quality data. Unless they are, they are likely to remain as crude tools that are disproportionately focused on cost-effectiveness as opposed to local health needs. We do not know how effectively PCTs will use PNAs, especially given their record to date of disinvesting in enhanced services such as out-of-hours opening and local delivery, as I pointed out in the last group of amendments, although I will go away and consider the reply that the Minister gave a moment ago. Nor, importantly, can we have confidence that PNAs will create a basis for commissioning pharmacy services that is consistent and rational across the country.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000073"></a>There is much to be said not only for pilot schemes but for a national framework for PNAs that could be adapted at local level to suit local conditions. A national template would include data sets and statistical models from which each PCT should work in order to ensure, first, that the PNA was robust and, secondly, to give clarity for contractors. If there is not to be such a framework, we have to ask how robust the process is likely to be and how precisely assessments will translate into service delivery. Those are the uncertainties here, and I am afraid they are fairly basic ones. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply. I beg to move.</p>

There is no question in my mind that they are the first port of call for a huge proportion of the population when seeking advice, healthcare or leaflets. The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, mentioned people not picking up leaflets, but certainly in our local pharmacist&#146;s there is an enormous amount of advice. They serve the population with important information. As a newly qualified doctor doing GP locums, I found that pharmacists got me out of holes time and again when I got the odd prescription wrong or the decimal point in the wrong place. The pharmacists know it all and they will always gently put you right. I would like that to go on record.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000075"></a>I am also a huge fan of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, who has said everything that needs to be said on these amendments. I support his call for pilot schemes. I think there was one thing, but I am not sure; my mind may have wandered, so I do not know whether he really did mention this. There is a requirement that pharmaceutical needs assessments will,</p>

<ul><a name="09031194000217"></a>&#147;can ... stipulate minimum standards for premises ... The guidance goes on to provide that the PCT should be able to undertake a number of commissioning and regulatory functions&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="09031194000184"></a>I do not think the noble Earl mentioned that. That causes some concern among pharmacists I know. Will it be a conflict of regulatory power with the General Pharmaceutical Council?</p>

<p><a name="09031194000076"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09031194000265"></a>Earl Howe:</b> No, I did not mention it because it is coming up in the next amendment.</p>

It is crucially important that this kind of inquiry, perhaps on a pilot basis, can define more precisely the needs of the pharmaceutical services in a particular area.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000079"></a>The Committee will forgive me for going back to my point about the particular dispensing practice in the village where I live. It has a fascinating and wholly acceptable symbiosis with the local pharmacist, with an agreement which is obviously quite different from that in the village of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege. If you get a prescription from the practice in the morning and you live in the village, you must take it to the pharmacist&#146;s shop; they will not dispense from the individual practice. Dispensing from the practice is for people who live outside the village, a long distance away, or who go the surgery to get a prescription when the local pharmacist is closed. That kind of local agreement, which can be part of a pharmaceutical assessment scheme, is quite invaluable.</p>

He is joined in this by the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge. I have listened to what the noble Earl has said, am not convinced of the strength of their case for piloting and hope to convince them about this.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000081"></a>In the Bill, primary care trusts will be required to undertake and publish their assessments of pharmaceutical needs in accordance with regulations. These regulations would set out the structure and content of these assessments and how primary care trusts should carry them out. They would also enable the Secretary of State to set out the circumstances under which a primary care trust must make a new assessment. The department expects to work closely with interested parties, including NHS and contractors&#146; representatives, on drafting these requirements.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000082"></a>When primary care trusts first developed their pharmaceutical needs assessments in 2004-05, they were not piloted. I am not aware that any strategic commissioning tools which PCTs have been tasked with developing, such as joint strategic needs assessments, were first piloted and evaluated. Of course, before this duty went live, there would have been wide discussion and consultation on specific requirements. We do not propose to act differently here.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000083"></a>I well understand the concern that primary care trusts do not yet have sufficient capacity and capability to produce these assessments across the piece, but we have already put in train&#151;with NHS Employers and as promised in the pharmacy White Paper&#151;a

Further resources will be available later this spring to include guidance on how to commission pharmaceutical services and more detailed advice on the information that these needs assessments should contain. A formal piloting and evaluation programme would mean a delay of at least two years, and probably longer, in achieving the goal of universally strengthened local assessments of pharmaceutical needs. That is not a delay that we would wish to see.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000084"></a>I will not address the amendments of my noble friend Lady Gibson, as they have not been spoken to. I am sure that she will bring them back at an appropriate time if she so wishes.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000085"></a>The second amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in which he is joined by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, proposes a requirement for the Secretary of State to publish guidance on the manner in which commissioning of pharmaceutical services may be informed by the results of an assessment. The virtue of producing guidance to support the regulations is that it can go much wider if it is not tied to the regulations. It can explain what is&#151;and, importantly, what is not&#151;in the legislation. I would not want to fetter this freedom in any way.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000086"></a>I referred earlier to the comprehensive support programme for primary care trusts that we are putting in place. Given the action already under way, we are not convinced of the need to bolster that with a new legislative duty.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000087"></a>The noble Earl referred to new pharmacy contracts awarded as a result of the PNA. No information is currently held on that centrally. Under the current legislation, PCT decisions are not required to be based on PNAs&#151;hence the proposals in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000090"></a>I am sorry that my amendments have fallen on stony ground with the Minister, although I am not entirely surprised. However, I think that there is an issue here about devolving all decision-making. The noble Baroness said that she did not wish to fetter the freedoms of PCTs. I realise that this is not quite the sense conveyed by my amendment but I spoke about having a national framework so as to arrive at PNAs that are consistent and rational across the country. There can be no better example of what I am thinking about than vascular screening. The Prime Minister announced in January last year the introduction of a uniform and universal vascular risk assessment for everyone in England between the ages of 40 and 74, which will be implemented in full by 2012. The national

This is what <I>Pulse</I> magazine had to say about the whole thing about three weeks ago:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031194000193"></a>&#147;No Government policy illustrates localism gone mad better than the vascular screening programme, which in fact is not a programme at all. A programme implies common aims, an agreed methodology and a consistent set of criteria for evaluating success. Vascular screening has only a vague aspiration, sketched guidance and implementation plans that vary widely from one area to another ... Some areas use pharmacists, others are employing battle-buses outside supermarkets. There is not even any agreement over the methods used to assess risk or consensus over how those at risk should be managed once identified&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000185"></a>So, by way of example, if there were a national requirement to incorporate an assessment of the needs of a PCT&#146;s population for vascular risk assessment into PNAs, this would be a good first step towards establishing a more systematic and consistent approach to undertaking vascular screening across the country. I am troubled that we are going to leave all this to PCTs. I am afraid that, although many of them are well equipped to do it, many will struggle and will find themselves considerably at sea. There is no more that I wish to say at the moment, unless the Minister wishes to comment.</p>

As I argued earlier, if we rely on localism to determine what pharmacy services there should be in an area and how they should be delivered, they are unlikely&#151;subject to the regulations, which I look forward to reading&#151;to have a recipe for national consistency in the configuration of those services.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000094"></a>There is another aspect of localism that causes concern, as the noble Baroness said&#151;the power that the Government propose to confer on PCTs to set standards and regulate pharmacy premises. By giving considerable discretion to PCTs to decide the standard of pharmacy services needed in an area and who should and should not provide those services, there is scope for substantial argument, or even litigation. The natural question that arises is who regulates pharmacists. Is it PCTs or is it the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain? If it is in effect both, which body takes precedence? I see the potential for confusion here, and I should be glad of the Minister&#146;s comments, which I hope will reassure me in some measure. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000097"></a>The Government made a commitment in 2002 to provide increased protection to the public by ensuring that all registered primary care practitioners performing NHS services in the community were listed with primary care trusts. They subsequently introduced a framework via the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2005 within which primary care trusts can take action if a pharmacy contractor&#146;s professional conduct, competence or performance gives cause for concern when an applicant applies to be admitted to a primary care trust&#146;s pharmaceutical list or afterwards. Known as &#147;fitness to practise&#148;, it applies to pharmacies and appliance contractors whether they are sole traders, limited liability partnerships or bodies corporate.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000098"></a><I>A Vision for Pharmacy</I> for 2003 mapped out the ambition for a contractual framework for community pharmacy to reflect modern service requirements and to help ensure community pharmacy is an integral part of the NHS and not just another shop on the high street. The community pharmacy contractual framework went live from April 2005 with all pharmacies providing essential services from October 2005. Primary care trusts are charged with monitoring performance of the framework in their areas. Under the framework, services are divided into three categories: essential services, advanced services and enhanced services. Service specifications were agreed with pharmacy bodies and published for all essential services, advanced services and a number of enhanced services. These include minimum standards, for example, for premises and accreditation of staff.</p>

The GPhC will be the new regulator for pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and pharmacy premises, taking over the role currently performed by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, whose functions are being split. The purpose of this is to modernise and strengthen the regulation of healthcare professionals to ensure patient, public and professional confidence and to make protection of patients and public the first priority. Noble Lords are completely familiar with those issues. As a regulator, the GPhC will have the power both to operate fitness-to-practise procedures to deal with registrants where there are concerns about their fitness to practise and to protect the public from registrants who become unfit to practise and for registration, regulation and inspection of pharmacy premises and enforcement responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000100"></a>As noble Lords may be aware, under powers in Sections 151 to 153 of the NHS Act 2006, before including a pharmacy or appliance contractor in its pharmaceutical list, a primary care trust must be satisfied that the practitioner is suitable to be included on that list. The sections outline the grounds on which the trusts can refuse to include that person or, if a person is already on the list, the grounds on which they can be removed. I am concerned that this amendment could potentially undermine the powers that have been in place for over three years.</p>

There is a distinction, albeit a fine one, between deciding that the way a pharmacist is delivering services is unsuited to the needs of an area, for whatever reason, and regulating pharmacy standards and fitness to practise.

Clause 26 adds a new section after Section 150 of the National Health Service Act 2006. It gives the Secretary of State power through regulations to enable PCTs to issue remedial notices or to withhold payments as part of action to secure quality pharmaceutical services and to manage performance. The effect of the clause will be to give PCTs new powers and discretions in respect of appropriate action to address poor performance and to decommission poor services.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000106"></a>I propose two minor and technical amendments to this clause for England. The first will remove the definition of &#147;pharmaceutical services&#148; from new Section 150A(3). That definition is unnecessary in the clause as the term is already defined in the existing legislation in Section 126(8) of the NHS Act. The second will insert a definition of &#147;practitioner&#148; in Section 150A(3). That will clarify the use of the term &#147;practitioner&#148; in Section 150A(1) and adopts the same language as is used to define the term elsewhere in the NHS Act.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000107"></a>There are five amendments in respect of the provisions regarding the NHS (Wales) Act 2006. These are also minor and technical and, I stress, have been agreed by Welsh Ministers. They concern NHS ophthalmic and pharmaceutical services in Wales. The first four amendments concern the equivalent provisions for Wales regarding notices and penalties, to which I have just referred.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000108"></a>The first amendment would create a new Chapter 1A of the NHS (Wales) Act 2006 for the provisions concerning notices and penalties. Rather than adding them to an existing chapter, this amendment means that the Welsh provisions are treated in the same way as the English provisions. The actual provisions will be unaltered by this change.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000109"></a>The second amendment clarifies that the provisions in the new Section 106A extend to practitioners who provide pharmaceutical services and general ophthalmic

This is because Wales has not followed the route in England of direct contracting for ophthalmic services but retains its previous arrangements.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000110"></a>The third and fourth amendments replicate for Wales the amendments for England to which I have already referred and also remove the definition of &#147;ophthalmic services&#148;. Definitions of ophthalmic and pharmaceutical services in the new Section 106A(3) are unnecessary as they are already defined elsewhere in the NHS (Wales) Act 2006. Pharmaceutical services are defined in Section 80(8) and general ophthalmic services in Section 71(10) of that Act. The insertion of a definition of &#147;practitioner&#148; into the new Section 106A(3) ensures that the language used to define &#147;practitioner&#148; is the same as that used elsewhere in Chapter 2 of Part 8 of that Act.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000111"></a>The fifth and final amendment corrects an error made at consolidation in 2006. It adds a reference to ophthalmic contractors in Section 107(9) of the NHS (Wales) Act 2006 to ensure that they must comply with the same fitness-to-practise requirements that pharmaceutical contractors must meet. I hope that Members of the Committee are content with these minor amendments and I beg to move.</p>

I place on the record how grateful I was to the Minister for her letter  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC485"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC485</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on this amendment. The notion behind reintroducing it is, first, to reduce the number of repeat prescriptions that must be prescribed and, secondly, to ensure that patients finish the course of prescribed drugs. Next, again, is the intention to emphasise the value for money that, by and large, most patients who have a prescription are getting.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000113"></a>Something that I have loved about the House since becoming a Member nearly 20 years ago&#151;only five Members of the Committee were here before me&#151;is the tremendous learning curve that one goes on to. Since reintroducing the amendment, I have spoken to lots of general practitioners and pharmacists. I was rather shocked to discover that some prescribed drugs cost literally pennies, whereas others cost hundreds of pounds.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000114"></a>I can understand the Government&#146;s reluctance to have much sympathy with the amendment, but it crosses my mind that, if I were to bring it back on Report stating that any drug costing more than &#163;10 would have to be clearly marked on the prescription, that would make it abundantly clear what fantastic value for money people in England get at &#163;7.10 or in Scotland. I am sure that the Minister is aware that Scotland is about to do away with prescription charges at a cost of &#163;65 million a year, which seems slightly extraordinary.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000115"></a>I think that there is quite a strong case for looking at this again. I know that the noble Earl, Lord Howe, was initially quite supportive when I brought this issue back during the passage of the previous Health Bill. Like all these things, once you start digging into it, it seems extraordinary that some drugs are incredibly cheap and others are incredibly expensive. One of my colleagues outside the Committee asked me whether anyone was putting me up to this. No one is putting me up to it; my main reason for introducing this amendment is simply that I am convinced that it is a very good idea that people realise what they are getting for their prescription charge. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000116"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09031194000282"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I have been in this House for almost 10 years. One thing that I learnt fairly early on is that the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, is one of the great free spirits of this House and one Member who not only thinks and speaks for himself but causes some of the rest of us to sit back and think in ways that we had not anticipated. I say that in all sincerity.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000117"></a>I have listened to the noble Lord on previous occasions when he has moved similar amendments and I have a great deal of sympathy with what he is trying to do. Those of us who sit through most of the debates in your Lordships&#146; House know that medicines management and the waste of medicines in the NHS have a particular resonance with the public. We know, too, that many people on low incomes are put off seeking and taking treatment by the disproportionate cost to them of prescriptions.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000118"></a>I do not want to make a general speech on prescriptions policy, because now is not the time for that, but my money is on the Minister coming back and explaining to the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, that even the same drug prescribed in a different place and at a different time may have a different cost depending on the method  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC486"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC486</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of purchasing it. A PCT may have a bulk discount and so on. Therefore, that is quite difficult, as is isolating the cost of a drug from the treatment.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000119"></a>However, I am enormously sympathetic to the noble Lord&#146;s desire to get through to the general public an appreciation not just of the cost of medicines but of how they themselves can be responsible about medicines. Therefore, I suggest to the noble Lord that he moves his idea in a slightly different direction by looking at the prescription forms and the general messages about the cost of medicines, together with ways in which the general public can access information about managing medicines more efficiently themselves in discussion with their clinicians. That might be one way of moving nearer to what the noble Lord is trying to achieve, which I think is entirely laudable.</p>

In my view, this is a very serious amendment because it requires greater transparency. I congratulate the noble Lord. I had originally intended to table something similar on Report, and I am pleased that he has helped us with his amendment because I am still working in that area.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000121"></a>We can expect the Government to reject the amendment. I may be wrong but I suspect that that is the case. I should like to use this amendment to appeal to those outside who can help us to table something perhaps better on Report. We have to address a number of issues which may prove difficult in implementing a system of this nature, but I should like to know what they are in some detail so that we can argue them out on Report in a more mature and sensible way.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000122"></a>There may well be a problem of price identification, which the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, has just referred to. Also, is it the retail price that should be shown? Perhaps another price would more accurately reflect the actual cost to the National Health Service. What happens in the case of drugs that are both over the counter and prescribable? There may be different price structures there. Do issues of competition arise? What is the view of pharmacies and the pharmaceutical companies on this level of transparency on the market more generally? What would the impact be on NHS procurement policies? Does it have implications for the export and import pricing of drugs?</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000123"></a>I am bringing up issues that might complicate things, but I do so only because I strongly support the principle and should like to know what the arguments against it are so that we can sit down and work out, if the Government do not accept the principle at this stage and elsewhere on this Bill, how in future we can make it work on the Floor of the House and ultimately convince the Government of the principle.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000124"></a>I support the amendment. I would not like to tell the Committee the annual cost of my drugs to the health service, but I suspect that they run into many thousands of pounds. To be frank, I should like to see on every bottle, every injection and every pill box what the costs are to the NHS. It is in the public interest that we all know what we are costing the taxpayer.</p>

It would be important for staff always to be aware of the true cost of equipment, the drugs they prescribe, admissions and so on, as staff in the NHS are often not truly aware of the costs that they incur with the things that they do. Sometimes they open packs and chuck them away or are not careful with them, or they use one type of equipment that is a lot more expensive than another.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000126"></a>The spirit behind the amendment is to be commended, although I have a feeling that it is not quite right in the way that it is put together and there could be a downside. However, perhaps we need much more open and transparent pricing across the whole of the NHS for both staff and patients.</p>

Nevertheless, I am sympathetic to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, as I have been in the past. One could regard this as part of the &#147;responsibility agenda&#148;, the term often used to denote our collective wish to get patients to take responsibility for their own health and their own care.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000128"></a>My only detailed point is one that has already been flagged up in various forms: it is difficult to refer to the actual cost or the full retail cost of any drug. Those are elusive, will-o&#146;-the-wisp terms. I suggest that the noble Lord might consider replacing those terms with &#147;the recommended retail price&#148;, which is something you can pin down. I hope that he will not let this go and that we will have a chance to debate it again.</p>

The only difficulties that I foresee are some of the points that have been made already by my noble friend Lady Finlay and the noble Earl, Lord Howe. Are we going to give the retail price? Will it include the pharmacist&#146;s dispensing fee? Many hospitals have a rule that even if a doctor writes a prescription for a proprietary preparation, the hospital may dispense the generic alternative, which will be much cheaper. The patient getting it from the hospital might meet someone getting the same drug from the local pharmacist and say, &#147;Why is mine costing so much less than yours?&#148;. All kinds of problems arise if one fulfils the amendment as printed. However, it is well worth pursuing so long as we can get it right.</p>

As noble Lords might anticipate, there are several significant reasons that lead me to believe that this amendment should be rejected.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000132"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Palmer, is completely consistent in his view, and I do not believe for one minute that anyone would put him up to anything. He will remember the debate he had with my noble friend Lord Warner on this issue during the passage of the Health Bill 2006. My noble friend&#146;s greatest concern related to patient attitudes to price labels. He promised that the issue would be taken forward with a proper study, and that study took place. I recently wrote to the noble Lord, so that he could read the detailed findings of the research. For the benefit of the Committee, the research question was whether people would continue to waste such high levels of medicines if they were aware of their actual cost. The researchers looked specifically at the effect of pricing information on medicine labels.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000133"></a>Qualitative research, in the form of focus groups, took place as well as a literature review. It clearly showed that labelling medicines with prices has significant challenges. The noble Lord, Lord Palmer, will have seen from the detailed findings how complex this issue is. The first key point is that it showed the risk that the noble Lord&#146;s amendment could present to patients who need their medicines to treat their medical condition effectively. We would not want to deter such patients from taking their medicine because they fear being a burden on the NHS if the price of their medicine is particularly high. That is particularly an issue for older patients. I can think of several of my own acquaintance who would be horrified if they knew that their medication costs the NHS thousands of pounds a year, as referred to by my noble friend.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000134"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0007.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09031194000289"></a>Lord Palmer:</b> Elderly patients would not pay prescription charges at all, would they?</p>

<p><a name="09031194000135"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="09031194000290"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I am referring to the cost of the medicine and the effect of putting pricing information on medicine labels. Equally, we would not want to deter someone who benefits from a relatively cheap medicine, who may perceive, albeit wrongly, that the lower price is linked to a lower-strength medicine or a lower level of care. The second key point, to quote the conclusion, is that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09031194000206"></a>&#147;Given the various routes to wastage (most of which seem to be beyond the control of the patient), there seems to be little possibility of reducing that wastage via pricing information&#148;.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000136"></a>The findings of the research are sufficient in their own right to oppose an amendment of this nature, but it may also be worth quickly highlighting some other practical challenges. One is calculating the full retail cost of drugs and appliances. Several Members of the Committee have mentioned that. While suppliers will publish a list price for products, that is not necessarily the cost to the NHS of supplying the product to the patient. There are other elements to take account of, such as the service fee paid to the dispensing contractor and any discount arrangements. Dispensers would not be in a position to know them all at the time of dispensing.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC489"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC489</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000137"></a>The scope of this amendment also means that it would affect far more than just prescriptions dispensed by a pharmacy or dispensing doctor in primary care. Prices would also need to be included on prescriptions dispensed, for example, by appliance contractors, out-of-hours service providers, hospital out-patient departments and walk-in centres. A practical challenge is the complexity of implementation. Changes to IT systems, including mechanisms to establish prices and to label medicines appropriately in all the NHS settings I have just mentioned, would be required. Costs would be ongoing as well as one-off. There is no evidence about how such costs and potential savings would compare.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000138"></a>I hope the noble Lord will sympathise with my reasons for feeling that this amendment should be rejected. However, to reassure him, I would like quickly to stress the fact that the department has action underway to address the very important wider issues on medicines adherence that this amendment has raised. Two of our well established policies&#151;medicines use reviews and repeat dispensing&#151;contribute to this agenda. An MUR&#146;s purpose is to improve a patient&#146;s knowledge and effective use of medicines through face-to-face consultation between the pharmacist and the patient to help reduce medicines wastage. Repeat dispensing makes it possible for patients to have their medicines dispensed in instalments for up to a year without having to contact their GP surgery. As each instalment is dispensed, the pharmacist checks that the medicines are still needed and are being used appropriately by the patient, thereby helping to reduce waste.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000139"></a>Furthermore, my noble friend Lord Darzi points out as a result of the intervention of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay&#151;it is not often that one gets briefed by the Minister, but I have been on this occasion&#151;that the next-stage review recommendation is to ensure that those who incur the most expenditure should also be accountable for it, which raises some interesting questions as we move forward.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000140"></a>The department has commissioned research, currently in progress, to establish the extent to which medicines are not used and hence wasted and how much that costs, as well as to determine the varied and complex reasons why people do not take their medicines as intended. The outcome of the research, which will be available this year, will inform future policy development for influencing both health professionals and the public to reduce the amount of unwanted medicines and provide value for money for the NHS. We need to wait for the outcome of that research so that any progress that we make is evidence-based. While I share the valid concerns of the noble Lord and others about the waste of medicines, I hope that he will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

Would it not encourage patients who are prescribed medicines to take at home to take good care of them and not mislay or lose them?

Greater transparency is an important factor in what I am trying to achieve with the amendment. I said in my opening remarks that one is opening something of a can of worms, and I quite accept the point made by my noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant that I have perhaps not worded the amendment quite as technically or as brilliantly as I might have. The noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, mentioned that the proposal might help reduce the overall cost of drugs, which must be a very good thing. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, talked about the fortune in drugs that he uses. I should perhaps have reminded the Committee that, being diabetic, I do not pay prescription charges, but I dread to think what I get free of charge on the National Health Service due to my condition. I am very grateful for the Minister&#146;s reply, and I thank her again for her letter. I may still consult her and bring back the amendment in some revised form, perhaps having spoken to my noble friends Lord Walton and Lady Finlay and the noble Baroness, Lady Barker. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

These are probing amendments, which I can cover quite briefly. In new Section 34A of the Local Government Act, we see that the definition of &#147;adult social care provider&#148; is,</p>
<ul><a name="09031194000218"></a>&#147;a person who carries on an activity which ... involves, or is connected with, the provision of adult social care&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031194000186"></a>I do not fully understand the phrase, &#147;is connected with&#148;. An activity that is connected with the provision of adult social care could include almost anything, such as the servicing of a van used to deliver food to a care home, yet we would surely not wish to say that the person engaging in that activity was an &#147;adult social care provider&#148;. The definition seems to encompass a wide range of people, and I should be glad if the Minister could explain how wide the range is intended to be in practice and why we need what appears to be a rather loose form of words here.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000145"></a>The provisions relating to the procedure that the local commissioner has to follow when investigating a complaint include a particular action: new subsection (4) says that the commissioner may obtain information and make enquiries as he sees fit but that he may also,</p>
<ul><a name="09031194000219"></a>&#147;determine whether any person may be represented (by counsel, solicitor or otherwise) in the investigation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09031194000187"></a>I question that power. If someone wishes to be represented, and there may be all sorts of perfectly good reasons why they may wish to be, then to my mind they should not be prohibited from appointing someone to act for them. What lies behind the provision? Would it enable the local commissioner to decline to deal with someone&#146;s independent advocate or a member of their family?</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000146"></a>I raise that question particularly in the light of the provision in new Section 34G(3), which says that for the purposes of an investigation a local commissioner has the same powers as the High Court in respect of the attendance and examination of witnesses and the production of documents. If that is so, we are surely dealing with a quasi-judicial process. It does not seem right that the commissioner should then be able to deny someone the right to be represented in that process.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000147"></a>A number of provisions govern the way in which a local commissioner must announce his decision on the matter he is investigating. If he decides not to investigate,  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC492"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC492</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or to discontinue an investigation, he must make a statement to that effect and say why he has made that decision. If he completes an investigation he must also make a statement setting out his conclusions and recommendations, which he then must send to various parties, including the complainant and the adult social care provider. The recommendations, naturally enough, may include action to be taken by the adult social care provider concerned. We then find in new Section 34H(8) that the statement must identify the adult social care provider concerned unless the provider is an individual and,</p>
<ul><a name="09031194000220"></a>&#147;the Local Commissioner considers that it is not appropriate for the individual to be identified&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90311-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000148"></a>I ask the Minister what kinds of circumstances might apply in which the commissioner could decide not to disclose the identity of the provider. Most would say that a person who had been found to have done something wrong should not be protected by public anonymity. On the other hand, I can see that there is an argument for protecting the identity of someone who has been in receipt of an unfounded complaint, but the Explanatory Notes shed no light on whether this kind of consideration would bear upon the local commissioner&#146;s decision, or whether other considerations would. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain the thinking behind this provision. I beg to move.</p>

Before I speak to them, I echo the noble Earl&#146;s comments on Amendment 116 about associated activities. Being familiar with this area of work, I had made an assumption that those words were included in the Bill to encompass things such as the provision of support, brokerage or care management. I was not until I heard the noble Earl that I realised quite how far and widely they could be interpreted. Clearly, they should not. I would be interested in the Minister&#146;s reply.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000150"></a>Amendments 118 and 119 also refer to the complaints procedures and the duties of the local commissioner in response to statements that are prepared. These amendments come from Help the Aged and Age Concern, soon to be a new charity for older people. Those bodies, like many Members of this Committee, are grateful that the Government listened to all the points made by noble Lords during the passage of the Health and Social Care Act. Older people who receive privately arranged or self-funded social care now have recourse to an individual complaints procedure, set out in Schedule 5 of the Bill. That is a welcome step forward.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000151"></a>However, self-funders and those who arrange their own social care are still outwith the scope of the Human Rights Act, even though they may live in residential care and may be quite vulnerable. It is therefore important that they have protection and access to a robust complaints procedure. The amendment&#146;s purpose is to move the Care Quality Commission and the local authorities up into the group of people who must receive reports of complaints, rather than those who might or may. If the CQC is to carry out its job, and local authorities are to be able to pin-point those

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000152"></a>In addition, I suggest that the local commissioner has to be adequately trained and resourced to deal with this new role. They should have a duty to inform the CQC of any negative outcomes from a complaint.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000153"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0008.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09031194000299"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I will address Amendments 116, 117 and 120 tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and Amendments 118 and 119, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000154"></a>Amendment 116 is aimed at restricting the scope of the new scheme in terms of the type of activity that is covered. New Section 34A sets out that the scheme applies to &#147;adult social care providers&#148;. An adult social care provider is defined as a person who carries on an activity which involves, or is connected with, the provision of adult social care. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would restrict the definition of &#147;adult social care provider&#148;, omitting the activities that are &#147;connected with&#148; the provision of adult social care. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, referred to this and she was right.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000155"></a>Our aim is to achieve consistency between the coverage of this new scheme and that of the registration system to be operated by the Care Quality Commission. As noble Lords may recall when we discussed this under the 2008 Act, an activity may be regulated by the CQC only if the activity involves, or is connected with, the provision of health or social care in, or in relation to, England.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000156"></a>The 2008 Act goes on to say that activities &#147;connected with&#148; the provision of health or social care include, in particular, the supply of staff who are to provide such care; the provision of transport or accommodation for those who require such care; and the provision of advice in respect of such care. I think that that illustrates very well the sorts of activity we mean when we refer to being connected with the provision of care.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000157"></a>The new CQC regulatory scheme is due to come into effect in April 2010. The Government consulted on the scope of registration last year. We will shortly publish the response to this consultation together with a consultation on draft regulations that will set out the scope of registration. I believe it is the right approach for the same activities regulated by the CQC to come within the scope of this new complaints scheme.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000158"></a>Amendment 117 seeks to remove the ombudsman&#146;s power to determine whether someone may be represented, legally or otherwise, in an investigation. This section deals with the procedure for conducting an investigation. The ombudsman can generally decide how to conduct the investigation. He may obtain information and make inquiries from any person as he sees fit. New Section 34F(4)(c) additionally is intended to clarify particular aspects of the discretion conferred on the ombudsman in the investigation procedure. It does not itself give the ombudsman that discretion. In particular, the ombudsman may restrict the presence and role of representatives acting for witnesses or for the complainant when interviewed. The aim is to  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC494"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC494</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulate the investigation procedure and to ensure that it does not become unduly bureaucratic or costly. It is also important to assist the ombudsman in obtaining evidence.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000159"></a>Permit me to illustrate this with the example of the ombudsman&#146;s current investigation procedures relating to local authorities. That is what this reflects. Interviewees may often have a friend present, who may be a relative, trade union official or a lawyer. They are there to give support to the interviewee and not to provide evidence. In cases where the ombudsman interviews a local government officer, the ombudsman may stipulate that the friend may not be an officer of the authority with previous involvement in the complaint, a legal officer of the authority, or the superior or junior officer of the interviewee. This is to avoid a conflict of interest or undue pressure being placed on the witness.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000160"></a>New Section 34F(4)(c) gives the ombudsman the same powers as under Part 3 of the 1974 Act governing his functions in respect of complaints about local councils. The intention is for the two schemes to be run as similarly as possible. Furthermore, all the UK public services ombudsmen have similar powers.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000161"></a>I now address Amendments 118 and 119, which seek to put the local government ombudsmen under a duty to send a copy of all statements they will produce about their investigations to the CQC and local authorities which may have an interest in the matter. I very much understand the aims of these amendments, which is to ensure that the CQC and relevant local authorities get to know about the complaints received by the ombudsman and factor them into their decisions relating to regulation and commissioning respectively.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000162"></a>Currently, new Section 34H(7) gives the ombudsman a power to send copies of statements to the CQC and to local authorities. That, of course, is a power, not a requirement. It differs from the provisions of subsection (6) where there is a requirement to send copies to the complainant, to the provider, to any person alleged to have taken or authorised the action which was the subject of the investigation, and to any other person who appears to the ombudsman to have taken or authorised such action. I believe that noble Lords would agree that it is absolutely right that copies of the ombudsman&#146;s statements should always be sent to those people.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000163"></a>However, statements will be produced about all complaints received by the ombudsman. Many of the statements would be of little or no interest to either the CQC or local authorities; for example, where the ombudsman has decided not to investigate and the statement simply gives his reasons for that; or where an investigation is discontinued because of lack of evidence of failure by the provider or injustice to the complainant. Of course, the complainant and provider must see the statement of why the ombudsman is not investigating, but it would rarely be of interest to the CQC.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000164"></a>I therefore do not believe that it would be necessary in all cases to send copies to the CQC and to relevant local authorities. It would, on the other hand, be entirely right for the ombudsman, having completed an investigation and made recommendations, or having discontinued an investigation because the provider has  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC495"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC495</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>agreed a satisfactory remedy, to send a copy to the CQC as the regulator, and probably to the local authority. The important thing is for the ombudsman to be able to decide when that communication is necessary, rather than being obliged to send reports to the CQC and local authorities which would be of no interest or value to them.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000165"></a>I am sure the ombudsman will want to develop a protocol with the CQC and with local social services authorities collectively, so that they receive only that information that they consider to be useful and relevant to the discharge of their functions. I should also point out that the ombudsman is empowered in new Section 34P to disclose any information to the CQC if this appears to be of interest to it in its role as a regulator. This information could be in a different form to that in the statement. The provisions in the Bill allow the necessary degree of flexibility for the ombudsman, enabling appropriate rather than compulsory communication.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000166"></a>Amendment 120 relates to new Section 34H. Our intention in subsection (8) is to give the ombudsman discretion over whether it is appropriate for a provider to be identified in the ombudsman&#146;s statement. The statement must not identify the complainant or any other person other than the provider, unless the ombudsman considers it necessary. This amendment would mean that a statement by the ombudsman could not identify the provider if they were an individual; nor could it do so if, in the ombudsman&#146;s opinion, an individual, including, for example, the complainant or another service user, was likely to be identified by publishing the provider&#146;s name. That would be the case whether the provider were an individual or an organisation. By removing the discretion, the position would then be that it would never be appropriate to identify a provider that is an individual, and there would be many cases where a corporate provider could also not be identified. The ombudsman would normally wish to name the provider in the statement, for the very good reason that it is the public statement of the ombudsman&#146;s conclusions on a complaint. The provision is therefore worded in a way that allows that but it recognises that there may be human rights issues in doing so, such as where there are risks to the privacy of the individual provider.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000167"></a>The ombudsman will also want to ensure that an individual service user cannot be identified as a result of naming the provider in the statement. However, even though naming the provider risks identifying the complainant, the complainant may actively wish the provider to be named. The individual service user just may not be concerned about being identified. The point of the provision is that the ombudsman can decide on the merits of the particular case. It would be very difficult to make provision for the precise circumstances where identification is or is not appropriate, which is why we believe the best approach is to allow the ombudsman discretion.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000168"></a>As I mentioned in the context of Amendments 118 and 119, the ombudsman is empowered in new Section 34P to disclose any information to the CQC if this appears to be of interest to it. The information would not be subject to the limitations about identification.  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC496"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column GC496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The ombudsman is well accustomed to using similar discretionary powers in the current local authority scheme in Part 3 of the 1974 Act. I argue that the use of discretion in this way is an important factor in the operation of the scheme. I hope that I have been able to provide sufficient explanation and reassurance so that the noble Earl will now feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

She was right to point out that the words &#147;involves&#148; or &#147;is connected with&#148; are a mirror image or transposition of the wording used in the 2008 Act but, as she also pointed out, the definition in that Act was made narrower by way of examples of what &#147;is connected to&#148; actually means. Here, if it is left entirely open, there is scope for people to argue that someone servicing a motor vehicle is an adult social care provider, which would be very undesirable.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000170"></a>More serious is the reply that she gave on Amendment 117. It is entirely right and understandable that a local commissioner should have the power to decide how proceedings are run and lay down the procedure applicable to a hearing and so on, but that is not the same thing as deciding that a person may not be represented.</p>

<a name="90311-gc0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09031194000171"></a>The wording appears to say that a person may not be represented at all. The noble Baroness&#146;s reply indicated that what is meant here is that the local commissioner could decide that a particular person was an unsuitable representative. If that is intended, I should prefer to see that made clear here. As it is, the wording is very widely drawn and it could be taken to mean that the local commissioner has a very sweeping power. I am not entirely happy with that situation and I wonder whether, between now and the next stage, further thought could be given to that point.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000172"></a><b><a name="90311-gc0008.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09031194000301"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> Perhaps I may seek clarity. My understanding of what the noble Baroness said is that in practice the ombudsman has the power to decide whether a person will have any representation of any kind, not the nature of that representation. That power exists for a very good reason: it is a means of attempting to ensure that a minor matter does not escalate. If an individual arrives with a QC, unsurprisingly the local authority will go on the defensive and the whole thing can spiral. My understanding is that all ombudsmen have that power. When the noble Baroness writes to the noble Earl, perhaps she could cast an eye over this matter and also give examples of how this works in practice, not just in the field of social care. I think that all Members of the Committee would find that helpful.</p>

I certainly take her point but equally one could imagine circumstances in which someone who needed help in presenting a case&#151;and it might be a good case&#151;was prevented from doing so because the ombudsman decided, for whatever reason, that representation was not appropriate. Therefore, one would hope that the rules that the

Nevertheless, I do not propose to detain the Committee further. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="09031194000175"></a>I have tabled a government amendment seeking to correct the same drafting error in a slightly different way.

<h2 align="center"><a name="09031167000102"></a>EU: Audiovisual Media Services Directive</h2>
<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="09031167000003"></a><b><a name="90311-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09031167000096"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communications, Technology and Broadcasting (Lord Carter of Barnes):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Andy Burnham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09031167000004"></a>I am today setting out how the Government intend to proceed with implementation of the European Union Audiovisual Media Services (AVMS) Directive.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="09031167000005"></a>The AVMS Directive amends the Television Without Frontiers Directive and extends its scope to cover video-on-demand services. It enables us to permit product placement&#151;if we choose to do so&#151;in certain types of television programmes, and subject to certain controls and safeguards. It gives the UK responsibility for regulating non-EU satellite channels which are uplinked to satellite from within our territory. It allows television broadcasters to take short extracts from other broadcasters&#146; exclusive coverage of events for the purpose of news reporting. Lastly, it makes changes to the amount and scheduling of advertising allowed in television broadcasting. The directive must be implemented by 19 December 2009.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="09031167000006"></a>The Government consulted last year on implementation proposals for four main areas of the directive: the definition of the services to be regulated; the regulatory arrangements for video-on-demand services; product placement; and the regulation of non-EU satellite channels. I shall address each of these issues in turn.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09031167000007"></a>First, the directive requires us to regulate the content of video-on-demand services&#151;that is, mass media services whose principal purpose is to provide television programming to the public on demand. It calls for this to be done through co-regulatory arrangements in which the video-on-demand industry takes responsibility for ensuring content standards.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="09031167000008"></a>Ofcom will be given powers to regulate UK video-on-demand services so that Ofcom can then designate, and delegate powers to, an industry-led co-regulatory body to regulate programme content in these services.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09031167000009"></a>These arrangements will ensure that UK video-on-demand services maintain, as a minimum, the standards and requirements set out in the directive. All UK providers will need to notify the co-regulator that they are providing a video-on-demand service.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="09031167000010"></a>The directive does not allow us to rely on self-regulation, but it is right that industry should be allowed and encouraged to set up and manage its own regulatory arrangements as far as possible, as it has done very effectively since 2003 through the self-regulatory body, the Association for Television On Demand. In the light of these decisions, the Government urge video-on-demand service providers to work together to finalise the details of the new co-regulatory arrangements.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS86"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column WS86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09031167000011"></a>The directive&#146;s definition of the on-demand services to be regulated will be transposed into UK legislation. The definition is narrow and covers only mass media services whose principal purpose is to provide television-like programming to users. The co-regulator will be able to issue guidance on the interpretation of the definition and on the services which fall within its scope. Those whose role is only to provide access to other providers&#146; video-on-demand services will not be responsible for the content of those services. However, the Government expect that access providers will want to ensure, as far as possible, that all video-on-demand services to which they provide access meet the minimum standards required for UK video-on-demand services.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09031167000012"></a>The Government also expect that Ofcom will designate, and delegate powers to, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to regulate advertising in video-on-demand services. This will maintain the ASA&#146;s role as a one-stop shop for all complaints about advertising. The directive&#146;s definition of the advertising to be regulated will be transposed into UK legislation, and the ASA will be able to issue guidance on the interpretation of the definition and the advertising which falls within its scope. The Government expect that this will cover all advertising in video-on-demand services, both that which is included in programmes and that which accompanies them.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="09031167000013"></a>For both programme content and advertising, Ofcom will retain backstop powers to deal with serious or repeated breaches of the standards and to intervene in the event of systemic failure.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="09031167000014"></a>Secondly, the directive sets out new EU rules on product placement in television and video-on-demand. These require member states to prohibit product placement but allows them to make exceptions to permit it in certain types of programme, if they choose to do so.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="09031167000015"></a>Last year, when we launched the consultation, I indicated an initial preference to maintain the status quo on product placement in television programmes. I said, however, that the Government would listen to both sides of the argument. The Government have received many representations on the matter since then, and we have considered them carefully alongside existing research and evidence.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="09031167000016"></a>Programme makers, commercial broadcasters and advertisers have argued that product placement would give broadcasters a new source of revenue. Responses provided a range of assessments of the value of this revenue. Ofcom&#146;s assessment in December 2005 of the revenue of product placement in the UK market was that most observers thought it might be worth around &#163;25 million to &#163;35 million after five years. Respondents believed that the expected revenue would help maintain investment to ensure quality and diversity of programmes on British television. They also argued that rules ensuring that products are not unduly prominent in programmes would make sure that product placement did not detract from viewers&#146; enjoyment.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="09031167000017"></a>On the other hand, consumer and viewer groups argued that allowing product placement in television programmes would bring about a blurring of the distinction between advertising and editorial content in television programmes which would undermine the trust viewers have in the integrity of UK-made  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS87"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column WS87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>programming. It was also argued that allowing product placement would risk undermining the creative integrity of writers. Others were concerned that product placement could weaken the effectiveness of our restrictions on the promotion to children of foods high in fat, salt or sugar.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="09031167000018"></a>The Government recognise the legitimate points made in these submissions and the strength of feeling on both sides of this issue.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="09031167000019"></a>On balance, and mindful of the need to maintain public trust in television broadcasters and British television&#146;s reputation for high standards, the Government have concluded that no conclusive evidence has been put forward that the economic benefit of introducing product placement is sufficient to outweigh the detrimental impact it would have on the quality and standards of British television and viewers&#146; trust in it.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="09031167000020"></a>Therefore, the Government have decided to maintain the status quo so that product placement will continue to be prohibited in television programmes made by and for UK television broadcasters.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="09031167000021"></a>The Government recognise that these are challenging times for broadcasters and are prepared to look at new evidence as it emerges and to consider first other avenues to assist broadcasters. Through a separate process arising from the AVMS directive, Ofcom is currently reviewing the rules on the quantity and distribution of television advertising. This review will consider the different regimes which currently apply for public service broadcasters (PSBs) and non-PSBs. Ofcom's conclusions will be announced after Easter.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="09031167000022"></a>We will review the position on television product placement in 2011-12, taking into account the conclusions reached by Ofcom<b></b>on the quantity and distribution of television advertising, changes in viewing habits, and any new evidence about the impact and potential benefits of product placement.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09031167000023"></a>Product placement is currently allowed in programmes made by and for UK video-on-demand services. Maintaining the status quo means that this will continue, subject to the limitations and safeguards imposed by the directive and the co-regulator.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="09031167000024"></a>Product placement will also continue to be permitted in films, and in television programmes acquired from outside the UK, subject to the limitations and safeguards imposed by the directive. Prop placement will continue to be permitted in all television and video-on-demand programmes, subject to the requirements of the directive and to guidance from Ofcom and the video-on-demand co-regulatory body.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09031167000025"></a>Finally, the directive requires member states to ensure that non-EU satellite TV channels which are uplinked from their territory and can be received within the Community meet minimum EU standards. A channel is uplinked from a member state if that country hosts the ground station from which the television signal is sent up to the satellite for broadcast.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09031167000026"></a>As a result, non-EU satellite television channels which are uplinked from within the UK and which are not already within the jurisdiction of another member state of the EU or European economic area will be required to have a broadcasting licence issued by Ofcom. This will ensure that Ofcom can take appropriate action against them if they breach the standards set  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS88"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column WS88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>out in the directive. Providers of uplink services will be required to stop uplinking a channel if they are informed by Ofcom that the channel does not have a licence or that it is in breach of the licence conditions, but they will not be required to check that a channel has a licence before agreeing to uplink it, or to monitor broadcasts themselves.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09031167000027"></a>The Government are working closely with Ofcom and with the broadcasting and video-on-demand industries to establish the new regulatory arrangements.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="09031167000028"></a>The Government are considering separately the implementation of the short reports provisions of the directive.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09031167000029"></a>Later this year, the Government will lay before Parliament an order under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972, to implement the new arrangements in UK law.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="09031167000030"></a><b><a name="90311-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09031167000097"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="09031167000031"></a>Organ donation is one of medicine&#146;s great success stories, transforming thousands of people&#146;s lives each year. However, around 8,000 people in the United Kingdom are currently waiting for an organ transplant and each year approximately 1,000 people die or are taken off the national list before a suitable organ becomes available. We want to enable as many UK nationals as possible to have a life-saving or life-enhancing organ transplant. That is why we accepted the Organ Donation Taskforce recommendations last year and why we are investing significantly in the donation infrastructure.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09031167000032"></a>We are aware that some people resident in other countries within the European Union needing transplants are being referred to the UK. This had led to accusations of priority being given to non-UK patients. We want to optimise the availability of organs for transplant for NHS patients and ensure public confidence in the fairness and transparency of the organ allocation system in the UK. We have therefore asked Elisabeth Buggins, the chair of the former Organ Donation Taskforce, to examine policy and practice within the framework of European law on the use of organs from UK deceased donors in respect of the referral, acceptance and transplantation of non-UK EU residents, including the different funding arrangements, and to report her findings to the department by June 2009.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="09031167000043"></a>The planning White Paper <I>Planning for a Sustainable Future</I> published in May 2007 with the accompanying consultation paper <I>Improving the Appeal Process in the Planning System</I>, signalled the Government&#146;s intention to improve the planning appeals service to make it more proportionate, customer-focused and efficient, while maintaining the principles of fairness, openness and impartiality. Measures to achieve this were included in the Planning Act 2008<sup>1</sup> and in regulations which are being laid before Parliament<sup>2</sup> today. This Statement sets out the Government&#146;s policies on how the new regime should operate.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="09031167000044"></a>Section 196 of the Planning Act 2008 amended the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to give the Secretary of State the power to determine the procedure  


<notus-date day="11" month="3" year="2009" textMonth="Mar"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS90"></a><b>11 Mar 2009 : Column WS90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by which appeals will be dealt with; on the basis of representations in writing, at a hearing or at a local inquiry. This power will commence in relation to planning and enforcement appeals on 6 April 2009. The principal parties to an appeal, being the appellant and the local planning authority, will have the opportunity to put forward their views on their preferred procedure. Final decisions will take account of any representations from these parties and will have reference to published criteria, which are approved by the Secretary of State and will be kept under review. The criteria are published on the Planning Inspectorate&#146;s website. Appeals on householder applications that are deemed suitable for written representations will normally proceed through an expedited procedure, designed to give a decision within eight weeks. The aim in all cases is to use the most appropriate procedure consistent with the complexity of the case without any loss of quality in the decision-making process.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09031167000045"></a>The Government have asked the Advisory Panel on Standards (APOS) to continue to review the performance of the Planning Inspectorate. It will monitor the operation of the new regime and, in particular, will investigate any case of complaint about the application of criteria to the choice of appeal method. The Secretary of State will take account of advice from APOS when conducting an annual review of these criteria.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09031167000046"></a>The Secretary of State&#146;s ability to deliver timely and high-quality decisions on planning and enforcement appeals will rely on all parties observing good practice. In anticipation of the possibility of appeal, local planning authorities should ensure that their reasons for a decision are clear, precise and comprehensive, especially when the decision taken by elected members differs from that recommended by their officers. When refusing an application, local planning authorities should consider carefully whether they have a sufficiently strong case, capable of being argued at appeal, on the basis of the material before them.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="09031167000047"></a>Appellants should also ensure that their grounds of appeal are clear, precise and comprehensive and relate to the scheme as refused at application stage, without substantial changes which could lead to any party being prejudiced. Applicants should not normally proceed to appeal unless all efforts to negotiate a solution with the local planning authority, including through amending their proposals, have been exhausted. They should be confident at the time of appeal that they have a clear case and do not need to commission further evidence.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="09031167000048"></a>Once an appeal is accepted and validated by the Planning Inspectorate, it is crucial that all parties adhere to the statutory deadlines at each stage. Parties should also maintain a regular and continuing dialogue to ensure that the issues can be clearly established between them, with no last-minute surprises arising.</p>

<a name="90311-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="09031167000049"></a>Following consultation, the costs awards circular, <I>Costs awards in appeals and other planning proceedings</I><I>,</I> will shortly be reissued and will be available on the Communities and Local Government website. It is important that all parties use the costs regime properly to regulate the system and to ensure that all who use it do not act unreasonably and lead others to incur unnecessary expense. <b></b>The Secretary of State will be able to award costs in all cases when requested to do so

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="09031167000059"></a>Departmental statisticians have completed an evaluation of the data from six trials in local authorities and one by Jobcentre Plus. The pilots included reviews of existing housing benefit claims in local authorities, or consortia of local authorities, and new claims to income support and jobseeker&#146;s allowance in Jobcentre Plus. One additional local authority trial returned too few calls for analysis.</p>

Under the scheme, the Treasury will provide participating institutions protection against credit losses. The scheme is aimed at targeting assets with the greatest amount of uncertainty about their future performance. Participating banks also agree a lending commitment addressing lending to businesses and homeowners. As the Chancellor announced details of the scheme on 26 February it is too early to measure its effect.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a><a name="09031182000029"></a>All workers are protected by the Working Time Regulations which cover working hours and statutory holiday pay. The regulations ensure that all workers can only work a maximum of 48 hours per week on average unless they sign a voluntary opt-out agreement. The regulations also provide all workers with 4.8 weeks of statutory paid annual leave per year rising to 5.6 weeks in April 2009.

New automatic penalties of up to &#163;5,000 for employers found not to be complying with the NMW were brought in under the Employment Act 2008. HM Revenue and Customs are responsible for enforcing the national minimum wage. In 2007-08, they helped to restore &#163;3.9 million in arrears to over 19,000 workers.</p>

Migrant and agency workers can build up entitlement to the state pension in the same way as other workers. Migrant workers also have the same rights as other workers when it comes to access to private pension schemes arranged by the employer. This includes stakeholder pensions where the employer has a statutory duty to designate at least one scheme for which membership is on offer to all employees (including migrant workers) who have been employed for a continuous period of three months. Whether or not these rights apply to agency workers would depend upon whether they are treated as employees for the purpose of the stakeholder pension scheme regulations.</p>

<ul><a name="09031182000157"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_15"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government what is the cost of insuring against the United Kingdom defaulting on its government debt compared with the cost in France or Germany. [HL1828]</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_31"></a>
<a name="09031182000036"></a><b><a name="90311w0001.htm_spmin10"></a><a name="09031182000215"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> There are no precise indicators of the cost of insuring government debt against default.</p>

<a name="90311w0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_18"></a><a name="09031182000037"></a>Credit default swap (CDS) spreads are commonly used as a proxy for measuring this cost. However, the strength of this proxy is highly questionable, as default is only one of a number of credit events enshrined in sovereign CDS contracts. Other credit events include missing coupon payments and restructuring of debt.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90311w0002.htm"/>


<a name="90311w0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_19"></a><a name="09031182000038"></a>There are also a number of other factors besides market expectations of sovereign default risk that can affect CDS spreads. The market for developed country sovereign CDS is relatively small and illiquid, as it is unlikely that a developed country will default on its sovereign debt. The illiquid nature of the market can lead to large movements in CDS spreads, simply for technical reasons. In addition, there is evidence that developed sovereign CDS contracts are used to hedge a number of other risks, aside from the risk of sovereign default.</p>

<a name="90311w0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_20"></a><a name="09031182000039"></a>The five-year UK sovereign credit default swap spread was quoted at 147 basis points as of Friday 27 February 2009, according to data provided by Bloomberg. This compares to 89 and 86 basis points for France and Germany respectively. This implies that it would cost $14,700 to buy protection for $1,000,000-worth of gilts. It should be noted that we have no evidence that any trades have taken place at these indicative prices.</p>

Poor continuity of care and follow-up are compounded by the reluctance of general practitioners to register them, and by a lack of medical records. Gypsies and Travellers have a higher incidence of long-term conditions, including mental health and respiratory problems, than the general population.</p>
