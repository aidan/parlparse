<ul><a name="0712036000297"></a>
<p><a name="qnpa_0"></a>What recent discussions they have had with the Governor of the Bank of England regarding the global credit crunch.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="st_0"></a>
<a name="0712036000026"></a><b><a name="71203-0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0712036000302"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, the Chancellor regularly meets the governor to discuss a range of issues, as was the case with previous Administrations. It is not the Government&#146;s practice to provide details of all such meetings.</p>

<p><a name="st_1"></a>
<a name="0712036000027"></a><b><a name="71203-0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="0712036000303"></a>Lord Barnett:</b> My Lords, I note my noble friend&#146;s Answer. The crunch itself is primarily the responsibility of the banks. That is a considerable responsibility, but the seriousness of the problem should not be exaggerated. Most banks, if not all, could well lose the odd billion or two and still make large profits. On the other hand, my noble friend, in a recent letter to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, made one or two important points that I assume came from the Treasury. The letter is worth quoting, as it relates to how and why Northern Rock was helped. Support,</p>
<ul><a name="0712036000275"></a>&#147;should only be undertaken when there is a genuine threat to the stability of the financial system and in order to avoid a serious disturbance in the wider economy&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000241"></a>Would that not apply to every bank?</p>

<p><a name="st_2"></a>
<a name="0712036000028"></a><b><a name="71203-0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="0712036000304"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, the reason why action was taken on Northern Rock was that it was clear that it was becoming a potential casualty of the lack of liquidity and it was becoming stretched in certain areas. None of that alters the fact that Northern Rock&#146;s basic mortgage book is a considerable asset value, against which the loan from the Bank of England is secured. My noble friend will recognise that it was important, with a bank in that degree of difficulty, that support was given in the interests of financial stability. He is right, however: the vast majority of banks are clearly facing some shocks due to the problems of international liquidity, but of course most banks are entirely sound.</p>

Do they also recognise that one of the consequences, in a housing market where prices are falling, of taking house prices out of the retail prices index will be that the Bank of England will be forced to set higher interest rates than would otherwise be necessary and therefore to put more pressure on mortgage payers?</p>

He will appreciate that if interest rates rise, there is increased pressure on mortgage payers, but it will also be appreciated in the House that large numbers of people have seen significant increases in their house values in recent years, we have full employment in this country and people are able to maintain their debts adequately. Within that framework we can look forward, with some degree of equanimity, to a period that we all recognise will be more difficult than in the recent past.</p>

Since we are not allowed to know what the governor and the Chancellor talk about&#151;the fact that Arsenal beat Aston Villa might have been central to their discussions today&#151;will the Minister ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether he would intervene with the governor to clarify the lender-of-last-resort function, and to distinguish between properly behaved deposit-taking institutions and the chancers who ran Northern Rock? As I understand it, the lender-of-last-resort function exists to assist those deposit-taking institutions that behave properly, but is not meant to underwrite the risks of those that do not.</p>

<a name="0712036000032"></a><b><a name="71203-0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="0712036000308"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My Lords, the latter is true. That is exactly the criterion that is to be adopted. However, my noble friend will appreciate that Northern Rock was an established bank and mortgage-holder, with a very considerable mortgage book. It ran into difficulties because of injudicious borrowing&#151;there is no doubt about that; that is why the price is being paid in terms of the significant collapse in its share price&#151;but it made sense, with reference to the British economy and the British people, for the Bank of England to take appropriate action to ensure that we controlled the overall position. It will be recognised that confidence can be lost in the banking system. It was important that it should be reinforced. The House, I think, will recognise the success of the governor&#146;s action and the tripartite arrangement.</p>

With that in mind, will he ask the Chancellor to ask the current management of Northern Rock why it is still offering on its website today a so-called &#147;together&#148; mortgage at 125 per cent of the current value of housing? Is that not reckless lending being pursued on the back of a government guarantee?</p>

Lessons are being learnt by the financial institutions at this time of crisis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="0712036000035"></a>As for Northern Rock&#146;s general operations, the noble Lord is straining at the gnat rather than dealing with the elephant. The gnat is the strategy that Northern Rock is presently pursuing on certain lending; the elephant that we need to deal with is how Northern Rock is set up as a viable institution for the future. That depends on the bids that are coming in. The Government and the British taxpayer have a real stake in the success of that operation.</p>

Does he agree that if the Rock were to be sold off piecemeal, it would cause incalculable damage to the north-east?</p>

It is important that Northern Rock is stabilised, which is why the Government and the Bank of England are registering support for Northern Rock to ensure that it gets back on to a stable basis with exactly the significant advantages that the right reverend Prelate identified. But he will appreciate, too, that even bigger issues were at stake; namely, the stability of the financial system and confidence in the banks. That is why it was necessary for the Bank of England to act as it did, while at the same time guaranteeing as far as possible the security of public moneys in Northern Rock.</p>

A number of significant provisions were brought into force in February, April and November this year; further provisions will be brought into force early next year. The Office of the Third Sector has published an implementation plan for the Act, which was updated in November.</p>

Is he aware that the Scottish Parliament&#151;charity law being a devolved matter&#151;is passing regulations without reference to or co-ordination with the Charity Commission for England and Wales in London, so national charities have to face a two-tier system of regulation and incur considerable professional fees doing this? Is that really a good use of charitable resources? If the Minister agrees, as I hope that he will, that it is not a good use, what are the Government going to do to prevent this getting worse and put right the situation that exists already? What steps are they going to take to avoid a similar situation arising when Northern Ireland gets its own charities Act, as is anticipated for next year?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="0712036000042"></a>I cannot accept for a moment that we have been slow in bringing this Act into force. The first provisions came in in February, raising the financial thresholds for registration and audit of charities, giving charity trustees new powers to help in the governance and administration of their charities, and modernising the constitution and powers of the commission. Other activities have taken place all through this year and will continue into next year. There has been no slowness at all. If there is a particular problem in what the noble Lord has raised, I shall go back to the department and ensure that he has a fuller answer.</p>

As the House knows, the definition of charity includes the removal of the presumption of public benefit for charities,</p>
<ul><a name="0712036000276"></a>&#147;for the advancement of religion, education and the relief of poverty&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000242"></a>That definition will be commenced next spring, following the publication of the commission&#146;s guidance on  public benefit next year and the establishment in February of the charity tribunal to hear appeals against the commission&#146;s legal decisions. There will of course be discussions with all interested parties once that happens.</p>

The work that the charities do is beyond compare. It is a marvellous part of our British system. The 2006 Act, passed without political recrimination in this House or the other place, will do a great deal to make the lives of charities better.

The Independent Schools Council says that indirect benefit through the relief of public funds is not enough on its own. We as a Government do not think that it is enough and nor does the Charities Commission. Each independent school will have to decide how best it can meet the public benefit requirement in its own circumstances. Some may choose to do so through supporting the academies programme, but there are many other ways in which independent schools can demonstrate their public benefit including, for example, bursaries or outreach schemes.</p>

The concept is therefore that it should be a full Olympic stadium holding 80,000 people for the Olympic Games, and that instead of then becoming a white elephant or sepulchre to sport as has happened in so many cities which have hosted the Olympic Games, it will be a working athletics stadium after the conclusion of the Games.</p>

One normally expects about 25,000 people at athletics events, but at the Olympic Games the attendance is more than double that. The stadium will cater more than adequately for the four weeks of the Olympic Games, and the commitment to the legacy&#151;that the stadium should be of value to the people of London and the United Kingdom after the Olympic Games&#151;is a very important built-in consideration.</p>

We all congratulate Glasgow, to take an obvious point, on landing the Commonwealth Games two years after the Olympic Games. Perhaps seating which is surplus after the Olympic Games have been held in London can be transferred to Glasgow. That strategy must be worked through. After the Games are over the stadium will be stripped down to the size which I indicated, but during the Games the stadium will look as magnificent as any other international arena.</p>

That will also facilitate the training of the staff and enable detection of the strengths and potential weaknesses of the stadium arrangements. So we intend to have trial runs, but I do not think that it is anticipated that any of those events will take place much more than a year before the Olympics.</p>

Should we not be ready for Mugabe to repeat his favourite accusation at the conference&#151;that the ruin of Zimbabwe&#146;s economy is due to sanctions suggested by this country and put in force by the European Union? As we all know, the reality is that the main measure&#151;which is not a sanction but a targeted measure&#151;is travel restrictions on some of Mugabe&#146;s cronies. It is regrettable that that allegation and others seem to have been swallowed by the leaders of SADC, who are inclined to rise and cheer Mugabe whenever he speaks at an international conference. Have not Her Majesty&#146;s Government been outspun by Mugabe? Should we not be putting more skill and effort into getting the truth across, especially to the leaders of the SADC countries? I expect that we should be aware of another Mugabe ploy at the conference.</p>

Like him, I can think of no one better to be at the conference than my noble friend Lady Amos. In respect of the travel ban, noble Lords will know that part of the common position allows Mugabe and his cronies to attend these meetings should they seek the permission of people from the European Union. It is extremely important that we convey our views to the SADC countries and to all countries in the African Union and the European Union to explain why we feel so strongly. We take every opportunity to do so, and we did so in the margins of the CHOGM meeting.</p>

It is not like the Commonwealth; it may have to get there. Is it not vital that we press ahead with the important agreements between the African Union and the European Union, on which the House of Lords recently received a report? Unless we can build up the competence and confidence of African countries in the African Union, which is what this summit is all about, we will not improve governance standards, of which Zimbabwe and many other African countries are not good examples.</p>

That is why, notwithstanding the fact that the Prime Minister and Ministers will not be at this conference, we have been very firmly behind the conference, and we have done everything that we can to ensure the success of the summit so that the agreements can be made and can be followed up appropriately.</p>

It follows similar statements by President Museveni of Uganda and President Yar&#146;Adua of Nigeria, perhaps indicating a change of attitude to the Zimbabwe crisis by African leaders. In view of the fact that there is now very little prospect, if any, of reaching an agreement between the Government and opposition in Zimbabwe on the conditions under which an election could be held in March, is there any prospect of SADC handing back its mandate to the African Union so that firmer action can be taken to ensure a level playing field when the time comes?</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="0712036000261"></a> Clause 1, page 2, line 5, leave out from second &#147;eggs&#148; to &#147;but&#148; in line 6</p>
</ul>
<a name="71203-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0712036000093"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 2, 10, 11, 13 to 15, 17, 18 and 52. The purpose of these amendments relates to the Bill&#146;s extension of the definition of &#147;gametes&#148; under the 1990 Act to include germ-line cells at any stage of maturity. It is not clear to me why this is necessary or desirable. The extended definition is out of line with the ordinary scientific meaning of the term. Biologically, a diploid germ cell, with a full complement of 46 chromosomes, needs to undergo DNA replication before the DNA divides to become a haploid gamete, with 23 chromosomes. Gametes are germ lines that have at least initiated meiosis&#151;the process of halving the number of chromosomes to create a haploid cell. Therefore, the definition under the Bill extends &#147;gametes&#148; to cover germ lines in the early stage of development which have not reached the stage of becoming gametes. This creates considerable confusion, but with no obvious rationale for treating early-stage germ-line cells in the same way as gametes. Extending the definition of gametes brings immature germ cells under the remit of the Bill and presumably out of the Human Tissue Act. Why is that required?</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0712036000094"></a>The first two amendments would remove the extension to early germ cells from the definition of gametes, reverting to the terminology used in the current Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act and Human Tissue Act. That is in keeping with the scientific understanding of the term and keeps those two Acts in line in this respect.</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0712036000095"></a>The next seven amendments are consequential, ensuring consistency of approach in the definitions of, and division between, gametes and other cellular tissue. The changes to the definition of gametes and the consequential amendments to the interpretation of cells in new Section 4A(6) will affect the interpretation of the definition of interspecies embryo in new Section 4A(5); for example, some creations such as cytoplasmic hybrids, created by replacing the nucleus of an animal egg with the nucleus of a human germ cell, will now be covered under paragraph (b) of the definition rather than paragraph (a). However, I do not believe that the changes will alter the scope; rather, in my view they will enable a more natural reading of that definition. That covers Amendments Nos. 10, 11, 13 to 15, 17 and 18.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1496"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1496</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71203-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0712036000096"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 5, which is also in my name. The background to this amendment is that eggs are naturally formed in the ovary and sperm in the testes. Developments in stem cell biology indicate that it is possible to make sperm from embryonic or other stem cells. These are being called artificial gametes, and early studies in mice confirm the reproductive potential of these cells. They are thus seen as a potential cure for some forms of infertility; for example, in cases where the testes no longer function as a result of cancer treatment or where sperm production is defective. Although it may be several years before the use of artificial gametes in clinical trials can be initiated, it is most likely that this will happen within the next five to 10 years. The Bill must take account of this likely development, and I am told that the UK is now leading the international field in this respect.</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0712036000097"></a>The 1990 Act makes no mention of artificial gametes but, in the 2005 consultation on the review of the Act, the Government state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="0712036000262"></a>&#147;The Government believes that the potential use of artificial gametes raises safety issues and that some uses may also raise ethical concerns. Therefore the Government proposes that the use of artificial gametes in assisted reproduction treatment should not be permitted but that the HFE Act should contain a regulation-making power giving Parliament more flexibility to allow the use of artificial gametes in future should it wish to do so&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000243"></a>However, in the White Paper, the Government proposed a ban on the use of artificial gametes&#151;a view which they stated was well supported by the responses received to their consultation. As it stands, the Bill prohibits the use or treatment of gametes other than those that originate from the ovary or testes.</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0712036000098"></a>The Government also considered introducing a regulation-making power to permit the future use of gametes. The White Paper stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="0712036000263"></a>&#147;The Government has decided, on balance, not to recommend such a power, proposing instead that this would be a matter requiring primary legislation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000244"></a>The problem is that the Bill does not permit the use of gametes which do not originate from testes or ovaries for the purpose of creating a permitted embryo under a treatment licence from the HFEA. Furthermore, there is no regulation-making power in the Bill to enable such treatment to be permitted in the future as there is, for example, for the use of mitochondrial transplant embryos, which we shall discuss later under the amendment of my noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant. Several leading researchers are already working in this area in the United Kingdom. In fact, the United Kingdom has managed to recruit scientists from overseas because of our legislative support. If we do not allow that to continue, research in this area will stop.</p>
<a name="time_5"></a>
<a name="71203-0002.htm_time3"></a><h5><a name="0712036000291"></a>3.15 pm</h5>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0712036000099"></a>The following consequences will flow from the current position under the Bill. UK researchers are pursuing research projects to develop treatments for infertility which will become illegal in primary legislation and require further primary legislation to permit them in the future. That could have inevitable consequences such as difficulty in obtaining funding  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1497"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1497</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for such research and consequences for the future of clinical trials and for infertile patients who wish to have their own children.</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0712036000100"></a>It must also be remembered that artificial gametes could be derived from bone marrow stem cells, other adult stem cells or adult cells in which pluripotency has been induced. Therefore, it does not refer only to embryonic stem cells. That makes the potential use in therapy even less controversial, especially in the case of derivation from adult stem cells where no genes are inserted to reprogram the nucleus.</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0712036000101"></a>If such treatment were not banned&#151;and this is important&#151;several safeguards remain. First, the use of such gametes for fertility treatment would require a licence. Secondly, the HFEA has powers to ensure that the procedure used for the creation and use of embryos for fertility treatment takes account of the welfare of any child that may result. The Bill thus requires that safety issues are the priority consideration of any treatment licence application that would use artificial gametes for fertility purposes. If regulation-making powers were included in the Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Walton, suggests, additional oversight by Parliament would be available.</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0712036000102"></a>I do not suggest that a therapeutic application of this technology is imminent, but it is likely to emerge at some point in the foreseeable future. A clinical trial may be proposed and Parliament needs to be in a position to permit the HFEA to licence at that point&#151;hence my amendments. These amendments, on which the noble Lord, Lord Winston, may wish to comment, are supported by those who work in the clinical infertility area, such as the British Fertility Society and the British Medical Association.</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0712036000103"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 51 and 53. The Bill as introduced uses the term &#147;human cell&#148; throughout Schedule 3 but does not fully clarify its meaning in that context. This creates ambiguity as to its scope, and as to the meaning of the phrases in which it is used in the schedule, including &#147;a person&#146;s human cells&#148; and &#147;a person providing human cells&#148;. It is unclear to me whether the term refers to cells from an individual, in line with the approach taken in the Human Tissue Act 2004, or to cells artificially created in vitro; that is, cell lines. By extension, it is unclear whether references to &#147;a person&#146;s human cells&#148; are to cells from the body of a person or cells, such as cell lines, that may be personal property and are owned by the person who generated them in vitro.</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0712036000104"></a>In my view, clarification of that definition is pivotal to the consent provision in Schedule 3. Cell lines created in vitro are currently outside the scope of the 1990 Act. They are also outside the scope of the Human Tissue Act 2004. This approach is entirely logical and sensible. If the consent requirements of the 1990 Act were extended by the Bill to cell lines, vast stores of valuable cell lines currently held in public, charitable and commercial collections of cell lines would become unusable for the purposes set out in Schedule 3, contrary to the interests of patients and public. The approach adopted to cell lines to date has significant support and we see no reason to change it. I presume that that is not the Government&#146;s intention.

<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0712036000105"></a>The amendment would make it clear that a &#147;human cell&#148; in Schedule 3 is a cell from the body of a person and that references to a person in the phrase &#147;a person&#146;s human cells&#148; are to the person from whose body the cell has come. The amendment also makes it clear that the requirements of Schedule 3 do not apply to cell lines generated in vitro from human cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0712036000106"></a>Briefly, on the other amendments in this group, I support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Walton and Amendment No. 5, which would clearly define a permitted egg, sperm and embryo. I shall reserve my comments on Amendment No. 2A, tabled by my noble friend Lord Alton. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="0712036000107"></a><b><a name="71203-0002.htm_spnew16"></a><a name="0712036000359"></a>Lord Elton:</b> Somewhat surprisingly, it may be appropriate to speak now to Amendment No. 2A, which has been tabled in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and myself. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, has lucidly illustrated to your Lordships the intimate relationship between the use of language and the activities of researchers; that is what the Bill is concerned with.</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0712036000108"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, has three sub-groups within this group. In the first he refers to a series of provisions that, possibly unintentionally, affect the research procedures that may be embarked on, and in the second he refers to developments that can be expected to take place in five to 10 years, a period in which the Bill is expected to continue, as an Act of Parliament, to provide for the contingency of those developments. It must be clear to all of us that, in the next 10 years, many unforeseen developments will arrive in this fast-moving field of research. It is undoubtedly with that in mind that the Bill&#146;s drafters included new Clause 1(5) to give the Secretary of State the power to intervene to change the meanings of terms which are already understood to be defined in the Bill as your Lordships have it. That is in fact a power to change, possibly dramatically, the effect of the Act of Parliament that we have in mind should be put on the statute book.</p>

<a name="71203-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0712036000109"></a>It is appropriate to raise that point now in order to ask Members of the Committee to have at the back of their minds throughout the discussion of this group, and every time a question of a definition or change of definition arises, the question whether that definition or change would fall under the provisions of Clause 1(5). If it would, one would have to think carefully whether some politician&#151;not necessarily a member of a Government, let alone this one&#151;shall be given the power to decide what shall be the effect in the years to come of what your Lordships are doing today and in the next three Committee sittings. I would submit that that is a power that we should not surrender. The reason that the Bill has attracted so much public interest and filled your Lordships&#146; in-trays with petitions is that it closely affects the emotions as well as the genes not only of ourselves but of future generations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0712036000110"></a>If your Lordships prove sympathetic to this idea, it may well be that we should come forward on Report with an alternative means of providing for changes in the interpretation of parts of the Bill. I do not think

I ask noble Lords to bear that in mind in the next hour and a half.</p>

<a name="0712036000111"></a><b><a name="71203-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="0712036000360"></a>Lord Winston:</b> I rise briefly to support the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel. I declare an interest as an employee of Imperial College London, working in the Institute of Developmental and Reproductive Biology and as a director of a spin-out company which is involved in the modification of gamete cells.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0712036000112"></a>I draw your Lordships&#146; attention to the prevalence of the kind of infertility that the noble Lord, Lord Patel, is addressing. It is now extremely common to see young women who cannot produce egg cells for one reason or another. Indeed, I think I have seen it written somewhere that it is now the fifth most common cause of anovulatory infertility&#151;which is rising in a population that is tending to gain skills, get better education and leave childbearing a little later. By the age of 40 a very large number of women have run out of eggs in their ovary and cannot conceive naturally, although they would be in a perfect position to have children were an egg to be available. As we know, the donation of eggs, which is dealt with elsewhere in the Bill, is a very fraught subject and not acceptable to all infertile couples. People would quite reasonably prefer to have their own genetic material, as I mentioned at Second Reading.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0712036000113"></a>In the case of the male, testicular failure&#151;the failure of germ cells to mature to produce sperm&#151;is extremely common. It can occur as a result of many factors, some of which are unknown. A few factors are genetic, and some are due to injury. As we get better at treating diseases such as Hodgkin&#146;s disease and cancer, we are also increasingly finding men with maturation arrest; that is, when the testicle is no longer producing sperm. These issues are extremely common and cause great distress to patients. They are important clinical issues. At present the only alternative available to these people is a donated gamete, a solution which all noble Lords agree is not ideal. Although we accept it within the legislation, it is, broadly speaking, much better if people can have their own genetic child.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0712036000114"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said, there is growing evidence of a research ability to produce gametes that are likely to be entirely viable in mice and other mammals, and it is very likely that this technology could be applied also to humans. Indeed, there have been suggestions that we can now develop viable animal embryos from gametes that have been matured from germ cells in viva. It would seem extremely cruel, in a Bill designed to help infertile couples, if that technology were prevented and that research was not allowed to continue in humans in Britain. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, is right to suggest that there are many issues in the clinical use of such matured gametes. We need to do a huge amount of investigation to make certain that the chromosomes, the genes, the development and the cell biology of these cells are normal before such an embryo is put back into the uterus. There are very few countries where this kind of research is possible,  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1500"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1500</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and it would be shocking if, in the process of passing the Bill, it was unwittingly prevented in a country that is most able to do it. It is essential that this research continues.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0712036000115"></a>There is another issue. There are situations where we use primary germ cells and other cells without the intention of doing in vitro fertilization or any infertility treatment. In my own laboratory we are trying to modify the male stem cells of pigs. We are doing it so that we will eventually, we hope, be able to transplant pig organs into the human safely without the pigs&#146; cell-surface proteins being recognised by the human system. As Members of the Committee will appreciate, a large number of people need heart transplants or other organ transplantation. This technology, which is the focus of the spin-out company to which I referred, is one example of where we could prevent such recognition.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0712036000116"></a>If we can develop this technology in the pig, important issues surrounding use of the same kind of technology in humans will arise&#151;not to modify humans but to understand the science of germ-cell development, so that in future we might be able, for example, to treat male infertility much better by encouraging primary germ cells to go through better maturation to arrive at gametes. The problem with the Government&#146;s proposed legislation is that research into human tissue would be difficult and would need a licence. I do not think that a licence should be required because there is no intention to produce a pregnancy, simply an intention to understand the cell biology. Any use of these gametes would thereafter of course be subject to law&#151;as they should be&#151;under the Government&#146;s proposals.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0712036000117"></a>There is a risk of unwitting restriction which could prevent and inhibit research that is quite properly required and is not threatening. I do not believe that any member of the public, even those with fairly strong religious convictions, would see this as a problem. The issue is not much more than one affecting the use of human tissue. I therefore hope that the Government will look favourably on the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel.</p>

The future makes it possible to create eggs or sperm from stem cells. These are known as in vitro-derived or artificial gametes. I prefer to use the term &#147;gametes&#148;. Those cells, artificial sperm or artificial eggs, derived from stem cells may make it possible for individuals not able to produce mature eggs or sperm to have a child. That is a prospect for the future which should be supported. For that reason I strongly support the amendment.</p>

Nevertheless, issues have been raised in some of noble Lords&#146; remarks, and indeed in the remarks on mitochondria, which no doubt we will come to later when my noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant speaks to his Amendment No. 4 in the group.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0712036000120"></a>We are being asked to do different things. The amendment of my noble friend Lord Walton asks us to remove all regulation and to allow what he would like to do to proceed in a wholly unregulated way. On the other hand, my noble friend Lord Patel suggests a form of regulation. I suggest in my Amendment  No. 2A that we should reserve to Parliament the right to decide on these complex and sometimes controversial issues.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0712036000121"></a>The amendments in the group deal not only with the questions already alluded to but with reproductive cloning, mitochondrial DNA, and immature human and animal gametes, expanding their use into interspecies embryos. That is a phenomenally wide group of issues to consider in one group of amendments. It is also a phenomenally complex group of issues for any lay person to deal with.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0712036000122"></a>We are having a rather back-to-front debate very late in our proceedings. Probably tomorrow or perhaps next week, we come to Amendments Nos. 66 and 67, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, which urge on us the creation of a national bioethics committee that is outside Parliament and capable of giving informed opinion to Members of both Houses before decisions such as this are taken. In many ways, I wish we could have had that debate at the head of our consideration of the Bill in Committee.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0712036000123"></a>My noble friend Lord Walton seeks in Amendment No. 4 to remove the need for regulation. The practical effect would be to allow licence holders to modify an egg or embryo for mitochondrial reasons without further regulatory requirement. If that were to permit reproductive cloning to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disease without having to go through the affirmative procedure, we would have entered a brave new world without so much as a parliamentary grunt. Many of us who admire scientists and science nevertheless believe that Parliament has a right and a duty to insist that good science and good ethics march hand in hand. I doubt that I am alone in wearying of the political mantra, &#147;We will follow the science&#148;. Parliament&#146;s job is surely to inform itself; arrive at wise and just judgments; and to lead, not to follow. We should be deeply suspicious of any attempt to remove regulation and simply place that power in the hands of the Secretary of State, however esteemed they may be.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0712036000124"></a>To sleep-walk into provisions that might have irreversible effects, and to do so in the absence of a legislative, ethical and regulatory framework, would be a dereliction of our duty. So, too, would the failure to close a route to reproductive cloning. As we are seduced and subverted by the dazzle of these various proposals, I am reminded of CS Lewis&#146;s prophetic polemic, <I>The Abolition of Man</I>, published in 1943, and of his futuristic work, <I>That Hideous Strength, </I>published in 1945. He foresaw what he described as

Even before Lewis and Huxley, in 1896, HG Wells published <I>The Island of Dr Moreau</I>.  Dr Moreau, who specialised in creating animal-human hybrids, says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="0712036000264"></a>&#147;I went on with this research just the way it led me ... I have never troubled about the ethics of the matter&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="0712036000245"></a>He was not subject to regulation.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0712036000125"></a>Instructively, Lord Feverstone, the creator of the National Institute for Coordinated Experiments in <I>That Hideous Strength</I> and a fictional Member of your Lordships&#146; House, says that his aim is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="0712036000265"></a>&#147;Quite simple and obvious things, at first&#151;sterilization of the unfit, liquidation of backward races ... selective breeding&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0712036000126"></a>All this was futuristic, speculative writing, but it is fast becoming reality because of the extremely permissive flexibility of provisions in Bills such as this. It is clear that the desire of the scientific lobby, to which my noble friend Lord Patel referred earlier, and evidenced in arguments for deregulation, is that the Bill embrace all future technological developments without wasting time coming back to Parliament for approval. Even when specific restrictions are stated in the Bill, they are usually accompanied by provisions to permit further change, with a minimum of scrutiny or accountability. I hope that when the Minister replies, he will reiterate that the provision of the conscience clause in the 1990 Act will continue to apply, thus protecting those scientists who do not wish to be corralled into work that in other European jurisdictions would carry a prison sentence.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0712036000127"></a>It may be very unfashionable to say this, but there are tens of thousands of desperately unhappy children who are orphans and who would desperately love to be in a loving home. Adoption has gone out of favour, and I noticed in a reply to a Parliamentary Question which I tabled recently that, in the whole of last year, only 165 babies were available in this country for adoption. Of course couples who wish to prevent the transmission of disease to their children should, as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, has said, be given every support possible if they want to adopt an orphaned child, instead of going to extraordinary lengths and using cell nuclear replacement procedures to create children who may turn out to have some other unexpected disorder resulting from the very artificial procedure used to create the embryo.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0712036000128"></a>Adoption would also be better than creating three genetic parents. At Second Reading my noble friend Lord Walton said that to be able to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disease:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="0712036000267"></a>&#147;One can take a donor ovum from which you have removed the nucleus and put the nucleus into that donor ovum, which has normal mitochondria in the cytoplasm, and then allow that to be fertilised by the partner&#146;s sperm, thus allowing these women to have normal children&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/11/07; col. 709.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000247"></a>This means that you can carry out a technique to insert the nucleus of an egg from the woman with mitochondrial disease into the egg of an egg donor

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0712036000129"></a>I ask the Minister, if we simply insert an adult somatic cell from the woman with unhealthy mitochondria into the enucleated egg instead of inserting the nucleus from her egg, would that not be reproductive cloning after activation instead of IVF? What precisely in the Bill would prevent this, as permitted eggs and embryos are allowed to have alterations in their mitochondrial and nuclear genes if it is for the treatment of mitochondrial disease, and do not have to have been created by fertilisation as new Section 3ZA(5) can override the prohibitions in new Section 3ZA(2) and (4) which would otherwise have prohibited implanting embryos created by altering DNA and embryos that had not been created by fertilisation?</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0712036000130"></a>Paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 2 on page 54 also specifies that licences can be given where the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of embryos to be implanted has been altered for the purpose of mitochondrial disease. These eggs and embryos are also specifically permitted to have material from two women according to new Section 35A on page 30. All this would seem again to permit reproductive cloning as one of several possible ways to prevent transmission of mitochondrial disease.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0712036000131"></a>With the Bill as it stands in new Section 3ZA(5), both this and the procedure suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, would be subject only to affirmative resolution. However, if the noble Lord&#146;s Amendment No. 4 is approved, then neither procedure would be required to go through Parliament for affirmation. This means that reproductive cloning would be legal as one method to prevent transmission of mitochondrial disease without ever having come back to Parliament. We must not allow this law of unintended consequences to happen.</p>

I feel the groupings are far too wide. For example, in the first grouping, it may appear as though the amendments have a great deal in common but, in reality, there are basic differences which lead to various different outcomes. Unless it is properly understood, we are in danger of passing the Bill  to the House of Commons without proper scrutiny of the possible&#151;or, indeed, probable&#151;unintended consequences to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has referred. After all, the danger of any new legislation is unintended consequences, and we have had a long history of looking at this over the years.</p>

When we hear people stating that the great public out there have no problem with the issues, of course they have no problem because they do not

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0712036000134"></a>We are now determined that we are going to be so leading edge in this area, where there is no guarantee of therapeutic success. In case noble Lords are not aware of the issues that were raised at Second Reading&#151;I have not read them&#151;I repeat that over a period of some 17 years there have been attempts to undertake this type of research and, during that period, there have been no positive results, whereas we have more than 70 proven therapeutic treatments directly attributed to the ethical adult stem cell research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0712036000135"></a>I shall address Amendment No. 1, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Patel, in particular. Will the Minister&#151;or indeed the noble Lord himself, if he wishes to come back&#151;give me some satisfaction on some of the issues the amendment raises? Does it necessarily mean that no licence under Clause 4(1)(a) will any longer be needed to store or use immature eggs? Will no consent be required any more under Schedule 3 for the use of immature eggs? Immature eggs derived from adult ovarian tissue could be used without consent for cloning experimentation and so on. Immature foetal eggs derived from abortion could be stored and used without any need for a licence, while no restrictions would exist any longer on the  use of immature eggs derived from born persons for treatment purposes. A licence-free environment in which immature eggs could be used for experimentation without any control is, I suggest, not the right way to go.</p>

The purpose of the amendment is quite simple: to remove the need for research on the prevention of mitochondrial disease to be subject to regulations made by both Houses of Parliament, simply leaving the responsibility for licensing such research with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. I shall come to that in just a moment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0712036000137"></a>I remind your Lordships that mitochondrial disorders are a cruel class of inherited disease&#151; life-threatening conditions coupled with great unpredictability about how future children will be affected. They can include fatal liver failure, stroke-like episodes, mental retardation with intractable epilepsy, muscle weakness, diabetes and deafness. All cells in the body contain between 1,000 and 10,000 mitochondria in the cytoplasm that surrounds the nucleus. They are tiny energy-producing structures, or organelles, vital to cell function. If they malfunction, organs will eventually fail.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0712036000138"></a>Because there are no mitochondria in sperm but only in the ovum cytoplasm, when mutations occur in the mitochondrial genes, causing these devastating diseases, those mutations are transmitted by the female who has those genes to all her children of either sex. They are therefore inherited only from the

Mitochondria carry only a very small number of human genes&#151;just over 0.1 per cent. It is in those genes that the mutations may occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0712036000139"></a>The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 permits laboratory research into human cytoplasmic transplantation. Such a research licence was granted by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to a team at Newcastle University in 2005, and the laboratory studies are ongoing. The team is working on animal studies in which it is carrying out the procedure, to which I referred in detail at Second Reading, of taking an ovum, removing the nucleus from it and transplanting the nucleus from another ovum into it so that that nucleus will contain 99.5 per cent of the DNA of the donor nucleus but will also contain the normal cytoplasm.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0712036000140"></a>The proposal that we are discussing now is the next step&#151;when safety has been assured and when all the evidence, scientific and otherwise, has accumulated to make it clear to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority that this is a practical possibility&#151;which is to be able to take an ovum from a women carrying these devastating mitochondrial abnormalities in her cytoplasm, take the nucleus containing 99.5 per cent of her DNA and transplant it into a donor ovum from which the nucleus has been removed but which has normal cytoplasm.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0712036000141"></a>The decision to allow that to happen is hinted at in the Bill, which allows regulations to be introduced in the future in respect of the clinical application of the current animal research to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disease. This amber signal is welcome, but is it not just introducing yet another stage of bureaucracy in allowing the research to proceed? The decision to introduce this technique as a clinical treatment must be based on whether researchers can produce convincing evidence of safety and efficacy. The decision to grant a licence for such new clinical treatment involving embryos and gametes ordinarily rests with the HFEA. Similarly, there is a strong case for the HFEA to be allowed to determine whether to license cytoplasmic transplantation in human subjects. It will be ideally placed to assess the safety and efficacy of each case and to incorporate detailed scrutiny by members of the scientific community with appropriate expertise. There is a need for such research to progress to therapeutic application for the prevention of such serious, life-threatening diseases.</p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0712036000142"></a>The idea that the resulting child has three parents is nonsense. The DNA in mitochondria carries no information that defines any human attributes whatever, so it cannot be parental in any way either. On this reasoning, one might well claim that people with a kidney transplant have four parents; indeed, that is a stronger claim, as the kidney carries nuclear DNA from the donor and not just cytoplasmic DNA. </p>

<a name="71203-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0712036000143"></a>This treatment is not the same as reproductive cloning, which describes the situation where any baby created would be genetically identical to a donor through the transferring of a nucleus from that donor into an egg from which its own nuclear DNA had been removed. Reproductive cloning is, and must remain, illegal in the UK. However, in mitochondrial disease treatment, there is in effect the exact opposite:

<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0712036000144"></a>People have asked whether this is the same as germ-line gene therapy, a term used for modifying a gene in the nuclear genome at the beginning of development. It is not germ-line therapy, because mitochondrial genomes are not being modified; they are simply being replaced. It is true that, once normal mitochondria are in place, subsequent generations will have normal mitochondria, too, which is hardly a bad thing. This is a crucial piece of evidence, which is of inestimable value to many women and many families where this group of mitochondrial diseases has been present&#151;I have seen many such in my professional life. We cannot miss this opportunity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0712036000147"></a>Now to Amendment No. 3. In 2001, this House thought it appropriate to pass a statute for the sole purpose of banning human reproductive cloning. It was a one-clause statute passed unanimously by both Houses. This Bill seeks to repeal that Act but to continue the prohibition. I have tabled Amendment No. 3 to seek clarification from the Government. I am sure that they do not wish there to be human reproductive cloning, as does none of us. The question that arises is whether the wording of Clause 3 is sufficient and whether it deals with the questions that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0712036000150"></a>As the noble Lord said, there may come a time when eggs and sperm can be created from stem cells.

If that work should succeed, it could be of huge benefit to a person who cannot produce mature eggs or sperm but would like to have a child who is

In theory, that technique could obviate altogether the need for donor sperm and eggs, which many of us would surely welcome. However, if such a technique were to be developed, it would open up all sorts of other possibilities, which we have really not begun to think about. It could mean that the stem cells of a man could be used to create a female ovum and the stem cells of a woman could be developed into male sperm. I use that notion as only one example of what might become possible. It would enable a woman to become a child&#146;s genetic father and a man to become a child&#146;s genetic mother. Some may feel perfectly relaxed about that idea&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Patel, may be one of them. However, I would be amazed if parliamentarians in general did not regard it as an idea that needed considerable thought and deliberation before we could contemplate making it legal.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0712036000151"></a>The noble Lord would doubtless say that he does not propose to make artificial gametes legal for treatment purposes and that he merely proposes an order-making power to do so. The problem for me with an order-making power, especially one expressed in terms as broad as in this amendment, is that it does not afford Parliament enough control over an idea that, if put before us, would be bound to give rise to controversy. The potential degree of controversy could be very great, for the reasons that I have given. Therefore I believe that such matters are more appropriately left to primary legislation. The Bill is right to prohibit the use of artificial gametes for treatment purposes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="0712036000154"></a>In my Second Reading speech, I said that I dislike the use of the word &#147;embryo&#148; to describe cell lines that were created from various sources. &#147;Embryo&#148; is a very emotive term and should not have been used in the Bill to describe the sort of interspecies and other embryos that are to be created. The general public think in terms of little babies with thumbs in their mouths pictured in utero, but that is not what we mean in the terms of the Bill. We cannot emphasise strongly enough that we are talking only about destroying 14 day-old cell lines, not embryos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0712036000155"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, made the distinction between cells, gametes and germ cell lines. That is a useful distinction. Germ cell lines are not gametes and we must make that clear. If we are going to use any language at all, let us use the scientific language in embryology textbooks that we all understand. Let us not muddle things.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0712036000156"></a>I have one or two other points. I am extremely distressed by the apparent opposition to the use of cytoplasmic hybrids. Mitochondria are understood by some people to be the same as a nucleus&#151;containing genetic material in the same way as the nucleus of a cell. They do not. I happen to think that mitochondria are one of the most exciting things that people are researching at the moment, because they go all the way back to where life emerged out of a combination of chemicals. Some people say that mitochondria were bacteria engulfed by a primitive cell many billions of years ago. That is something of a digression, but mitochondria are the energy givers to the cell. They are not the same as the nucleus. If you put a nucleus from whatever sort of cell into a cell that has had the nucleus removed and just use the wonderful things that the mitochondria can do, that is not cloning. Nor is it anything more than we do in the laboratory when we use a substrate to grow things: the cytoplasm and the mitochondria are that substrate. We should get that clear and stop being too emotive on the subject. That is why I support the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, who I can see is as enthusiastic about mitochondria as I am.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0712036000157"></a>I have one thing to say in response to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Elton. Many people say that adoption is the answer to infertility: women should not have abortions but should allow the child to be adopted. Women are not baby factories, nor should they be regarded as such to enable other women to adopt. It is very unfair to expect them to see themselves in that light. Therefore, I do not think that adoption is an answer to infertility and we should never regard it as such.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0712036000158"></a>I wish to speak to Amendment No. 12 in the name of my noble friend Lady Barker, who cannot be here until later because she is attending a funeral. Amendment No. 12 proposes to delete subsection (6)(b) of new Section 4A, which appears to prevent the use of germ cell lines and nuclei in the creation of cybrids under subsection (5)(b)(ii) and (iii) in new Section 4A, when, in fact, such germ-line cells may have the most suitable nuclei to transfer because of their usefulness in repairing DNA. We believe that the bar on this process is wholly contained in the spurious subsection (6)(b) of new Section 4A and is not a consequence of the broad definition of &#147;gamete&#148; dealt with previously, or indeed at lines 13 or 18 on page 5, which Amendments Nos. 17 and 18, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Patel, address. We cannot see why the Government seek to prevent this. Furthermore, subsection (6) of new Section 4A runs the risk of leaving the use of gametes and germ-line cells in interspecies nuclear transfer outside the Act. Why would the Government want to do this? Perhaps the Minister will tell us. Therefore, we would like subsection (6)(b) of new Section 4A to be deleted, as that would correct this anomaly.</p>

Before I respond to the various amendments I should make it clear to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in response to his question about the conscience clause, that Section 38 of the 1990 Act continues to apply and is not affected by the Bill.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0712036000160"></a>The first clause in the Bill amends Section 1 of the 1990 Act. This section is key to many other provisions in the Bill, and indeed the remit of the HFEA, as it contains the meanings of key terms, including embryo, gamete, sperm and eggs. While we are often clear about what these terms mean from a biological point of view, definitions may be capable of being interpreted quite differently within the context of legislation. For this reason definitions are vital and we must have legal clarity: we are legislators.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0712036000161"></a>On Amendment No. 1, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, the meaning of the term &#147;egg&#148; in the Bill was drafted to include cells of the female germ line at any stage of maturity. It should be noted that the wording of this provision followed the precedent of a provision in the 1990 Act, as amended by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. It was drafted in this way to ensure that any egg precursor cell would be subject to all the same provisions in the Bill and the 1990 Act as an egg itself.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0712036000162"></a>Cells of the germ line develop in stages. For example, eggs start life as a primordial germ cell, then become a primary oocyte, a secondary oocyte and, ultimately, a definitive oocyte or egg. The Bill ensures, for example, that to store ovarian tissue containing cells of the female germ line, such as immature eggs for future use in treatment, a storage licence would be required in addition to the consent of the woman whose cells were being stored. In new Section 3ZA of the 1990 Act, as inserted by Clause 3, permitted eggs are defined. It is prohibited to place anything other than a permitted egg, sperm or embryo into a woman. Another reason for having a definition of &#147;egg&#148; that would include immature cells of a female germ line is to ensure that use of in vitro maturation within the context of assisted conception treatment is regulated, as would be the possible future use of in vitro growth of gametes for treatment. These techniques involve taking cells of the female germ line from the ovaries, which will clearly be eggs under the definition in the Bill, and maturing them in vitro. If the reference to &#147;egg&#148; did not include immature cells, there would be uncertainty that the cells removed and matured would have been an egg in legal terms. Importantly from the point of view of researchers in particular, unless eggs, including with the wider definition, are to be used for HFEA-licensed research, currently no licence for storage would be required. That is because the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Special Exemptions) Regulations 1991 exempt gametes from requiring a storage licence if, for example, they are intended for the purpose of research on gametes alone without the creation of an embryo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0712036000163"></a>Amendment No. 1, as part of the group of amendments with similar effects, amends the definition of &#147;eggs&#148; in proposed new Section 1(4) of  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1510"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1510</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the 1990 Act. It removes the words, &#147;including cells of the female germ line at any stage of maturity&#148;. That has the effect of altering the meaning of &#147;egg&#148; in the Bill to live human eggs but does not include eggs that are in the process of fertilisation or are undergoing any other process capable of resulting in an embryo.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0712036000164"></a>Amendment No. 1 removes certainty from the Bill as to the type of human cells that will be regulated as eggs. For example, it would no longer be clear that immature cells of the female germ line would be covered by this definition. Amendment No. 1 would also have the effect of casting doubt on the meaning of &#147;egg&#148; in this context. The effect would be that, because some immature egg cells would not fall clearly within the definition of an egg, they may not be able to be implanted in a woman. For example, if an ovarian tissue was stored for a cancer patient who then required IVF, it might not be possible to use immature cells of the female germ line with the ovarian tissue for the purpose of creating an embryo in her treatment, as the egg used to create the embryo may not be considered to be a permitted egg.</p>

Amendment  No. 11 adds the words &#147;other than gametes&#148; to new Section 4A(6)(a). This means that references to animal cells and the definitions of inter-species embryos under new Section 4A(5) do not include gametes.</p>

The effect of Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 is that the reference to human cells in paragraph (b) would expressly include cells of the germ line.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0712036000173"></a>The effect of Amendment No. 12, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, is that human cells are not defined in relation to new Section 4A(5) and it is, therefore, open to argument as to whether cells of the female or male germ line would be covered by the reference to human cells in the definition of cytoplasmic hybrids under Section 4A(5)(b).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0712036000174"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 2A. The noble Lord, Lord Elton, is absolutely right to say that definitions are important. The amendment would remove from the Bill the provision allowing through affirmative regulation the extension of the definition of the human embryo if the need arose following developments in science and medicine, which by their nature cannot be predicted at this time. The regulation-making power in Clause 1(5) allows us to ensure that the 1990 Act will always be up to date with current developments in science and technology. While I understand the noble Lord&#146;s misgivings, this power is incredibly important in ensuring a continued proper regulation in this complex area of science.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0712036000177"></a>I turn now to Amendment No. 3 of the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, who I trust is well. It is a delight to see him back in the House. The Bill introduces a wider definition of a human embryo in order to include embryos created in ways other than by fertilisation&#151;for example, by adding genetic material to an egg. New Section 3(2) of the 1990, as inserted by Clause 3, ensures that only permitted embryos, eggs and sperm can be placed in a woman. New Section 3ZA provides definitions of what will be permitted and has the effect that only embryos produced by fertilisation of a natural egg with a natural sperm and natural gametes can be place in a woman. Removing subsection (5), as proposed by Amendment No. 3, would remove that definition. Amendment No. 3 removes subsections (5) and (6) from page 3. This has two principal effects. First, it removes new Section 3ZA, which defines a permitted egg, sperm and embryo for the purposes of the 1990 Act and, secondly, it removes the provision that repeals the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001. New Section 3ZA defines a permitted gamete as an egg produced or extracted from the ovary of a woman or sperm produced or extracted from the testes of a man with unaltered nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. A permitted embryo is defined as an embryo created by the fertilisation of a permitted egg by permitted sperm where no nuclear or mitochondrial DNA of any cell of the embryo has been altered and where no additional cells have been added to the embryo. This new subsection also has a provision that will allow Parliament, through regulations, to amend the legislation so that embryos created to avoid the transmission of mitochondrial disease can be replaced in a woman. This regulation-making power would also be removed from the Bill by the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Walton. I shall return to mitochondrial issues when I respond to that amendment.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0712036000178"></a>If the definition of a permitted egg, sperm and embryo in subsection (5) were removed, it would not be clear in the legislation which embryos and gametes could be placed in a woman. That would mean that, for treatment purposes, we would have to rely on a general definition of embryos and gametes similar to that in the 1990 Act. This definition resulted in the Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 to prevent embryos created in ways other than by fertilisation to be placed in a woman. The approach under the Bill is to specify precisely what entities can be placed in a woman rather than to list those that cannot, as under the 2001 Act. We believe that this approach gives greater certainty and ensures that only the types of embryos and gametes that Parliament intended could ever be placed in a woman.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="0712036000179"></a>The Human Reproductive Cloning Act 2001 is repealed by the Bill, but the purpose of this amendment is to remove the provision in the Bill that has that effect. The 2001 Act states that anyone placing in a woman a human embryo that has been created otherwise than by fertilisation will be guilty of  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1513"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1513</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an offence. However, the Government remain firmly committed to a ban on reproductive cloning. In this Bill, the provisions have the same effect as the 2001 Act&#151;that is, to prevent anything other than an embryo created by fertilisation of a natural egg with a natural sperm being placed in a woman. Therefore, the 2001 Act is suppressed but it is still an offence to carry out reproductive cloning.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0712036000180"></a>The definitions of embryos and gametes in the Bill are drafted to capture a wide range of things that may be created under a research licence. However, we consider it appropriate to separate out embryos and gametes that can be created and used for important research from those that will be used to create a human being. The definition in new Section 3ZA(5) of the Bill clarifies which embryos, eggs and sperm can be placed in a woman, and we think that this clear separation is vital.</p>

<a name="71203-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0712036000181"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked whether it would be reproductive cloning if a somatic cell were used in mitochondrial donation. As I said, the Government remain committed to a ban on human reproductive cloning, and the intention of the regulation-making power in new subsection (5) is to use techniques involving fertilisation to prevent the transmission of serious mitochondrial disease, not the use of somatic cells.</p>

<a name="71203-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0712036000182"></a>I turn to Amendment No. 4, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Walton, who spoke passionately about this issue at Second Reading and this afternoon. As discussed in relation to earlier amendments in this group, Clause 3 introduces the concept of permitted embryos, sperm and eggs. The Bill prohibits placing in a woman any embryo, gametes, eggs or sperm other than permitted embryos or gametes. This essentially prevents placing in a woman anything other than an embryo created by the fertilisation of a naturally occurring egg with a naturally occurring sperm, so, although the legislation covers a much wider spectrum of embryos created through various techniques, only those created through fertilisation can be used to create new life.</p>

<a name="71203-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0712036000183"></a>Clause 3 inserts new Section 3ZA into the 1990 Act to define permitted embryos and gametes. For gametes, this means an egg produced or extracted from the ovaries of a woman or sperm produced or extracted from the testes of a man with unaltered nuclear or mitochondrial DNA. For embryos, this means an embryo created by the fertilisation of a permitted egg with the permitted sperm where no nuclear or mitochondrial DNA of any cell of the embryo has been altered and where no additional cells have been added to the embryo.</p>

<a name="71203-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0712036000184"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Walton, referred to the research group in Newcastle which is trying to find ways to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disease conditions. If that research develops into a safe and effective treatment, the Bill has a provision that will allow Parliament, through regulations, to amend the legislation so that embryos and eggs created to avoid the transmission of those conditions can be placed in a woman. That regulation-making power, therefore, provides for an egg or an embryo to be brought within the definition of a permitted egg or  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1514"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1514</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>embryo if it has had applied to it, in prescribed circumstances, a prescribed process designed to prevent the transmission of mitochondrial disease.</p>

<a name="71203-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0712036000185"></a>Clause 3(5), inserting new Section 3ZA(5) into the 1990 Act, is a very specific regulation-making power which would enable such eggs or embryos to be placed in a woman under a treatment licence. Amendment No. 4 moves the provision from secondary legislation and places it in the Bill. The provision was left to secondary legislation not because we believe that the issues relating to mitochondrial disease are, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, says, to do with technological brutalism, nor because we want to introduce a further layer of bureaucracy, but because we believe that data on safety and efficiency of this technique are not yet available and, therefore, it would seem premature to provide for this technique to be licensed in the Bill.</p>

<a name="71203-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0712036000186"></a>The technique also raises important ethical considerations because it covers the creation of an embryo using three separate genetic contributions. Although we recognise that this research is significant and has the potential to alter significantly the reproductive options for those people who suffer from serious mitochondrial diseases, we feel, at this time, when the safety and efficacy of the technique has yet to be demonstrated, that this provision is most appropriate in secondary legislation with an opportunity for debate in both Houses.</p>

<a name="71203-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0712036000187"></a>Amendment No. 5, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, raises another important matter. The amendment introduces a regulation-making power which would allow the definition of permitted eggs and sperm to be expanded to eggs and sperm that have been derived from a prescribed process to treat infertility. That relates to research to help those people who are unable to produce gametes naturally to have children that are genetically related to them. It is also possible that in some circumstances that technology could be used for the purpose of enabling same-sex couples to have children who are genetically related to both parents.</p>

<a name="71203-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0712036000188"></a>I note what the noble Lord, Lord Patel, has said about researchers working in this specific area and what the noble Lords, Lord Winston and Lord Wilson, have said. We believe that this research is not yet at a stage when it can be translated into infertility treatments, but Amendment No. 5 provides for the expanded definition of permitted embryos to include artificial gametes to be introduced by secondary legislation. The Bill allows for research into artificial gametes to be carried out but the use of artificial gametes is not permitted in treatment. I understand the arguments that have been put forward from a scientific perspective, but I believe that the amendment raises wider ethical questions, as the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said. Therefore, on balance, the Government have decided that such a significant and potentially wide-ranging development should be subject to full parliamentary debate and consultation as and when further data on these techniques are available.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0712036000189"></a>Amendments Nos. 51 and 53 seek to permit the use of cell lines, a tool commonly used in research for the creation of embryos in the laboratory by means of  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1515"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>therapeutic cloning without specific consent to this activity. The cell lines may be cultured for many years; some cells found in cell lines were originally donated decades ago. The cells would have been taken from a donor with the person's consent, but that person would be unlikely to have imagined, particularly if the cells were donated many years ago, that they could or would be used for the creation of cloned embryos.</p>

<a name="71203-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0712036000190"></a>Every person has the right to decide whether their cells may be used in the creation of an embryo, and for what purposes that embryo may be used. That was the main reason for the consent regime found in the 1990 Act and the reason behind the proposed changes to the consent requirements found in the Bill today. These changes have been introduced to ensure that a person&#146;s consent is always obtained before the use of their cells or gametes in embryo research. Schedule 3 to the Bill preserves the system of consent under the 1990 Act that makes changes to reflect the fact that human embryos can now be created in more ways than simply mixing human gametes. Additional consent requirements are introduced to ensure that informed consent is obtained before any human material can be used to create an embryo and for the subsequent use and storage of such embryos. These provisions ensure that the same safeguards provided in the 1990 Act for consents relating to embryos are applied to all types of embryo creation.</p>

<p><a name="0712036000248"></a>that is already adequately covered by existing regulations through local and central ethical committees. It therefore hardly needs an extra piece of legislation through the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0712036000198"></a>It would be nonsense.

But this research is important, and might be curtailed. That is example of where the Government need to think about this phrase, as raised by my friend the noble Lord, Lord Patel.

The HFEA is set up primarily to deal with the special ethical considerations that arise from the creation and use of embryos. As I recollect, the committee recommended that the authority should have the power to exempt from the requirements of a licence activities in respect of which a licence was applied for but which in the view of the authority did not involve the ethics of embryos.

My scientific knowledge cannot dazzle anyone, as my children regularly remind me. Scientists merely wish to inform so that parliamentarians can make better regulations.

The purpose of my amendment relating to artificial gametes is to treat those who are infertile. I made a point of referring to patients such as those treated with cancer therapies whose germ line cells are destroyed. I accept the concern of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, but we are not talking about using male somatic cells to produce female germ cells or vice versa, but about infertile couples using male somatic cells, adult cells or induced pluripotent cells to produce male sperm or vice versa for female eggs. I would not be at all &#147;relaxed&#148;, to use the words of the noble Earl, Lord Howe, if the case was as he suggests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0712036000205"></a>As far as concerns the amendment of my noble friend Lord Walton, we have to recognise that mitochondrial diseases are serious. People who suffer from such a disease inherit it through the female line. Mitochondria are not germ cells. The embryo created will be the fusion of a male sperm, the father, and the female egg, the mother. The DNA material that would not belong to them would be the mitochondrial material. It is therefore not cloning in the correct sense of the word &#147;cloning&#148;, unless you wish to abuse that term scientifically. I would not wish to do that. So I do not accept that that is cloning, and I support the noble Lord, Lord Walton, in what he is trying to promote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="0712036000226"></a>Following the BSE crisis, and after the saga of genetic crops, the Science and Technology Committee of your Lordships&#146; House said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0712036000278"></a>&#147;many are deeply uneasy about the huge opportunities presented by areas of science including biotechnology and information technology, which seem to be advancing far ahead of their   


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1519"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1519</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>awareness and assent. In turn, public unease, mistrust and outright hostility are breeding a climate of deep anxiety among scientists themselves ... Science&#146;s relationship with United Kingdom society is under strain&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000249"></a>Do we seriously believe that the creation of animal-human hybrid embryos, about which there is deep unease, will heal that fractured relationship? The main argument for using hybrids is for medical cures. Interspecies cloning is particularly in highlight in this regard. However, the Japanese procedure, which was referred to at Second Reading, to produce cells that resemble embryonic stem cells directly from skin, producing multipotent stem cells that were identical immunologically to the patient without using an embryo, was recently found to work with human cells by two groups, as several noble Lords mentioned in our debate on 19 November. That is a major advance. The two groups were led by Professor Yamanaka in Japan and by Professor James Thomson in America, who originally isolated human embryonic stem cells.</p>

<a name="71203-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="0712036000227"></a>My noble friend Lord Patel spoke powerfully against the Japanese procedure in that debate. He questioned the ability of the production of embryonic stem cells directly from skin, and pointed to some of the issues that might arise. He emphasised that the mouse produced from these cells had tumours, owing to a particular gene that had been inserted to induce the cells to become multipotent. I am delighted to be able to tell your Lordships&#146; House that the same research group published a further article on 30 November in <I>Nature Biotechnology</I> in which it described research in which it did not use that gene and none of the mice developed tumours. The cells are likely to be much more biologically relevant than cells produced by interspecies cloning, as cloning produces numerous biological flaws and carrying out interspecies cloning would simply magnify those problems. On 30 November, The <I>Daily Telegraph</I> reported:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="0712036000270"></a>&#147;Now the Japanese team led by Prof Shinya Yamanaka and colleagues at Kyoto University show in the journal Nature Biotechnology how to convert adult human skin cells into cells that resemble embryonic stem cells without using the tumour-causing gene&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000250"></a>These genes will be an immune match to the patient, so pursuing this avenue of research would negate the need to pursue therapeutic cloning and interspecies cloning.</p>

<a name="71203-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="0712036000228"></a>What is the precise purpose of what we are being asked to approve, should the amendments not be made to the Bill? What did scientists speaking to the Joint Committee say on being asked their views on so-called true hybrids? Dr Lovell-Badge said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="0712036000271"></a>&#147;I cannot think of a good experiment to do now but I am sure someone will think of a good experiment&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000251"></a>Professor Bobrow said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0712036000279"></a>&#147;we are also not aware of any pressing scientific reasons at the moment for creating such entities, but who knows what tomorrow might bring?&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000252"></a>Professor Smith said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="0712036000272"></a>&#147;At the present time, we have not been able to identify such a particular reason&#148;&#151;</p>

<ul><a name="0712036000280"></a>&#147;but that does not mean that they do not already exist and that there are not people already in the scientific community who would have appropriate grounds or that they would come along in the future&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000254"></a>This is not exactly overwhelming, compelling evidence that true hybrids are urgently required for medical use. Furthermore, the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, said in his evidence to the Joint Committee on the draft Bill on 6 June that,</p>
<ul><a name="0712036000281"></a>&#147;there was no clear scientific argument as to why you would want to do it, and, secondly, a feeling that this would be a step too far as far as the public are concerned. I think we do have a responsibility to ensure that we take the public with us in the other important areas of research that we want to do, and do not lose their confidence by moving forward with something which is much further out, as far as acceptability is concerned, and where the scientific arguments for wanting to do it are not particularly strong or convincing, or even existent&#148;.</ul>


<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71203-0006.htm"/>


<a name="71203-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="0712036000229"></a>I know that many of those who voted for embryonic cloning in 2001, and who will vote for animal-human hybrids, did so out of a genuine humanitarian desire to help those who suffer from disabling diseases. I do not believe that anything divides us in this House in our determination to try to do that, but were those beliefs well founded?</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="0712036000230"></a>It may be instructive to note the subsequent widely reported comments of the noble Lord, Lord Winston, in 2005. He said:</p>
<ul><a name="0712036000273"></a>&#147;I think it is unlikely that embryonic stem cells are likely to be useful in healthcare for a long time ... I was concerned that parliamentarians&#151;particularly in the House of Commons&#151;have been convinced that it was just a matter of a few years before we would be able to transplant stem cells and cure a lot of neurological disorders, like Alzheimer&#146;s disease, for which I think it is going to be a hugely difficult problem and probably completely insoluble by stem cells&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000255"></a>To pretend that the creation of hybrid embryos from animal eggs will offer a desperate patient with motor neurone disease their only hope of a cure, as was prominently asserted earlier this year, is perpetrating yet another piece of fiction which does no service to the seriously ill.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="0712036000231"></a>Perhaps now would be a good time to pause and similarly ask what the creation of interspecies embryos might realistically promise. In his speech on Second Reading, my noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant inform us that,</p>
<ul><a name="0712036000282"></a>&#147;the new technique of cloning using the interspecies embryo&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000256"></a>would not require suppression of the immune response. Indeed, he went on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="0712036000274"></a>&#147;Now, if one can use animal cells to produce the type of capsule or framework in which the nucleus from that cell can be implanted, stem cells derived from that cell will be immunologically compatible with the host into whom the subsequent stem cells will be implanted. That overcomes the difficulties arising as a result of some use of other cells such as the adult stem cells to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/11/07; cols. 708-09.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="71203-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="0712036000232"></a>In due course, I know that the Committee will greatly appreciate it if my noble friend would be willing to explain how it is that cells containing proteins from a distantly related species would not provoke an immune response, yet stem cells taken only from the same individual supposedly would. In expounding such views, I also trust that my noble friend will explain fully how one can be so sure about  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1521"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1521</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the developmental potential of such a cloned interspecies entity, especially without implanting it in a womb or crossing the 14-day limit.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="0712036000233"></a>In our debate in January 2001, my noble friend was sceptical about progress using adult stem cells, stating that progress would take many years of fundamental research. In his speech on Second Reading, my noble friend also commended an article by Julian Savulescu on the purported benefits of attempts at human cloning with eggs of distantly related species. I hope my noble friend will take the opportunity to dissociate himself from Professor Savulescu&#146;s previously expressed views in favour of reproductive cloning or the harvesting of tissue from cloned foetuses.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="0712036000234"></a>Meanwhile, Her Majesty&#146;s Government seem decidedly confused regarding whether or not the potential use of a technique known as tetraploid complementation would fall under the remit of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act if human embryonic stem cells were injected into a tetraploid embryo of another species tetraploid embryo complementation is already a well established technique for deriving mature mice entirely from mouse embryonic stem cells in which the cells of a tetraploid mouse embryo give rise to extra embryonic tissue, such as placenta, while the mouse&#146;s embryonic stem cells contribute directly to the developing foetus. </p>

<p><a name="0712036000257"></a>as proposed to be inserted under Clause 4(2) of the Bill has the scope to cover any predominantly or substantially human organism that conceivably may be created by injecting human embryonic stem cells into an embryo of another species into which the animal cells primarily produce extra embryonic tissue. </p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="0712036000236"></a>I invite the Committee to contrast those remarks with those of the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon, and also with those previously made by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. He stated that an animal embryo altered for an experimental or other scientific purpose by the introduction of one or more human cells will be governed by the provisions of the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 once it reached the half-way point of gestation or incubation. That was given to me in a Written Answer on 28 June 2007. Subsequently, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon, stated that if the cells that make up an embryo contain at least a haploid set of human chromosomes and at least one sequence of animal DNA, including a tetraploid complement of animal chromosomes, then it will be regulated as an interspecies embryo, but the regulation of animal embryos that contain single or multiple human cells is not within the scope of the Bill. That was given in a Written Answer on 12 July 2007.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="0712036000237"></a>Under which legislation would an embryo fall if it contained a significant proportion of human embryonic stem cells, which obviously themselves contain at least a haploid set of human chromosomes that have been injected into a tetraploid primate embryo? The evident confusion displayed by the contrasting answers from Her Majesty&#146;s Government on this potential issue have not inspired much more confidence in the ability  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1522"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1522</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to regulate such research than the extensive indecision of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority regarding whether or not it could regulate the so-called &#147;cybrid&#148; embryos. Such confusion may be especially disconcerting in the light of Dr Stephen Minger&#146;s comments to the Joint Committee on the Human Tissue and Embryos (Draft) Bill that it may be only a few years before someone will want to,</p>
<ul><a name="0712036000284"></a>&#147;take human embryonic stem cells and put them into a primate blastocyst and take that blastocyst to mid-gestation or maybe to birth or maybe to ten years of age&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000258"></a>So much, then, for the 14-day limit as applied to interspecies embryos.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="0712036000238"></a>In 1990, in opposing the first Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, I quoted in another place scientific opinion that doubted the scientific worth, let alone the ethics, of human embryo experimentation. I quoted an intervention from a debate in your Lordships&#146; House by my noble friend Lord Walton, whom I respect enormously although we disagree fundamentally on this issue. I seem to have been arguing with him now for the past 20 years. He had been asked what significant cures or advances in treatment had been achieved. He replied,</p>
<ul><a name="0712036000285"></a>&#147;I agree that as yet there are none&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/2/90; col. 958.]</ul>
<p><a name="0712036000259"></a>In 2001 when I divided your Lordships&#146; House, when close to 1 million human embryos had been destroyed, I asked the same question. No one could point to a single cure, yet we then authorised the cloning of human embryos. Seven years later we are now being asked to permit the creation of interspecies embryos. Although some 2 million human embryos have now been destroyed or experimented upon, the answer to the question remains the same. Cures&#151;around 80 are now documented&#151;are coming through adult stem cells, not through interspecies manipulation.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="0712036000239"></a>We should be clear-sighted. We should think wisely about what we are being asked to authorise. Having done so, we should reject these proposals as a step too far. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_82"></a>
<a name="07120316000001"></a><b><a name="71203-0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07120316000092"></a>Lord Harries of Pentregarth:</b> I was not able to speak at Second Reading, so it is appropriate at this stage to declare an interest as a member of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which is relevant to all stages of the Bill.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07120316000002"></a>I have three points to make in response to the noble Lord, Lord Alton. First, in his first intervention today, he held before us a spectre of science that he termed &#147;brutalism&#148;. He set out a rather frightening future of the kind of world that might come about through science. We are always right to be wary, but there is another view of science: that it is a great blessing, that we are meant to use our minds in order to interact with natural processes to bring about human health and healing. He used the word &#147;artificial&#148;, and people sometimes say &#147;unnatural&#148;, but it is natural for us to use our minds in order to enhance human welfare and well-being.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07120316000003"></a>The second point concerns this set of amendments. I presume that what is really being referred to is cytoplasmic hybrids. There is a case for looking separately at so-called &#147;true&#148; hybrids because, as the  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1523"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1523</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lord rightly said, there is not a great deal of scientific pressure at the moment to do research on true hybrids, but there is a lot of such pressure to do research on cytoplasmic hybrids. The reason is clear: there is a great shortage of human eggs. If it were possible to do this research using animal eggs, there would be a virtually unlimited supply. I remind your Lordships that we are talking about research that is essential for the future.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07120316000004"></a>Thirdly, the noble Lord mentioned the new research from Japan that might make it possible to produce embryonic stem cells without destroying embryos, which is very exciting and promising. But when applications for licences for research come before the HFEA, one of the first questions it asks, if research on embryos is proposed, is whether it is possible to do the research other than by using embryos. In the future, therefore, if this new research line looks possible, the HFEA will quite rightly have to say to the research team, &#147;Is it really necessary for you to use embryos?&#148;.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07120316000005"></a>The use of cytoplasmic hybrids is a very promising line of future research. Your Lordships&#146; House should approve it and make it possible.</p>

The noble Lord is quite right: I said at Second Reading that Yamanaka had used in his work in Japan vectors which subsequently produced tumours in mice. He is right also that only last week&#151;in fact, just a few days ago&#151;there was an article in <I>Nature Biotechnology</I> headed:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="07120316000080"></a>That meant that there will not be tumorogenicity of the same degree, but I shall come back to that in a minute, because the story is not quite as glorious as the noble Lord just made out. He was quite right, though, that science is moving fast in this area and may be promising.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07120316000007"></a>There is no doubt that this recent publication, related to induced pluripotency in adult cells, is a scientific advance that most scientists working in stem cell science would not have expected to come with the speed with which it has. It heralds tremendous promise for achieving every stem cell scientist&#146;s holy grail&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Alton, will remember that I mentioned it&#151;of being able to reprogramme an adult cell to a pluripotent cell and differentiate it in the cell types that they need to treat the diseases. That is what every scientist is chasing. It is not that they wish to do embryonic stem cell research for amusement or any other purpose; it is solely for the purpose of looking for treatments.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="07120316000008"></a>I return to the main point of the amendment, which relates to two issues: interspecies embryos, and embryos created for cell nuclear-transfer technology. Perhaps I may read a document that I received from Sir Martin Evans, this year&#146;s winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. He is the man who identified embryonic stem cells decades ago and showed that it was possible to obtain cells with  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1524"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1524</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>normal chromosomes from early blastocysts. In a recent publication, Jamie Thomson, in Wisconsin, first identified chromosomally normal stem cells from human embryos and early blastocysts. Sir Martin states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="07120316000084"></a>&#147;At the moment, and for the foreseeable immediate future, neither induced pluripotent stem cells nor adult stem cells will suffice for either research or development of stem cell-based therapeutic approaches. It should be pointed out that, presently, the induced pluripotent cells all have integrated within them factors&#148;.</p>

One of them was an oncogene called Myc, which subsequently induced tumours in the mice. Their oncogene is now removed. What if scientists removed that and used other vectors to induce pluripotency? Yamanaka said that he had induced in his experiments 20 factors in every cell. That means that the chance of a cell subsequently derived not having any of these factors in it would be one in 10 million. We do not know at this stage what results that may produce.</p>

At present, the main research focus for the use of those entities would be the use of cytoplasmic hybrids, as the noble Lord said&#151;and I agree with him. Scientists currently wish to use only cytoplasmic hybrids to do the experiments, and not others. The Bill also allows for further regulations to be made by the Secretary of State to include other as yet unforeseen and therefore indefinable entities in the remit of the legislation.</p>

I have said before that if last century was the century of the physical sciences, it looks as if this century may be the century of the biological sciences. If it produces the same degree of advances as the physical sciences produced last century, our lives will be changed&#151;and certainly, the lives of those with debilitating diseases will be changed. As we all know, the UK has an international reputation as a leader in stem cell science.</p>

SCNT, as somatic cell nuclear transfer is often referred to, has three specific aims: to create disease-specific stem cell lines that can be used to model disease processes and open up new opportunities for developing therapies; to generate stem cell lines with particular genetic backgrounds to be used in drug development assays; and to create patient-specific stem lines for therapeutic use, which would avoid rejection by the recipient immune system, either because they are created using a patient&#146;s donor cell nucleus or selected to be immunocompatible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="07120316000013"></a>SCNT techniques have proved effective in numerous animal species. Just two weeks ago there was success in achieving SCNT in monkeys, which suggests that current technical barriers might be surmountable. Nevertheless, many eggs will be required to develop SCNT techniques to derive

It may therefore be more acceptable to use animal rather than human eggs, since they could be used to generate cytoplasmic hybrid embryos for the derivation of embryonic stem cell lines of essentially human nature. At the time when these cells are harvested from the blastocysts, most of the genetic material is human to the extent of 99.9 per cent or more. Some say that if you harvest it early enough it would be virtually 100 per cent, because more of the animal material from the mitochondria is transmitted later in the blastocysts. Animal eggs are readily available from abattoirs.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="07120316000014"></a>Proposed research on interspecies embryos in the United Kingdom would involve taking the somatic cell from an adult with a degenerative condition and placing the nucleus in a nucleated animal egg to create stem cell lines to use as diseased models to study pathogenesis and test therapies. Currently, SCNT-derived cells could not be used therapeutically, and no one has the intention to do so, given the exposure to material of animal origin. I say &#147;currently&#148; because we do not know whether it will be possible in science in due course to remove all the animal material. In the United States it is likely that within two years the original embryonic stem cell lines created by James Thomson will be used, with FDA approval which has already been given. Those stem cell lines had rabbit feeder cells; by using a scientific technique, those feeder cells have been removed. The FDA has accepted that technique and allowed permission for those cells to be used for therapy for the first stage of the trial.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07120316000015"></a>Generation of cytoplasmic hybrid embryos using readily available animal eggs would also provide invaluable experience in SCNT technology, thereby increasing technical efficiency and expertise so that a much smaller number of human eggs would subsequently be needed to generate &#147;patient-specific&#148; stem cells that could be used for clinical treatment. The information and technique would also be relevant in research looking at deriving stem cells by programming adult somatic stem cells. In that respect, I also have to say to my noble friend Lord Alton that a technique of reprogramming adult cells to become pluripotent cells used the technique developed by using embryonic stem cells. Without learning from embryonic stem cells, that particular technique would not have been possible as we had to know which vectors were needed to induce pluripotency. My noble friend may challenge that and we will have an interesting discussion if he does.</p>

However, that work is at a very preliminary stage and the current technology involves engineering the cells in a way that raises a number of safety issues that will need further refinement before the use of iPS cells in the clinic can be contemplated. To give one example: adult cells have a problem with

If these cells are used for therapy there will always be a problem because of the loss of telomeres when inserted for treatment. They may produce cancers in the patients treated because of the limited senescence of these cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07120316000017"></a>Not enough is known about any particular route to generating stem cells to be sure of predicting which approach will bear fruit, and all avenues of research should be left open. Discoveries in all types of stem cell research inform the field and have the potential to accelerate the delivery of safe and effective stem cell therapies. Indeed, the leading stem cell centres in the UK and overseas contain groups that are working with both embryonic and adult stem cells, and no doubt iPS cell technology will be incorporated in the very near future. In fact, scientists in the UK have already started using the iPS technology following the two reports.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07120316000018"></a>Regulating the creation of interspecies embryos for research under the strict regulatory regime of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act will ensure that it is undertaken in a responsible and appropriate manner, subject to rigorous transparent review. Such work will undoubtedly progress in other countries and it would be preferable for the UK to conduct research in its tightly regulated environment rather than rely on results from countries where the same standards may not apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07120316000019"></a>The Bill clearly prohibits placing an interspecies embryo in a woman. Furthermore, interspecies embryos cannot be kept after the earliest of the following: the appearance of the primitive streak, or the end of a period of 14 days beginning with the day on which the process of creating the interspecies embryo began. The regulation is firm enough to stop that happening.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="07120316000020"></a>There are other issues related to induced pluripotent cells derived from adult cells because of the state of senescence that I have already mentioned. iPS cells, even if they are made safe for transplantation cell therapy, may be useful in patients of a certain age only before their inherited state of senescence turns the cells cancerous. What do we do for the teenager who suffers spinal cord injury in a motorcycle accident? The answer still has to be that ES cells retain real potential in that situation.</p>

I want to add one point to everything that has been said. When we talked about the nature of interspecies embryos, we said how difficult it was to collect human eggs. This point has been well made but another point must be taken very seriously. If we are to continue with interspecies embryo research&#151;I absolutely agree with those who say that we should and must&#151;we must also recognise that there is a risk posed to women from overstimulation of their ovaries. It is not a great risk but it is a risk.</p>

<a name="71203-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="07120316000023"></a>Adopting the technology of using animal eggs and human sperm to give us material on which we can do this research, which has the potential to be so very useful, is in my view preferable to encouraging more women to have their ovaries stimulated than need to do so for treatment purposes. We should look not only at the potential for the alleviation of suffering that this area of research might bring, but at trying to prevent suffering that could result if too much overstimulation of women&#146;s ovaries should occur other than for treatment. We should take that point very seriously.</p>

Indeed, one could argue that the stimulation of the ovary under any circumstances may produce abnormal eggs. There is growing evidence that the lesser the stimulation, the better the quality of the egg and the better the chance of the embryo implanting and being viable. Within the next three to five years more and more in vitro fertilisation programmes may not involve stimulating the ovary. I believe that this method of stimulation, which is used worldwide, is obsolete. That will make eggs more difficult to obtain because researchers and clinicians should be working with only one or two eggs. Therefore, there will be a growing need for eggs elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="07120316000025"></a>I should spell out the statistics involved with the current methods. If during stimulation you get 10 follicles, on average you will get nine or 10 eggs. From those, on average about six will fertilise, of which, on average, two or three will produce an embryo. Even then, those embryos will not necessarily be viable. Something happens during this process which is not entirely counterproductive, and we do not understand why. That is why an alternative method would be extremely useful. It is not reasonable to expect women to give up eggs during their in vitro fertilisation programme when they know that it is uncertain which egg will become the embryo which will produce the pregnancy they so desperately desire. For that reason as well it is essential to focus on the needs of these IVF patients.</p>

The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, encouraged us to pursue research, but most countries have not formed specific legislation to cover the creation of human-animal hybrids for research.

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07120316000027"></a>I will mention the results of two recent pieces of public research on this issue. The Joint Committee had an online survey in June 2007 with 153 responses, and only one person suggested that the regulatory authority should license interspecies research. Secondly, in July 2007 a public opinion poll was conducted with 2,073 people, and only 7 per cent said that they knew a lot about using human embryos in research and 9 per cent had never heard of it. That suggests that not a great deal is generally known about the subject among the general public. The summary of responses to the scientific consultation gave the general view of organisations that there is currently no reason why scientists would want to create human transgenic embryos, true hybrids or human chimera embryos.</p>

<a name="71203-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07120316000028"></a>The lack of human eggs should not be used as a justification for embarking on this unethical research. All avenues of research should not be open; only ethical avenues should be pursued. The Joint Committee recognised that the Bill lacked an ethical framework. The Bill would allow for the unnecessary licensing of these hybrids.</p>

Should we not rely on that basic human response to show that this research is both ethically and morally concerning and is indeed wrong? It removes any respect for human dignity and it crosses the human-animal species barrier. No consideration seems to have been given to biosecurity issues in relation to interspecies viruses. Are those who are experts in stem cell embryology also experts in such issues? It has been suggested that animal eggs from abattoir material could be used, but in any event that research is repugnant; it should be prohibited rather than allowed. I urge noble Lords to ban such scientific experiments; we need to retrace our steps to align ourselves with European countries rather than embark on even more unethical research.</p>

He is a most distinguished neuroscientist, although his Nobel Prize was awarded for work on prions as a cause of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Nevertheless, he has been taking a careful interest in the progress of these debates in the House of Lords, and he made it absolutely clear that in his view issues that are being considered today in relation to the Bill are, for various reasons, not being pursued as effectively as they might be in the United States.

A significant proportion of the budgets of the National Institutes of Health in the United States and the UK&#146;s Medical Research Council goes into this research, but it is licensed by the Animal Procedures Committee and does not fall within the ambit of the HFEA.</p>

<a name="71203-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="07120316000031"></a>To return to the points made by my noble friend Lord Alton, let me say at once that although it is absolutely right that no cure for a human disease has yet been achieved by the use of stem cells, a great deal of research has been done in using stem cells to treat animal models of disease, with as yet some significant and quite encouraging results. This type of research is measured in years, not months and days. For example, in my field of research&#151;muscular dystrophy&#151;it has been shown that muscle stem cells, some created from adult stem cells by manipulation and other techniques, have been injected into muscle and have replicated and produced a certain amount of repair. The problem is how to get those stem cells into every muscle in the human body. That is an enormous challenge for scientists. But there are encouraging signs of benefits arising from such work.</p>

<a name="71203-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="07120316000032"></a>My noble friend Lord Alton is absolutely right that adult stem cells, cord blood stem cells and embryonic stem cells have considerable potential. Nevertheless, adult stem cells, although they are valuable, are adult and therefore more mature and are much more difficult to manipulate into producing long lines of cells comparable to those that can be produced from embryos. Even cord blood cells are nine months more mature than those obtained from the embryo, and are rather more difficult to manipulate.</p>

<a name="71203-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="07120316000033"></a>The point that I made at Second Reading is important. These stem cells, derived from donors of whatever kind, to be injected for treatment purposes into human beings after full consideration of all the ethical consequences and of licence under the HFEA, are not immunologically compatible with the individual into whom they are injected. Not to make too strong a point, made also by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, as I said at Second Reading, if you are performing a cybrid, where you take a rabbit cell and use simply the membrane and cytoplasm to form the actual skeleton into which you insert the cell of the skin of the human being suffering from an illness which is going to be treated by the stem cells derived from that technique, those cells are immunologically compatible because the tiny amount of DNA in the cytoplasm will not affect that situation. The cell lines could be of enormous value. I believe that to have cybrids as part of the Bill is crucial for the future management and treatment of human disease.</p>

However, if you look at this week&#146;s <I>British Medical Journal</I>, you will see that Ian Wilmut, who created Dolly the sheep, is outspoken in saying that while work on the use of these cells must continue, that does not mean that we should not at

That work must go on in parallel with this new work on adult skin cells. The problem with adult skin cells, even if you do not use an oncogene, is that you have to introduce genes into those cells to make them replicate and develop in the way that we would wish. To carry that out requires a virus to carry the genes into the cell. That virus is not without potential hazard.</p>

The point is simply that we currently lack an ethical or moral compass for decision-making in relation to this type of entity&#151;a compass of the kind that the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, gave us in the 1980s and which subsequently formed the framework for the 1990 Act. I find the absence of such a framework in this context extremely unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07120316000040"></a>Some fundamental ethical questions present themselves. Is the ethical status of an entity which is 99 per cent human on an equal footing with the status of something that is 50 per cent human? Are there particular ethical issues that need to be borne in mind when decisions are taken about the creation and use of a true hybrid embryo, as distinct from the creation and use of a cytoplasmic hybrid embryo? If there is a sensitivity about the use of completely human embryos, as the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, said there should be, is the sensitivity associated with the use of hybrid embryos the same or is it greater or smaller? Indeed, does the special ethical status of the human embryo extend also to embryos that are less than 100 per cent human? None of these questions admits of answers that are immediate or straightforward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07120316000041"></a>The Government&#146;s own position on the subject of true hybrid embryos has already shifted. That may be seen by some as good but, viewed in another light, it is rather worrying because it indicates that Ministers had few ethical or practical pointers to guide them in the first instance. When the Chief Medical Officer gave evidence to the Joint Committee on the subject of true hybrids&#151;that is, hybrids created using human gametes and the gametes of an animal&#151;he was asked to clarify the ethical distinction between a cytoplasmic hybrid and a true hybrid. He said this about the true hybrid:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="07120316000085"></a>&#147;The process involved and the resulting entity is very different in character to the first. I am surprised that you cannot see that. I think the outside world would see a big distinction&#148;.</p>
</ul>

Noble Lords will remember that arising out of the special ethical status of the human embryo, which the Baroness, Lady Warnock, helpfully defined, has emerged an understanding about research projects involving such embryos. The understanding has been that, wherever possible, embryos used for research should be those left over from IVF treatment which would otherwise

The utilitarian approach says that, even though these are human embryos with special ethical status, it is ethically justifiable to use them in research as a means to an end, rather than to destroy them, so long as the end potentially conduces to the public good in the way that the law allows. If one looks at the statistics for research projects approved by the HFEA, the vast majority have involved embryos that have originally been created for treatment purposes but have not, in the event, been needed. Research projects for which embryos have been expressly created from gametes have been comparatively few in number. One reason for this surely has to be the greater ethical sensitivity associated with the deliberate creation of a human life form expressly for the purposes of research.</p>

<a name="71203-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07120316000043"></a>Following on from that, the point that has not been made about the provisions for interspecies embryos is that, of necessity, they envisage the creation of embryos expressly for research. These embryos are clearly not left over from anything else; they have to be manufactured. That basic point should not be ignored for the purposes of the ethical framework, and that is why I suggested in my amendment two things. First, we need a set of principles that should inform all decisions relating to any research application involving interspecies embryos. Secondly, those principles should require the regulator to consider a number of factors, over and above those normally considered, before a licence for the creation of an interspecies embryo is issued. These are that the research project in question should be designed to fill an important gap in scientific knowledge&#151;important in the sense of its potential benefit to man&#151;that there should be a reasonable chance that the project will be successful in achieving its aims; and, lastly, that there should be no practicable alternative to the creation and use of an interspecies embryo. For a bona fide project, those additional hurdles should not present a difficulty, but they, or something like them, are I think essential if the sensitivities relating to interspecies embryos are to be paid any sort of respect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07120316000044"></a>I hope that the Minister will agree to reflect on these issues between now and Report and that we can move towards a more considered position in relation to the ethical underpinning of these provisions.</p>

I do not think that the scientists will find it too onerous so long as the wording is modified so that it does not appear too draconian. Paragraph (b) of proposed new subsection (3B) in the amendment refers to,</p>

<p><a name="07120316000082"></a>I could not think of embarking on a research project if I did not believe that it might produce a useful result. If the regulator was not too draconian about enforcing that provision, I would have some sympathy with that point.</p>

It seems to me that on Report we shall have an important debate about the setting up of an ethical framework.

At the moment, the HFEA works with a very clear ethical and legal framework, which was originated by the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, and enshrined in the 1990 Act. We have to work strictly within that. Therefore, when we are considering applications to carry out research on cytoplasmic hybrids, that ethical and legal framework is very much in place. Some of the principles that the noble Lord lays down in the amendment already have to be taken into account when a licence committee is considering research applications. However, I think that he raises some very good questions in relation to so-called true hybrids. I am not sure that we have given serious ethical consideration to that aspect of this clause.</p>

This takes us back to other pieces of legislation that we have been debating in recent months in this House; for instance, under the Mental Health Bill we were also asking for a very clear set of principles. The noble Lord, Lord Harris of Pentregarth, has made a very strong case for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority already operating under an ethical framework, but I am sure that the noble Earl is right in wanting to take it further, particularly at this stage. I believe that we should, as the House is gradually doing, ask for a clear set of ethical principles against which we judge a whole lot of decisions. It seems to me that generally we have accepted the spirit of that.</p>

The Bill sets out a framework of regulation for interspecies embryos.

Two parliamentary committees have examined this topic in much detail and the scientific community has

Having listened to the arguments presented here, we have set out in this Bill a framework for regulation, the same as is already in place for embryo research using human embryos. We have also heard the limitations and the dangers to donors of eggs, as highlighted by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, and by my noble friend Lord Winston. We need to open up this area of research to scientists in the hope of developing knowledge about disease, of discovering new ways of treating and perhaps even of curing serious disease and medical conditions affecting the quality of life of countless people worldwide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07120316000051"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 6, 6A and 43. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, has tabled a number of amendments, the combined effect of which is an absolute prohibition on research involving interspecies embryos, as defined in Clause 4 of the Bill, including the prohibition of the use of hamster eggs in testing of human sperm fertility, a test which can be licensed under the  1990 Act. Such embryo research since 1990 has been limited so that it is permissible only under licence from the HFEA. Research involving interspecies embryos will also have such boundaries. As with all human embryo research, a licence from the HFEA will always be required for the creation, the keeping and the use of interspecies embryos as well as for the hamster test. There is an absolute prohibition on placing of interspecies embryos in a woman or in an animal. In addition, no licence may authorise the culture of interspecies embryos beyond 14 days or the time at which primitive streaks appear or whichever occurs first. Any interspecies embryo must be destroyed once the limit is reached. As the noble Lord, Lord Patel, suggested, research involving interspecies embryos could provide us with better understanding of human embryos and embryonic stem cells. With appropriate limitation in place, I believe that that research should be licensable under the regulatory remit of the HFEA, just as the research which Professor Wilmot intends to undertake now into reprogramming of human somatic cells would not be possible without prior research using embryonic stem cells. Research using interspecies embryos may one day provide more clues to the mechanics of human cells and lead to a better understanding of the nature of disease and provide effective treatments.</p>

<a name="71203-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07120316000052"></a>I turn to the comment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, about tetraploid complementation, to which he referred as covered by the Bill to the extent that they will not be permitted embryos and therefore could not be implanted in a woman. The Secretary of State also has the power under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to prevent them being implanted in an animal. The Bill contains in Clause 4 the power to extend the definition of interspecies embryos to cover any further embryos that combine human and animal material, should the need arise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07120316000053"></a>Perhaps I may turn to the yuck factor mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain. I agree that there is an important need to distinguish between the legitimate concerns and the discomfort arising merely from unfamiliarity, a point highlighted very strongly  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1535"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1535</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. Two moral claims have been highlighted as forming part of the yuck factor: the response of the horror of the idea of playing God and the transgression of a fundamental taboo. In some way, the claims are associated with the issues of naturalness; for example, scientists are wrong to attempt to manipulate nature in this way because such manipulation is unnatural. Not only is it very difficult to specify, as highlighted in the very powerful document published by the Academy of Medical Sciences to specify what &#147;unnatural&#148; means, but it is not clear why unnaturalness should be bad. IVF is an unnatural process; vaccination is an unnatural process; but those scientific advances have created modern medicine as we know it today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07120316000054"></a>Amendments Nos. 9 and 16, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, alter the proposed ability, through regulation, to change and to extend the definitions of interspecies embryos, as inserted by Clause 4(2) the Bill. The amendments set a limit on the regulation-making power, such that any new types of interspecies embryo, once included in the Act, would be prohibited from being created. The regulation-making power would provide the future flexibility we need to ensure that the law keeps pace with any technological developments in the creation of part-human, part-animal embryos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07120316000055"></a>A power is also provided in new paragraph 3(5) of Schedule 2 to the 1990 Act, inserted by paragraph 6 of Schedule 2 to the Bill, to permit the HFEA to grant a licence to create, keep and use any form of interspecies embryos. Under new paragraph 3(8), the Secretary of State can further limit the scope of what can be licensed by the HFEA in relation to any new entities. The choice as to whether and how these powers should be exercised would be a decision for Parliament as well, as the regulations are subject to the affirmative procedure. This means that the decision on whether or not to devolve discretion to the HFEA to permit the creation, use and keeping of any form of interspecies embryo not already listed in the Bill can, and rightly should, be made at that time. </p>

The resulting product must be destroyed by the two-cell stage. This test has been performed by many clinics since it was permitted under the 1990 Act, and is a valuable method of assessment without the need to create a human embryo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07120316000059"></a>Amendment No. 42 removes from the Bill the HFEA&#146;s ability to license the storage of interspecies embryos created for research. I have made clear our intentions to permit the creation and use of interspecies embryos in research. This paragraph gives the HFEA the ability to permit the storage of interspecies embryos, which is important for researchers carrying out their day-to-day activity, and vital in creating a complete framework in the regulation for research involving interspecies embryos.</p>

<a name="71203-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07120316000060"></a>On Amendment No. 45, before the HFEA may license research using human embryos under the 1990 Act it must make a judgment that the use of embryos in that specific project of research is necessary. The Bill is proposed to expand this test to research projects involving interspecies embryos, and rightly so. Interspecies embryos should not be used for research lightly or without necessity, so amendments to the 1990 Act made by the Bill must stay in place. I therefore invite the noble Lord, Lord Alton, not to move that amendment.</p>

<a name="71203-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07120316000061"></a>The power provided in new paragraph 3(5) to permit the HFEA to grant research licences to create, keep and use new forms of interspecies embryo is valuable in ensuring that the Act can remain robust following developments in science and technology. This licensing ability of the HFEA regarding these new forms of embryo may, however, be limited by the Secretary of State when any regulation is made. However, power can further limit the scope of what can be licensed by the HFEA regarding these types of embryos. Amendment No. 47 would remove the power proposed for the Secretary of State to limit the licensing by the HFEA of research involving new forms of interspecies embryo. This power is important, as it allows limits to be placed on what can be licensed if any new forms of interspecies embryos are defined in the future. Parliament&#146;s agreement would, however, be necessary as the regulations are subject to affirmative resolution, as I mentioned earlier. This power gives the opportunity to place tougher restrictions, if necessary, on the use of any interspecies embryos appropriate to their qualities and characteristics. This is particularly important if their use could be both scientifically beneficial for one purpose and detrimental for another.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="07120316000062"></a>On Amendment No. 48, the inclusion of interspecies research in new paragraph 3(9) of Schedule 2 to the 1990 Act ensures that the HFEA, when licensing interspecies embryo research, has the ability to make suitable restrictions on the terms of licence. The HFEA has had the ability to do this in relation to embryo research licences since 1990, and it is right that this power is extended to enable the HFEA to provide similar restriction on interspecies embryo research should it need to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07120316000063"></a>On Amendment No. 61, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, we have proposed the same level of regulation and control on the use of interspecies embryos and research throughout the Bill as we have  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1537"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1537</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on the regulation and control of human embryos. The principles of the 1990 Act have worked well, where the often difficult decisions regarding appropriate licensing of embryo research are made by the specialist regulator, the HFEA. The importance of embryo research for the public good, the likelihood of the research in question yielding a useful result and the respect for how necessary the use of interspecies embryos is in that research are all measures by which its necessity can be judged. We have proposed that the use of human or interspecies embryos in research must always satisfy the criterion necessary for that research project, as highlighted by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and that the decision on the necessity must be made by the specialist regulator, which has access to all the available scientific data and the information required to make sound decisions on each licence application.</p>

<a name="71203-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07120316000064"></a>In addition, as set out in the 1990 Act and the 2002 research purposes regulations, the research must also be necessary or desirable for a number of specific areas of research, such as the understanding or treatment of disease. The licensing principles are the same today as they were in 1990, and the HFEA has done an excellent job of licensing research since then. I see no reason to treat the licensing of interspecies embryo research any differently from how we have treated licensing of human embryo research in the past. I invite the noble Lord, Lord Alton, to withdraw his amendment.</p>

In the hamster test, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, the slight difference is that while the moral principle is the same, the use of the hamster test is clinical; it is not strictly a research procedure. That is why there will be no licences for it; it is something that clinics would declare during a routine inspection by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, and it would not necessarily be subject to a licence application.</p>

We disagreed then about the advantages of carrying out therapeutic cloning. The right reverend and noble Lord said then that it would&#151;I use his exact phrase&#151;&#147;be illicit&#148; to use human embryos if alternatives exist. That has come out in the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, which is in some respect a paving amendment for the next group of amendments concerning the so-called Hunt test&#151;the words that the Minister used in 2000 that if alternatives exist, it would not be right to use human embryos.</p>

My noble friend Lord Patel is right to say that huge advances are being made. He said that science is moving on at a dramatic pace and that those advances appear to be taking place mainly through the use of adult stem cells. My noble friend has claimed that there would eventually be a problem of cancer with induced pluripotent stem cells from Japan, despite the announcement made on Friday last. I hope that he would acknowledge that all human embryonic stem cells caused a specific type of tumour&#151;indeed, that is how embryonic stem cell scientists find out whether they have isolated true embryonic stem cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="07120320000003"></a>I return to an issue that I raised on Second Reading: what I then dubbed the Hunt test, which I hope will be incorporated into the granting of all licences. In the debate in your Lordships' House in 2001, the then Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="07120320000064"></a>&#147;the 1990 Act already provides the answer to the question of what happens if and when research into adult cells overtakes research using embryos: embryonic research would have to stop because the use of embryos would no longer be necessary for that research&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/1/01; col. 120.]</ul>
<p><a name="07120320000052"></a>In another place, the Minister said in debate that the HFEA,</p>
<ul><a name="07120320000065"></a>&#147;must satisfy itself that there is no other way of doing the research, avoiding embryo use&#148;&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/12/00; col. 214.]</ul>
<p><a name="07120320000053"></a>That point was alluded to by my noble and right reverend friend Lord Harris of Pentregarth in our previous debate.</p>

<a name="71203-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="07120320000004"></a>Accordingly, I propose Amendments Nos. 44 and 46 to ensure that licences may be granted only when applicants can prove that no alternative is available and to encourage the best substantiated scientific research. They will also bring the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act in line with paragraph 8(3) of the International Society for Stem Cell Research guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="07120320000061"></a>&#147;The project proposal should include a discussion of alternative methods, and provide a rationale for employing the requested human materials, the proposed methodology and for performing the experiments in a human rather than an animal model system&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71203-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="07120320000005"></a>Although the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, has tried to offer assurances that current legislation and regulation are in accordance with the International Society for Stem Cell Research and the World Medical Association&#146;s declaration of Helsinki, I remain to be convinced that all is necessarily as it should be. Paragraph 11 of the declaration of Helsinki states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="07120320000062"></a>&#147;Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120320000054"></a>Can any Member of the Committee demonstrate how the shifting rationale underlying currently licensed human cloning research fits those criteria? By way of example, initially, Licence R0152 was stated to be for the treatment of diabetes, then for no particular disease, then again for the study of diabetes and now, apparently, for general transplantation purposes.</p>

<a name="71203-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="07120320000006"></a>In a Written Answer, the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, asserted that somatic cell nuclear transfer,</p>
<ul><a name="07120320000066"></a>&#147;is considered to hold great promise for the development of patient-specific stem cell therapies, which may overcome the problems of immune rejection that would otherwise prove a barrier to the use of transplanted stem cells&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/11/07; col. <I>WA</I><I> 2</I>.].</ul>
<p><a name="07120320000055"></a>At present, there is understandable excitement about whether direct reprogramming of human skin cells might ultimately achieve the same goal, and particularly about the work of Professor Yamanaka in Japan. In June 2007, three publications heralded the successful creation of embryonic-like cells from  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1541"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1541</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>adult stem cells. Within the past month, no fewer than three further publications have shown that the same approach is feasible in directly reprogramming human cells. It remains to be seen how much work might lead to specific therapies, but there are grounds for optimism as well as caution. By contrast, I was surprised to discover that no similar supporting references were provided in a reply to a subsequent Question for Written Answer in which I asked,</p>
<ul><a name="07120320000067"></a>&#147;which empirical studies in either humans or other species have conclusively demonstrated the benefits of human somatic cell nuclear transfer with regard to therapies that overcome the problems of immune rejection with patient-specific embryonic stem cells&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 26/11/07; col. <I>WA</I><I> 9</I><I>8</I>.].</ul>
<a name="71203-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="07120320000007"></a>This question is especially pertinent when the research in question is now diverting &#163;760,000 of public funding so that women might be persuaded to provide around 700 precious eggs that otherwise might be used for their own fertility treatment. If such research with human subjects requires financial inducements and the underlying rationale may not be unequivocally supported by scientific literature and prior animal experimentation, how does it accord with international standards? This is especially curious in the light of oral evidence given to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee by the chief executive of the Medical Research Council on 5 February 2007, which was published as House of Commons Papers HC 272-l. He expressed doubt about support for the use of human oocytes for somatic nuclear transfer due to the virtually zero success rate. Bearing in mind the alternatives pursued in other countries, with which some of our leading scientists now hope to catch up, it seems fair to ask what could conceivably be accomplished with human cloning that could not possibly be achieved by other approaches. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us and will say which other countries permit interspecies human embryos.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="07120320000008"></a><I>Forbes</I> magazine, which is hardly interested in ethical objections, recommends that investors do not do what the British Government have done.

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="07120320000015"></a>Listening to the noble Lord, I am reminded that in my own laboratory a remarkable experiment has been done by one of my colleagues, Ellen Poon. She is one of my post-doctoral research workers and has been working on genes that direct differentiation in completely surprising fashions. Her work would not have arisen without the use of embryonic material, under licence, of course. Most of the embryos that she has been using are defunct. They would not be regarded as being suitable for transfer on the grounds of their morphological appearance. Under the microscope they look completely dead or inactive and are not undergoing cell growth. We are about to publish a paper. We have not yet got it approved by a journal, but I think it will be accepted because it is a good piece of experimental

When we take cells from these embryos, we can get stem cells that express in quite a surprising way exactly the genes that are wanted. Basic research does not necessarily arrive at foregone conclusions. One does not know where the exciting things may develop. If Ellen is right&#151;and I have watched her work very carefully&#151;using effectively non-viable embryos surprisingly might give rise to stem cells. This kind of amendment would prevent that, which would be a pity.</p>

I speak only with some second-hand knowledge. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, tries to promote in all these amendments his wish that&#151;and he truly believes in it: I respect that&#151;the only form of stem cell research we should allow is that based on adult stem cells, or, now, pluripotent stem cells derived from adult cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="07120320000019"></a>I accept that both these lines seem enormously promising. What I do not accept is that any other form of stem cell research, including particularly embryonic stem cell, does not seem to have much future. The noble Lord may well be right, but just now he has to accept that the fundamental research is done on embryonic stem cells. I repeat: these are chromosomally normal cells present in early blastocysts that have the capacity to differentiate in all 257 types of human cells. None of the other cells has the same pluripotency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="07120320000021"></a>I refer to the noble Lord&#146;s Amendment No. 46. In paragraph (b) he proposes that much of the interspecies embryo research could not be done solely in animal models. The whole purpose of interspecies embryo work is to be able to develop disease because many diseases are specific to humans; they do not occur in animals. The point of much of the research is

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="07120320000022"></a>I may be able to accept paragraph (c) but I will have to discuss it further. Paragraph (d) states that,</p>
<ul><a name="07120320000068"></a>&#147;the research method proposed is most likely to produce satisfactory results&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120320000057"></a>That is too high a standard for any research project. Not just in biological science but in any kind of science it would be unusual to have this degree of confidence in likely results in any research. That is the nature of research.</p>

<a name="71203-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="07120320000023"></a>While I am on my feet, I say to the noble Lord that while we can get very excited about induced pluripotent cells, we must remember that what we are saying is that, as my noble friend Lord Walton said, inserting viral vectors into the cells makes them differentiate and become pluripotent cells which carry these vectors with them. As I said earlier, even Yamanaka in his paper says that they had at least 20 insertions per cell. If you work out the mathematics, that means for a cell not to have an insertion would require 10 million cells. To get that is a tall task.</p>

<a name="71203-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="07120320000024"></a>Furthermore, perhaps I may say to the noble Lord that to be able to understand that these cells are truly pluripotent in the same way that embryonic stem cells are, he or any scientist would have to take them down to a blastocyst stage. That blastocyst is an embryo in every respect, and, if implanted, would be a clone of where the adult cell came from. Therefore, it too might need regulating.</p>

For the sake of clarity and for the information of the Committee, when a research licence committee looks at a research licence application, the application has to say roughly how many embryos will be used. It may be 100, 200 or whatever. But I do not possibly see how the noble Lord gets this figure of 2 million embryos. It may also reassure the noble Lord that paragraph (b) of Amendment No. 46 already has to be considered in all research licence applications. They have to show that appropriate work on animals has been done before saying it is now an appropriate stage to move to try to do something in relation to humans.</p>

These licences have been issued only where the authority believes that the use of embryos  is necessary. That is a requirement of the Act, a requirement which would be kept through the provision in the Bill.</p>

<a name="71203-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="07120320000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, suggested a further three criteria of which the HFEA must be satisfied before it licenses embryo or interspecies embryo research. The first is the requirement that research should already have been successfully attempted using animal models. In order for the use of embryos to be necessary, the research should have a firm base on which the project is founded. This could be data from animal embryo research or data from research conducted through other means.</p>

<a name="71203-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="07120320000030"></a>Human physiology and genetics are close enough to some animals for them to provide good models on which to test research methodologies. However, the differences which are present can mean that research which works well in an animal model does not work in humans. This principle can also work in the other direction, and we may fail to get satisfactory results in animal research where clear successes occur in humans. Animal research is vital to a better understanding of embryology and stem cell biology, but research using human embryos must not be limited to being undertaken only in cases where animal models have shown success. The authority will make decisions on the necessity of the use of human or interspecies embryos in research projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="07120320000031"></a>Secondly, there is the requirement that research cannot be satisfactorily achieved by means other than through embryo research. Among the many aims of research on embryos and, in the future, interspecies embryos, one particular aim is to benefit the development of disease models and treatments primarily through the use of stem cells. Human stem cells can be obtained from many sources, as highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, including stem cells, cells sourced from the adult body, from embryos, from umbilical cord blood and, in recent developments, by the manipulation of normal human cells, so-called cell programming.</p>

<a name="71203-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07120320000032"></a>Each of these lines of research holds out a promise to the sufferers of many wide-ranging diseases and medical conditions. We should not limit ourselves regarding the avenues in which research should be undertaken in the hope of cures. Embryo research, for example, provided vital pieces of the puzzle which allowed researchers to begin exploring how to perform cell reprogramming. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Patel, that limiting embryo research only to goals which cannot be reached by other means is not appropriate if we are to succeed in curing many presently incurable diseases. All avenues of research that have the aim of achieving the same goal should be allowed to flourish in the hope one day of making better the lives of those suffering today.</p>

Nor should we forget the peer-review process of funding for the project. Available evidence will be examined to assess the validity of research through a depth of evidence, and can equally be good justification for following an avenue of research.</p>

<a name="71203-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07120320000034"></a>Not all research is successful. In fact, researchers in almost every field of science undertake significant research to yield only a few positive results. The results, however, are significant. A specialist regulator is in place to assess the necessity of each embryo research project, and legislation has set out which scientific goals are suitable for embryo research. Such goals include the treatment of disease. This system has worked well in the past, and is the best arrangement that we can hope for to permit embryo and interspecies embryo research while ensuring that the special status of the embryo is upheld. I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I shall return to this issue on Report, because it is a fundamental question. I draw noble Lords&#146; attention to paragraph (c) in my Amendment No. 46, which says,</p>
<ul><a name="07120320000069"></a>&#147;that the research specified in the licence cannot be achieved satisfactorily by any other reasonably practicable method not entailing the use of embryos or inter-species embryos&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120320000058"></a>That is the crux of the debate. If it is possible for my noble friends Lord Patel and Lord Walton, or the noble Lord, Lord Winston, to demonstrate satisfactorily to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority that alternatives exist, they could proceed under the terms of the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07120320000036"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, reminded us of something that he said earlier when he questioned the work of Professor Yamanaka and the need for 20 vectors to expedite that work. However, compared with the more than 200 attempts that Professor Wilmut had to make to clone Dolly the sheep, that seems to be rather better and more effective. I said earlier that we should exercise caution as well as optimism. Importantly, extraordinary alternatives are emerging that do not need to use human embryos. This creates some middle ground in the debate, and I am sorry that more Members of the Committee have not attempted to stand on that middle ground.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07120320000037"></a>I was struck by a comment by Professor Neil Scolding, who is professor of neuroscience at the University of Bristol at Frenchay Hospital, when he gave evidence to the Joint Committee and was asked what he thought was driving this determination to have interspecies embryos and to create more human embryos. I dispute the figure given by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. The figures that I have been using have been based on replies that I have been given in your Lordships&#146; House about the numbers of embryos that have been destroyed or experimented on. That is the point&#151;not the figure given by the noble Earl, which in turn was given to him by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Professor Scolding&#146;s point was that mere

If mere scientific curiosity, admirable though that may be, is really what is driving the debate, surely we have a duty to say that other factors must be held to account.</p>

<a name="71203-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07120320000038"></a>I was surprised to hear the noble Lord, Lord Patel, say that producing satisfactory results, which this amendment would require, is too high a hurdle. In the world in which I work and live, one is expected to give some evidence that the line of inquiry pursued, certainly where public resources are being used, should have to have some reasonable outcome in order to justify continuing with it. I shall return to this issue, but I have two other points to make before I conclude.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07120320000039"></a>My noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant said that there would be no immunological reaction if the cells were transplanted into the patient. I refer him to an article in <I>Methods in Enzymology</I>, volume 260, in which it was discovered that mitochondria can cause an immune reaction. Would not the animal mitochondria that would be present in these cells therefore be likely to cause an even greater immune reaction? The noble Lord, Lord Winston, intervened on the issue of the hamster test and said, if I understood him correctly, that you do not need a licence for the hamster test if it is for treatment rather than for research. I do not understand this, and I hope that the Minister will&#151;</p>

That is my understanding. I cannot prove it, but I believe that that is right.</p>

The noble Earl, Lord Howe, pointed out that 83,000 registered embryos have been used for research. However, in vitro fertilisation, as I pointed out, destroys a large number of embryos that cannot be used for fertility treatment. Sadly, they are not researched. It would be helpful if they were. I  think it would be ethically justified&#151;ethically a good thing&#151;if we encouraged more research, but that is my personal opinion.</p>

I will also argue that we need more balanced representation on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, argued earlier in our proceedings, that we should establish a national bioethics committee.</p>

I am told that you need a licence to use the hamster test for treatment as well as for research. Paragraph 9(1)(f) of Schedule 2 to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 specifies that you need a licence for both research and treatment, so I wonder whether we could have clarification on that as the debate unfolds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07120326000002"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: The amendment seeks to delete the last provision in the present definition of interspecies embryos in the Bill. Let me rehearse briefly some of the history of this matter. When the Bill came before the Joint Committee in draft form it had specific examples of interspecies embryos like the ones presently in the Bill, and a final provision which the department described as a &#147;catch-all&#148;. In other words, if you took them all together you had a complete description of what was meant by interspecies embryo.</p>

<a name="71203-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07120326000003"></a>The difficulty of that situation was that the scientific witnesses who were asked to comment on the catch-all provision found great difficulty in understanding it. I have not been able to find out exactly who thought it up&#151;indeed I have not really inquired&#151;but that is the way that the scientists viewed it. So it was not at all surprising, when the Government came to publish their Bill, that that provision had disappeared. We had suggested that the way to approach this matter was to look for a general definition of interspecies embryos, stating what their characteristics were and defining them in that way, rather than by a list of examples and then the difficult catch-all which was found to be impractical.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07120326000004"></a>What has now happened is that the Government have not come forward with another catch-all provision but have taken refuge in a power to add to the list of things which amount to an interspecies embryo,</p>
<ul><a name="07120326000040"></a>&#147;such other thing as may be specified in regulations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120326000030"></a>Whatever you have to say about that, it is a fairly all-embracing kind of definition; the regulation-making power does not seem to be extremely restricted.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07120326000005"></a>When we are talking about interspecies embryos, as many Members of the Committee were doing earlier, it is essential to know what it is we are talking about. The interspecies embryos that the Government are seeking to capture, if that is the right word, in the Bill were described by the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, in his reply at Second Reading as the &#147;human end of the spectrum&#148;&#151;I think that that was his phrase&#151;of interspecies embryos. That immediately suggests that there is more to the spectrum than is intended to be captured by this definition&#151;and, of course, we do not have far to go to find some examples.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07120326000006"></a>I had understood, rather vaguely, that the Secretary of State for the Home Department regulated this, but, with the great help that I received from officials of the noble Lord&#146;s department, I have examined this issue a little more fully. It seemed to me that if we could not get a catch-all provision, we could have a general provision and then extract from it what had already been given to the Secretary of State for the Home Department. That would make a perfectly reasonable type of definition also and I was anxious to see how that could be fitted into the scheme.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07120326000007"></a>The answer is that it does not fit at all. The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 proceeds by requiring licences for animal experimentation that causes distress, pain or harm to the animals that are the subject of the legislation. The embryo of an animal does not come under the protection of that legislation until it is half-way along the gestation period for that particular animal, unless it be an animal that does not have that kind of characteristic and then it is when it first qualifies for independent feeding. So it is not captured by the Home Office legislation unless and until it is of a half-gestation period and only if it is an animal embryo.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07120326000008"></a>I believe that an interspecies embryo which starts off being an animal embryo and has human material inserted into it in some way or other is no longer the embryo of that animal. If that is right&#151;and that, I think, was the hypothesis of the answer given to the Joint Committee to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred&#151;the result is that interspecies embryos are not regulated at all if they come from that end of the spectrum. They may of course attract regulation if they were to be implanted in an animal, as that would be a part of the procedure which would require a licence, but if nothing like that happens, then as far as I can see there is no regulation of these at all. I do not find that a very satisfactory situation.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07120326000009"></a>The split between what I might call &#147;the human end of the spectrum&#148; and &#147;the animal end of the spectrum&#148; is rather hard to define. When the working group of the association met to consider these matters it decided that the Bill with which we are concerned should aim to capture human embryos treated with animal material, leaving out animal embryos treated with human material. That was its broad definition, and basically that is what was reflected in the draft Bill and in the Bill before us. However, it is not satisfactory. Indeed, in some ways, we are in a position rather like the one we were in before the  1990 Act became law. Everyone felt that the embryo research and in vitro fertilisation should be the subject of control and there was unanimity that some regulation was required. The only dispute was what that regulation should be. In particular, the main dispute was whether research on the embryo up to the 14-days or primitive-streak stage should be allowed.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07120326000010"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, and those of a like mind who have spoken in the previous debates on these ethical issues, would think it right that this area of interspecies embryos should be regulated, but the question is what that regulation should be. From what  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1551"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1551</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I have learnt up to now&#151;and I am always in the learning process&#151;the kind of regulation you want at the human end partakes of an extension of the regulation of the human embryos that the HFEA was set up to supervise and carry on. But there is no corresponding control at the other end. If that is the way of the situation, it is extremely important that the definition should specify where the human part of the spectrum ends.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07120326000011"></a>We have had some communication with experts in this area and my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding will speak about that. The parts of the scientific community that are interested in this field have seen the problem and are seeking to address it. They are better qualified than I am to provide an answer, although we tried to do so in the Joint Committee&#146;s report. We realised that it was not perfect, but then no research is. As we have just heard, you cannot say it is perfect in advance; you can only do that once it has happened.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07120326000012"></a>We did our best, but the Government felt that that was not good enough and have proposed this route instead. It is not right to leave this important area of regulation in this vague state, with a ministerial power to say what the definition really is. The noble Lord, Lord Darzi, said at Second Reading that that gave flexibility. I entirely accept that it does, but flexibility is inappropriate at the point of definition. When you want to regulate something, I submit that it is vital that the area to be regulated is clearly defined. It is about as mad to have flexibility in that area as it would be to have flexibility in a fence around an animal enclosure. Flexibility is very useful, and Ministers&#151;myself included&#151;have often invoked it in support of powers of various kinds, but I respectfully suggest to your Lordships that it is not appropriate when it comes to defining an area of concept and research as important as this, where there are ethical principles to be followed that are already in the 1990 Act and will be continued in the licensing of this type of interspecies embryo, should it be allowed under provisions similar to those in the Bill.

<p><a name="07120326000033"></a>Anyone who has been in government and has had to deal with the Home Office will recognise that completely. The Home Office has always had a strong instinct to defend its boundaries. That has been its culture. I suspect that the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, will find that for himself if he has to try to sort out how we will deal with this in the context of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07120326000015"></a>As my noble and learned friend has said, I have been in touch with one of our principal witnesses, Professor Martin Bobrow, who chaired the committee of the Academy of Medical Sciences and gave us valuable evidence on how the medical scientific world views this difficulty. In answer to my noble and learned friend, Professor Bobrow said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25"></a><a name="07120326000039"></a>&#147;The idea of a single, general definition is very attractive. The problem for me in this area is that we do have this bifid system where we regulate animals and things that come from an animal in one way and things that start as human in another way. We are trying to deal with the meeting of it&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120326000034"></a>He then went on to comment on the amendment that my noble and learned friend had put to him.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07120326000016"></a>It is clear that at the moment we are in a difficult and unsatisfactory situation. My first proposition is that it is for the Government to sort this out. If the Bill says &#147;the Secretary of State&#148;, the convention is that that means any Secretary of State&#151;including, of course, the Home Secretary&#151;not just the Secretary of State for Health. That is the pattern of the legislation. It rests firmly upon the Government to find a solution to the problem, otherwise the regulators will find great difficulty, as my noble and learned friend has said, in knowing what to regulate.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07120326000017"></a>Professor Bobrow, with whom I have had a long discussion today, said that the Academy of Medical Sciences has been sympathetic to a suggestion, made some while ago, that early in the new year a workshop should be convened, followed by a new working party to consider the status of animal embryos with some human admixture. That would allow widespread debate and perhaps deliver some new thoughts into the discussion about the definition of what constitutes a human embryo. That, of course, is the question. What is &#147;human&#148;? We are very concerned to defend humanity in this. The reason why we attach such importance to the embryo is that it is human. The profession is now going to sit and work on that. It will not be just the academy; it will be the Medical

The question is: will they do it in time for Parliament to be able to amend the Bill? In other words, it may well be that a regulation-making power of the sort contained in this clause will be the only way to deal with it. However, I hope the Minister can give us an assurance that his officials will work closely with the Academy of Medical Sciences and the others in order that they may proceed in tandem and learn from each other. It is abundantly clear that this is not a problem that can be left to drift.</p>

I draw the attention of the Committee to one aspect of this in the research area. True stem cells, at best, are totipotent; that is, they can develop into any one of numerous cell types&#151;in the case of the human body, it is about 220 different cell types. There are various degrees of potency. Some stem cells are pluripotent, which means that they can develop into many tissues, but not all. Some stem cells&#151;mostly, it seems, from adult sources&#151;have even more limited potential and can grow only into certain tissue types.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07120326000021"></a>There are many ways of assessing a stem cell&#146;s potency for further development. One can look at the genes which the cells produce and get some idea of how they are likely to progress if allowed to differentiate into different tissues. One can look at the tissues which are produced in vitro in the laboratory, to see whether one is developing nerve cells, muscle cells, heart cells and so on. However, one of the best tests&#151;it is almost the prime test, and the one that has been most used in the literature and the most valuable&#151;is to mix stem cells with an animal embryo, usually that of a mouse, to see what happens to the human cells during that animal&#146;s development, which is then sacrificed either before gestation has finished or shortly afterwards.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07120326000022"></a>The classic experiments have allowed it to be established that good stem cells, which one really might want to use, can be incorporated in a wide range of tissues&#151;liver, spleen, kidney, brain, heart and so on. This is without doubt an extremely valuable test. The question is whether it would continue to be a viable possibility for experimenters in this country who look at stem cells in the future. It would seem to me very important that it does; there

<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07120326000024"></a>I remind your Lordships that a number of scientific research projects are banging on the door and wanting permission to use cytoplasmic hybrids for the reasons which we have discussed previously; that is, taking out the nucleus of an animal egg and replacing it with the nucleus from an adult human cell. The HFEA has received scientific and legal advice that this is a human embryo from the standpoint of the 1990 Act. It is very different from the other kinds of human-animal hybrids&#151;the so-called true hybrids&#151;which have all been brought together in this definition. I wonder whether a way forward might not be to ensure that the question of cytoplasmic hybrids should be in the Bill so that the House&#146;s opinion on it can be tested. Scientists would welcome the opinion of this House and the House of Commons. The suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, of a workshop to look into other forms of hybrids should be pursued, because, as two other noble Lords have suggested, we have not yet had a proper moral compass on them. As far as cytoplasmic hybrids are concerned, the HFEA has received scientific and legal advice that they are human embryos from the standpoint of the 1990 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07120326000027"></a>Secondly, although I am no expert in these medical and ethical issues, it strikes me that if the noble Lord has his way and line 35 appears on the statute book when the Bill passes into law, it would be possible for him or one of his colleagues in the Department of Health to come forward with a regulation in some future year, notwithstanding the fact that there has been an enormous amount of regulatory angst and philosophical discussion about the ethical position of this or that outside your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

My professional friend, the noble Lord, Lord Winston, spoke about the tests. The test of a stem cell&#146;s pluripotency would apply also to induced pluripotent cells. They would have to be tested for efficacy by using that kind of test&#151;and that is the standard test. One cannot conduct such chimera tests in humans; they have to be done in animals, using human stem cells.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07120326000029"></a>I agree with my noble and right reverend friend Lord Harries of Pentregarth that what scientists are seeking is to use cytoplasmic hybrid embryos. As I said previously, the transfer of a somatic adult cell nucleus into an animal egg from which the nucleus is removed&#151;it might even be possible to remove mitochondria, but that is a separate discussion&#151;and removal of the stem cells from early blastocysts is  99.9 per cent, if not 100 per cent, human DNA. In that respect, as my noble and right reverend friend said, it could be regarded as a human embryo. To produce stem cell lines that carry the disease genes that occur in humans, but not in animals, is what scientists are seeking to do. These stem cells are useful in testing how these diseases developed and how to change these chromosomes by genetic manipulation. They are used also in future drug development. Avastin was developed by using such experiments, as my noble friend Lord Winston described.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07120328000005"></a>It is highly unsatisfactory that in debating a subject as sensitive and difficult as interspecies embryos we have no clear idea of what kinds of embryo are capable of falling under that heading. Like my noble and learned friend, I am distinctly uncomfortable about giving the Secretary of State a broad order-making power to widen the scope of new Section 4A, even under the affirmative procedure. It would be better to omit that provision altogether than to have the current lack of clarity about the definition, difficult as it may be to come up with such a definition.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07120328000006"></a>At the same time, I am conscious that the creation of interspecies embryos is permitted, and has indeed been authorised, under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. As my noble friend Lord Jenkin pointed out, the thrust of that Act has little to do with embryology as such; it is about minimising suffering in animals that are used for medical research. The Act, almost by default, allows for a wide range of experimentation involving animal embryos to which human genetic material has been added. It appears also to regulate only those procedures involving so-called protected animals, which are defined in the Bill. Animals that do not fall within the scope of this definition are not subject to regulation when it comes to research. The question of when an animal embryo ceases to be an animal embryo and becomes human is equally not addressed in the Act. It leaves us as bereft of a definition of interspecies embryo as does this Bill. That cannot be satisfactory in an area of law as important as this.</p>

<a name="71203-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07120328000007"></a>I am particularly worried about the scope that there appears to be in the 1986 Act to authorise research that involves bringing hybrid creatures to maturity inside the womb of an animal, a process that this Bill would explicitly ban in relation to an interspecies embryo in any of the forms listed in new Section 4A. We have read about transgenic mice that are bred using human genetic material, including the mouse on which a human ear was made to grow. I am not condemning that kind of experiment, which may well carry the potential for enormous good, but it takes us close to an area with which most of us would,

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07120328000008"></a>What is the acceptable time limit for propagating animal-human hybrid embryos in the laboratory? For hybrids that are at least 50 per cent human, this Bill says that the limit should be the earlier of 14 days or the appearance of the primitive streak. But for animal-human hybrids&#151;that is to say, hybrids that are predominantly animal but partly human&#151;the current law is a lot less restrictive, especially for animals that do not fall within the definition of protected animals. What are we to think about that? These are major questions on which we currently have no guidance at all.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26"></a><a name="07120328000117"></a>&#147;There is no principle, as such, which underpins the Government's choice of 50% as a cut-off point for whether an entity is sufficiently human to merit regulation by the HFEA, or whether it is more appropriately regulated as an animal by the Home Office. The 50% rule is essentially an arbitrary attempt to draw a line between what qualifies as human and what as animal&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120328000010"></a>That indeed is the nub of the problem and, to be frank, it does not make life any easier to be told by the Government that the definition of interspecies embryo proposed by the Joint Committee will not do because it would sweep up within it various sorts of scientific procedure currently overseen by the Home Office. The retort to that is surely that the regulatory structures ought to follow the ethical principle rather than the other way round. If it is not possible to distinguish the ethic status of something that is 99 per cent human from that of something that is 49 per cent human, we are bound to question whether the dual arrangement for research approvals makes proper sense.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07120328000011"></a>The Government&#146;s adherence to the dual arrangement would be more tenable in practice were it possible to predict in advance that an entity would be, say, 20 per cent human on the basis that it begins as 20 per cent human. But, unfortunately, as Dr Robin Lovell-Badge told the Joint Committee, things are not as neat as that, since, in his words, you may,</p>

We have to deal with that, and the Government and Parliament need to approve a legal architecture that would straddle all types of interspecies embryo&#151;an architecture that rests on the foundations of ethics and science and which has clear guidelines but which allows for a sensible degree of autonomy by the regulator in taking decisions.

Even if the work were not banned, introducing additional regulations would be a major setback for the speed at which such research could progress. The noble Earl may correct me if I am wrong, but the amendment would prohibit two extremely valuable approaches. One is the use of transgenic animals, which is currently allowable under Home Office licence and fundamental to biomedical research. Testing the pluripotency of stem cells, as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, mentioned, is critical for realising the therapeutic potential of stem cells, not only embryonic stem cells. Even more so, it will be needed for induced pluripotent stem cells.</p>

Other examples include mice generated with a human immune system&#151;so-called huMAb mice. These mice have been used to address a variety of research questions but also to generate humanised monoclonal antibodies, which are increasingly utilised to produce antibody-based drugs, such as the cancer treatment I mentioned earlier, Avastin.</p>

Determining pluripotency&#151;a cell&#146;s ability to form all the body&#146;s cell lineages, a defining feature of stem cells&#151;is an important step in deriving ES cells. My noble friend Lord Winston mentioned that. The most effective method is, as he said, to determine their ability to participate in normal embryonic development after reintroduction into blastocyst stage mouse embryos, which are then implanted into the uterus of receptive female mice&#151;so-called surrogate mother mice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07120328000021"></a>The creation of transgenic animals, including those incorporating human DNA, is regulated by the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures)  Act 1986. An animal comes under the remit of that Act at the end point of gestation. Research involving protected animals&#151;all vertebrates, excluding humans but including octopi&#151;including transgenic animals,  is subject to licence by the Secretary of State for  the Home Office under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Section 2 of the Act includes within the definition any protected animal from the midpoint of the gestation or incubation period for the relevant species.</p>

There is no legislation that specifically applies to research involving non-human embryo in vitro, but the 1986 Act applies to any procedure involving a living animal&#151;for example, the hormonal stimulation of oocyte maturation for implantation of a blastocyst as well as the production or breeding of any genetically altered animal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07120328000023"></a>All the scientific agencies&#151;not only the MRC, but the BBSRC&#151;are concerned about this amendment. Examples of the BBSRC&#146;s work include the use of farm animals to generate large quantities of human protein to treat specific human diseases. This has been possible through the incorporation of human genes into fertilised sheep eggs. Examples are alpha-1-antitrypsin, with a specific promoter region so that the gene is expressed in a mammary gland. When the egg is implanted, it develops into a transgenic sheep and when the gene is expressed the protein is secreted in milk and can be harvested to be used to treat emphysema, for example. A similar approach has been adopted with the human blood-clotting factor VIII expressed in sheep's milk for haemophiliacs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07120328000024"></a>Transgenic research on mice has now become an important technological approach to study the role of deleted genes and added human genes. There are many examples that I could quote. Briefly, this amendment will affect a significant amount of current medical research funded by all research agencies. I believe that such research is already regulated through the animal regulation Act.</p>

That is a misunderstanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07120328000029"></a>As I said on the previous amendment, the test for a cell&#146;s potential to develop into other tissues is one that we must consider carefully. We might argue that any animals that are so produced should be destroyed before they become viable, or at least should not be allowed to breed. That might help the Committee; it might be a way of looking at that in the future. However, transgenic animals must be allowed to breed. Without that breeding process, one will not understand the basis of functional genetics, which, as I say, is such a significant advance in every field of medicine and one which is accepted in every country; even countries that are querulous about in vitro fertilisation accept this kind of animal research as being a sine qua non of good biology.</p>

However, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, pointed out, we can never be sure that new techniques will not be developed in the future or that new forms of human-animal embryos will not be developed that may also need to be regulated under the 1990 Act. Therefore, the problem of definition is an issue.</p>

<a name="71203-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07120328000037"></a>I refer to a letter sent over the weekend by Professor Bobrow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="07120328000118"></a>&#147;The Scrutiny Committee&#146;s final report acknowledged the limitations of the proposed definition. Following publication, the Academy liaised extensively with the Department of Health, to see if we could refine the Scrutiny Committee&#146;s definition to avoid the problems outlined above. This involved a great deal of e-mail correspondence and a meeting hosted by the Wellcome Trust on 7 August attended by representatives from the Academy, MRC, Royal Society, Wellcome Trust and Department of Health. Despite considerable efforts, we were unable to draft a satisfactory general definition of an ISE&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="07120328000113"></a>interspecies embryo&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07120328000121"></a>&#147;and concluded that, even with more time, we were unlikely to reach a viable solution. We agreed that a regulation-making power, allowing the list of definitions to be expanded as necessary in the light of new research methods and findings, to be the preferable option&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120328000114"></a>That is the scrutiny of the scientific committee. I come back to the point raised about regulation. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, asked who would regulate interspecies embryos. The regulations in question would be for the House to debate in the form of an affirmative resolution.</p>

<a name="71203-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07120328000038"></a>Amendment No. 19, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, seeks to insert new provisions into the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to regulate the placing in an animal of an embryo altered by the introduction of any elements derived from human cells and seeks to create an associated regulation-making power. In so far as it applies to the placing of embryos into recipient animals already protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, it adds nothing new to the existing provisions of that Act and is redundant. However, the amendment, as worded, also seeks to regulate the placing of an embryo into recipient animals other than those protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.</p>

<a name="71203-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07120328000039"></a>The 1986 Act defines a &#147;protected animal&#148; as any living vertebrate, other than man and one invertebrate species, Octopus vulgaris. Unprotected animals therefore comprise man and all invertebrates other than Octopus vulgaris. This would vastly extend the reach of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. As the noble Lord, Lord Patel, pointed out, the generation of transgenic animals containing human DNA has become a common technique to study both basic and applied human biology. It forms an important part of modern medical research. Any additional regulation would be an unnecessary burden in cost and time for researchers and regulators and would have little or no additional benefits for animal welfare. It would be contrary to the Government's better regulation agenda.</p>

As with Amendment No. 19, in so far as it applies to keeping or using embryos of animals already protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986&#151;other than creating a requirement to restate in regulations the criteria on which the relevant licences are granted&#151;the amendment adds nothing new to the existing provisions and protections afforded by that Act and is redundant.

Instead, he wanted to see the money used for expanding provision for those who had never before been to university.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07120328000052"></a>The announcement came without any consultation with those involved. There is a consultation exercise taking place now, finishing at the end of this week, on 7 December, which makes this debate apposite. It is clear from discussions taking place that Ministers have made their decision and that, although they are listening through the consultation exercise, they do not intend to change much substantively.</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07120328000053"></a>The problem has been dubbed the ELQ problem&#151;equivalent or lower qualification problem&#151;and it has caused considerable furore in the higher education and further education worlds. The number wishing to speak in tonight&#146;s short debate is a good illustration of that. The Secretary of State&#146;s argument is that it is a matter of allocating scarce resources in a fair way. There is no bottomless pit to fund higher education, and government priorities lie with getting as many as possible up to degree level to meet the challenging Leitch target of 40 per cent of the working population with degrees by 2020. That &#163;100 million will finance some 10,000 full-time university students, more if they are part-timers or foundation degree students. Why should those students be denied university places in favour of students on whom the state has already spent some &#163;15,000 or &#163;20,000 in higher education provision?</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07120328000054"></a>Put that way, it is difficult to fault the logic. None of us would argue that there are unlimited resources; trade-offs have to be made, and on the face of it those who have already had considerable resources lavished upon them should not take priority over others who are knocking on the door of higher education wanting to get in. Yet there are good reasons to reject this proposition. First, it is not obvious that there are at present many knocking on the door of higher education and being denied entry. On the contrary, most of those with the relevant qualifications are found places, while the falling secondary school rolls mean that the number of teenagers coming forward in the next few years will free up places for adults. The hope is, of course, that with all the Leitch initiatives there will be an increasing number of adults coming forward to fill those places, but until they begin to emerge, is it right to make these cuts?</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07120328000055"></a>There are also questions of cost-effectiveness and, perhaps even more, unintended consequences. Maybe there will be places for 10,000 extra full-time students, but the Open University alone reckons that it is going to lose 29,000 of its 120,000 students as a result of the changes. As Brenda Gourley, its vice-chancellor, remarked to me, &#147;That is three medium-sized universities. Is that really what the Government intended?&#148;. That is not all. In many universities, particularly the post-1992 universities, all part-time courses have a fair number of participants who are taking second qualifications. One such university reckoned that 60 per cent of its 450 full-time equivalent numbers in its centre for  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1565"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1565</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lifelong learning were such. Losing those students will make those part-time, often evening, courses non-viable and the universities will be forced to close them down. That illustrates all too well the unintended consequences of taking decisions without prior proper consultation. In any case, it sits oddly with the Leitch agenda, which encourages upskilling and reskilling to meet the challenges of global competition.</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07120328000056"></a>Most people would reckon that the shelf life of a bachelor&#146;s degree is about 15 years and, in any case many recognise, even when they graduate, that had they had better advice they might have chosen a very different undergraduate degree. Overall, the proposals privilege the young and those with employer support and disadvantage those over 25 who want to choose their own learning pathway. It hits disproportionately those whom the Government are trying to entice into higher education, namely part-timers. It has been estimated that some 20 per cent are going to be affected, compared to 2 per cent of full-timers. Those people are already earning their qualifications the hard way, giving up their evenings and weekends to acquire better and more appropriate qualifications. They already get much less than their full-time equivalents; they have to pay fees up front; there are no interest-free loans and if they borrow via career development loans they have to pay commercial rates of interest; and they get little by way of maintenance support.</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07120328000057"></a>Who are they? They are disproportionately older students. The Open University reckons that 68 per cent of those affected will be over 35. Many are training for new careers, and many are teachers. Teacher training will be excluded, but not the degree behind the training. Some 25 per cent are taking qualifications in maths, science and technology; many are women returners who are retraining after years out with childcare; others are older people who are retraining in the hope of getting a better job, gaining a management qualification or returning to the job market after redundancy.</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07120328000058"></a>Some professions are going to be particularly hard hit. Many train in social work, counselling and psychotherapy only after experience in the workplace; and with the new Layard initiatives we are in need of large numbers of such people. The clergy are going to be very hard hit, since nearly all take degrees in theology after a first degree, again often later in life. What is tough is that precisely at a time when the Government are telling us that we need to keep our skills up to date and think in terms of working through to 70, they are putting a damper on precisely that opportunity.</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07120328000059"></a>It hits disproportionately precisely those institutions&#151;universities and further education colleges&#151;which have been doing most to widen participation and encourage those who have traditionally not gone into higher education to do so.

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07120328000061"></a>The Government are proposing some compromises. Medicine, architecture, nursing, some but not all teacher training, and for the moment the STEM subjects&#151;science, technology and engineering&#151;which are part of the strategically important and vulnerable subjects, are being exempted. There are some social work exemptions, but many of the professions allied to medicine, including pharmacy, will be hit. Foundation degrees will be exempt. One cannot help feeling that perhaps the whole enterprise is an underhand way of forcing universities into offering two-year foundation degrees and helping therefore to meet government targets in this area. Again, the Government are promising transitional help&#151;funding guaranteed at 2007 levels for the Open University and Birkbeck until 2010 to help them &#147;reconfigure&#148; their programmes&#151;but does this mean moving to foundation degrees? Are these compromises enough? Can the Open University and Birkbeck really be expected to change that rapidly? Surely, the Open University&#146;s suggestion that the issue be considered as part of a revamp of the part-time student deal in 2009 is reasonable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="07120328000062"></a>I come back to the trade-offs and value for money. Essential the trade-off being offered here is only within the HEFCE budget and we are, of course, being assured that the money is being used within the higher sector to help widen participation. Equally, however, this move needs to be seen as part of the wider education and skills agenda&#151;the Leitch agenda. Here, only last Monday, the Government announced a doubling of the Train to Gain budget for employer training, with a doubling from &#163;500 million to &#163;1 billion a year. Yet there are real doubts as to whether this sector&#151;employer-based training&#151;has either the will or the capacity to absorb this money and expand that fast. There are serious questions about value for money. The IFS evaluation of the pilots suggested that 85 per cent of expenditure on these pilots was dead weight&#151;namely, that employers were being paid for training they would do anyway. Surely the &#163;100 million needed to meet the Leitch higher education targets could be funded from the Train to Gain budget.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="07120328000065"></a>Let me say at the outset that despite their considerable anxiety over this change and this move, universities understand the Government&#146;s aim of redirecting the public money involved towards those who do not have a first higher education qualification. None the less, my anxiety is that the change could threaten financial stability for some institutions and put at risk opportunities for lifelong learning and upskilling, which could be lost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="07120328000066"></a>Noble Lords will hear from others about the impact on particular institutions, but sector-wide, Universities UK&#146;s analysis shows that the impact will be extensive. There are ways in which the money will be reallocated, and that is good. But unfortunately, it is little comfort, since there is no way of knowing which institutions will be reprieved and which will not. Some professions are particularly vulnerable. Students in pharmacy, psychology, education and the performing arts frequently retrain for a change in career. We cannot assume that these students will in future be willing to pay the full economic cost of taking that second life-chance.</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="07120328000067"></a>Universities are working with the funding council to deal with the situation that they find themselves  in and there may be ways to mitigate the worst effects of this proposed change. Perhaps universities that  will lose their funding could be given preferential status to bid for an equivalent number of funded additional student numbers against the Government&#146;s restated priorities, or perhaps additional exemptions could be added in subject areas that are reliant to a significant extent on second degree recruitment. Other ideas involve changing the timeline, holding the change until 2010-11 to aid planning, or developing a realistic time limit after which a student undertaking a second first degree could be funded, say after five or six years.</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para15"></a>

The Germans and the Americans are already there. We are going to play catch-up again. We must aim for 45 per cent, which means an extra 2 million at level 4. We are not going to get that if we now take action that will damage the institutions that can deliver on that. I agree with the objective; we must do it, but we cannot do it by damaging them. Therefore, we must find a way forward that avoids that. The one that occurs to me is to say to institutions, &#147;We will ring fence your ELQ money for your institution on the basis that you reorient your teaching to fit in with the Government&#146;s objective&#148;.</p>

I trust that the Minister and the Government will take careful note of the points that will be raised.</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="07120328000072"></a>There is definitely a&#151;dare I say&#151;Mr Bean-like aspect to this proposal. Superficially, the Government&#146;s objective is quite clear and makes some sort of sense, but all the most likely consequences are contradictory and may be somewhat chaotic in their effect. We have already considered the fact that &#163;100 million cut off this budget must damage the basic objective of lifelong learning. Secondly, as Universities UK has rightly pointed out, a raft of non-exempted qualifications that are clearly in the public interest will also be adversely affected. Thirdly, the cuts will reduce the capacity for first qualifications. This issue is difficult at many different levels.</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="07120328000073"></a>I must admit that my relationship with this subject is influenced by having been involved at an earlier stage in my life in television productions for the Open University, and I am concerned at the potential impact of this proposal on the Open University. My understanding is that it could affect as much as 12 per cent of its operational budget. One might say that  12 per cent can be absorbed and that we all have to cut our coats to deal with the times we live in, but the truth is that a 12 per cent cut in the Open University must, by definition, impair the quality and variety of what it can offer&#151;and that has never been more needed by society than it is now. This is not the right moment to impose cuts on the Open University. That is a bottom line, I am afraid.</p>

<a name="71203-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="07120328000074"></a>Finally, it is absolutely extraordinary that this proposal is happening without adequate consultation. What on earth has been going on?

If he agrees, will he accept that it is vital to exempt institutional credit and short-course awards from the ELQ policy?

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07120328000077"></a>Thirdly, why does the list of exempted teacher training qualifications not include the post-compulsory education and training certificates for lecturers in FE colleges? Is this an error by the Higher Education Funding Council or are the Government abandoning the commitment made when I was a Minister for further education teachers to be qualified teachers?</p>

The people most affected will be members of hard-working families who are anxious to make headway, and it is a gross misunderstanding that these students will be studying primarily for their own pleasure.

<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="07120328000082"></a>In this regard, I should like the Minister to answer four simple questions. How many of the affected students are women who are re-entering higher education to gain career-relevant skills?

I rarely speak on issues of higher education in this House but I felt moved to do so because I think that this policy is spectacularly misconceived. It cuts entirely across the lifetime learning agenda, a good deal of which takes in things such as certificates and diplomas, which will be put at an acute disadvantage by the consequences of this proposal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="07120328000091"></a>Given the misconceived nature of the proposal, I want to concentrate on the various exemptions and to look at two areas; namely, health and cultural and creative industries. I understand that 54 per cent of ELQ students are in London. One reason why the percentage is so large is that London is a hub for both cultural and creative industries&#151;the development of which is a regional policy; for example, in the Mayor&#146;s cultural strategy&#151;and pharmaceuticals. Pharmaceuticals and culture and creative industries are two of the biggest industries in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07120328000092"></a>With regard to health, pharmacy is excluded from the list of exemptions, as are nutrition and cognitive behaviour therapy&#151;the Layard agenda, if you like. An institution such as the London School of Pharmacy will be seriously destabilised by the loss of income. On the cultural and creative industries side, monotechnic institutions, particularly music schools of various sorts, will be acutely affected. The majority of students in acting are adult learners, as are those in opera and associated local activities. I think that one consequence of the policy will be the creation of a range of very perverse incentives which universities, being full of clever people, will make every effort to exploit. I could go into at least three or four that are already happening but I think that my time is up. However, I think that they will occur and that the policy may be thwarted on the ground a good deal.</p>

She scrutinises what is on offer at Birkbeck and the Open University and wonders, first, whether she can afford the expense of part-time education; secondly, whether her day job will leave her with the necessary stamina; and, thirdly, whether her husband would be up to acting as a single dad with their toddlers for two or three evenings a week.</p>

As we have heard, it weakens the commitment to life-long learning and it weakens the commitment to the upgrading and refreshment of knowledge and skills. Somehow, there is no realisation that this occurs at various times throughout a person&#146;s life; it does not involve a finite period. It is clearly a harmful blow to part-time students, who have been left out anyway in many discussions about university funding and are now even more on the margins. It is unfair to many women, who wish to return, after having children, to extend their educational qualifications. It is also inegalitarian for a Labour Government, since many students are in deprived areas and are catered for by the ex-polytechnics.</p>

It has been suggested by some that many of the affected students are recreational and rather ancient. In fact, 85 per cent of Open University people affected are aged between 25 and 65, 74 per cent of them are working and paying taxes and 9 per cent of them are carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="07120328000100"></a>The Government keep implying that the Open University is grossly overestimating the financial impact of all this. However, our figure of a reduction in support of &#163;31 million a year after three years can be found on the HEFCE website: &#163;31,626,519 to be precise. The Government have seriously underestimated the impact of the proposal on Birkbeck and the Open University in particular.

Those penalties are quite severe. They can include a heavy fine and even jail. I ask the Minister to consider, given the Government&#146;s other problems at the moment, that the notion of 1,000 or 2,000 graduates being sent to jail or fined heavily for fibbing on their application forms will not drive the success or popularity of the Government to new and improved heights.</p>

First, the Government&#146;s plans to reduce ELQ funding by &#163;100 million by 2010 contradicts everything the Government have been saying about retraining and creating a flexible workforce. Part-time students, who already get a raw deal on financial support, are being kicked in the teeth yet again. There was no prior consultation and no parliamentary debate in advance of this major change in policy. Instead, HEFCE is now consulting only over how the decision is to be implemented.</p>

<a name="71203-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07120331000004"></a>The Government claim that the removal of funding will affect only second degree students, or &#147;serial degree chasers&#148;. In fact, the decision affects a wide range of students and universities in England, including many involved in short courses and part-time vocational and professional education and training. Modern labour markets require both upskilling and reskilling of the existing labour force, not just new entrants. Modelling by HEFCE and the UCU suggests that institutions will be badly affected by the proposed cuts; we have heard about that from several noble Lords. The Government&#146;s suggestion that these students will all get funding from their employers to undertake their studies is not borne out by current statistics or evidence. Significant numbers of adults will therefore discontinue their lifelong learning because they cannot afford it. Their withdrawal will also make large tracts of university courses unviable.</p>

<a name="71203-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07120331000005"></a>Have the Government properly assessed the impact of these proposals on continuing education, on widening participation in higher education and on the institutions upon which lifelong learning relies? I accept that there are exceptions, but it is difficult to see the logic behind them. For example, teachers are exempt but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Blackstone, said, those teaching in further education are not. Foundation degrees will be exempt, but they may not necessarily be the appropriate kind of qualification for a student. Students may be pushed into doing an inappropriate qualification just because it is funded. I call on the Government to think again&#151;to back off, as it was put by another noble Lord&#151;and consult properly before coming back with much more appropriate proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07120331000007"></a>There is a demand from employers that we have systems that are flexible and responsive to demand, and relevant to the demands of competition. Does the Minister agree that it is in the interests of Britain that we not only provide for people with poor or no basic skills, but ensure&#151;as has been mentioned&#151;that those already in the workplace are able to change direction or access relevant skills to meet the needs of an ever changing workplace?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07120331000008"></a>The Government&#146;s own paper clearly laid out that everyone had a right to increase and update their skill levels and the right to a second and third chance to progress in their careers. So why has the Minister,  Mr Denham, decided to take such a retrograde step and cut funding by such a huge amount? Does the Minister not agree that cutting opportunity will remove the right of people to change direction and broaden their skills? The message being given out is, &#147;If at first you don&#146;t succeed, you just don&#146;t succeed&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07120331000009"></a>The NIACE draws attention to the fact that many people make false starts in life and need supported second chances. My honourable friend in another place, David Willetts, has said that cutting the funding for ELQs has all the hallmarks of a rushed and potentially damaging proposal. This is a big change to be made at such short notice. Can the Minister tell the House how this cut will affect indebted modern language graduates in need of vocation-specific top-up training? When the Government are looking to reform their flagship Train to Gain programme barely a year after its national launch, why are they also deciding to phase out CoVEs? I fear that the Minister finds himself in a conundrum, for he cannot say that the Government want to meet new challenges yet support funding cuts. </p>

We have increased funding by about 25 per cent in real terms since 1997, and we now spend more than &#163;10 billion a year on higher education and  &#163;7 billion a year on further education. However, we face enormous challenges. In today&#146;s workforce,  20 million people do not have higher level skills. We need to produce another 4 million people with the first higher level qualification between now and 2020 if we are to meet the challenges that Sandy Leitch&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Leitch&#151;has identified.

It is possible to disagree with the choice that we have made, but quite impossible to avoid making a choice one way or another.</p>

<a name="71203-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07120331000013"></a>Against that background, let me try to explain what we are going to do. In further education, we have introduced an entitlement to free tuition for adults to achieve their first full level 2 qualification, and for young adults under 25 to achieve a first qualification at level 3. We are we focusing further education funding on those priorities, in line with the Leitch recommendations for addressing low skills. The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, puts to me what I think is a rhetorical question. Of course we want people with first opportunities at all those levels and we also want progression, but that does not of itself write larger cheques.</p>

<a name="71203-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="07120331000014"></a>Let me focus my remarks on higher education, because that is the subject. In higher education, we have asked HEFCE by 2010 to redistribute &#163;100 million of teaching grant that currently goes to fund students studying for an HE qualification when they already have a qualification at the same or higher level&#151;an ELQ. We ought to acknowledge in this debate that the amounts in the first two years will be far less than that&#151;about &#163;25 million next year and about &#163;60 million in the following year. That is a redistribution&#151;not a cut&#151;of less than 1.5 per cent of the total teaching grant, even before the significant increases during the CSR period come into play. All the grant will remain in the system. It will be allocated by HEFCE to HE providers. It is a reallocation. The overall grant does not change, except in one sense: a significant increase for funding of higher education during the CSR period of 2 per cent in real terms per annum. That is a major and continuing increase.</p>

<a name="71203-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="07120331000015"></a>Let me say that we did not ask HEFCE to stop funding all ELQ students. Indeed, the &#163;100 million is less than a third of the total funding of &#163;327 million that we are currently spending on ELQ students. We asked HEFCE to implement a change that took account of both the wider policy imperatives and the need to provide the institutions that might lose money with time to adjust. No institution will lose cash on its 2007-08 baseline over a three-year period, and no decision has been taken about whether to make additional savings after 2010-11. That is something for the next spending review.</p>

<a name="71203-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="07120331000016"></a>The fact is that the more money we spend on students doing ELQs, the less there is for those who have never yet participated in higher education. We estimate that by 2010-11, 20,000 people will be studying for a first higher education qualification who otherwise would not have been able to do so. That is enough to fill an entire large university&#151;I am not sure that I will do a comparison with how many modest-sized universities might be impacted. That group is our priority. Those who criticise the policy should explain why they would have made a different choice about the priorities. Why would it have been better to have 20,000 fewer students studying for a first qualification and left the ELQ policy unchanged?</p>

Many universities are struggling to meet their HEFCE contracts. Money will be taken away from one group, but there is no obvious solution to where that new group of students is going to emerge from. There is a bit of a misconception around, unless there is a dramatic improvement in the number of young people leaving school with the relevant and appropriate qualifications. On a budget of &#163;10 billion, I wonder whether it is worth playing around in this way for &#163;100 million to be allocated in an uncertain way as soon as 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07120331000019"></a>Some people have suggested that a choice should not be made, but there has to be a choice because we can spend the money only once. If I were to follow, for example, the advice of my noble friend Lord Morgan, we would achieve what I think he suggested only by growing the budget in a way that is unavailable in current circumstances. I say to my noble friend Lord Puttnam that I understand his desire for stability and getting an engaged discussion about the future, but we do not have the luxury of being able to do that simply by avoiding the hardest choices of all. We chose as we did because we believe it is fairer; it helps more qualified people to get into higher education.</p>

We are getting to a point where some rather more difficult decisions have to be made. Our aim by 2020 is that 40 per cent of adults should have an HE qualification compared with  30 per cent now, which is an increase of 4 million people. That is why it is vital to look at these changes. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, that I do not think that what is being proposed in making that change from 30 per cent to 40 per cent is denying people the opportunity to retrain.

A huge amount of this policy depends on trying to drive forward that Leitch agenda, which the House warmly supported when it debated it. It is in that context that we can see the kind of growth that we need. I understand from what was said about lifelong learning by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, the noble Lord, Lord Watson, and my noble friend Lord Plant and from the example of the two students mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Quirk, that some people believe that that sort of proposition out of Leitch may be very difficult to achieve. I do not think that the decision that we are discussing tonight is in any sense inconsistent with the Leitch proposition. The central message of Leitch is that we need to increase the number of people with higher-level qualifications. We will move away from that imperative if we continue to prioritise those who already have such qualifications over those who do not. Teaching grants will still be available in all cases for foundation degrees, which are vital for retraining and reskilling. That is part of the answer to ensuring that people have the opportunity to retrain and go on other courses where there is employer co-funding; and examples of the courses which have been exempted have been mentioned.</p>

I will return to that in a moment, in the context of saying that some scepticism has been suggested about whether employers will engage in co-funding or whether they have ever realistically done so. It is only possible to say that there have been some improvements in that position. The House and those way beyond it will have to accept that the employers in this country will have to change. The economy of this country has no option but that employers change, as my noble friend Lord Jones, also said. We do not have the option, given the number of people in the workforce without the kinds of skills we need over the coming periods or, indeed, the skills we need today. There is no option other than that there is a fundamental lifting of the level of skills. The role of employers has to be that they increase whatever they have done historically, as my noble friend Lord Jones said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07120331000027"></a>I accept that there are issues for some institutions which have a relatively high volume of ELQ students. My noble friend Lady Warwick is right to talk about their stability, but their stability cannot mean that we do not move for further change. We welcome the jointly funded project between Birkbeck College and HEFCE to examine the future development of Birkbeck&#146;s business model. It is important for the Open University not to overstate the financial impact

I say to the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, who I hope will not mind if I still refer to him as my noble friend, that the figures he cited come from the HEFCE website, which illustrates one possible scenario after 2010-11&#151;that any outcome will depend on the decisions of the next spending review and may very well not lead to that kind of conclusion. Indeed, of the &#163;100 million to be redistributed by 2010-11, we think that about &#163;12 million will come from the Open University. The actual outcome for the Open University will be smaller because of the institutional mitigation that we have directed HEFCE to include in implementing the change.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07120331000028"></a>In addition, the Open University will take its share of the additional money coming into higher education through the Comprehensive Spending Review. It will be able to take a share of the &#163;100 million as it is reallocated. I cannot, knowing the Open University&#146;s great capability, believe that it is incapable of recruiting students on other bases as well.</p>

I hope that I can put it in the proper position in the debate.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07120331000031"></a>I wanted to conclude my point. No funding decisions have been taken beyond the CSR period, and the future decisions on ELQ funding will not lead to the overall funding for individual institutions falling off a cliff. I simply do not accept that that  will happen.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07120331000032"></a>The OU is an extraordinary institution. I am like other people who love it. I think that it is quite capable, through the variety of high-profile public activities that it engages in, to think of ways in which block grant funding mechanisms can properly recognise a wide variety of its activities.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07120331000033"></a>That brings me to the consultation point. Those who have made points about the OU or indeed any other institutions have said that they do not believe there has been adequate consultation. I understand that. I should say at least that the Government were quite clear about the priorities that they intended to meet. That was not a matter for consultation. It has been in the public domain for as long as I can remember, and it has been very widely debated. Consulting on whether to consult would not have been particularly fruitful. However, the consultation, which will conclude very shortly, is a genuine consultation about how the policy should best be implemented. I cannot stress too strongly to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, who wondered whether we were taking it seriously, that we have gone into it with an open mind. We wanted to see what the best approach should be, and we are grateful to everyone

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="07120331000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, in particular, floated a suggestion, which sits alongside other suggestions made by my noble friend Lady Warwick, about how universities most affected by the new funding policy could be put at the front of the queue for new student numbers that would be created as a result of the change. That proposal is worth serious consideration, and I promise the House that it will be seriously considered even in the last period of the consultation. I will also ensure that there is consideration of the questions asked by my noble friend Lady Blackstone and the points made by my noble friend Lord Plant about pharmacology, arts training and the training of further education teachers. I am not aware that we have ever stepped back from that, and I should be very disappointed to find that we had even done so by accident, although I do not believe that we have. I will ensure that those questions are in front of the consultation process people. I will also ensure that the point made by my noble friend Lord Griffiths about the training of the clergy is considered in that period. I should say to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that I do not believe that there will be a particularly difficult outcome for part-time students. That is probably the subject of a very important debate to be had about support for part-time students, but it is probably slightly different from our debate this evening.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07120331000035"></a>We wish to continue to fund students who are progressing to higher-level qualifications. We particularly want, and we believe that we must get, the support of employers because we have no option but to get it. We must get more people to enter higher education for the first time. We cannot continue to lag behind and then hope somehow that our economy will continue to prosper. That is not realistic. We are not in a position in which we will back off from that philosophy, but we are in a position in which the consultation must consider the details of this debate and the other submissions that have been made. I will ensure that all those factors are put in front of those conducting the consultation.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07120331000038"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment  No. 21, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 62. Amendment No. 21 is in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, who spoke at Second Reading and who is unavoidably absent overseas, taking part in a long-standing engagement.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07120331000039"></a>The amendment would require the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to report to the Secretary of State on the respective sums of money used in human embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research. It seeks to ensure that, as with the local ethical review process established in the case of animal experiments under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, an amicus curiae&#151;in this case, someone to speak for the human embryo&#151;would be appointed to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and would have a remit at least to challenge repetitive experimentation.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="07120331000040"></a>Amendment No. 23 seeks to disqualify from membership of the HFEA anyone who has a direct pecuniary interest in any of the activities governed by the Act. Amendment No. 62 seeks to establish clear record-keeping by the HFEA of ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval and hospitalisation.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="07120331000041"></a>Turning first to Amendment No. 21, it is ironic indeed that the moral justification, if it can be passed as such, for experiments on human embryos is the desire to keep Britain in the lead. This mistaken jingoism is a false patriotism at every level. While we have been diverted down the blind alley of embryonic stem cell research, the most breathtaking discoveries are being made by our competitors. Promises of a biotech El Dorado have proved illusionary, with vast sums of public money consumed in the process. How much better it would have been if those public resources have been used, as some of us have argued throughout, on the less ethically troubled pursuit of adult stem cell technologies. Amendment No. 21 seeks to require regular reportage of the respective sums of money allocated for the two approaches, a point eloquently made during the Second Reading debate by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="07120331000042"></a>Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 deal with the membership and the role of Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. There are currently 18 members of the HFEA. It has an interim chair, Walter Merricks, who was a founder member of Donor Conception Network. The chair is supposed to be a lay person and I would argue that to accord this status to Mr Merricks is stretching definitions&#151;something about which we heard earlier in another context&#151;beyond their intended sense. Eight other current members of the authority are working as medical or scientific professionals in the field of IVF or genetics. Apart from Mr Merricks there are two other members, Messrs Brown and Dundas, who are directly involved in patients&#146; groups and lobbying. The other seven could generically be described as lay people, but some have publicly advocated embryonic experimentation and cloning. The academic lawyer, Emily Jackson, who has spoken out in favour of human reproductive cloning is an active participant in pro-choice abortion politics and this November delivered a speech at the London School of Economics entitled  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1582"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1582</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;Rejecting the sanctity principle and rethinking the wrongness of killing&#148;. Her perspective is contained in the title, which she argued passionately. David Archard is the token philosopher on the authority, holding entirely predictable views. The four others could be described as neutral in the absence of any information to the contrary. So, in effect, it is only possible to claim that, at the most, four of the 18 come at assisted reproduction and embryo research from a potentially neutral perspective.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07120331000043"></a>I have never heard any indication of any member of the committee who has expressed serious reservations about anything which vast swathes of our population consider to be controversial at best and unethical at worst. Summing up this analysis, 11 of the 18 are involved, in one way or another, with fertility treatment and research; three others are outspoken in their position on research; leaving just four others&#151;two with a financial background, one involved in childcare work and one ex-BBC&#151;who could possibly be described as neutral.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="07120331000044"></a>As the <I>Times </I>reported only this morning, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, a point I put to my noble friend the right reverend Lord Harries of Pentregarth, is currently considering two licence applications from the Newcastle and King&#146;s Universities for the creation of interspecies embryos, called by them cytoplasmic hybrids, involving the cloning process, adult somatic cells and enucleated animal eggs. These applications are due to be ruled on on 5 December. Following a freedom of information request by Comment on Reproductive Ethics, it is acknowledged that the HFEA has never turned down a research licence application to the best of its knowledge. Will it grant these applications? As I asked my noble friend earlier today, what then is the purpose of the Bill which dedicates so much space to the permitted creation of interspecies embryos? It would appear that the HFEA has already assumed authority in this area of science.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="07120331000045"></a>So indifferent is the HFEA to widespread hostility to creating animal-human hybrids that they it has totally disregarded its own consultation which demonstrated that of more than 800 submissions, only one in eight supported the creation of hybrids. This not only ignores public consultation but it is dangerous to treat Parliament with apparent contempt to pre-empt deliberation in both Houses; it would make a total mockery of what passes as a democratic process.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07120331000046"></a>This is not a new problem. In 1982 the then Government announced the terms of reference for what became known as the Warnock committee. On 18 November 1993, in a Radio 4 broadcast of the &#147;Analysis&#148; programme, my noble friend Lady Warnock gave an insightful response when asked how the membership of her committee was determined. I quote her directly from a transcript:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="07120331000151"></a>&#147;There exists what is generally known as the Central List. The Central List is produced and combed for people who might have an interest in this kind of thing. I was then given a kind of draft list and asked whether there were any other people I thought would be obvious choices, maybe people who were not yet among the great and the good, and I was with some difficulty allowed a power of veto. There was one particular person who  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1583"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1583</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was supposed to be the Catholic, and I said I would not have him. I just knew that I couldn&#146;t work with him. We went right up to the day before publication with the civil servants saying, &#145;But there&#146;s nobody else in the world&#146;. So in the end, the night before publication, I said, &#145;Well, will you please tell the Minister that it&#146;s a very, very bad way to embark on working on a committee when you know that there&#146;s somebody you&#146;re not going to find easy to work with&#146;. The following morning two names were suggested. So I did win on that, but it was very, very hard and it took a lot of persistence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71203-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="07120331000047"></a>Doubtless it would be much easier for us all if people we found it difficult to work with could be excluded from committees and public bodies. I have probably had that effect on some of your Lordships during today&#146;s proceedings. In 2002 Susie Leather, the chair of the HFEA, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="07120331000152"></a>&#147;I don&#146;t think we need them&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120331000142"></a>that is, people opposed to the use of human embryos&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="07120331000156"></a>&#147;continually on the committee saying, &#145;I&#146;m opposed to all this&#146;&#148;. </ul>
<p><a name="07120331000143"></a>And the Joint Committee adumbrated a very telling new constitutional principle:</p>
<ul><a name="07120331000157"></a>&#147;those with such public views cannot administer the law to which they may be fundamentally opposed&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07120331000144"></a>That simply is not true. Removing dissenting and questioning voices is a huge error. Many local ethical review committees&#151;I sit on one&#151;contain people opposed to animal experimentation, but they see their role as a questioning one, ensuring, at least in the context of the law as it stands, that the interests of the subject are not dismissed or neglected.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07120331000048"></a>When I last looked, 70 per cent of the HFEA&#146;s income came in fees from the very clinics it is supposed to police&#151;a case of the watchdog being far too closely identified with the burglar. Perhaps the Minister can tell us what the current figure is. Clearly that incestuous relationship makes it difficult to say no too often, or ever at all. My Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 seek to address those issues.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07120331000049"></a>On Amendment No. 62, Her Majesty&#146;s Government have declined to follow the lead of their South Korean counterparts by restricting the type of human eggs that may be used in embryo research in order to protect women&#146;s health and welfare. Instead, appeal is made to an HFEA consultation undertaken in 2006 on the donation of eggs for research in which the publicly stated risks of side effects due to ovarian hyperstimulation&#151;a point made today by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger&#151;seems, curiously, to have been described as threefold lower than those indicated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the same year. I refer your Lordships to two Written Answers, at cols. <I>WA 99</I> on 23 October 2007 and <I>WA 131</I> on 29 November, to Questions I tabled, as well as to the conflicting statements of the HFEA and the RCOG. The HFEA has said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="07120331000153"></a>&#147;Mild OHSS is relatively common (occurring in between 1-10% of treatment) and can be treated and controlled. Severe OHSS is rarer (occurring in around 1% of cases)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07120331000145"></a>The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, by contrast, says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="07120331000154"></a>&#147;Women should be informed that mild forms of OHSS are common, affecting up to 33% of in vitro fertilisation (IVF)   


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1584"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1584</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cycles, and that 3&#151;8% of IVF cycles are complicated by moderate or severe OHSS&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="71203-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07120331000050"></a>According to Written Answers by the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi of Denham, on 22 October, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority appears to have incomplete records regarding ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This is not necessarily reported by clinics unless treatment was discontinued, and it does not hold data regarding how many in vitro fertilisation patients were at risk of hospitalisation after producing 20 or more eggs. Such appalling deficits would hopefully be rectified by the implementation of Amendment No. 62, which would lay on the HFEA a duty to keep records. Although clinics have to report OHSS if it causes an IVF cycle to be cancelled before egg collection for embryo transfer, they do not have to report all cases of women being hospitalised for OHSS. If women choose to continue with the cycle, risking their health, and end up in hospital, IVF clinics do not need to report it. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, in its guidelines on the management of OHSS published in September 2006, called for auditable standards, including the percentage of women who were admitted to hospital with OHSS, the number of days as an in-patient and incidence of thrombosis.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07120331000051"></a>The appalling degree of underreporting recently came to light when the journal, <I>Human Fertility</I>, reported in September that, in a four-year period of study, there were 53 incidents of women from an IVF clinic in Newcastle being hospitalised with OHSS, two of whom had life-threatening complications. However, the data held by the HFEA for the Newcastle clinic on the reported incidence of OHSS for six years during the same period show that only three cases of OHSS were reported to it.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07120331000052"></a>Amendment No. 62 has an affinity with Amendment No. 24, in the name of my noble friend Lady Finlay, which also stresses the importance of record-keeping, in that case of IVF&#151;success rates on the one hand, and risks of serious adverse side-effects on the other. I hope that the Committee and the Government will be convinced by the arguments for greater transparency and accountability. I beg to move.</p>

I often think that if I offer strong support, it may not necessarily help his case, but I offer it none the less.

That is why I regard the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, in relation to the authority as so important.</p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07120331000054"></a>I have only two points, both relating to the word &#147;transparency&#148;, which seems to apply to almost every public appointment and every declaration of pecuniary interest, except, so far, in this area. In public appointments in the past, the great and the good have appointed more of the great and the good, provided that they are not Roman Catholic or do not agree with the ethical stance that is being put forward. </p>

<a name="71203-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="07120331000055"></a>This is a very serious issue, and this House will look closely at the make-up of the authority in future. It will not be possible for a closed circle of scientists and those who take one particular ethical or philosophical point of view&#151;you can always find a jobbing philosopher to come up to support any point of view; our major universities are full of jobbing philosophers who will do that at the drop of a hat&#151;to decide in an area such as this, which is so important to men and women. As I said earlier, I am not an expert in these areas, either ethically or scientifically; I represent, if you like, the ordinary Back-Bench Peer in the street. However, quite of lot of people in the street are concerned about what is going on. They will not wish to have a lot of self-interested scientists, self-interested and self-appointed ethicists, and a self-interested elect to the great and the good decide what is ethically right or wrong. That is why it is important that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, suggests:</p>
<ul>

However, in future it is important that we make it absolutely clear that no one on the authority has any pecuniary interests whatever. That is what transparency means. If in political parties one has to be transparent in this way, declaring our interests&#151;as it is quite proper that we should all have to&#151;in this House and another place, and if people are concerned about transparency in political funding, we must ensure that those who serve on this authority have no pecuniary interests.  It would be ethically abhorrent if they were allowed to do so.</p>

I have every respect for the views of my noble friend Lord Alton, with whom I am joining forces in our discussion of later amendments, as I have for the views of the noble Lord, Lord Patten. However, I must spring to the defence of the way in which public committees work in this country. I do not believe that my noble friend Lady Warnock was ever actually the chairman of the HFEA, although clearly her work was fundamental in creating it. However, I can assure the Committee that in my time members were appointed according to Nolan principles in every respect. Indeed, as members at one stage we had a bishop, an actress and a rabbi.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="07120331000061"></a>Of course a body like that needs some scientists on it. To debar from membership anyone who might make money out of anything associated with IVF would be to debar huge sectors of society&#151;not least counsellors, who have been members, nurses or maybe even those who print leaflets or run nursery schools. There are very many ways in which one might make money out of IVF. However, it is noticeable that the well-known practitioners in the field, and the most regulated, were not members of the authority and were sometimes alleged to make a great deal of money out of this treatment. But if money is perceived as a problem, the Committee may wish to support another amendment that would put more of the work in this field back into the NHS.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="07120331000062"></a>The authority members took their work very seriously&#151;and what I say I think applies to all public committees in this country. There is freedom of speech and those who were appointed were articulate, often academic and intelligent and had the freedom to write what they wished to write outside the bounds of the authority. Members of the authority met regularly with pro-life members and listened to what they had to say. Of course, fees had to be charged; it is a general principle in charging clinics that the object of regulation according to this Government should meet the costs of regulation. There was no personal profit to be made by any member of the authority or the authority itself in glancing licences to clinics. Indeed, your Lordships may recall that very recently there was an attempt to close a clinic, which caused an enormous furore. It is very difficult because of the law to close a clinic.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_361"></a><a name="07120331000063"></a>That brings me back to the law. This is a country that is run according to the law&#151;positive law not natural law. The members of the authority were  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1587"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1587</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bound legally by what is in the statute. That is why this House and the House of Commons are, in the end, the ultimate ethical arbitrators. The law comes first and foremost for the authority.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_362"></a><a name="07120331000064"></a>It is self deluding to imagine that there can be another set of ethics outside the parameters of the law which will affect those who administer it. It is also self deluding to imagine that members of the authority spent all their time discussing ethics. There was a great deal of work that was mundane and legally required&#151;licensing, inspecting, keeping data, running a computer, overseeing training and so forth. None of that had very much to do with ethics as the word has been bandied about recently, but simply to do with the administration of the law.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_363"></a><a name="07120331000065"></a>That brings me back to the importance of the provisions of the Bill that we are passing in the next few months. The Bill contains the ethics. It would be limiting to insist on one member who spoke always, let us imagine, for animals or against embryo experimentation, because these matters have to be considered under the law and with public consultation. The HFEA has taken full account of public consultation very recently in relation to embryos. There have been other public consultations; for example, about sex selection. The public came out very clearly against sex selection for social reasons and that has remained the rule of the authority and it is in the Bill.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="07120331000066"></a>The law is what counts: that is what matters. This string of amendments is designed to tie the authority in a way that would not apply to any other public committee in this country. It would make it look as though IVF were intrinsically dangerous; far more dangerous than a normal pregnancy. After all, many a normal pregnancy ends up in some form of danger.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="07120331000067"></a>Collecting figures about OHSS is not as easy as it might seem, because many women come for treatment from abroad and then vanish off the books of the clinic when they go back to wherever they came from. Others may present in hospital with particular problems such as thrombosis and it may not be known that they had IVF. Any amount of data collection in that area is not necessarily accurate. Furthermore, the authority has been criticised for collecting data that are not used and are not necessarily useful.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="07120331000068"></a>I hope that the Committee will support the normal, natural, lengthy and complicated way of appointing members of the HFEA, which corresponds in my experience to the way in which all other members of public authorities in this country are appointed&#151;by advertisement, by selection according to criteria, and by expecting of them a commitment to the law and to free speech.</p>

The noble Lords, Lord Alton and Lord Patten, made many allegations about the HFEA in detail and it would take a long time to answer them. I am not going to do that, but I should like to focus on one or two points of principle that run throughout the amendments.</p>




<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1588"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1588</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="71203-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="07120331000070"></a>First, I am not sure that everyone is aware of the importance of reproductive technology now to the women of this country. Women are getting married later and having children later, and a higher and higher percentage of women in the population need help in producing babies. Because of the advances of medical technology and the skill of clinicians they can now have the children whom they so desperately want.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="07120331000071"></a>It is true that certain people are opposed to reproductive technology in principle, but we need to bear in mind that what we are talking about is what so many women in this country want: help in having children.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07120331000072"></a>Secondly, as regards the make-up of the HFEA, I find it very strange that each of its members should be named as though they had an intrinsic conflict of interest. They do not. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, talked about somebody being neutral. Nobody in this life is totally neutral. If I may say so, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, himself is hardly neutral. I would not want him to be. Who is this neutral person who suddenly appears who has no views on anything and expresses no passion on anything? Of course, the members of the HFEA have views. I agree that it would be very difficult for a person who was totally opposed to the use of assisted reproductive technology in helping women to have babies to be a member of the HFEA. If you are totally opposed to that in principle, it would be very difficult because your job&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said&#151;is to administer the law as Parliament has decided it. That is your job.</p>

There may be ways, in particular through the ethics and law committee, that we might be able to involve people more. It need not be totally ruled out. But there is no doubt that the fundamental job of the HFEA is to administer the law as Parliament has decided it.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="07120331000075"></a>Pecuniary interest was mentioned. I assure the Committee that before any decision is taken by a licence committee and before any major issue is discussed by the authority, people are asked whether there is any conflict of interest. They have to declare it and if it is a very direct conflict of interest, they have to leave the room and they are not allowed to take part in that discussion. We are extremely aware of possible conflicts of interest.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="07120331000076"></a>On the question of collecting data, particularly about OHSS, the HFEA has instituted a very effective system of alerts. If a clinic has a problem&#151;for example, if a person has to go to hospital as a result of hyperstimulation&#151;it reports it to the HFEA, which immediately alerts all the clinics to the incident.  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1589"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1589</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>This system is beginning to work rather well because the HFEA, as well as working with the law, has to work by persuasion and getting clinics on its side. So we have to encourage clinics to adopt better and better practice. One of the ways we do this is through this system of alerts. Of course, the HFEA is not perfect but some of the criticism that has been made tonight does not stand up to serious examination.</p>

<p><a name="st_178"></a>
<a name="07120331000077"></a><b><a name="71203-0015.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07120331000188"></a>Lord Winston:</b> There is a great deal of technical information in the Bill. We have gone through much of it this afternoon and this evening and will go through more. It might be useful and for the benefit of the Committee to discuss Amendment No. 62 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This is an extremely puzzling condition. It is essentially a response of the ovary to stimulation by the hormone which is given exogenously; that is, by injection, to women whose eggs are needed for IVF. One of the problems about this puzzling condition is that women respond idiosyncratically; that is, some women with a very low dose of FSH&#151;the hormone involved&#151;give a very exaggerated response which is quite unpredictable. Other women, in spite of massive doses of the hormone, do not give this response at all and do not show ovarian hyperstimulation.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="07120331000078"></a>You could argue physiologically that virtually all IVF cycles are a form of ovarian hyperstimulation because that is the nature of the beast. Humans were built to ovulate one egg and in order to improve the statistics to get more embryos so that one will be viable there is pressure to get more than one egg in the hope that you will get one embryo. So this is a major problem. While I have great sympathy with the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, about women who are made sick by this technology, I do not consider for a moment that this is because there is a drive in the background to stimulate women so vigorously that one gets lots of eggs for research; rather, it is an attempt to maximise the chances of a successful pregnancy.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="07120331000164"></a>9.15 pm</h5>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="07120331000079"></a>The problem is that the two issues are not related, so you can get large doses of hormones and small numbers of eggs and vice versa. The symptoms of OHSS vary massively. For example, thrombosis, which I agree is a dangerous condition, very often is totally silent, women are not admitted to hospital and they do not even know that they have a thrombosis. Some years ago, the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and I sat on a Select Committee looking at the aircraft passenger environment. One of the major issues with which we were concerned was thrombosis after long flights. We saw from the evidence that most of the thromboses were not detected and were not detectable unless you involved subjects&#151;aircraft passengers&#151;in detailed tests. That is a key problem here with OHSS. No matter how carefully the records were taken, they would actually be completely unreliable.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="07120331000080"></a>Secondly, there is the important issue that was just raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech. As the noble Baroness pointed out, a large number of people come from overseas for these treatments, spend a  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1590"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1590</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>variable amount of time in the United Kingdom, may be hospitalised overseas and may be hospitalised here. It would be inappropriate to try to keep those sorts of records. It would be an unreasonable burden when there are much more important records that we might be considering; for example, the children born as a result of this treatment, which is not in the Bill. I referred to that at Second Reading. I feel that while we in the medical fraternity understand the concern, at present one has to say that this extremely puzzling and common condition is not predictable and does not routinely end in hospitalisation. One of the reasons why the royal college and the HFEA figures vary so much is that there is no definition of severe ovarian hyperstimulation. That is a real issue if you are going to try to keep records.</p>

<a name="07120331000081"></a><b><a name="71203-0015.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07120331000189"></a>Baroness Barker:</b> I apologise to the Committee for my absence earlier this afternoon, which was unavoidable. In the absence of my noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby, I will make a few points on the first three amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Alton. We support him in his request in Amendment No. 21 for reports and information about the amount of resources put towards various different types of research. Bearing in mind the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Patten, earlier, I caution the noble Lord, Lord Alton, not to draw conclusions based simply on the amount of government funding for particular types of research. If the noble Lord, Lord Patten, is right that a great deal of commercial investment is being made into certain types of research, it is entirely legitimate that the Government might seek to fund the type of research that is not of greatest commercial value but which has a greater public health value, even though it is more difficult to fund. I caution against some of the interpretations that might be made of the data.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="07120331000082"></a>I listened to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on Amendment No. 22, and his quote from the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, on the formation of her committee. The thought that immediately struck me was, &#147;That was then&#148;. Since 1990, the system of appointments to public bodies has changed dramatically. What the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, talked about is a thing of the past. There is now far greater transparency in public appointments, and that applies to the HFEA as much as to other bodies.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="07120331000083"></a>The question in my mind on this amendment is, &#147;Is it right to impose on one member of the authority a particular duty?&#148;. I think that it may not be. My understanding is that all members of a public body must pay regard to ethical issues, and none of them should be there if they do not. They may come to collective judgments, but it is a common responsibility.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="07120331000084"></a>As for Amendment No. 23, other Members of the Committee have talked about the issue of expertise with far greater authority than I could. It is always the case that the pool of people from which one selects some of the membership for specialist bodies must have extensive involvement in the field. That is not a new or unique situation in public appointments.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="07120331000085"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Alton, talked about payments made to the regulator by the clinics it  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1591"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1591</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regulates. In a number of different fields, and pensions is one&#151;I see the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on the Benches opposite&#151;it is not uncommon for regulators to be paid by the bodies they regulate provided that there is a clear remit in law regarding what the charges should be for. The HFEA was set up in that way. The fact that two sorts of bodies are engaged in the same field does not necessarily give rise to a conflict of interest.</p>

<p><a name="st_180"></a>
<a name="07120331000086"></a><b><a name="71203-0015.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07120331000190"></a>Lord Elton:</b> I agree entirely with the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, on the normality of a regulator being funded by the regulated bodies. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, raised an anxiety about the possible effect on the decisions made. It would be helpful if we were told whether there is any relationship between the funds received by the regulator from the regulated bodies and the nature of the decisions it makes. If there is no connection between the decisions and the volume of money received, the anxiety recedes. On the other hand, if there is a connection, then the noble Lord&#146;s case would be advanced. Although I would think that the former was the case, I should like to be reassured about it.</p>

<a name="71203-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="07120331000087"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, pointed out, as have others, that it would be odd if a single member of a body was required to pay particular attention to ethics and to ensure that everyone else also paid particular attention. The duty should lie equally on all members. She preceded the point with the interesting statement that there is only one ethics: the ethics set in law. It seems that we are at a point where events are always proceeding ahead of the law, so it is constantly necessary to bear in mind the ethical questions raised by new developments. Again, it is unfortunate that we could not have discussed a bioethical advisory body at the beginning of our debates. I hope that the usual channels and business managers will find a method of devising a grouping to allow us to do that at the beginning of Report stage, because it is central to this law.</p>

Others were experts in computing, which is obviously important, while others were councillors or men of the cloth, as I said. All those professions were taken account of, and that work is by no means a soft option. The Committee will wish to know that in my day it was extremely badly paid, although that may have changed. One did this sort of job not for glory or for pay but simply out of commitment. It was a very heavily loaded, time-consuming and demanding job in which one learnt a great deal, both pleasurable and painful. The welfare of the child was the number one ethical principle embedded in the law, and it is

The principles include the welfare of the child, the safety of the mother and baby, respect for the embryo, the autonomy and dignity of every individual involved in treatment and the receipt of treatment, and, more recently, the saving of life.

<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="07120331000091"></a>On my second point, I have much more sympathy with the noble Lord, Lord Alton. Amendment No. 62 refers to the hyperstimulation of ovaries. My professional colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Winston, very lucidly set out the difficulties of collecting those data. However, my sympathy with the noble Lord lies in the fact that I should like to see a greater degree of patient safety being promoted in all aspects of medicine. I know that the Minister is also interested in patient safety. I hope that all the units that provide in vitro fertilisation adhere to the excellent guidelines produced by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which the noble Lord mentioned, to try to reduce the incidence of moderate and severe hyperstimulation of ovaries. However, as I said, we have heard about the difficulties of data-collecting due to problems of definition, and that would just create an extra burden without producing any return.</p>

I am indebted to both the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, and the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, for their clear explanation of the growing need for assisted reproduction and of the fundamental roles of the HFEA, which must include adherence to the law. The HFEA has a duty under Section 7 of the 1990 Act to produce annual reports. These are an overview of what the authority has done over the past year, as well as a forward look at the coming year.</p>

I entirely refute the noble Lord&#146;s statement about false jingoism and false hopes, but I believe that the idea outlined in the amendment is good in principle. However, the HFEA does not have a role in regulating or licensing adult stem cell research. It would therefore not have the remit, nor would it be appropriate, for the HFEA to produce annual reports on the resources spent on adult stem cell research in the UK. As my noble friend Lord Darzi outlined in his closing speech

Over the same period, the MRC provided &#163;16.5 million for embryonic stem cell research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="07120331000094"></a>Further, although the HFEA licenses human embryonic stem cell research, it does not provide funding for it and therefore does not have a role in recording the information on resources put into this research. I feel that it would be the role of the UK Stem Cell Bank, research councils or the scientific community as a whole to monitor and make available information regarding the volume of activity in stem cell research in the UK. I very much hope that they will do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="07120331000095"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 22 and 23, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Alton. The skills and expertise needed among HFEA members are considered by the chair of the HFEA in consultation with the Department of Health. Subsequently, appointments are made by the Appointments Commission on behalf of the Secretary of State for Health, following advertisements in the UK press. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, for, among other things, her clear explanation of the appointments process. It involves advertisements in the national press, as I said, and they are in line with the Nolan principles; it is a transparent process. These processes have improved over the past 10 years, as noble Lords have said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="07120331000104"></a>Members must declare any conflict of interest with issues that the authority considers and absent themselves from such deliberations as appropriate. The 1990 Act set conditions for the make-up of the authority&#146;s membership. That is covered in Schedule 1 and ensures that the chair or deputy-chair cannot be, or have ever been, a medical practitioner, a person who has been involved in keeping or using gametes outside the body or any person who has been directly involved in commissioning or funding of research involving gametes. The 1990 Act further specifies that at least one-third of the members are of a professional background and that at least half of the members are not from any of these backgrounds and are therefore lay.</p>

<a name="71203-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="07120331000105"></a>The current membership of the HFEA includes a philosopher&#151;a professor of philosophy and public policy&#151;who brings a lay and an ethical perspective to discussions. As the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said, it is right that all members of the authority have much to contribute in terms of discussions on ethics. That is a matter for the authority as a whole. I feel strongly that there is a need for the membership of the authority to include people who have specialist expertise in the areas that the HFEA regulates. I know that this view is shared more widely outside the House, as it was brought up as one of the reasons against replacing the HFEA by the Regulatory Authority for Tissues and Embryos. The areas for which the HFEA has oversight are complicated and, in order for it to be effective, it is important that the membership includes people who have specialist expertise and first-hand knowledge of the subject matter.</p>

<a name="71203-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="07120331000106"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, and others asked about applications currently before the HFEA in respect of interspecies embryos. The HFEA is considering two licence applications from Newcastle and King&#146;s College to undertake the creation of interspecies embryos for research. The applications were received late last year, and the HFEA has consulted the public on the creation of embryos of this type. The authority has decided in principle that it is appropriate for it to consider the applications and is doing so through the licensing committee.</p>

<a name="71203-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="07120331000107"></a>Amendment No. 62 is the new clause of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, which would require the keeping of records that are already maintained by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and HFEA-licensed clinics. It is a condition of every licence issued by the HFEA that proper records are maintained. That was supplemented in July this year when new regulations, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Quality and Safety) Regulations 2007, came into force. They amended the 1990 Act to implement the   


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1595"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column 1595</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>requirements of the EU directive 2003/23/EC, which sets standards of safety and quality for human tissue intended for human application in respect of reproductive cells. Schedule 3A of the 1990 Act&#151;&#147;Supplementary Licence Conditions: Human Application&#148;&#151;requires licensed clinics to keep records of and report adverse events and reactions to the HFEA.</p>

<a name="71203-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_389"></a><a name="07120331000108"></a>The seventh edition of the HFEA&#146;s code of practice, published to coincide with the introduction of new regulations, requires that any occurrence that is inconsistent with routine patient care is reported to the authority. This would ensure that the example cited by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, of a clinic in Newcastle, was properly reported. The HFEA would expect an incident report from a licensed clinic whenever the clinic is made aware of a case of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, or other adverse reactions to the stimulatory drugs or the egg-collection procedure itself, where this results in prolonged hospitalisation. The information provided by my noble friend Lord Winston is, of course, extremely helpful. Non-identifying information about adverse reactions to treatment, notified to the HFEA, would be made available by the authority on request.</p>

<a name="71203-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="07120331000109"></a>Furthermore, Section 15A of the 1990 Act requires the HFEA to investigate reports of serious adverse reactions, and events, and take appropriate regulatory action should this be required. The HFEA already has appropriate procedures in place to ensure that severe side effects of treatment are recorded locally and notified to the authority. I hope that noble Lords will consider not moving their amendments but, before I sit down, I say to the noble Lord, Lord Elton, that I will speak to the usual channels and try to ensure the discussion on Report of a bioethics commission or Joint Committee comes at the beginning of Report stage, as he recommended.</p>

If some way can be found to provide the information about the balance of resources allocated to the different kinds of stem cell technologies, everyone in the House would be better informed and grateful for that. I accept the earlier point of my noble friend Lord Patel, however, that this is not just about insisting on equity. It may well be that we should be insisting that a lot more money goes into adult stem cells if the case that I have been making all afternoon comes to pass. It is not about getting an artificial figure, but about having proper data.</p>

I do not know the views of the actress, but I think I know the views of both the rabbi and the bishop. My noble and right reverend friend Lord Harries will recall that, when he chaired the Select Committee of your Lordships&#146; House that retrospectively looked at the orders we passed in 2001, 38 theologians from the reformed, Anglican, Orthodox and Catholic traditions, submitted a joint statement opposing the

That appeared as a footnote to the final report, but not in the body of the report. Interestingly, one of those theologians is now the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>

<a name="71203-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_392"></a><a name="07120331000112"></a>No bishop and no rabbi who has ever spoken out against the use of human embryos has, for the reasons that my noble and right reverend friend described, ever been appointed to the HFEA. His argument was that it would be incompatible because of the contrary opinion that they would put and because that might place them in an unacceptable dilemma. I do not accept the basis of that argument.</p>

Nevertheless, even if it was very difficult, we should not rule it as outside the scope of the membership of the HFEA in future&#151;the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Patten. If we are looking at future of appointments, it is not unreasonable to have members who do not themselves support the original premise on which an authority was established. Sometimes, by bringing informed arguments to the debate, they are able to convince people of the merits of looking again&#151;especially at things such as repetitive use of human embryos, the very point that I enumerated as one of the key questions.</p>

It seems to me that if a body is set up by law, to seek to go on to it to undermine what it was set up to establish raises an issue of bad faith. Many years ago, I was asked as a local councillor to sit on the board of a girls&#146; public day school trust. I said that I was committed to education, but that they should realise that I did not believe in fee-paying schools and I thought that, in that context, there was an issue of bad faith.

I take him back to our very first debate in your Lordships' House&#151;I instigated it on a Motion in 1998, I think. The then Chief Rabbi, Lord Jakobovits, who was a member of your Lordships&#146; House, spoke strongly against the use of human embryos in cloning procedures.

<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="07120331000119"></a>I do not think that one can say that every rabbi or every bishop shares the same opinion, but I believe, turning to the point made by the noble Baroness, that to exclude people who may take a contrary view is wrong. I told your Lordships that I serve on a local ethics committee connected with my university, looking at the animal procedures that take place there. I am very struck by the fact that, on that committee, there is one member who is opposed to vivisection. That does not compromise the way in which he participates in our debates. I like to hear what he has to say about repetitive use and duplication of use of animals. I am not always convinced by his arguments, but I think that those arguments are worth hearing. They are certainly not arguments of bad faith. To exclude people entirely from such committees because a parliamentary vote went one way or the other seems to me entirely wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="07120331000120"></a>When we had the vote on human cloning in 2001, nearly a third of your Lordships voted against that proposition. The House was divided, but by a majority voted in favour of the 1990 legislation. A significant number of people have always been opposed to it. The precondition that my noble and right reverend friend Lord Harries put before the House that only someone with a passion should be appointed rather than someone who is neutral would mean that everybody who is appointed to the HFEA would be on the other side of the argument.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, raised an important point, and the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said that it was an obvious point that had not been overlooked and that the interests of the child were written in to the law in every possible direction. Does that go beyond Section 13(5) of the 1990 Act? She spoke as if there was a great barrage of protection there.

I am not saying that at all; in fact, my noble friend Lady Deech did a superb job during her time as chairman and was very objective and fair, even though I sometimes disagreed with the conclusions that the HFEA reached. I am arguing that the composition of the membership of the HFEA should be more balanced and that it should be more questioning of the way in which the law is being interpreted&#151;in particular, about the tendency to pre-empt Parliament. To have a meeting of the HFEA this very week, between the sittings of this Committee of your Lordships&#146; House, to determine applications on interspecies embryos will create a great deal of cynicism in the minds of the public, who wonder whether we have not allowed ourselves to become just a rubber stamp.</p>

It keeps a register of the names of donor fathers and spent a great deal of time debating the anonymity of donors and the effect that that would have on children. I could go on and on.

Perhaps we could collect data on people who have been treated here and developed OHSS and who then go back to overseas destinations. At least we might invite them to provide self-reporting. That might be useful data to accumulate in the future. I see some of the practical difficulties that have been raised in that context.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="0712035000010"></a>The National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit's (NCJDSU) 15th annual report was published on 30 November. The report documents the unit's findings in relation to sporadic, familial and iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) up to 31 December 2006.

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="0712035000011"></a><b><a name="71203-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0712035000068"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Anne McGuire) has made the following Statement.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="0712035000012"></a>Work matters. People in work are generally better off financially and in terms of their health and well-being, their self-esteem and the future prospects for them and their families. Disabled people must get the same opportunities to benefit from work as everyone else.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="0712035000013"></a>Our specialist disability employment services (job introduction scheme, work preparation, WORKSTEP, disability employment advisers and access to work) for those who need the most support to work, or long-term support in work, make a profound difference to the lives of tens of thousands of disabled people every day. But we can make these services work better and achieve more.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="0712035000014"></a>We have carried out a major review of these services and listened to the views of many disabled people, employers, external delivery partners and Jobcentre Plus staff.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="0712035000015"></a>Today we have published a consultation paper, <I>Helping People Achieve their Full Potential: Improving Specialist Disability Employment Services</I>, to set out how we think we can improve these services to help more disabled people to reach their potential through leading fulfilling working lives. A copy of this document has been placed in the Library.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="0712035000016"></a>The proposals complement our other major reforms such as Pathways to Work and proposals for a flexible New Deal by offering additional specialist help for people with greater support needs. Alongside the modernisation of Remploy, we expect that these proposals will help to improve our services for those disabled people who need most help to find, retain and progress in paid work.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0712035000017"></a>Responses to the consultation need to be submitted by close of business on Monday 10 March 2008.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0712035000019"></a>The Economic and Financial Affairs Council was held on 13 November in Brussels. The Financial Secretary to the Treasury attended for the UK. The items on the agenda were as follows:</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0712035000021"></a>The council adopted conclusions on the next three-year cycle for the Lisbon strategy, as prepared by the Economic Policy Committee. Ministers agreed that the Lisbon strategy is delivering results and that the four priority areas for reform agreed at the 2006 spring council (employment, knowledge and innovation, business potential, and energy and climate change) remain valid. Ministers agreed with the Commission's assessment that the integrated guidelines do not need a fundamental overhaul, as stability is an important element for the effectiveness of the Lisbon strategy. They also agreed that the main focus of the new cycle should be on the implementation and delivery of reform.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="0712035000025"></a>The council agreed conclusions on EU statistical matters, including the 2007 EFC status report on information requirements, the reduction of the statistical burden, EU statistical governance and the public communication of major statistical revisions, as prepared by the Economic and Financial Committee. The UK welcomes work to reduce the statistical burden on member states.</p>

The presidency felt that good progress had been made on these proposals, which the UK strongly support. The council is due to consider these proposals again at its meeting on 4 December 2007.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="0712035000028"></a>Green taxation: passenger car-related taxes&#151;Ministers exchanged views on Commission proposals for a new directive introducing a compulsory CO2 element into passenger car taxation. The UK Government are committed to combating climate change using the most cost-effective tools available, but remain to be convinced that this proposal, which would restrict member states' choice of form and structure of passenger car taxation, is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="0712035000033"></a>The council received a presentation from Hubert Weber, the president of the European Court of Auditors, on the 2006 general budget.

These conclusions have been prepared at the Economic Policy Committee and the Economic and Financial Committee.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="0712035000041"></a>Ministers will be asked to agree conclusions on the economic dimension of migration.

The UK believes that the Lamfalussy arrangements have made a major contribution to improving the efficiency of the EU legislative process and enhancing supervisory co-operation. The UK believes that the draft council conclusions represent an appropriate consensus about how the Lamfalussy arrangements should evolve going forward.</p>

The UK believes that member states should be given flexibility to apply reduced VAT rates where these will not materially affect the single market and therefore supports the extension of most of the temporary derogations granted to those member states that acceded to the European Union after 1 January 1995.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="0712035000051"></a><I>Combating tax fraud</I><I>&#151;</I>Ministers will be asked to agree conclusions on work to improve arrangements to combat tax fraud, which have been prepared on the basis of a report by the Commission. The UK is strongly supportive of work that will help in the fight against missing trader intra-Community (MTIC) and other VAT fraud, while remaining committed to minimising the burdens on legitimate businesses.</p>

The UK supports the proposed work programme.</p>

The strategy sets out the actions that need to be taken over the next five years on prevention, early diagnosis, better treatment, improving patients' experience of care and reducing inequalities. It also sets out how these actions will be delivered by the NHS.</p>

Under the current arrangements, in-port services are provided by Serco Denholm Limited, under government-owned contractor-operated arrangements, while out-of-port services are undertaken by the Royal Maritime Auxiliary Service (RMAS).</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="0712035000058"></a>Since 2002, we have been working to find a long-term service provider and, following an industry briefing day in May 2003 and a subsequent pre-qualification questionnaire exercise, four bidders were shortlisted, although two subsequently withdrew. The two remaining bidders, Serco Denholm and the Starfish Consortium&#151;the latter comprising Babcock Naval Services (Clyde), Devonport Management Limited (Plymouth), Fleet Support Limited (Portsmouth) and Smit International (Scotland) Limited&#151;were invited to submit two proposals offering a complete service: one of these proposals reflected a partnering arrangement with the RMAS, whereby staff remain in the MoD; the second proposal would entail TUPE transfer as appropriate.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="0712035000059"></a>Following detailed bid evaluations, using predetermined criteria, Serco Denholm's proposal to provide the complete service, including taking ownership of MoD marine service assets, was selected as the preferred bid. Following completion of final negotiations with the company, a contract will be awarded in early December

The contract for those services currently provided by Serco Denholm (vesting day 1) will commence immediately following the award of the contract, while the contract for the services currently provided by the RMAS (vesting day 2) will start at the beginning of April 2008.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="0712035000060"></a>A key implication of the new arrangement will see the transfer of the RMAS workforce to the company under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (TUPE) Regulations. New pension arrangements are also in place that are comparable to those currently enjoyed under the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="0712035000061"></a>A further significant aspect will be the closure of Her Majesty's Mooring Depot at Pembroke Dock within six months of vesting day 2, which will lead to around 30 redundancies. New employment opportunities are, however, expected to emerge from arrangements that will form part of the contract for the sale of the dock.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="0712035000062"></a>The changes in the way in which the service is to be provided will result in some 200 post reductions from the combined workforce of 740 during the first five years of the new arrangement. As far as possible, these will be achieved either through natural wastage or through voluntary means, although the need for some compulsory redundancies cannot be ruled out at this stage.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="0712035000063"></a>Throughout the tendering process, the department has engaged with the relevant trades unions and this will continue as the formal TUPE consultation process commences.</p>

<a name="71203-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="0712035000064"></a>This is a complex and valuable contract and the MoD's commitment has been to ensure that we get it right for all those concerned, especially those staff employed by the RMAS who will be affected by the new arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="0712035000066"></a>The Ministry of Defence recognises the importance of a robust strategic airlift capability to operational deployments. On 26 July 2007, I announced our intention to procure a sixth C17 Globemaster aircraft. I am pleased to announce that the Ministry of Defence has now signed a contract with Boeing, totalling some &#163;130 million, for the purchase of the sixth C17 aircraft to be delivered in 2008. This procurement will deliver a significant increase in our capability. The four existing C17 aircraft already make a critical contribution to sustaining current UK worldwide operations, both in providing a general airlift capability and in lifting oversize items. The additional C17 will join the existing fleet of four aircraft and a fifth aircraft that will be delivered in May 2008.</p>

Before it is put into service, ContactPoint will go through extensive user acceptance testing by practitioners to ensure that the system meets their needs and is fit for purpose. It will also be subject to rigorous penetration testing by people who are experts in the IT security field and approved by the Communications and Electronics Security Group.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_100"></a><a name="07120321000162"></a>My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Young People and Families (Kevin Brennan) and I have today made the following Written Ministerial Statement about funding and implementation of ContactPoint:</p>

<a name="71203w0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_101"></a><a name="07120321000163"></a>I am announcing today levels of funding to local authorities to support the implementation of ContactPoint and providing an update on the implementation timetable.</p>

<a name="71203w0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_102"></a><a name="07120321000164"></a>To support local implementation until March 2009, &#163;40 million will be made available, made up of the following elements:</p>
&#163;27 million to local authorities in England, from April 2008 to March 2009, to support implementation;&#163;1 million from April 2008 to March 2009  to support national partners&#146; ContactPoint implementation projects;a further &#163;12 million from January 2008, made available to lead organisations to support modifications to case management systems. This will enable the main existing systems to provide data to ContactPoint and/or for authorised users to be able to have one-way access to ContactPoint via those systems.
<a name="71203w0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_103"></a><a name="07120321000165"></a>We have also provided indicative funding allocations to local authorities for future years: &#163;27 million in 2009-10 and &#163;15 million in 2010-11. My officials will write to local authorities and national partners today to inform local authorities and other partners about this funding.</p>

<a name="71203w0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_104"></a><a name="07120321000166"></a>ContactPoint is a key element of the <I>Every Child Matters</I> programme to transform children's services by supporting more effective prevention and early intervention. Its goal is to improve outcomes and the experience of public services for all children, young people and families. ContactPoint will provide a  tool to support better communication among practitioners across education, health, social care and youth offending. It will provide a quick way for those practitioners to find out who else is working with the same child or young person.</p>

<a name="71203w0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_105"></a><a name="07120321000167"></a>ContactPoint will be a simple basic online tool containing:</p>
minimal identifying information for each child, and name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact details for parents or carers; each child will also have a unique identifying number;contact details for the child's educational setting and GP practice and for other practitioners or services working with them; and  


<notus-date day="3" month="12" year="2007" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WA155"></a><b>3 Dec 2007 : Column WA155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an indication as to whether a service or practitioner holds an assessment under the common assessment framework or whether they are a lead professional for that child.
<a name="71203w0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_106"></a><a name="07120321000168"></a>No case information will be held on ContactPoint.</p>

<a name="71203w0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_107"></a><a name="07120321000169"></a>ContactPoint is being developed with extensive input from a wide range of stakeholders. These include:</p>
delivery partners&#151;local authorities and national partners (for example, voluntary and community sector organisations);practitioners and managers from across children's services, and bodies that represent them; andchildren, young people and parents and carers.
<a name="71203w0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_108"></a><a name="07120321000170"></a>Over the last few months, we have been considering the substantial stakeholder feedback that we have received and we have looked at the implications that the resulting proposed changes could have on the system. It is clear from the considerable work that we have done so far that we will need more time than we originally planned to address the changes to ContactPoint that potential system users suggested.</p>

<a name="71203w0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_109"></a><a name="07120321000171"></a>The change to the timetable will mean that deployment of ContactPoint to the &#147;early adopters&#148; local authorities and national partners will be in September or October 2008. It will be deployed to all other local authorities and national partners in 2009, between January and May, depending on final deployment slots. The additional time available presents a number of opportunities to do more work in the period prior to ContactPoint deployment, which will help to realise some benefits earlier. The fundamental design of ContactPoint will not change; the alterations will make sure that the system works even more effectively for users and improves the ability of local authority ContactPoint teams to manage user access.</p>

<a name="71203w0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_110"></a><a name="07120321000172"></a>The news on Tuesday 20 November of the loss of large volumes of child benefit data from HMRC has raised questions about the safety of large-scale personal data in other government systems, including ContactPoint. ContactPoint will not contain any financial information (such as bank details) or case information (such as case notes, assessments, medical records, exam results or subjective observations).</p>

<a name="71203w0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_111"></a><a name="07120321000173"></a>On Tuesday 20 November, the department conducted an assessment of how personal data are stored and protected in the department. As a result of that assessment, I am confident that we have very robust procedures in place. On Wednesday 21 November, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. In light of the security breach at HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure that standards are as high as they can be. To this end, on 20 November, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families decided to commission an independent assessment of its security procedures. This will be undertaken by Deloitte. Delaying the implementation of ContactPoint will enable the independent assessment of security procedures to take place as well as address the changes to ContactPoint that potential system users have told us that they need.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_112"></a><a name="07120321000174"></a>Delivery partners will receive further information early in the new year. In the mean time, progress will be reported to local project managers regularly through their ContactPoint implementation co-ordinators. They will work with individual authorities and national partners to agree new deployment slots as soon as it is possible to do so.</p>

The price of gas has been at a level that has meant that it is more profitable to generate electricity through the increased use of coal.</p>

<a name="71203w0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_113"></a><a name="07120321000177"></a>The introduction of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) set a price on CO2 emissions. Power stations are covered by the scheme and must account for their emissions by surrendering allowances.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_114"></a><a name="07120321000178"></a>In phase 1 of the EU ETS, the price of allowances fell significantly due to oversupply in the market. It is still more profitable for electricity generation to come from increased use of coal even when factoring in additional carbon costs of burning coal compared to gas.</p>

<a name="71203w0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_115"></a><a name="07120321000179"></a>In phase 2 of the EU ETS, the European Commission's decision to request significant reductions on several member states&#146; caps will help to ensure greater scarcity of allowances in the market. This should deliver a carbon price that incentivises cost-effective emission reductions and investment in clean technology.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_240"></a><a name="07120321000342"></a>HIV incidence (newly acquired infections) is currently monitored through unlinked anonymous testing of men who have sex with men across a network of 15 sentinel genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Data are analysed for London and outside London. There have been no statistically significant trends since 1996 in the incidence of HIV among men who have sex with men as measured through this sentinel surveillance system. In 2006, incidence of HIV among men who have sex with men was estimated at 2.1 per cent. For London the estimated incidence was 2.6 per cent and outside London it was 1.3 per cent. Men who have sex with men who attend GUM clinics are considered to be a higher risk of HIV than the general population of men who have sex with men and therefore are likely to have a higher incidence of HIV.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_344"></a><a name="07120321000456"></a>IMGs not holding UK or EEA passports can currently gain entry to the UK as follows. Those who have taken the foundation course in the UK and need to continue with their postgraduate training can apply for jobs in UK hospitals. The NHS trust will need to apply for a work permit and undertake a recruitment search to ensure that the post could not be filled by a resident worker. This complies with the normal requirements of the work permit arrangements. IMGs may apply to enter the UK under the highly skilled migrant programme (HSMP), as long as they meet the points threshold. Successful HSMP applicants have free access to the UK labour market. The medical training initiative (MTI), which is part of the training and work experience scheme (TWES), offers an additional work permit route for IMGs who may need specific training in a particular area of medical procedures. As this is specific training for the individual doctor, advertising is not appropriate. The period of approval for the MTI is limited to 24 months and requires endorsement by the deanery.</p>
