Could the Government remind Ambassador Ron Prosor that when moderate, sensible people in Britain criticise Israeli policies, they are not criticising Israel as a country, but some of Prime Minister Olmert&#146;s less wise, more foolish, policies in the occupied West Bank? When do the Government think that Prime Minister Olmert is going to commence substantive negotiations with Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority on the real issues required to get to a Palestinian state by the end of this year?</p>

The two issues are not helpfully conflated. On his second point, there is progress in the Annapolis process, and indeed regular meetings are taking place between Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas. Let us hope that they produce results, although whether that will be by the end of the year, I know no more than the noble Lord.</p>

The Israeli authorities have recently announced that 800 settler homes are to be built in East Jerusalem, bringing the total of additional housing units to be built around East Jerusalem since Annapolis to 9,617. Given Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s consistent view that settlement expansion in the occupied territories is illegal, and even the American view that it is unhelpful, will the Government draw the attention of both the Israeli Government and President Bush

We have raised with the Israeli Government our concerns about recent reports of the construction of new housing units in illegal settlements. I say again that this is in breach of Israel&#146;s road map commitments, which call for a freeze on all settlement construction. Moreover, it threatens negotiations on a two-state solution, as my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary was able to see for himself this week.</p>

The rocket attacks into Israeli territories are doing enormous harm both to civilians and the peace process, as are indiscriminate retaliatory actions by Israel against civilians in Gaza. Peace requires that this stops.</p>

When are the next meetings? Would it be fair to say that the most disruptive elements to progress are, first, the Hamas control of Gaza, which splits the entire Palestine case in a tragic way; and, secondly, a point that the noble Lord, Lord Wright of Richmond, rightly made, that the settlements continue to be built over an area which is meant to be Palestine? These surely are the two issues that have to be focused on in a follow-up meeting very soon.</p>

Indeed, the briefings we receive from the United States and others involved in Annapolis are that there are cautious grounds for some optimism around certain components of the deal. That gives us all encouragement. On the second point, obviously the election of Hamas in Gaza makes everything more complicated. But it represented the views of Palestinian citizens at the time of the election and we have to live with these political realities and find a way to make peace despite them.</p>

They believe that there are settlers who need homes and, pending a final solution via Annapolis or another process, they do not see a need to cease this construction activity.

As to the broader point, a number of officials no longer in government, both in the US and in the UK, have made the point that there needs to be contact with Hamas. That is the luxury of not being in office. For those in government on either side of the Atlantic, the quartet principles requiring a cessation of violence, the recognition of Israel and the acceptance of earlier agreements made by the Palestinians remain the pre-conditions for direct contacts by government.</p>

Does he see any real hope that may lead to the re-establishment of a Palestinian Government of National Unity in the near future which would want to live at peace with their neighbours and would be prepared to discuss with them, in peace, how best to achieve that end?</p>

Surely, in the age of food security and food shortages, the very department that is responsible for food and farming should highlight that.

Food, farming and rural affairs are still our priorities. Climate change is a priority, but it encompasses a lot of these other issues. The way we farm and manage the land, and the things farmers can do to mitigate and attack climate change, are a major contribution, as was said during the debates on the Climate Change Bill in this House. Just because the word &#147;farming&#148; is not in the title does not mean that it is not a top priority. As I have just mentioned, one of the department&#146;s strategic objectives is a thriving farming and food sector.</p>

It is interesting that on his website, where they are listed, it says at the bottom that further information can be found on the Treasury website.

I pay tribute to the rural payments agency, because that is a remarkable transformation in the past two years. The people in the office have worked their socks off, in co-operation with farmers and our stakeholders. It gives us a much better chance to make next year, the 2008 payment year, the first normal year of the single farm payment system, which is what we always predicted.</p>

Is he aware that the apparent change of heart on the part of the Government towards railway electrification is very much appreciated? He referred to last year&#146;s White Paper, which seemed to have been based on an oil price of $50 a barrel. With the oil price now at $139 a barrel, it seems that those economics need fundamentally to be changed, particularly in the transport sector. A further appeal of electricity as a means of powering trains is that it can be generated from a variety of sources, produces fewer emissions and is a great deal easier to maintain. The Secretary of State for Transport last week referred to the desirability of a rolling programme of electrification.

Our transport appraisal process takes full account of forecast oil prices and the environmental benefits of electrification. We recognise that oil prices are at record levels, which will undoubtedly improve the business case for electrification. If we are moving in the general direction of increasing electrification, a strong business case is to be made for the Midland and Great Western main lines. Indeed, that business case was set out in the Atkins review in 2007.</p>

They will continue to defend their position, and consequently see no reason to require Post Office Ltd to delay the implementation of its network change programme. Suspension would bring uncertainty for sub-postmasters and customers alike, and add significant costs to Post Office Ltd. It would therefore not be appropriate to suspend the closure programme.</p>

Are not the closures completely at odds with many of the Government&#146;s stated objectives of reducing social exclusion among old people, especially people with disabilities, who should of course be protected by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005? Furthermore, what about curbing carbon emissions? I should have thought that the buses that will be taking protesting pensioners to far-flung post offices would count for the Government in that regard. Also, if the Government lose out on the judicial review, which I believe will take place in October, instigated, incidentally, by two disabled pensioners, Jonathan Coe and Judy Brown, will not the cost of reinstating 2,500 post offices outweigh the cost of keeping them open until the result of the review is known?</p>

But the noble Lord will recognise the obvious fact that usage of post offices is declining at a very significant rate indeed. Only last year, eight out of 10 pensioners had their payments made direct and not through post offices; this year it is nine out of 10. The simple fact of the matter is that people are making their decisions on their own account, which is severely affecting the business of post offices. That is bound to lead to some reductions in the number of post offices.</p>

In most places they are absolutely identical. The constitutional treaty met a sticky end when it was voted down in referenda in the Netherlands and France some years ago. The mystery is this: if our eyes can see the identical words, how is it that&#151;while we see one thing&#151;Ministers insist on seeing something quite different? Of course, the answer requires no detective work at all. We do not need Hercule Poirot to see exactly what has happened. The treaty drafters and this Government have rather cleverly achieved an illusion by using a methodological device to argue that the constitutional concept has been abandoned.

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="080611100000098"></a>This switch is obviously ingenious and delights all the Sir Humphreys, but that view has virtually no support Europe-wide. In fact, almost all Europe's leaders have been frank and candid about what has been done and about the digital enhancement that has taken place to make the text look different. The only body that is constantly quoted as insisting on the difference is the Dutch Council of State. Throughout our debates, that body has been paraded as a fig leaf for the apologists, but when I came to look at the details of its report to the Netherlands Government, even that august body revealingly let slip in that report&#151;should your Lordships be interested, it is on page 9 and again on pages and 10 and 14&#151;that the Lisbon treaty's goals are,</p>
<ul><a name="080611100000292"></a>&#147;in keeping with the EU's constitutional development&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080611100000267"></a>and that the differences with the constitutional treaty, which was turned down, amount to no more than &#147;shifts in emphasis&#148; and the &#147;abolition of symbols&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="080611100000099"></a>The truth is that the treaty and the Bill are the outcome of weak negotiation by a weak and failing Government propped up, of course, by the Liberal Democrat Party. The treaty is crammed with measures that the Government earlier fought desperately to reject. Quite aside from the Bill, the treaty itself and the negotiation give us a very poor deal indeed. As someone said the other day, not since the Convention of Cintra has there been anything as bad out of Portugal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="080611100000100"></a>It is on almost precisely this text now before us that all three parties promised a referendum. All three parties said that they would give the people a say. None of us knows what the people would say nor the outcome of a referendum were there to be one. People in the Republic of Ireland will tell us tomorrow in a referendum what they think. They have had an excellent campaign and debate and it seems that the outcome is

Some people say that it depends entirely on the weather. In thinking about the Irish referendum, we incidentally note and reject the patronising view that the treaty would be too difficult for the British public to understand and that it can be comprehended only by the sublime genius of the minds of the Foreign Office.</p>

<a name="80611-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="080611100000101"></a>We do not know what the outcome would be. We do not know what impact there would be if the treaty falls as a result of the Irish rejection, although we have some reports from Brussels, including the FT&#146;s excellent Quentin Peel, that far from stymieing the EU advance, it would clear matters up and that the smaller member states are longing for the whole thing to be dropped. Mr Peel quotes a Brussels official as saying that few tears would be shed if the whole thing were dropped. We do not know what the impact would be, although we have had many dire predictions. Nor do we know the full purpose of the treaty and what effects it will have on our constitution.</p>

<a name="80611-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="080611100000102"></a>There are legions of known unknowns in this treaty. There are provisions that allow new provisions and powers that permit new powers, and it is full of what astronomers call dark matter. The other night, in an exchange at a late hour, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said that this goes further than any other treaty on accountability. But it goes further than any other treaty in its open-endedness as well. It leaves countless doors and windows open for the new departures, transfers of power and treaty changes without proper parliamentary control. That is the nature of it and I am not sure that any such Bill&#151;people have referred to Maastricht and so forth&#151;with such open-ended features has ever been presented to Parliament before. As a dodgy company floatation prospectus might say, its aim seems to be to carry out an undertaking of great advantage by means and for purposes which will be explained later. I fear that the directors of the South Sea Company would have recognised that approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="080611100000103"></a>We do not know any of those things. However, we do know that the public are being hoodwinked&#151;and the public know that as well. The latest YouGov poll shows that 65 per cent know it is the same text as before. They believe that Labour has broken its promise. Some 51 per cent of those polled want a referendum say on this. The Lord President may have come across this poll and may know something about it. The only misnomer in this excellent poll is the phrase YouGov. We do not &#147;gov&#148;. A failing Government try to &#147;gov&#148; and a so-called listening Government do not listen. The Government say they want to be closer to the people yet take good care to keep as far as they can from them on this issue. The same goes for the Liberal Democrat party and its belief in listening to and being closer to the people&#151;not, it seems, on this issue.</p>

The Government have now defaulted on their promise; they have defaulted on their pledge.

People say, &#147;What about the Maastricht treaty?&#148; or &#147;What about the Single European Act?&#148; Yet this treaty is unique in its open-endedness. That is why it has got such a chunk of attempted accountability in it. It is not nearly enough but it has admittedly got some accountability phrases and provisions in Clause 6.

He has also put forward the key arguments for consideration by your Lordships&#146; House&#151;has there been a broken promise in respect of the referendum and, more generally, what is the case for a referendum which should be addressed by us now and in the future?</p>

<a name="80611-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="080611119000002"></a>I personally disagreed with the Prime Minister&#146;s apparently snap decision, with limited consultation, to promise a referendum on the constitution, and in my conclusion I do not rely on the argument that politicians are entitled to change their minds or, indeed, on the American line that promises are meant to run on and not to stand on. The argument stands on its own merits that a promise was made on the constitution and, therefore, quite properly the noble Lord poses the question: is this effectively the same as the constitution, save for the symbols, the flag and so on? In short, how significant are the differences?</p>

<a name="80611-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="080611119000003"></a>We can of course have the war of quotations and I give the noble Lord credit for not entering into that during his address today. I start from the proposition that there is an arguable case on both sides and it is a matter of judgment. I am prepared to accept that the Lisbon treaty is sufficiently different for the UK, with new elements safeguarding our interests, and that those differences include the protocol in respect of the charter, the key undertakings in respect of the common foreign and security policy and the new safeguards in justice and home affairs.</p>

If the noble Lord took the trouble to read the report prepared by the European Union Committee of this House, he would see that our essential interests were wholly safeguarded in respect of CFSP. There were only two relatively minor elements, for example, in which the European Court of Justice was able to have a role in CFSP, which were much debated in this House. I have come to that conclusion on those areas and I am fortified in my view that there is a sufficient change by the fact that at least nine of the 27 members of the Union proposed to hold

Those countries have exercised their judgment in the same way that I have.</p>

<a name="80611-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="080611119000006"></a>The second issue is that in my judgment the democratic case for a referendum is very weak indeed. I believe that the noble Lord said that the outcome may well depend on the weather. That is hardly a strong democratic argument. Looking over the experience of referendums in this country, the proposal has little relevance to the merits of the case, but rather to the tactical decision, depending on which side of the argument one is. I confess to the House that as regards the referendum in the 1970s on Wales, I was among those who opposed the Government at that time and I argued&#151;I think the noble Lord nods to this&#151;for the referendum, in part, on good tactical reasons. I suspect that the Conservatives&#146; failure to hold a referendum in respect of the Single European Act and on Maastricht was based on similar tactical reasons and not on the merits of the case. Clearly, the case for referendum bristles with problems in practical terms. It depends who puts forward&#151;</p>

Can he not see the point that, because every single political party in the last general election made a commitment that there would be a referendum, this was not an issue in the general election campaign and that people sought to have the debate at a later stage? By denying a referendum now, that debate is denied the people on this vital issue.</p>

I should just give headlines on the other matters: the practical difficulties. It depends on who poses the question and the wider context. My experience of the Welsh referendum in 1979 was that 80 per cent of the people of Wales were against the devolution proposals of the Government. In 1997, 50 per cent were in favour and 50 per cent were against. Does one imagine that there was some mass conversion over that period? No, it was the fact that, in 1997, an incoming Labour Government with an overwhelming majority put forward the proposal, so it depended very much on who posed the question and the wider context. There was a weak Labour Government in 1979, who was highly unpopular, and in 1997, there was a popular Labour Government with a very substantial majority. It depends when the question is put. For example, in Sweden there was general antipathy to the European Union. There was only a brief window of opportunity when the pendulum of Swedish opinion swung in favour of the European Union and by happy chance, or unhappy chance, the Swedes had their referendum at that time. So public opinion can be highly volatile, as we saw in Sweden.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="080611119000011"></a>There can be problems in interpreting the result. If there is a very low participation rate, does one ask what is sufficient in terms of public opinion? Perhaps the real issue is that one cannot reduce such a complex matter to a single issue. I recall that President Mitterrand said that in referendums the French people always answer the wrong question. I was one of those who, on the French referendum on Maastricht, appeared on platforms in France arguing for a &#147;yes&#148; vote at that time. It struck me that the issue was not that of Maastricht, but whether or not one liked President Mitterrand, and there were issues about immigration and textiles which were wholly unrelated to the Maastricht treaty. In the Irish referendum tomorrow, there are questions about abortion, defence and neutrality, which do not appear in this treaty. The question cannot be reduced to a single issue. The fundamental issue is that although in Parliament one can debate and negotiate with opposing groups, in the popular vote one cannot negotiate with the people. If, perchance, the Irish people were to vote against tomorrow, who would know what the particular issues were on which they rejected the treaty?</p>

But it is clear that various devices have been used&#151;that was the case in Denmark, for example, and it led to the second referendum on opt-outs; in Ireland, there could be yet another chance as on the previous occasion. But one cannot negotiate with the people to find out what their main reasons were for rejecting a particular proposal at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="080611119000017"></a>Perhaps I should start by criticising the Labour Government. We are where we are because the Labour Government have, for the past 10 years, failed to make a constructive case for British membership of the European Union. Since they have failed to make that constructive case, the British debate has slipped further backwards towards what one has to call the <I>Daily Mail</I> view&#151;of European integration as a threat. We have heard echoes of that from the noble Lord, Lord Howell. We heard of the Convention of Cintra and had the image of the poor British holed up in a corner of the Continent and forced to submit to humiliating conditions dictated by the French. That is what he implied by that reference.</p>

<a name="80611-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="080611119000018"></a>I have to say to the noble Lord, Lord Howell, that, as I have worked through the details of the Bill&#151;I speak as someone who has worked on the European Union for a long time&#151;I have been struck by the relative modesty of the changes that it makes. They are useful and constructive changes, but this is not a revolution. This is an evolutionary process of amendment.</p>

<a name="80611-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="080611119000019"></a>I want to make a passing comment, since the Irish referendum campaign is clearly preoccupying us, on the Irish &#147;no&#148; campaign. The <I>Irish Times</I> has made it clear in two or three articles in past few days that there is a peculiar coalition of eccentric right-wing millionaires with strong links to the American neoconservatives and left-wing socialists and nationalists in Sinn Fein, and that is not itself such as to encourage enthusiasm, particularly in view of the fact that it has refused to say where its funds have come from&#151;perhaps from non-domiciled and offshore people, as with some people in the Conservative Party.</p>

<a name="80611-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="080611119000020"></a>I note that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, has added his name to this amendment and, from the tone of his introductory speech, I assume that if there is to be a referendum, he will campaign actively for people to say &#147;no&#148;. I note that his colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, does not have his name to the amendment and, from the number of things that he has said in the course of our discussions in this House, it is quite clear that he will be campaigning for a &#147;yes&#148;. So we have a Conservative Party that is likely to be divided on the issue, which is very reminiscent of Harold Wilson&#146;s Labour Party.</p>

I will answer the other question as I continue with my speech.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="080611100000135"></a>If one is making a comparison between Harold Wilson and David Cameron, I note that Melanie Phillips, in Monday&#146;s <I>Daily Mail</I>, drew the comparison between David Cameron and Hamlet. She stated that the opposition leader&#146;s stance,</p>
<ul><a name="080611100000293"></a>&#147;turns Mr Cameron into the Hamlet of the European debate&#151;an awesome talent for speeches denouncing tyranny, but a complete inability to act against it&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611100000268"></a>Melanie Phillips is, of course, much more strongly in favour of the former Tory policy adviser the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, whom she says argues that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="080611100000283"></a>&#147;Britain should renegotiate the terms of its EU membership, restricting it to trade agreements and common security and environment policies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611100000269"></a>As we know, there is a range of opinion on the Conservative Benches. On Monday, the noble Lord, Lord Vinson, said that the European Union is incompatible with British democracy. That is a fairly strong statement.</p>

<a name="80611-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="080611100000136"></a>We look forward with interest to hearing the range of views on this referendum on the treaty. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, that it is a referendum, not the referendum; there are different sorts of referenda and we shall hear various views from the Conservative Benches&#151;from the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, for example.</p>

Many on his Benches want the next Conservative Government&#151;if there is to be one&#151;to promise that, if elected, they will renegotiate the Lisbon treaty. I remind the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, that this is exactly the position taken by Harold Wilson in 1973-74 with his referendum promise to cover up the divisions within his Labour Party, if and when it returned to government. But Harold Wilson, at the very least, had the sense to offer his party, and the public, a referendum on the underlying issue&#151;do we stay in the European Community, as it then was, or leave it?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="080611100000139"></a>The Conservatives are attempting to avoid that question by offering a referendum only on the treaty.

The Conservative Party is in a quite different position from his own. If I am not mistaken, his own party moved an amendment in the House of Commons calling for an &#147;in or out&#148; referendum. The Conservatives did not do that, so they cannot be criticised for not supporting an amendment which the Liberal Democrats moved in the House of Commons. However, the noble Lord&#146;s party most certainly can be criticised. Why does it not make up its mind?</p>

I simply wish to say that the position of my party throughout has been that it is in Britain&#146;s long-term interests to remain a member of the European Union. The present position of the Conservative Party is that it wants to stay half in and half out. However, William Hague, who used to say that the Nice treaty would bring about the end of British democracy, now says that the Lisbon treaty will do that and that the Nice treaty is just about acceptable. When the treaty is ratified, we need an intelligent debate in this country on Britain&#146;s long-term future in the European Union and how that fits with Britain&#146;s position in the world and our foreign policy. My party will lead that debate and we hope that the Government will be willing to join it. We shall be very interested to know where the Conservative Party stands on this altogether.</p>

I believe that referenda are essentially alien in the political democracy in which we thrive. MPs are ultimately answerable to the electorate at the general election, and that should be so. The referendum in 1975, in which I ashamedly voted no, clearly had that demerit. A referendum gives one the opportunity to ventilate one&#146;s feelings on a very wide scale, not least on the general record of the Government in office at the time. The real issue on which a decision is now required is whether we should remain a member of the European Community. All too often, that issue is sidelined, and unfortunately all experience vouchsafes that.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="080611100000149"></a>A referendum on the treaty begs the question of why we did not have one on far more fundamental issues affecting Europe. The voices of the Conservative Party at that time were somewhat muted. The case which the Opposition make for a referendum now revolves around a statement made by Tony Blair when leader of the Labour Party. Accordingly, one is impelled to ask why other statements made by him were not accepted by the Conservatives. Suffice it to say that that statement made by Blair was, in my judgment, wrong, albeit in entirely different circumstances from those which we are considering today. Of course this treaty has certain similarities to the former treaty&#151;that is not surprising&#151;but it is not the same. That has been the subject of many debates on this Bill and I will not enlarge on this theme today, although the issue has been touched on by my noble friend Lord Anderson.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="080611100000150"></a>It is somewhat dismaying that certain politicians, particularly but not exclusively in the Conservative Party, are now prepared to embrace something which they never would touch in government. The logic of their actions is not only opportunistic but extremely perilous. On this issue they have exhibited a unique intellectual barrenness. Not so long ago it voted for, and as a Government believed in, the European Union. Now it has changed and it is sad that it cannot admit that that change has occurred. It stands virtually alone in the European Union. None of its fellow conservative parties in Europe adopts its stance but it has certain allies; for example, the French hunting party, Sinn Fein and Marianne Thieme, the leader of the Dutch Party for the Animals. The Conservative Party is prepared to risk everything. Can we really stand alone when we consider our position with China, India, Russia and the wider world? Is it not important to have an effective voice on climate change, starvation and disease, which affect countless millions in the third world? Are we not more likely to be heard as an influential member of the European Union than if we are outside? Why put all this in danger?</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="080611100000151"></a>Putting aside the Conservative quest for the Man Booker Prize for fiction, are they unconcerned about other issues raised in the treaty, such as the reduction in the size of the Commission, the share of our vote in the European Union, the end of rotating presidencies, children&#146;s rights&#151;which are dealt with in the treaty for the very first time&#151;climate change, international development and much else? This treaty is far more extensive and significant than the constitution which was previously in place. What, then, is the ultimate

Some want to exit from the European Union altogether, while some prefer, for dubious political ends, to play around with this matter, casting no credit on those whom I otherwise respect highly; namely the noble Lords, Lord Howell and Lord Hunt. They took a very different line when they served in government, and I am sad that they have departed from that today.</p>

It is the word &#147;trust&#148;. In 1979, in the May of the general election, I was commanding the troops in Belfast. On the Monday of that week the then Secretary of State, now the noble Lord, Lord Mason, invited a number of us to have a drink with him at Stormont before he returned for the election. At the end of the party, his civil servants formed a double line down the stairs to his car, and as he appeared they began to sing, &#147;Will ye no come back again?&#148;. He put up his hand and said, &#147;Cut that out. Did you not hear our Prime Minister say last October that we had lost the trust of the country? If a party in Government has lost the trust of the country, it will not be elected. I do not expect to get back on Thursday. Thank you for what you have done and goodnight&#148;. He then walked down to his car.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="080611100000153"></a>The business of trust has always seemed to me to be hugely important. As a layman in this matter&#151;I am told that Cross Benchers are best described as radicals of the extreme centre with the right to lash out in every direction&#151;I could not help but read the three manifestos produced in 2005. The Labour Party manifesto stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="080611100000284"></a>&#147;It is a good treaty for Britain and for the new Europe. We will put it to the British people in a referendum and campaign wholeheartedly for a &#145;Yes&#146; vote to keep Britain a leading nation in Europe&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611100000270"></a>Of course we want to be a leading nation in Europe, but that was a firm commitment. As the noble Lord mentioned, a large number of people in this country believe that it was a commitment, and despite the admirable care, determination and attention to detail with which this treaty has been debated in this House, nevertheless for the public there is the matter of trust in their Government&#151;the Government having said that whatever it was, a constitution or whatever, it would be put to them. It is not deserving of trust if that opportunity is denied.</p>

<p><a name="st_87"></a>
<a name="080611100000154"></a><a name="80611-0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80611-0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080611100000408"></a>Lord Blackwell:</b> My Lords, it is a great privilege to follow the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. As he says, the question before the House today is not whether this House approves of referendums and not whether this is a good treaty, but simply whether the Government should be held to their promise to hold a referendum on the constitutional treaty. The Government have erected two lines of defence in order to fend off this possibility.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="080611100000155"></a>Their first line of defence is that the treaty is different, and no doubt we will hear that again when the noble Baroness winds up. She will say that the  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_590"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 590</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>treaty is different because it replaces existing treaties, whereas the Lisbon treaty is an amending measure. You do not have to be a lawyer to understand that it is the treaties that result at the end of the process which have to be looked at, not the process by which you get there or what the treaties are called. You have to compare the text of the constitutional treaty with the European treaties that result at the end of the Lisbon process. I will go on to argue that those two treaties have very similar texts, and it is those texts&#151;those we have at the end of the legal process&#151;that will have a legal and constitutional impact on the UK. The texts of both treaties are primarily existing treaties. In both cases, the existing treaties have been maintained in large part&#151;some amendments were added to the constitutional treaty and the whole text reprinted, while in the case of the Lisbon treaty, the amendments were put in and the whole text was reprinted as a consolidated text. The Government have now provided those for us. To pretend that the two texts are different because they were arrived at by different processes makes for an extremely dubious argument. However many times the Government repeat that these two texts are different, as if repetition on its own will give the statement substance, it is clear that that line of defence has no substance at all.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="080611100000156"></a>Their second line of defence is to say that if you do insist on comparing the texts, it will be clear that they are different. It is an argument the Government have avoided as far as possible&#151;perhaps for the obvious reason that they know the difficulty they would have if this House engaged in it&#151;and they have refused to this point to provide a comparison of the texts of the two treaties side by side.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="080611100000157"></a>In recent weeks, we have had a breakthrough and I am extremely grateful to the Lord President for her correspondence with me on this topic and for putting it in the Library of the House. In that correspondence, the noble Baroness put forward an analysis by Professor Peers which compares the texts of the two treaties. He suggests that there are 35 differences between the text of the constitutional treaty and the consolidated text after the Lisbon amendments&#151;that is 35 differences in treaties containing 400 articles and 328 pages, including the protocols.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="080611100000158"></a>I have asserted in previous debates&#151;and the Government have not rebutted it&#151;that there are only two articles in the constitutional treaty which have not been transferred, in whole or in part, to the consolidated treaty text following Lisbon. I believe three articles have been added to the Lisbon text. The vast majority of these 35 differences&#151;some 30 in all&#151;are simply changes to the wording of articles which appear in both texts and the rest of the articles are the same. The issue for the House is to judge whether those differences are significant.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="080611100000159"></a>There was another breakthrough earlier this week when the counsel for the Government, defending their case in the High Court against Stuart Wheeler, made their case by saying, &#147;Of these 35 differences, we would like to point to five which are particularly significant&#148;. So now we are getting very close to the chase. What were these five? It is important that I should read them out because they are quite interesting.  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_591"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 591</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The first was extending the opt-out on policing and criminal law. I agree there is an extension there. The second was additional warning powers for national parliaments on subsidiarity. Noble Lords can make their own judgment as to how significant that is. The third was the protocol on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which a committee of this House has said makes no difference to the legal standing of the charter. The fourth difference was an express statement that national security is the responsibility of nation states. The fifth difference was the flexibility clause, Article 308 as was, that will now not apply to foreign policy. As the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, said earlier, if those are significant differences from the constitution, you wonder what the assurances we were given at the time of the constitution were worth. It is up to the House to decide whether those five significant areas we are now homing in on justify not having a referendum where the constitutional treaty required one.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="080611100000160"></a>None of these 35 textual changes affects any fundamental aspects of the constitutional treaty on which a referendum was promised. None of them deals with any of the extensions of competences; none of them deals with the extension of QMV; none of them deals with the collapse of the Third Pillar, other than in relation to the increased ability to opt in or out; and none of them deals with the increased powers of the president, the European Court and the European Parliament. So none of the fundamental aspects of the European constitution which led to the commitment to hold a referendum have been changed and the Government are down to using fine amendments to the drafting to escape from their commitment. It is, of course, a judgment that the House has to make, but I believe that both the first and second lines of defence collapse under scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="080611100000161"></a>This leads one to conclude that the only reason the Government are making these arguments is to get themselves off the hook. It is therefore up to this House to stand up for the British people and to protect the promise that was made to them by all the main parties, including my own, that they would have a say and that this constitution would not be passed without their consent. The British people have not been asked that question and have not given their consent. I say to those on all sides of the House who support the direction of the European Union and believe that this is a good treaty, that if they allow the Government to get away with a short-term, expedient win on the referendum, it will only be at the expense of building up the scepticism of the British people and their resentment of the arrogance of those in power. They will have only themselves to blame for the scale of the backlash against the European Union and all those to do with it that will inevitably result.</p>

I say to the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, that when he goes through the minutiae of comparing texts, he should bear in mind that there is a fundamental difference between something called a constitution, which is a constitution and has the role of a constitution, and an amending treaty to the existing one.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="080611100000163"></a>I will give evidence not only of my views but of views that other Governments have taken. For example, the Government of Denmark&#151;much admired in some of our discussions in Committee and on Report by some of the Eurosceptics in this House&#151;were committed to a referendum on the original constitutional treaty. Denmark was one of the member states that had clearly made that the case. In the discussion following the collapse and withdrawal of the constitutional treaty and then the negotiation of the amending treaty, the Danish Justice Ministry reported to the Danish Parliament on the reform treaty. Its view in its published legal analysis was that under the Danish constitution, if powers are transferred to an international organisation by a treaty, that treaty can be ratified only by referendum. It concluded, however, that:</p>
<ul><a name="080611100000294"></a>&#147;for Denmark, the Lisbon Treaty does not transfer new powers to the Union. On this basis, the Justice Ministry concludes&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="080611100000271"></a>and advised Parliament&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080611100000295"></a>&#147;that Denmark can ratify the Lisbon Treaty by normal procedure&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80611-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="080611100000164"></a>So the Danish Government, the Danish Parliament and the Danish people took exactly the same decision as we are being recommended to take in this country. It is a question not of a breach of trust but of a complete change of circumstances. As we heard in Committee&#151;I do not propose to go through it in detail&#151;that is not only the question for ourselves and Denmark; it is also the position in relation to the Netherlands, one of the two countries which, following its then constitutional obligation, had a referendum on the constitutional treaty, which was rejected by the people in that referendum. The Netherlands then referred the new amending treaty to Dutch constitutional experts. The Council of State, having examined the changes, reported that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="080611100000285"></a>&#147;Unlike the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe, it&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611100000272"></a>that is, the reform treaty&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="080611100000296"></a>&#147;provides no arguments for a gradual expansion of the EU towards a more explicit state or federation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611100000273"></a>On the basis of that, the council concluded that there was no need, and no constitutional obligation, to have a referendum.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="080611100000165"></a>We are in the company of good parliamentary systems and good systems of democratic control in those national parliaments&#151;Denmark, much admired by Eurosceptics, and the Netherlands, a good and fundamentally democratic country&#151;and we are following precisely principles and practice. The amendment is an exercise in mischief-making that should be rejected by the House.</p>

I do so because I am above all concerned with what is likely to be the least damaging outcome of this long series of transactions for British interests in the long run and our position within the European Union.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="080611100000167"></a>I start from a premise which regards referenda as alien devices in our constitution. I would not have had a referendum in 1975&#151;I shall come back to that later. Important decisions of this kind are to be taken by a democratically elected Parliament. We get into a bad habit if we go on down the referendum road. It is with only that question that I intend to deal.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="080611100000168"></a>I do so by looking at the dreadful warning of the 1975 referendum. I know that it came out with the right result for almost everyone at that time. That was a piece of luck and depended on a number of other much more fundamental factors. My fear is that a referendum on this issue under this Government at this time will produce an outcome which is disadvantageous to our country.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="080611100000169"></a>I draw two lessons in that respect from our experience in 1975. Nobody can doubt that the decision then being taken was of fundamental importance. Macmillan was the Prime Minister who made our first application to join the Community in 1961. He opened the debate in August 1961 by saying that it was,</p>
<ul><a name="080611100000297"></a>&#147;perhaps the most fateful and forward-looking policy decision in our peacetime history&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611100000274"></a>He was right about that. His successor, Edward Heath, when he came to open the debate on the White Paper in October 1971, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="080611100000286"></a>&#147;I do not think that any Prime Minister has stood at this Box in time of peace and asked the House to take a positive decision of such importance as I am asking it to take tonight&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 28/10/71; col. 2202.].</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611100000275"></a>Those were the views of two distinguished statesmen about the fundamental question of our accession to the European Community, as it then was.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="080611100000170"></a>Neither of them considered at that time that it was necessary to depart from our traditional democratic parliamentary method of deciding it. It was left to Parliament to decide. The first lesson that I draw is that it was not necessary, sought or argued that we should in relation to a decision of such importance of course proceed to the people. It was taken for granted by everyone that it should be taken by Parliament. We came to have the referendum in 1975 not because of any fundamental change in that issue but because of conflicts, tension and strife within the then Labour Government. That is the sharp difference. It was recognised until that happened that a referendum was not to be desired.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="080611100000171"></a>There are three reasons to be drawn from that for believing that it would be wrong to have one now. At least that referendum addressed beyond any doubt a single, intelligible, major, fundamental issue, and that was the issue that was presented to the electorate at that time. The electorate were not presented with a 1,000-page bundle of miscellaneous documents&#151;despite my diligence over many years, I confess that I have not read them all; I am not a master of many of the details. However, I could have coped with the 1975 referendum question, which was:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="080611100000287"></a>&#147;Do you think the UK should stay in the European Community (the Common Market)?&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="080611100000276"></a>That question is relatively simple to understand and hugely fundamental. If you are to have a referendum at all, that is the kind of question to put&#151;not this extraordinary shambles that provokes such dissent and the debates that we are having.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="080611100000172"></a>Moreover, if the Government had failed to secure the affirmative resolution that they wanted from that referendum, that would have had serious implications, but only for the United Kingdom. We were asking ourselves what we should do; it did not matter one jot to the well established, existing Community members. On this occasion it is quite different, having seen the impact throughout the Community of votes that have gone the wrong way, whether in Denmark, France, the Netherlands or&#151;where it may go the wrong way tomorrow&#151;Ireland. It was a different, fundamental question&#151;very simple, and with a referendum quite different from ours.</p>

<a name="80611-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="080611100000173"></a>Even so, although it went the right way, having the referendum in 1975 damaged the interests of the United Kingdom. First, it eroded our credibility, standing and influence within the Community. Happily, I am able to say that restoring our credibility and effectiveness in the Community thereafter was undertaken overwhelmingly under the leadership of my noble friend Lady Thatcher, but that was repairing damage done even by a referendum that had been won. Even then, it had a damaging effect on us, because it also distracted from other business that the UK should have been addressing and had a divisive impact on the Government of that time.</p>

Leaving aside the Stalinist echoes of that remark, I infer that to mean that they went the way that he disagreed with.

Would it be fair to infer from that that he thinks that the people, were they so trusted, would vote no?</p>

I do not disguise my own belief that we ought to retain our position as an increasingly effective member of the European Union. Moreover, I am glad that that is the objective of all the political parties represented in this House, except UKIP. I am delighted, for example, that my own party, through its leader and its spokesman on foreign affairs, has left nobody in any doubt that we intend to and must remain within the European Community, or European Union as it is now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="080611100000176"></a>I have not dealt with the mistrust argument, although I recognise its power. I just do not believe that we should go through a referendum procedure to remedy the betrayal at which people are entitled to point. That is not right. It is not right to use this House to correct the misdeeds of the democratic Chamber, nor, in this respect, to correct the misdeeds of the Government themselves. I put that on one side, but with great regret.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="080611100000179"></a>On the referendum, I am not predicting the answer because I do not like it. I made it clear that we definitely need to be in the Union, playing an effective role. I am prepared that that should happen on the basis of the treaty of Lisbon, which is neither in my judgment necessary nor ideal as a treaty in that form. Yet it is there, and a rejection of it now by this country would lead to a shambolic situation about our status in the Union thereafter.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="080611100000180"></a>One of the matters that one can take account of is very simple. It is quite possible that if this treaty were put to a referendum unsullied, on the strength of its own merits, it might be endorsed on any view of it. But if it is to be put before the electorate by a Government who have already discredited themselves by their initial betrayal and are, above all, in the pit of dismissal, derision and abuse, I can hardly see the case being presented successfully by a Prime Minister who is at a record low point with the electorate. It would be an unnecessary referendum being presented by unattractive advocates in circumstances that are not good.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="080611100000181"></a>We should stand by our long-standing procedures, as did Ted Heath, Harold Macmillan and the party that took the fundamental decision to take us into the European Union. We should have the courage to say, &#147;I&#146;m sorry, people, but this is something for which our parliamentary democracy is in the last resort the right tribunal to make this decision&#148;&#151;and proceed on that basis. It may not be the most popular thing to advocate in the House, but I think that it is the right thing to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="080611100000186"></a>On the referendum and the manifesto commitment, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. It is an issue of trust, but also simply of honourable government. You cannot make a major manifesto commitment, as it was in the eyes of the public, and then act almost with contempt in not honouring it.

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="080611100000187"></a>The Government&#146;s main argument on the manifesto commitment is that the changes to the treaty are not significant. That is not a strong argument. I and many others in this House would say that there are significant changes but, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, pointed out, there are also the changes that have been set out and acknowledged by other European state leaders as significant. They have been entirely clear about that. Therefore, the main argument is defused. Even if it were not, it is set aside by the simple issue of honouring a manifesto commitment.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="080611100000188"></a>I want briefly to say something about my own experience of Europe in general. Unlike, I suspect, many in this House and across the country, I was brought up, until the age of 10 or 11, entirely in France&#151;in Paris&#151;Germany and Austria. I was brought up in a family which read Goethe in German, and played and sang Schubert in the evenings. They may today be described as Europhiles. They had a great regard for European culture, but that has nothing to do with desiring a political union across Europe. Secondly, in the 1975 referendum, I, like many people here, voted to stay in, but what I voted for was not a European Union but an EEC, as it was described. I voted for a European Economic Community and nothing more.</p>

Since then, there has been huge change. Little by little, stealth by stealth, we have given away sovereign powers over many areas, including judicial, legal and environmental matters, fishing, employment, human rights and business. Sovereign powers have been given away, which we never thought would happen in 1972.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="080611100000191"></a>Then came my experience of working in Europe. In 1998 I was asked to take on the rather ridiculously Gilbert and Sullivan-style title of president of the Trans-Manche region. This was a grandly titled, artificially devised region between Kent, where I was involved, Nord-Pas-de-Calais in France, Flanders and Wallonia. I thought that this would be a good thing to do. It would encourage transport, business and tourism links with European countries. I brushed up on my French and went into it with great enthusiasm, but I found, after a few months, that the system added absolutely nothing. My local government officers said that it was like wading in treacle. Our experience, having started with huge enthusiasm, changed to one of feeling that there was simply nothing to be got out of this. The bureaucracy and endless meetings with commissioners were simply not producing anything. After one year

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="080611100000192"></a>Finally, I have already spoken of the sovereign powers that we have given away. I feel immensely strongly that we have given away more sovereign powers in the few years between 1999 and 2008. With regard to the treaty and the manifesto, even if we give away only insignificant powers, those are not acceptable. The whole premise of the Government is that we are not giving anything away. That cannot be true because we have been asked to give away having a president of Europe and there are other examples. To say that we are giving nothing away and therefore do not need a referendum simply cannot be right. Therefore, I fully support the amendment.</p>

I am afraid that history is important to this issue. In March 1972, the other place was faced with an amendment for a referendum before we could accede to the treaty to join the European Community. There was considerable debate. On 15 March, the Labour Party leadership came out against a referendum. On 16 March, President Pompidou declared that there would be a referendum in France on the question of enlargement from six to nine and taking in the United Kingdom. On 24 March, the then Prime Minister, Edward Heath, announced that there would be a periodic referendum in Northern Ireland to decide the question of whether Northern Ireland would ever join with the Republic. On 29 March, the Labour Party&#146;s leadership decided that there would be a referendum and that they would vote for the amendment. That amendment was not carried, but the Labour Party, in its manifesto for the 1974 election, made a commitment to a referendum and faithfully carried that out and legislated for it. It may have been reluctantly, but the noble and learned Lord supported that referendum and, I might add, he was a member of the Government in 1972 when the pledge for the Irish referendum was made. Indeed, he was a distinguished legal adviser of that Government.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="080611100000194"></a>We then persisted to a situation where the Labour Party in opposition decided that it would come out from the European Community without even a referendum. I diametrically differ from the noble and learned Lord in his view that that 1975 referendum was irrelevant and damaging. In my view, it was the central issue that meant that when the Labour Party went to the country on that manifesto in 1983, it was rejected. Having been given the chance to decide whether to stay in or stay out, the British people wished to retain that choice. It was a fundamentally stabilising and welcome factor in changing the mind of the Labour Party to become, as it is today in Government, an enthusiastic supporter of the European Union. It also laid the foundation for a broad consensus on European Union membership which still lasts across the parties, for all the divisions, today. History will show that Harold Wilson showed a lot more courage

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="080611100000195"></a>It goes on longer than that. This is not an alien concept. We have had three general elections&#151;in 1997, 2001 and 2005&#151;in which all three parties committed themselves to a referendum on the question of whether we should join the euro-zone. My views are well known in the House. I have campaigned against that on economic and political grounds but fundamentally on economic grounds. As we now face the downturn in the world economy and the problems of adjustment for the UK economy there must be pretty few people in this House who are not glad that we have the compensating measure of being able to devalue and are not held in a fixed exchange rate.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="080611100000196"></a>It goes further than that. The noble Lord said that he had disagreed with the decision of the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to have a referendum when he announced it in 2004. That is not really the important decision. Of course he was Prime Minister but he went on to compound that judgment by putting it in his manifesto in the 2005 election. So did the other two parties; all three parties fought that election on a referendum. This is, with respect to the noble Lord, not an alien concept. He may fundamentally disagree with it and there may be many people in this House who believe that this is a parliamentary democracy and they do not wish to see referendums. Yet that commitment in Northern Ireland has been a positive one. I have profound doubts whether we would have been able to have the successful negotiations that started under the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, as Prime Minister and went on through her successor John Major and then on with Tony Blair. Those who feared that they would be forced against their will by a government who were not prepared to listen to them found solace and satisfaction in that there would have to be a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="080611100000197"></a>As people have become more alienated for many complex reasons from what I call representative government, the sort of democracy which I support, from time to time it is necessary to accept that there are some issues which split parties and families and are easier and better dealt with by a referendum. Having defended the constitutional place of referendums&#151;not frequently, I do not want to become a plebiscitary democracy&#151;I want to retain the concept that a government are elected on a manifesto which they broadly speaking maintain for a four-year or five-year term and are judged overall during that period when they come back to the electorate. However, from time to time, and particularly when they promise in an election to have a referendum, that new way of democratic expression should be maintained, honoured and not spurned or despised.</p>

Surely the great strength of the European project is maintaining and enhancing peace while promoting a common prosperity in a democratic way. If so, let us ensure that the emerging entity is grounded in Pericles&#146; observation: &#145;Although only a few may originate a policy, we are all able to judge it&#146;&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="080611100000199"></a>When we decide in an election, the vast majority of the public have not the slightest idea of our various manifestos, commitments and the detail of the legislation. They make a broad assumption, a broad judgment, about who is competent, who they trust, and whether they need an alternation of power to ensure the best aspect of democracy&#151;that power changes at fairly frequent intervals.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="080611100000200"></a>The key question today is this: no one denies that they were promised a referendum; the defence is that this treaty is different. I personally think that it is different and I can point to different elements, subsections and clauses with which I agree. But in view of the fact that there has been a manifesto commitment, our judgments are not anywhere near as important as those of the people. Opinion poll after opinion poll shows that the majority of the people of this country do not see any fundamental difference between the constitution and the treaty. The people also tell us something else, which is profound. They want to be able to express their views on this.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="080611100000201"></a>I do not know what will happen in Ireland tomorrow. Just as the Dutch and the French people held the destiny of the European Union in their hands and voted &#147;no&#148;, on&#151;whatever may be said and wherever you sit&#151;a treaty which was great deal better than that put forward by Giscard d&#146;Estaing, which the then Prime Minister said he would have supported, it is much easier to look at this treaty. Nevertheless, the people think that this is still an issue on which they should have the last word.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="080611100000202"></a>I would go further if the Irish were to vote for this treaty and if Britain were to be alone in making a decision. I must say something that will probably annoy and surprise quite a number of people. For many of the reasons that were made clear by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, I still think that it is in Britain&#146;s interests to play a full and constructive role. Despite my anger that the Government have not taken the opportunity to put in some of the parliamentary brakes that have been discussed on restricting the competence of the European Court of Justice to do exactly what is in the treaty and try to narrow down

That is a personal decision. It would be one vote in a referendum. It might not win it or it might.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="080611100000203"></a>It is defeatism for those who support this treaty to say that they cannot win a referendum. If you are democrats, you should have the courage of your convictions and go out and win it. I, for one, would support it in those circumstances.</p>

I would add to what my noble friend has said; like him I have been a Minister in a Conservative Government and had the honour to serve under my noble friend Lady Thatcher. There was many an occasion on which I relied on the support and loyalty of my Back-Benchers, even if they were not altogether sure that they agreed with me. There were some occasions when that loyalty was strained too far, but I respected and admired that. It is not likely that I differ from the Front Bench on this issue, but one has to retain one&#146;s independent judgment and this is a matter of sufficient importance that I feel obliged to do that.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="080611100000205"></a>I object to referenda on fundamental constitutional grounds. I disagree with what the noble Lord, Lord Owen, has said, both on constitutional theory and on the history. I want to say a word about both. I am a believer in parliamentary government and in parliamentary democracy and it is for exactly those reasons that I was very sympathetic to the amendment put forward by my noble friend Lord Goodlad, which would have required Parliament to approve any change in the opt-in, opt-out situation. I really believe that and I think that the consequence of going for referenda is to debase and to weaken the long tradition of parliamentary democracy which is so important for this country.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="080611100000206"></a>It is all very well for the noble Lord, Lord Owen, to say that he is not a believer in plebiscitary democracy and that he does not want referenda to be held that often, but, on this occasion, he tells us, the people would like one. The truth is that, for every public opinion poll that has ever been taken on any issue, however minor, if you were to ask the people whether they would like a vote, the answer would always be yes. What does one expect people to say? That is no foundation for a fundamental change to our constitution, even if it were to be comparatively infrequent.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="080611100000207"></a>If referenda are to be held, they should be held only in the rarest circumstances, when really major constitutional decisions are taken, involving a substantial transfer of sovereignty. Having heard and followed the debates as closely as I could, and having read the treaty, I cannot bring myself to say that it involves a substantial transfer of sovereignty. Compared with the Maastricht treaty, the Nice treaty and all the other  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_601"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 601</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>treaties that have been put through, this is important and necessary but comparatively piddling. It is piddling in constitutional terms and necessary and important in political terms. It is necessary and important in political terms because it makes the necessary changes to accommodate the enlargement of the European Union, for which all parties in this House argued strongly and for which we had to fight to get. It is necessary and important because it provides greater possibility of Europe speaking with one voice on important matters, such as foreign affairs, energy, climate change and so on. It is in our interests that Europe should speak with one voice, but it is also important to remember that in constitutional terms it is piddling in the sense that it is not a substantial transfer of sovereignty.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="080611100000208"></a>Take, for example, one of the most important aspects of the treaty, which has been the subject of much debate: the creation of a more permanent president of the European Union. That is desirable because it makes it more probable that there will be continuity, enabling a common view to be built up. However, the really important thing is that that president has no more power than the existing transient six-monthly president of the European Union. He is not given any more power at all. It is merely the creation of an institution which we hope, with reason, will lead to agreement being reached, but if agreement is not reached, unanimity will still be required. That is just one example and I shall not bore the House by giving many examples of why this is not a substantial transfer of sovereignty.</p>

<a name="80611-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="080611100000209"></a>Then we come to the historical argument that there has been some sort of change in the convention. Of course, the concept of having a referendum is not new in this country and of course, people have wanted them and argued for them, usually, although not always, for opportunistic reasons, but the fact is that apart from the very special case of local referenda, in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, there has not been a single national referendum since 1975. My reading of the history is slightly less benign than that of the noble Lord, Lord Owen. A referendum was introduced because the Labour Party was bitterly divided and the only way to maintain the Government in power was to have a referendum on whether to stay in.</p>

The fact that political parties&#151;rightly or wrongly; in my view wrongly&#151;promised a referendum on the previous treaty should be decisive for the House in deciding whether or not to require a referendum to be introduced. We have to exercise our personal judgment and make a personal decision about whether it is in the interests of this country, in terms of the evolution of the constitution of this country&#151;whether we want to have more referenda&#151;and in terms of the impact of what we are doing on Europe.</p>

The Salisbury convention was a prudent, self-denying ordinance of the House not to use its legal power to frustrate the will clearly expressed by an incoming Government in their manifesto. It is quite a different matter for this House to say that it has the right not just to refrain from stopping a Government implementing their promises, but to force a Government to implement their promises. Whatever the considerable merits of your Lordships' House, which we all agree about, it is not an elected body, and it is peculiarly inappropriate to say, &#147;Not only should the Government keep their promise but we, of all people, are insisting that they do so by a particular form of populous democracy&#151;that is, a referendum&#148;. There is something faintly ironic, and beyond, in this House arrogating to itself the intention or the right to do that. It is for those reasons that I cannot go along with the proposal that there should be a referendum.</p>

I read about, and understood, what I was being asked to vote on, and I voted &#147;Yes&#148;. The problem is that if there is a referendum now, being one of the Lords Spiritual in this House, I no longer have a vote, so I ask not to be deprived of what I had lost in Uganda.</p>

<a name="80611-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="080611100000239"></a>The question of whether Britain should join the European Community, as it then was, was of immense importance. Even if one took the view, as I did, that in a parliamentary representative democracy referenda are not ideal because they tend to lead, despite the disavowal of the noble Lord, to a plebiscitary notion of how we should govern ourselves, it was arguable then that this was an issue that should be decided by the public.</p>

<a name="80611-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="080611100000240"></a>By any objective test, the Lisbon treaty is a very different matter for this country. Having served, along with the noble Lords, Lord Tomlinson and Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, on the convention that drafted the constitutional treaty, I am bound to say that in my judgment, even if the constitutional treaty had been adopted, it is arguable whether it would have been sensible to have a referendum. I know the political arguments&#151;I heard them in my own party&#151;as to why we should have one. Once again, it was arguable that this treaty, drafted and signed by 27 members, which purported to establish a framework that would in some sense be final and a framework for further jurisdiction by the European Court of Justice, was of such emblematic importance that it was necessary or appropriate to have a referendum. In the case of the treaty of Lisbon, which is just one of a series of amending treaties, I cannot understand why the Conservative Party in opposition finds it necessary to argue that it should be treated any differently from those that it was responsible for negotiating in connection with the Single European Act.</p>

In order to reinforce his point, I refer to the example of the Netherlands that was quoted earlier. The Dutch people are, I believe, as deeply attached to democracy as we are in this country and yet there seems to be little clamour in the Netherlands for a referendum on this treaty. Is it not the fact that the Netherlands has largely accepted the advice of the independent Council of State that the two treaties are very different?</p>

I take the view that the treaty of Maastricht had a much greater effect on the governance of this country, as did the Single European Act, over which the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, presided and which was also of much greater significance in terms of the transfer of sovereignty. It is an absolute travesty to talk about the transference of sovereignty in the Lisbon treaty. The mere repetition of this by the rag press in this country should not disguise from sophisticated Members of this House the reality of the limitations of the Lisbon treaty.</p>

To me that is almost as significant as the differences between the substance of the constitutional treaty and the terms of the Lisbon treaty, which the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, enumerated in some detail. The only sense in which I disagreed with him was in his evaluation of the importance of these differences. I believe that they are profoundly different in that they modify the extent to which this country will be driven forward by decisions within the European Union in the areas where we have an opt-out.</p>

Those who are treating this as a matter which could be easily decided by the public one way or the other are overlooking how this action is perceived in other European countries today. There is, for the European Union as for this country, a growing danger of marginalising ourselves in the debates of the Union, and there is a growing danger that as the world becomes more fragile, more vociferous and less mindful of what lead to the setting up of the Union, through our navel gazing we will cease to play the part we ought to play&#151;the influential role. When we take actions of the kind being proposed here, in the circumstances of the day, when so much has changed in the European Union and the treaty over the past two or three years, it is a kind of self-indulgence and an abnegation of our responsibility to use our judgment about what is appropriate in fulfilling our role as Members of this Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="080611100000251"></a>The questions I want to ask are simple: was a promise made to the electorate; is the promise still applicable; and should it be honoured? Everyone is agreed that there is no doubt that all three parties made manifesto commitments, and certainly the Labour Party made a commitment to put the constitutional treaty to the electorate by way of a referendum. That takes one on to the second question: is it still applicable? The only reason I have heard for it not being applicable is that we are now looking at a different creature from that considered by the Constitution Committee. I have this to say to noble Lords: I served on that committee under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, when we were looking at the constitutional treaty. Today I looked back at the report published at the time, the 41st report of the committee in 2003-04, where we reported on the convention&#146;s draft constitutional treaty on the future of Europe.</p>

<a name="80611-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="080611100000252"></a>In passage after passage of that report there are references to the proposals we are now considering under the current Bill and have been talking about for weeks. I put it to noble Lords that what we now have in the Lisbon treaty is a repackaging of what was in the constitutional treaty with some changes and some add-ons. To me that makes not the slightest difference if at the heart of it is the old constitutional treaty&#151;it is all there. I do not think that Mr Blair or Mr Brown promised that there would not be a comma added, a change made, or even the 35 changes referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell. We have the essence of it here, and lawyers are perfectly capable of looking at it to see whether the essence remains. We have been doing that in tax avoidance schemes for years.</p>

<a name="80611-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="080611100000253"></a>I was told that if I looked at the report of the Dutch Council of State, I would be impressed by it. Indeed, my noble friend Lord Hannay is an enthusiast. With great respect to the Council of State, I have to say it deploys arguments of a character which carry absolutely no conviction with myself or, I should have thought, with many lawyers. On page 11, the report states that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is no longer within the treaty, as it was in the constitution. However, Article 6 tells us that it is to have exactly the same standing as if it were included; the point is of treaty quality. To me, it does not make a fig of difference whether it has been moved out and does not form part of a pillar. The council goes on to say that the second element to be used in assessing the proposed reform treaty is the division of competences, while the next sentence states that the division will not be substantially affected by the proposed reform treaty. It then points out that there are differences, but that the substance is not changed.</p>

<a name="80611-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="080611100000254"></a>When we come to the symbols, the name of the treaty establishing a constitution reflected a particular vision of European co-operation. The existing treaties were to be repealed and replaced by a treaty which is a single, binding constitutional document embracing the entire constitutional order, and was unprecedented in the Union&#146;s political history. But what if those same provisions are just scattered like peppercorns by way of amendments over the existing treaties? It is all there, but the fact is that it is not labelled as a constitutional treaty. It goes on to point out that the state symbols  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_608"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 608</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have been removed: that there is nothing about an anthem and there is nothing about a flag. But the anthem still plays and the flags still fly in front of every hotel. There is an omission, it states: it is no longer said that EU law is supreme. But there is a declaration to that effect; no one doubts that that has been the case law for many years.</p>

<a name="80611-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="080611100000255"></a>After all that, it states that the significance of these changes should not be underestimated. I suggest that the changes are of no material importance and that what we have is the old Lisbon treaty. The two treaties are recognisably the same&#151;they are not identical of course&#151;and a promise has been made; that promise ought now to be fulfilled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="080611100000256"></a>In his maiden speech at Second Reading, which impressed me very much at the time, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chichester reminded the House of a figure known to me in my youth&#151;not personally but I knew of his reputation&#151;George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester. He was a figure of towering moral strength but I shall mention only one or two of his achievements. In the 1930s he rescued, or did his best to rescue, churchmen who were being tyrannised by Hitler; he moved on to help Jews to escape; he was the first churchman to go to the Isle of Man to see that remarkable array of scholars, engineers, lawyers and so on who were arrested overnight and whisked off there. His courage was such that he stood in the then House of Lords&#151;not this building because it had been blitzed&#151;in wartime and said that the policy of obliterating Berlin was immoral and that there was no justification for pursuing it. For me, he is a towering moral figure and I cannot help asking myself how he would regard a Government failing to carry out a manifesto pledge of this character.</p>

As I understand it, his case is based not on whether referendums are good or bad, not on whether this treaty is good or bad and not on whether the Opposition, when they were in Government, had a referendum on the treaty for which they were responsible. His is a very straightforward point: he claims that the Government promised a referendum on this treaty at the time of the last election and that, in all conscience, therefore, the Government should hold the referendum now. That, as I understand it, is his fundamental case.</p>

That would have been a referendum on a treaty which would have been the totality of the existing provisions of European Union treaties for the past 50 years, which have made up so much of our constitutional position in Europe. A referendum on the Lisbon treaty, however, would be a referendum only on this single amending Act. It would be an Act of no more importance than its four immediate predecessors. That would be a very different proposition from that of a referendum on the old constitutional treaty, and that is why no promise has been broken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="080611132000010"></a>I shall be brief. I want in part to answer the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Symons. If she is correct in her prediction that the Government will win this vote tonight, the Government will live to regret it. They may live to regret it as quickly as Friday when we hear the result of the Irish referendum. Even if they do not do so then, I believe that what Nick Clegg said before he was leader of the Liberal Party and before he changed his mind on this issue is true. He wrote in the <I>Guardian</I> that if the parties in this country were going to deny a referendum about the treaty to the British public it would increase cynicism not just about politics but about politicians dealing with Europe. He said that, if denied a referendum, the public would think that the politicians did not, as he put it, have &#147;the <I>cojones</I>&#148; to carry the argument about a referendum to the public. There was something rather ironic in the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, attacking the Labour Government for not taking the argument about the treaty and Europe to the public when what he was doing was to argue against taking the issue to the public.</p>

<a name="80611-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="080611132000011"></a>Comparisons have been made with the Maastricht treaty, with which I was involved. On the most important aspect of the treaty of Maastricht, which was the possibility of the introduction of the euro to this country, the Conservative Party&#151;followed by the Labour Party&#151;promised to have a referendum were the euro ever to be introduced. That pledge, on that most important part of the Maastricht treaty, still applies and is still upheld not just by the Conservative Party but by the Labour Party as well.</p>

<a name="80611-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="080611132000012"></a>It was the Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, who said on 3 July 2007 (at col. 803 of the <I>Official </I><I>Report</I>) that the Maastricht treaty involved &#147;a smaller transfer of power&#148; than this treaty. He may not have meant it; it may have been a slip; but perhaps it was a slip in which he spoke more wisely than he knew. However, the point is not a sterile argument about one treaty compared with another. The fact is that we have had a whole series of treaties&#151;Maastricht, Nice, Amsterdam and Lisbon&#151;all of which have gone a bit further. Have we reached a tipping point? Have we reached a point at which the accumulation of powers justifies this issue being put to a referendum as was promised by all political parties at the previous election?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="080611132000013"></a>The public have demonstrated, again and again, that they would like a referendum. It has been demonstrated in opinion polls. My noble friend Lord Brittan said that if you ask the public whether they

Possibly; but if they have actually been promised a referendum they are quite likely to want it even more. We have had referenda organised in 10 parliamentary constituencies under the auspices of the Electoral Reform Society, in which large numbers of people have voted and shown that they do not wish to accept this treaty. In one such referendum held in the constituency of Eastleigh, represented in another place by Mr Chris Huhne, more people voted for the principle of having a referendum than had for Mr Huhne at the general election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="080611132000014"></a>On the point that the treaty of Lisbon differs from the constitutional treaty, at the very beginning of our debates the noble Baroness&#151;although she handled each debate with great charm and skill&#151;said, rather insidiously, that we should not have any quotations from foreigners. I could not really understand why: could it just be because almost every head of state is on record as having said that the differences between the treaty of Lisbon and the constitutional treaty are non-existent? With one exception, I will adhere to what the noble Baroness said. I will not quote the Belgian or Finnish Foreign Ministers; I will not quote Bertie Ahern, or the Italian or French Prime Ministers, but they all said it, again and again. I will not quote their actual words, but when the now Lord Chancellor, Mr Jack Straw&#151;I do not think he is a foreigner&#151;was asked in another place what constituted a constitutional treaty, and therefore made a referendum necessary, he said that you ought to have a referendum if it is a constitutional treaty, and what constitutes that is having an EU President and an EU Foreign Minister. Well, we have a different name for the Foreign Minister but those two proposals, which he said justified a referendum, are still here.</p>

<a name="80611-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="080611132000015"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Symons, argued that the constitutional treaty is very different from the Lisbon treaty, and that it repealed existing treaties whereas the Lisbon treaty does not. Yet, as my noble friend Lord Blackwell pointed out, she did not say that while the constitutional treaty abolished the treaties, it then went on to write the provisions back into the text. So, what is the actual difference? Now, this is where I will break the rule and quote one foreign politician, because President Giscard d&#146;Estaing, the author of the constitution, gave the answer when he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="080611132000112"></a>&#147;In the treaty of Lisbon, the tools are largely the same. Only the order in which they are arranged in the toolbox has been changed. Why this subtle change?&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611132000104"></a>I quote this because it is as revealing as all the other quotes that I am not using would have been: they tell us the motive. He went on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="080611132000113"></a>&#147;Above all, it is to head off any threat of referenda by avoiding any form of constitutional vocabulary&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611132000105"></a>There, we know it.</p>

<a name="80611-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="080611132000016"></a>I could, indeed, also quote the correspondence that the German presidency under Angela Merkel circulated in canvassing this idea of using the device of having not a constitutional treaty but an amending one, with its political advantages. If there is any doubt that there is no difference between the two, it was made clear by my noble friend Lord Blackwell in pointing out that the Government have very kindly not just given us the  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_613"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 613</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>treaty, but printed the consolidated text. With that and the amending treaty within it, we can compare it with the original constitutional treaty, and they are virtually the same.</p>

<a name="80611-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="080611132000017"></a>The other point made was that Britain was perhaps signing a different treaty from that signed by other countries, because of the Government&#146;s red lines. But the point that I made to the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, needs an answer. I pointed out to him that at the moment when the Government made their promise to have a referendum they had achieved many of their objectives on the red lines. In particular, they had achieved the objective that foreign policy was not subject to control outside this country. The noble Lord answered me by saying that the red line remained in place, but that is not the point. The promise was made that we would have a referendum, even though the red line had been achieved. They said that the treaty, even with the red lines, deserved a referendum, so why are we not having one now?</p>

<a name="80611-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="080611132000018"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, said, in his usual very even-handed and fair way, that there were differences between the two, but they are not large. I agree with him. There is the difference in how the Charter of Fundamental Rights is treated, subject to a protocol. But many people, including Select Committees in the other place, have argued that the protocol is not guaranteed to be watertight, and many academic lawyers have argued the same. So it would hardly seem that that by itself justified the abandonment of the commitment that was given to have a referendum.</p>

<a name="80611-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="080611132000019"></a>This is a sad day for politics. I make no criticism at all of those who, like my noble friend and my noble and learned friend sitting beside me, have always been against referenda and who have made clear in the past their opposition to referenda on this sort of issue. Maybe the arguments are not overwhelming and maybe there never should have been a promise to hold a referendum; maybe it was not wise and maybe the treaty is not as different from others as I profoundly believe that it is. The fact is that the Government made a promise and should stick to it. The Liberals also went along with it, but they have not just ratted&#151;they have re-ratted and re-re-ratted. First, they were for a referendum, then they were for abstaining, adamant for drift&#151;and now they are firmly against a referendum. Who knows where they will be tomorrow?</p>

<a name="80611-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="080611132000020"></a>If this amendment is defeated tonight, it would certainly be bad for our involvement in Europe but, above all, it is bad for politics in this country.</p>

I begin by saying very directly that I find the words of the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, for whom I have very considerable respect, offensive to an extraordinary degree. The Liberal Democrats, ever since 1981, when we were formed as an alliance and then became a merged party in 1987, have been consistently in favour of this country&#146;s full membership of the European Union and of many of the ways in which we believe that we can confront the dreadful issues that now face us in the world. We have been the most consistent of the three major parties in this country, in that regard.</p>

<a name="80611-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="080611132000030"></a>Let me go back historically for a moment. The Conservatives, under Mr Edward Heath, were the leading voices in favour of the European Union. Very shortly afterwards, they entered into some of the most far-reaching understandings, which carried this country into a considerable level of integration on the economic front under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher. They continued in that same guise until the time of the premiership of Mr John Major&#151;a deeply divided premiership, in which the Conservative Party began the process of reaching fission on the issue of the European Union. Then, finally, in opposition, they have come out increasingly against the Lisbon treaty and, for that matter, moves towards greater integration in other areas of policy, such as climate change. This has not been the story of a consistent party.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="080611132000031"></a>The Labour Party, in the days when I still belonged to it, was very much in favour of the European Union after the 1975 referendum. I shall have a word or two to say about that in a moment. By 1980 it had already changed its policy through 180 degrees, and decided that it wanted to leave the European Economic Community, as it then was. In 1981 it confirmed this at that year&#146;s conference, deciding that it was committed to leaving. It stuck by that decision in the 1983 manifesto. Since that time it has been, first, indecisive, and then, in 1997 under the leadership of Tony Blair, enthusiastically supportive of the European Union. It is, again, a picture that has been very much coloured by what were seen to be the political advantages or disadvantages, in which the European Union itself played a secondary role to electoral and partisan considerations. I must reject what I regard as the rather cheap crack to the effect that, in some ways, the Liberal Democrats do not know where they are. On any proper reading of the last 25 years, they have known exactly where they are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="080611132000032"></a>I turn from that to the noble Baroness, Lady Symons of Vernham Dean, who said, with her usual cogency, something important that has not played a prominent part in this debate. In subsuming all existing treaties,  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_615"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 615</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the changes that would have been made under the constitutional treaty proposal were more far-reaching than those in the treaty of Lisbon. Indeed, it would simply have prevented a whole set of parliamentary debates on earlier treaties, such as those of Nice and Maastricht, and even going back to the treaty of Amsterdam. She is absolutely right about that. It was a very far-reaching change in the category of legislation, which brought it within a different sphere from that of the treaty of Lisbon. I will not go into detail, although there are some interesting details. For example, in evidence given to the European Union Committee, Professor Dashwood specifically proposed that, under the treaty of Lisbon, the CFSP was defended and treated according to separate rules and understandings from those that would have been the case under the constitutional treaty. That was accepted by the European Union Committee. There are other examples, particularly in the field of foreign affairs, where one can point to a considerable distinction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="080611132000033"></a>I return to an earlier point for a moment. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, took us back to the 1975 referendum. In doing so, he was right to distinguish between what was probably the single most fateful debate that this country has had since the Second World War on where its future lies, and the many other treaty changes with respect to the European Economic Community and the European Union. It is an issue of such majesty that I believe there is a case for a referendum. At that time, I disagreed with my colleagues, Lord Jenkins and the noble Lord, Lord Thomson of Monifieth, when they resigned from the Shadow Cabinet in opposition to the referendum. I thought that in rare, exceptional cases, where the whole future of a country was being decided, there was a case for a referendum. It is absolutely crucial, in the interests of Parliament and parliamentary sovereignty, that the distinction is clearly made. Those who are pressing for a referendum on the Lisbon treaty are blurring a crucial line.</p>

<a name="80611-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="080611132000034"></a>Let us ask why. If referenda&#151;although there are some cases for them&#151;are to be truly representative of the attitudes of the people, they must be governed by rules and conventions that hold. The 1975 referendum was closely bound by such rules. Both sides&#151;and both sides crossed party lines&#151;got together to decide that every single household should receive a statement from each side and a statement by the Government. I repeat: both sides were cross-party. Money was spent on enabling the people to understand the issues at stake. Compare that to today. The British people have been deprived&#151;I have to say this&#151;by the previous Government of virtually any serious attempt to let them know exactly what is going on in the European Union. The difference is like that between night and day. There has been virtually no attempt by the Government, under Mr Blair, to rebut some of the wildest charges made against the European Union, There has been no attempt to correct the record, even where the issues are purely factual. For years, we have all read rubbish about the behaviour of the European Union. No attempt has been made to correct it.</p>

I conclude by pointing to one last factor, which it is crucial that we take into account. I have mentioned the way in which, tragically, referenda can now be effectively influenced. I will go further: they can sometimes even be bought. In the Republic of Ireland, Libertas, the main funder of the no side of the argument, has recently refused to give information about where its donations come from, simply reiterating that it has kept within the law, and refusing to answer questions about that law. This is a moment when Parliament must decide for itself what the proper spheres for referenda are. I strongly urge that they be very tightly constrained. It must also decide what the proper preparations are for a decent, democratic referendum. None of this obtains in the current case and it is, therefore, the responsibility of Parliament&#151;as was said so forcefully by my noble friend Lord Maclennan&#151;to take decisions, use its judgment and do what, long ago, Edmund Burke said we should do: to give our judgment to our fellow citizens.</p>

<a name="80611-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="080611132000046"></a>In today's <I>Times</I>, we read in the main leader that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="080611132000115"></a>&#147;A change in voting weights is an inevitable consequence of the arrival of new members&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611132000107"></a>in the European Union, and that it would be &#147;disingenuous&#148; to talk of the treaty as a &#147;tidying-up&#148; operation. It is more than that, according to the <I>Times</I>. If you read that, you would assume that this treaty reduces British voting weight because of the arrival of new members. I do not think that the <I>Times</I> reported what the Select Committee said in our report, and what the facts are. The Select Committee report stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="080611132000116"></a>&#147;The new system for calculating a qualified majority is more equitable and takes more account of population than the current QMV rules, and the revision is significant. The UK&#146;s voting weight increases from 8 per cent to 12 per cent&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80611-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="080611132000047"></a>Would a reader of the <I>Times</I> leader this morning have reached the conclusion that the UK was gaining 50 per cent in voting weight in the Council of the European Union? I worry about a referendum on the basis of that kind of reporting in the Murdoch press and a lot of other sections of the press.</p>

<a name="80611-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="080611132000048"></a>I also worry about a referendum on the basis of some of the descriptive arguments about the treaty advanced during our debates. If the treaty is a huge and unacceptable erosion of national sovereignty, as some have argued, usually late in our debates, why do the foreigners not spot that? Do we have a different definition of national sovereignty or attach additional weight to national sovereignty? Or are they just stupid? In Budapest, those who can remember 1956 will know that national sovereignty has real meaning and real value. So why did the Hungarian Parliament approve the ratification of this treaty by 325 votes to five? In Warsaw, the vote was 384 to 56. Those countries have a real understanding of what national sovereignty means because they have just regained it. They have read this text, and they know that this nonsense about huge diminution of sovereignty is simply not true.</p>

<a name="80611-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="080611132000049"></a>A referendum is also inappropriate to this text for another reason given by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, and from the Liberal Democrat Front Bench by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire. This treaty is no big deal. It is a modest, sensible series of small reforms. It adds up to a great big book because there are a lot of small reforms. The size of the reforms, individually, is not great, but they are all worth having. I do not mean to play down the significance  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_618"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 618</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of making the Union work better&#151;a little more transparently, democratically and efficiently. That is what the treaty, if ratified, will do.</p>

<a name="80611-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="080611132000050"></a>I do not want to exaggerate: the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, well knows, because he has heard it at home, that the Council is working perfectly well unreformed. It is, but the Council with a reformed presidency will work better. It is a small reform, but it is worth having. Of course, the talk of a democratic deficit in the European Union is grossly overblown. It always has been. The Council consists of the elected representatives of the member states. But the idea of increasing the role of the European Parliament will improve democratic control a little. It is no big deal, but it is worth doing and it is a good idea. Of course, ensuring that when the Council legislates it does so in public is not a big reform, but it should have happened a long time ago and it is good that it is in this treaty and will happen now. Of course, national parliaments could improve their scrutiny systems without this treaty, but the yellow card subsidiarity system will help them do that. That is a good thing. Of course, the Commission could go on with as many Commissioners as member states, but it would be better to see the Commission reduced so that there are no more Commissioners than there are Commissioners&#146; jobs to be done. That is what this treaty would do. Those are not enormously important reforms. They do not raise issues of national sovereignty, but they are worth doing.</p>

<a name="80611-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="080611132000056"></a>My final point relates to what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, said in his very wise speech. Let us suppose that today's amendment were carried and accepted by the Government, and there were a referendum and that, as a result, the United Kingdom was unable to ratify the Lisbon treaty, which therefore did not come into effect and was a dead letter. What would be the effect on the United Kingdom? How would UK interests be affected in that situation? From my experience, I believe that our interests would be seriously damaged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="080611132000057"></a>Opposition spokesmen sometimes suggest that if this treaty were cleared away and finished, the European Union would breathe a great sigh of relief and move to a different prescription&#151;the one that we hear about from some quarters on the opposition side of the House. They speak of a free trade area, and a looser, more liberal Europe. I know of no evidence for that theory. I know of no evidence to suggest that that is what would happen. Such evidence as I have seen suggests that it would not happen. The prescription for that kind of Europe was elegantly, comprehensively and beautifully made in the European convention by Mr David Heathcoat-Amory from the Conservative Party in the other place. At the end of the convention, he had seven supporters in a convention of 207. None of them was a member of a governing party, nor a member of a party in a governing coalition. If the United Kingdom found itself in the same position as Mr Heathcoat-Amory was in the convention, we would have some support, as he did. We would presumably have Sinn Fein and certainly Monsieur Le Pen&#151;odd company, in my view, and not company that we should be seeking. There would be a low chance of our finding any government party to join us in our prescription. There would be no chance of our finding the required unanimity to change the treaty in that direction. That is why I am against a referendum, lest the consequence be that we find ourselves in that position. The treaty is no big deal; but for the UK to refuse to ratify the treaty would be a very big deal indeed. That is why I am against the amendment.</p>

It is completely wrong of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, to suggest that this House should not pass an amendment of this sort. If this House cannot discuss and pass amendments to decisions of the House of Commons, what on earth is it here for? The Salisbury convention says that the House of Lords should not try to thwart the Government when they have put something in their manifesto, but that does not mean that this House should not make amendments and send them back to the House of Commons for it to reconsider. That is what I want to talk about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="080611132000059"></a>As other noble Lords have said, the people of this country believe that they were promised a referendum on the constitution. They believe that the Lisbon treaty enacts the measures contained in the constitution and that the Government have cheated them in refusing to honour their manifesto pledge promising a referendum. That is the fact of the matter. It is clear that nothing will move the people from that view. A deep resentment will continue to be felt for a long time if this Bill is passed without provision for a referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="080611132000062"></a>At the next general election there will certainly be a number of organisations recommending voters not to vote for any MP, of whatever political party, who failed to support the amendment for a people&#146;s referendum when it was moved in the House of Commons. In many seats, particularly those held by Labour, only a few votes could make the difference between holding and losing the seat. The political landscape has changed considerably since the House of Commons rejected a referendum on the Lisbon treaty. The 2008 local election results were a disaster for the Labour Party, and the losing of the Crewe and Nantwich by-election an added catastrophe. Recent opinion polls show that the Labour Party is polling the lowest support over a long period of time. I say to Labour Members in particular, it could well be that Labour MPs would welcome the opportunity to reconsider their position. It may well be in the interests of individual Members of Parliament and of the Labour Party in general.</p>

<a name="80611-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="080611132000063"></a>Only this House&#151;nobody else&#151;can give all MPs the opportunity to reconsider their position on whether the people should be consulted on this treaty. By passing these amendments and sending the Bill back to the House of Commons for further consideration of the referendum issue, Labour Members of this House would be doing their colleagues in the House of Commons a great service. My recommendation is that the House of Commons should be given another opportunity. That is what this House is about. It gives the opportunity to the House of Commons, the elected House, to think again. It by no means agrees completely that there should be a referendum, but it will allow the colleagues of Labour Members in this House to think again and perhaps vote differently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="080611132000065"></a>I have just two points to make this late in the debate and I will do so briefly. One argument we have heard is that we should vote in favour of a referendum in order to keep the Government clean&#151;a big enterprise but that is the proposition. We owe it to public integrity to vote for a referendum because of what the Government said in their manifesto. I do not doubt the sincerity of what the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said on this. There are perhaps one or two question marks about  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_621"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 621</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one or two other people&#146;s arguments in favour of this proposition which sound occasionally a tad meretricious. I do not want to throw myself on the assegais in defence of the Government&#146;s honour, and occasionally when I listen to their arguments about why they have been against a referendum&#151;something they should never have promised in the first place&#151;I am able to contain my enthusiasm within the bounds of public decorum.</p>

<a name="80611-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="080611132000066"></a>I do not want to get too deep into that argument but to make one simple point. Confessional time: I have written three-and-a-half manifestos. I have been a member of Governments who I suspect have not always kept every manifesto promise they have made and on which they were elected. If in this House we get into a constitutional tizzy every time a Government do not keep an election promise we are going to require a productivity rate of stellar, Asian proportions. So it is not a hugely good argument, although it is a reasonable political point for my noble friends to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="080611132000067"></a>I breezed into one or two of the debates in Committee. I have not taken part in the Bill: it reminds me a little of Francis Pym&#146;s observation that it is dog and bone for any debate in this country on Europe&#151;the same old bone dug up time after time. During the debates that I heard the most interesting and agile argument was made, not surprisingly, by my noble friend Lord Forsyth, was a terrific debater in the other Chamber too, from which we have both been ejected, and who is a terrific debater in this Chamber. My noble friend said that this treaty was very different from Maastricht, for example, because we put the Maastricht treaty into our manifesto, we were elected on it in 1992 with 43 per cent of the vote, and, therefore, there was no requirement on us to accept the case for a referendum.</p>

<a name="80611-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="080611132000068"></a>It is true that we were elected&#151;some of us, not me&#151;on that 1992 manifesto. I do not seem to remember every Conservative who was voted in on that manifesto taking the view that they should support the Maastricht treaty. I was some way off. I had to read about it in the <I>South China Morning Post</I>, but I seem to recall that a lot of people did not take the manifesto argument in that period, and there were even Members presently in this House who voted against the Maastricht treaty and voted in favour of a referendum on it. I shall come to that in a moment.</p>

<a name="80611-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="080611132000069"></a>Secondly, my noble friend&#146;s argument does not take account of other European treaties and legislation on which we have not had referendums. Our old friend the Single European Act, the biggest practical extension of qualified majority voting we have ever seen, was driven through on a guillotine on a three-line whip, as quite a few of us in this Chamber know very well. I am only sorry that my noble friend Lord Tebbit is not in place, because he was party chairman at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="080611132000070"></a>There is a third issue. As some noble Lords will know, I had something to do with the 1992 election campaign which we fought with the Maastricht treaty in our manifesto. I recall the advice that we gave to candidates, for example, in something called <I>Questions of Policy.</I> I shall not quote it, because it might be a

The advice was that if candidates were asked why we should not have a referendum, they should say that this was not part of our constitutional practice; and we quoted again and again the reasons against a referendum, adduced with great eloquence and force by my noble friend Lady Thatcher in her speech on 11 March 1975. That speech was much quoted when, in this House, we voted on 14 July 1993 on whether or not there should be a referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Several of my noble friends here today went back and quoted that speech in extenso.</p>

This proposal cannot be represented as the action of a revising Chamber, neither does it provide any opportunity for compromise. It is in fact the clear rejection of the elected Chamber&#146;s decision on a constitutional and voting question. For good measure, that is being proposed by the unelected House of Lords&#148;.</p>

But in that debate on 14 July 1993, to which my noble friend referred, the name of another old boss of mine of sorts came up&#151;Sir Alec Douglas-Home who had become Lord Home. He presided over a review committee in the House of Lords, which concluded that regular use of referendums as instruments of constitutional protection should be contemplated within a wider framework of constitutional reform. We are in the midst of constitutional reform; we have it in a Bill before this House. Enormous constitutional changes are proposed and implied in this Bill. Is my noble friend quite sure that all the tradition and history, which is powerful but should not be our master, points in the direction in which he is leading?</p>

Thus far, I have failed to turn up the speech by the late Lord Home; perhaps it was made sub fusc. But Lord Home argued for precisely what the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, argued for. He argued, within a constitutional settlement, for an agreed way in which we could take on the issue of referendums. If it ever comes to a vote on that in this House, I will vote against the use of referendums; but at least that vote would be an attempt to put that argument into a broader constitutional context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="080611132000074"></a>Finally, I have not changed my views. My noble friends who will vote against a referendum tonight have not changed their views. I do not think that the European Union is changed fundamentally, except that it now has 27 members, which is why, as the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said, we have to have the institutional arrangements in this treaty. It will not be a terrible disaster if the Irish vote no, and I will make that point; but the European Union would work better if we had those arrangements in place. I have not changed my views. Some others have changed theirs. My strong prediction is that after the next election, they will find that they have to change their views back again as we come with a crashing and grinding of gears to face up to the fact that we are living in the real world and have responsibilities in it for the national interest.</p>

I had my say about this Bill at Second Reading. I still think that the Government cannot go on disregarding public opinion, especially on an issue like this, which will accelerate the integration of Europe and go far towards establishing a single European state in which we would play a modest part. My conclusion then was that our people must be given a choice. That remains my view.</p>

<a name="80611-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="080611132000076"></a>The Government, by resisting calls for the referendum they promised, have become detached from those they purport to govern. The Government seem increasingly indifferent to what people think and are indeed contemptuous of their views. An attitude like that often marks the dying stages of a Government. Some politicians, if they do their people an injury, tend to think that will fade away in due course, but it is seldom forgiven or forgotten.</p>

<a name="80611-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="080611132000077"></a>Tomorrow, the Irish people will exercise their right to decide whether to subscribe to this treaty. Their constitution, unlike ours, allows them a free vote. If we were to vote today against allowing our people to take part in a referendum and the Irish should, as seems possible, vote no, that would be a signal humiliation of this House. The amendment, however, gives our people a voice&#151;something that they were promised and ought to have. It deserves the support of every one of us who believes that the electorate has a right to express its views in a matter of major constitutional importance that will affect their lives and those of their children. I will certainly support it. I do not wish to be ruled by Brussels bureaucrats. As was said in another context&#151;I believe by Henry II&#151;not today, not tomorrow, not ever.</p>

I am on record as saying in this House on 10 December 2003 that there was no case for holding a referendum on the constitutional treaty. My judgment was that, unlike under the Single European Act&#151;a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Patten&#151;or the Maastricht treaty, there was no major shift in powers between the nation states and the European Union and that there was therefore no case for referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="080611133000002"></a>Like the Foreign Secretary, I was surprised that the then Prime Minister, Tony Blair, promised in 2004 that we should have a referendum. When asked, the Foreign Secretary said that there was no way on the basis of constitutional significance that the treaty merited the decision that the Prime Minister took.</p>

<a name="80611-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="080611133000003"></a>If a referendum was not necessary for the constitutional treaty, as I do not believe that it was, it is certainly not necessary for the Lisbon reform treaty. That is the view taken by all other member states. Of course it is true that Ireland has yet to vote and we will see what happens&#151;I will say a word about that in a moment.</p>

<a name="80611-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="080611133000004"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, who made an excellent speech, that there are similarities between the two treaties, and I congratulate him on all his hard work, but my disagreement with him is that I do not believe that either the constitutional treaty or the Lisbon reform treaty merited a referendum. As the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said, they are no big deal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="080611133000005"></a>A powerful argument was made by my noble friend Lady Symons when she reminded us that the constitutional treaty abolished all existing treaties. She was supported by the Dutch Council of State, of which the noble Lord, Lord Neill, was rather critical. I perhaps read what it said slightly more carefully than him, and there was a lot more than the bits that he quoted. It stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="080611133000030"></a>&#147;the proposed Reform Treaty is substantially different from the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611133000027"></a>It also agreed that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="080611133000029"></a>&#147;The constitutional concept, which consisted in repealing all existing Treaties and replacing them by a single text called &#145;Constitution&#146; is abandoned&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611133000028"></a>Instead of setting up a so-called constitution, the Lisbon treaty returns to the customary amendment procedure for existing European treaties, as applied in the treaties of Amsterdam and Nice. My noble friend has established a strong point there, which I do not believe has been answered during the debate.</p>

<a name="80611-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="080611133000006"></a>There is also the Danish Justice Ministry, which has produced a penetrating legal analysis&#151;I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Neill, has read it&#151;that said that, for Denmark, the Lisbon treaty does not transfer new powers to the Union. That must also be true for the UK, especially in view of the opt-outs and so on that we negotiated. The report concluded that Denmark could ratify the Lisbon treaty by normal procedure rather than by having a referendum.</p>

<a name="80611-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="080611133000007"></a>We should oppose the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Howell, and settle the matter here in Parliament. It is true that an Irish referendum is being held tomorrow; we all await the result with interest&#151;a matter which is a question for Ireland and for the EU. Whatever happens, Her Majesty's Government would be right to defeat the amendment, with the help of other parties and other noble Lords in the House, to hold a Third Reading in a fortnight's time, and to ratify the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="080611133000009"></a>Very briefly, I feel that I should recall the EU's genesis&#151;the basics of how it works&#151;which is boring but important. The powerful idea that gave rise to the European Union is that the nation states had been responsible for the carnage of two world wars. Those nation states, with their unreliable democracies, had therefore to be emasculated and diluted into a new form of supranational government, run by a Commission of technocrats. That is the big idea. It is from that idea that we have the EU's claim to have brought peace to Europe since 1945, which I do not have time to query now, although I will just mention the part played by NATO.</p>

<a name="80611-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="080611133000010"></a>It is also from that big idea that we have the EU system of law-making, with all EU legislation proposed by the unelected Commission in private, negotiated in private by COREPER or the committee of permanent civil servants from the member states, and passed in private in the Council of national Ministers. It is true that the elected European Parliament has growing influence over that process, but it cannot propose legislation and it is not in its interest to resist it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="080611133000015"></a>I got as far as saying that after the laws have been through that process, they are enforced by the Commission and the Luxembourg Court of Justice, against whose rulings there is no appeal. The founders of the project, Jean Monnet and others, made no secret of their goal: that 80 per cent of all national legislation should come to be made under that system, leaving national parliaments in charge only of the rest. That is just about where we have now arrived since we joined in 1972, after a series of treaty changes that other noble Lords have mentioned. Those treaty changes have, without doubt, steadily increased the EU's share of our national legislation. There really is no doubt that the Lisbon treaty will take that process further, as noble Lords have said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="080611133000016"></a>None of that has featured much in general elections, because all the main parties, the BBC and our political class generally have supported it. Many in your Lordships' House support it, and its extension under the Lisbon treaty. That is understandable. Your Lordships&#146; House is well endowed with former politicians and civil servants who have given much of their successful lives to building and supporting the project of European integration. They believe strongly that the United Kingdom must be at the heart of that project, whatever its disadvantages, if we are to play our part in this globalising world against terrorism, climate change, world poverty and on the international stage generally. We have heard much of that tonight.</p>

<a name="80611-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="080611133000017"></a>However, a large and growing majority of the British people are not convinced. They feel powerless that their voices and their votes no longer count with their political class and that too much of the unwanted regulation which blights their lives comes from Brussels and not from people who are responsible to them. That is perhaps partly why 40 per cent of them no longer bother to vote in general elections. They have a point. Modern Governments are elected by around 40 per cent of the 60 per cent who vote, or some 24 per cent of the electorate, but those Governments then go on to make perhaps only 30 per cent of our national law, and less in the vital area of our industry and commerce. So one can understand people's growing frustration with the new Brussels system of governance and their anger that their well tried and hard won democracy should have been taken from them without their explicit or informed consent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="080611133000020"></a>I do not pretend that our democracy would be restored if the British people voted down the Lisbon treaty in a referendum, but at least we would stay where we are&#151;at the treaty of Nice&#151;and the referendum campaign would, at last, produce the full and open national debate which has not taken place since the referendum of 1975. That means that no one under 50 has had a chance to vote on this great issue of how they are governed. Of course, there would be disappointment in Brussels because the treaty could not be ratified. They would be in the same sort of position they were in after the Dutch and French people rejected the original constitution. However, the project would continue, just as it did then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="080611133000021"></a>Some noble Lords may not be aware that the pace of European legislation has increased by 25 per cent since the constitution failed, so the suggestion that the EU would fall apart without it has turned out to be unfounded. Likewise, the City of London has thrived, despite our not joining the euro. The hope must be that a rejection of the Lisbon treaty by the British people would lead to a fundamental reappraisal of the project in Brussels, and that we might go back to the EU&#146;s Laeken declaration&#151;it wanted to bring the project closer to the people but was frustrated by the constitution, which went in the opposite direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="080611133000022"></a>Those who accuse the Conservatives of wanting a referendum on the Lisbon treaty because they really want to leave the EU altogether are quite simply, and to me regrettably, wrong. I would not have joined the UK Independence Party if I had thought, after speaking to many influential Conservative friends, that there was a chance of that being so under its present leadership. We support the amendment because we see it as giving rise to an informed national debate and to the failure of the Lisbon treaty. To us, that is a worthy aim in itself and one which we share with the Conservative Party. However, we shall continue to believe that the United Kingdom would be much better off out of the project entirely, both constitutionally and economically, as I have tried to show on many previous occasions, and indeed from the point of view of our influence on the world stage. We will never accept that we have to surrender our right to govern ourselves in order to collaborate with our friends in Europe or with friends anywhere else on the planet.</p>

I conclude by asking your Lordships not to forget the past. When we remember where we have been, we can sometimes see more clearly where we should go. Let us not forget that over the past few hundred years, in their thousands, in their tens of thousands, in their hundreds of thousands and, yes indeed, my Lords, in their millions, good British people have willingly given up their lives to create, and to safeguard, our system of parliamentary democracy and the absolute sovereignty of the Crown in Parliament&#151;the British Crown, in this Parliament. They have been joined in that great sacrifice&#151;certainly one of the greatest sacrifices the world has ever seen&#151;by many more from the Commonwealth and from our great cousin the United States of America. Has all that just become old fashioned, out-dated, and no longer relevant in this brave new globalising world? I hope not. In all humility, I suggest that we should now remember all those who made that sacrifice, and let their descendants decide how we proceed. They did not die for this. I support the amendment.</p>

I understand and respect the fact that other Members have taken a different view, but that is my honest opinion and it is held with just as much honour as that held by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="080611134000005"></a>A point that has been made once or twice during Report is a certain lack of consistency by the Liberal Democrats. I do not like reading my own speeches but, by God, they stand up well. On 22 October 2007, I told the Lord President:</p>
<ul><a name="080611134000073"></a>&#147;it is now time for the Government to move on to the front foot in this argument. Given that kind of lead, the Conservative opposition will be seen for what it is: a piece of shoddy opportunism to paper over its own divisions on Europe.

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="080611134000008"></a>Those were the original positions I took at the beginning of this process and it is the position that we take on these Benches this evening. This has been one of the debates to be remembered in the House, with some very high quality contributions from all sides, made with sincerity and great eloquence. I will not delay the House any longer. Those on these Benches will support the Government, as I promised.

It has been a great privilege to sit through some of the most extraordinary and terrific speeches that I have heard in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="080611134000010"></a>I have singled out a few of those speeches for comment. I must pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Bruce-Lockhart, for whom it was a particular effort to come here today; he spoke with great eloquence, although I did not agree with him. The most reverend Primate made some entertaining and interesting points, many of which I agreed with. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Owen&#151;both former Foreign Secretaries&#151;spoke with great eloquence from different perspectives and we were richer for that. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, made one of the most brilliant speeches I have heard in a long time.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="080611134000011"></a>Many other noble Lords spoke extremely well and I pay tribute to all of them for their speeches, whether or not I agreed with them. This has been a substantive debate and it shows Parliament at its best. It proves beyond doubt that the Government&#146;s approach in saying, &#147;This is the place to scrutinise, deliberate and debate&#148;, is exactly right. I will come on to the issues that noble Lords have raised about referendums but I do want to make that point. This is what we are here for. It is even more so what another place is here for. I believe we have fulfilled our obligations in scrutinising this treaty. I pay tribute, as I will again at Third Reading, to the Opposition, the Liberal Democrats, the Cross Benches, the right reverend Prelates and all noble Lords who have participated, because we have done our job extremely well.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="080611134000012"></a>A lot has been said about the purpose and role of referendums, or occasionally referenda&#151; if I am not mistaken, the plural is &#147;referendums&#148;, but I will leave that aside&#151;and the question of opinion polls and YouGov opinion polls in particular. For any noble Lord who has not made the connection, I declare the interest that my husband is president of YouGov. When the YouGov poll took place, he and I were on a boat in France, so it is nothing to with us, guv. Noble Lords would also expect me to say that I have no knowledge or information on anything to do with opinion polls conducted by that company&#151;we keep a complete Chinese wall between us and anything that it may do. However, I look with great interest at all the opinion polls on the subject.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="080611134000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brittan, and the most reverend Primate and other noble Lords said that the truth in the history is that when people are asked whether they would like a referendum on all subjects, they will rightly say yes. We have to keep +the context of what is being said.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="080611134000014"></a>I was struck by what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said&#151;the noble Earl, Lord Ferrers, also raised this at Second Reading&#151;about the complexity of the question. When the referendum took place, all those years ago now, it was on a straightforward question&#151;a question that people could answer with great certainty. One of the great issues for us is that the complexity of the  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_630"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 630</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>treaty, because we scrutinised it line by line, has been revealed&#151;I refer to the changes that have been made, the red lines and so on. We must be clear that in using referendums we are also ensuring that we give people the right responsibility, which is to answer questions that are put before them, and those questions must be able to be answered properly. I hesitate to say that explaining what the justice and home affairs opt-ins would be to the population at large may be quite complicated. There is an issue about Parliament making its mind up about what its responsibilities and role are and when it is right and proper to ask those questions of the public.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="080611134000015"></a>I also note what was said about the weather in Ireland. I understand the point; on issues of this complexity, it concerns me that the weather might be the determining factor. I cannot decide&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Howell, must forgive me for this&#151;whether, if there were a referendum, the Conservative Party would campaign for yes or no. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, will answer that question for me. Indeed, I might press him to, because I really am unsure what the position would be; it is an important issue. If there were a referendum, I know where the Liberal Democrats would be; I know where the members of UKIP would be; I know where those on my Benches would be; I probably even know where some of the Bishops might be; I know where some of the Cross-Benchers would be; but I do not know where the Conservative Party officially would be. I have asked several times, but have not really had an answer to a question that is important in the context of those who push in relation to trust; we need to know, in particular, what the Conservative Party would do&#151;if this Bill reaches the statute book, as I hope it will, next week, and if there is ratification across 27 member states&#151;whether the Conservative Party leadership will reopen this. If they were fortunate enough to win the support of the British electorate and become the Government, would they accept&#151;as Mr Cameron seemed to be moving to doing in his article earlier this week&#151;that what is done is done? I think the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, said in a speech in 1975 that two years on from when things have happened is not the time to start reopening that which went before.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="080611134000016"></a>Noble Lords have said how isolated Her Majesty&#146;s Opposition are in Europe, for which I am very sorry. This is a great party and some of the best and most brilliant speeches made in your Lordships&#146; House this afternoon in support of the European Union were made by noble Lords sitting on the Opposition Benches. I hope that the Conservative Party will move back to the position of strength&#151;to being supporters of Europe, so that we may all together be in that great position in that way.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="080611134000017"></a>It is my contention that it is our job to do our job and the European Council&#146;s job is to do its job. Whatever happens in Ireland, it will be for the European Council, which will meet at the end of next week, to deliberate and discuss. The 27 heads of state must make their own decisions.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="080611134000018"></a>I will comment on the debate extremely briefly. Six reasons have been given for having a referendum. The first&#151;the obvious one&#151;is the manifesto commitment: this is exactly the same as a constitution and there  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_631"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 631</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should therefore be a referendum on it. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, talked about trust; the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, has been very consistent; he also delivered, I meant to say earlier, yet another very good speech. But, as my noble friend Lady Symons, said in a very powerful speech, the constitution is entirely different. It is a founding document; it is quite different to what is before your Lordships&#146; House now, which is in a similar vein, as many noble Lords who were responsible for dealing with previous treaties, have pointed out. We do not accept that it is the same thing. Out of the nine countries that held or plan to hold referendums, none, bar Ireland&#151;which has to do it under its constitution&#151;is planning to hold a referendum on this treaty. That means that we are in good company in recognising that this is not the same thing.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="080611134000019"></a>The second reason is that the Lisbon treaty is a constitutional treaty. As noble Lords have explained, far more eloquently than I can, it is not; it is different. Noble Lords say that the content is the same, is similar, may be similar, or possibly has similarities. The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, quoted part of my letter. He obviously did not quote all of it&#151;I will not go through it all&#151;but if noble Lords read everything I said, I hope they will draw a slightly different conclusion to that.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="080611134000020"></a>Yesterday, for fun, I was looking up what the DNA similarities are between human beings and other animals. Apparently, I am 60 per cent a fruit-fly, 98 per cent a mouse and 95 per cent a guinea-pig. That does not make me a guinea-pig or a fruit-fly or a mouse&#151;I hope.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="080611134000021"></a>We are very clear that there may be similarities. Things were brought forward from the constitution because they were important innovations in how we operate together. That does not make us the same&#151;I am not a fruit fly. As I have already indicated, some of the safeguards in this treaty were not even in the constitutional treaty.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="080611134000022"></a>Then there is the argument of the cumulative effect of all the treaties we have had in the past, meaning that we have got to the point where we need a referendum. I reject that. The sixth and final reason that has been given over the course of all our debates over the past months has been that we have held a referendum on other issues so we should hold a referendum on this. I am not going to dwell on that point because I do not think that anybody has raised that today as a conceivably good issue.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="080611134000023"></a>I just want to comment to the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, on the case that is before the courts at the moment. I have to question the appropriateness, while the case is still before the courts, of raising what was said by government counsel. I am not surprised that the noble Lord was able to get a copy of what the counsel said&#151;I am sure that it is now in the public domain in any event. However, the noble Lord will understand that I am not proposing to comment on it.</p>

That is why I am not proposing to comment on it at this point.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="080611134000026"></a>I want to end very briefly with the issue of politics. After all, politics is politics. There are people in your Lordships&#146; House who, whatever I say, genuinely believe that the Government made a commitment and that the treaties are exactly the same. I hope that they have read them line by line and I hope that they have done the work and analysis to reach that conclusion. I do not see how they could have reached that conclusion, but I genuinely believe that they have.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="080611134000027"></a>There are those who will see this referendum as an opportunity to campaign to remove ourselves from the European Union&#151;either altogether, or to renegotiate our position. This is a vehicle or a method. It is a completely legitimate thing to do. I do not regard anything that I am saying here as illegitimate. I am just pointing out what is going on&#151;hastening, in a sense, our departure from Europe.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="080611134000028"></a>There are perhaps also those who see this as an opportunity to land a blow. Politics is politics and people will use the issue of trust to say something about the Government, the Prime Minister, Members of your Lordships&#146; House and so on. That is for them. </p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="080611134000029"></a>For my part, however, I am clear: the constitution is gone. It was declared gone at the IGC. This is an amending treaty by any reading and under any set of circumstances. We have negotiated a strong position for this country. I want us to play our full part in Europe, to get beyond the negotiations and discussions we have had in your Lordships&#146; House, important though they are, and tackle the problems that we face together&#151;on poverty, climate change, our relations with other countries, working together to promote human rights and providing greater protection for our citizens so that they can live, work, study and travel in the European Union and enjoy the benefits of being a part of it. I want us to speak with one voice or, as the most reverend Primate said, to make a fuss, on behalf of our people in the European Union, to make it better. That is the commitment of this Government.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="080611134000030"></a>I take what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, at the beginning. Perhaps we have not done enough to promote our own in Europe, but my goodness, I intend to start doing that if I have not already done so. We should pass this Bill, reject the amendment, take our place in Europe and get on with the things that really matter to our citizens.</p>

I feel privileged and humble to have had the opportunity to take part in it. I shall try to be brief in summing up some of the contributions. There obviously is not time to comment on every wonderful speech. I hope that this does not embarrass the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, but I should like to put her speech at the centre of my considerations. She it was who put, as clearly, simply and eloquently as one could, the case against which our amendment is aimed. She it was who put the question: is this different? The noble Baroness, Lady Symons, asserted with vigour that it  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_633"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 633</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was different and that the constitutional concept had been abandoned. That is what we have to assess. I believe that not to be so. It is view against view and I will try to support the case the other way.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="080611134000032"></a>The secondary role was played in our debate by the good Dutch lawyers who are much quoted, although I think that my noble friend Lord Neill of Bladen demolished their credibility to a considerable extent. Indeed, when you read on page 13 of their report, as I am sure all of your Lordships have, that they assert that the Lisbon treaty does not codify the supremacy of the European Court of Justice or the EU law, one realises that it must a be rather questionable document, because it does. In the treaty provisions precisely, the supremacy of EU law is codified and made absolutely clear. It has been confirmed in all our debates in Committee by the very learned and wise lawyers, judges and others in this House whose opinions are immensely valuable. They have all confirmed that the ECJ is the supreme court, that its rulings cannot be challenged&#151;there is no appeal against them anyway&#151;and that it is supreme in all areas which fall under the ECJ. This treaty brings a whole new group of areas under the ECJ. The rulings of the ECJ are supreme and override our national view.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="080611134000033"></a>I say that merely to emphasis the point that those who question the constitutional importance of the treaty, or who say it is merely tidying up, not very much or no big deal, really cannot have grasped what is stated in the treaty. In the decision to collapse the Third Pillar and bring the vital issues of justice, home affairs and many others into the purview and coverage of the European Court of Justice, it is constitutional. Even the Dutch lawyers admit that. Therefore the proposition that somehow the constitutional concept has been abandoned withers and collapses.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="080611134000034"></a>Does it have the same effects? My noble friend Lord Blackwell put this devastating question: if all the measures that were in the constitutional treaty are there, who is to explain that it does not have the same effects this time, just because it is written in a slightly different form? Of course the same measures will have the same effects and provide the same basis for the same rulings by the European Court of Justice, as would have been the case under the constitutional treaty.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="080611134000035"></a>Finally, is the text the same? Here again we seem to have a difference, like ships passing in the night. I have before me the text of the two treaties and I find again and again, page after page, paragraph after paragraph, word after word that it is identical. It is the same text. As the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, rightly and eloquently said, it is in a different wrapping, but it is the same text. If that is not taken as fact from this Dispatch Box then let us turn to the great Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the sponsoring department, which in 2004 put out a guide to the European Union to explain the constitutional treaty. The other day it put out a guide to the Lisbon treaty with a foreword by the Prime Minister, Mr Brown. I have to tell your Lordships that out of 15 pages of explanation, 12 are identical. It is the same advice for treaties that are said to be different, and I am afraid that that stretches

<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="080611134000036"></a>Perhaps I may say a word on the issue that came to the fore in many excellent speeches&#151;the question of whether we like referenda. I do not like them very much. In principle, I think that we should handle them cautiously; in practice, they occur again and again. There have been many under this Government and all parties have promised them in their manifestos for various things, including my own party in 1997 regarding the euro. The truth will have to be faced by some of my noble friends who have used phrases such as &#147;time and time again&#148;, &#147;in the past&#148; and so forth. The world has moved towards the referendum mode for very obvious reasons. Quite aside from the fact that referenda have been promised, we now live in a world where 2 billion people are on the internet and the world wide web, and two-thirds of households in this nation are online and interactive. People are empowered, they have views and they wish to put those views forward. This is not the world of five or 10 years ago; it is the world of the information age, which totally transforms the way in which opinion is formed and the way in which democracies will work.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="080611134000037"></a>I am very sorry for those who say that they do not like referenda but there will be a lot more of them. They will come again and again. There will of course be resistance to them and there will be many cases where it is felt that a more refined judgment filtered through Parliament is much better, and that view is probably right. However, there will be more and more of what the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, calls &#147;exceptional cases&#148;. I believe that we have one before us now.</p>

I would certainly be opposed to it; I have never had any doubts about that. We all know that the treaty contains all sorts of things that the noble Lord&#146;s Government and party were totally against from the start. They fought desperately to keep those things out of the treaty but they have been included. The only people who are in love with the treaty are the Liberal Democrats. His own party is not very keen on it, to tell the truth, and I think that the Prime Minister has distinct doubts, but the noble Lord is caught in a trap.</p>

I was talking about Parliament, about which we all care. We want to see this House of Lords upholding its duties, which are to amend and improve and to argue with consistency and accuracy about what is necessary, and we want Parliament to be trusted in the way that everyone always calls for. However, if we push through a measure without the say of the people&#151;the say of the people which is encouraged in a document about the present European Union, which says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="080611134000071"></a>&#147;You can join the debate and have your say on the future of Europe&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611134000068"></a>but apparently they cannot have their say on the future of Europe&#151;and if we reduce to mere scrutiny the realities of parliamentary control, then Parliament itself will suffer.</p>

<a name="80611-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="080611134000043"></a>The truth is that in this debate, despite the sincerity of the arguments of the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, and others, we have really won the argument. We would have won the key votes as well if the Liberal Democrats had not adopted their bizarre and supine approach to everything and anything to do with this Bill, because I believe that the arguments are on our side. I respect what has been put up against us but I do not think that it stands up in the face of the facts, in the face of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, in the face of the arguments of Europe&#146;s leaders, as the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, said, or in the face of the frank and candid assessments of those who founded the constitutional treaty on which the text is based. Because of all those things, it really is time to put this matter to a vote and to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="080611134000057"></a>As the Bill stands, the penalties would be inconsistent and disproportionate. My amendment proposes that the penalty for a breach of the labelling requirements be limited to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the standard scale, which would bring it in line with that applicable to the Food Labelling Regulations 1996. Any person found guilty of an offence under those regulations is liable simply to a fine not exceeding level 5. The kind of offences we are talking about in this Bill are entirely comparable with offences under the food

Unlike the provisions of this Bill, no term of imprisonment attaches to the offences and no reference is made to conviction on indictment.</p>

<a name="80611-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="080611134000058"></a>On proportionality, I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Mitchell, now agrees that we are not dealing with a potential offence that should be capable of putting someone behind bars for two years, or indeed at all. A fine at the highest and most severe level, level 5, is appropriate, and any more than that might prove to be counterproductive in that it could be seen by the courts as being so disproportionate that convictions would be unlikely. That would render the Bill as tokenistic and in effect give drinks producers a licence to ignore it. If we are to have legislation along these lines, let it be realistic and workable. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="080611135000005"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now move on but, in many ways, we are continuing the debate we have just concluded. When I listened to the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, I was reminded that one of the problems over our membership of the European Union, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, put it, is that we always seem to have been on the back foot. We have never taken head-on the concerns of the public, which have often been increased by what they may or may not read in the media. The amendment seeks to provide an opportunity for us to work out for ourselves how best we can deal with what the treaty of Lisbon really means, an issue which has been a real worry and concern for many members of the population. We got a sense of that in the previous debate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="080611135000006"></a>I am delighted to see the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, in his place because I was moved to think of this amendment following an exchange I had with him in a previous debate. If I recall correctly, he had described a situation in which one of the voters in France&#151;a neighbour of his, I think&#151;had received, during the referendum campaign, a huge document that he had put in the waste-paper basket. The noble Lord and I had a bit of an exchange because he described a lot of the voters as neo-fascist and Trotskyites. I remonstrated with him at the time that he should not describe all my very good friends in France in such terms, because there were a number who were genuinely concerned. I felt that I overreacted, however, so this gives me a chance to say how sorry I am that I then described him as a bureaucrat.</p>

I congratulate him on it. It took me back a long way into history, and it is a marvellous account. His concluding words in his editor&#146;s foreword gave rise to this amendment, and I shall explain why. Describing the problem of Britain&#146;s membership of the European Common Market, or however it was then described, he said that one of the problems is that there were so,</p>
<ul><a name="080611135000053"></a>&#147;many examples of bad luck&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080611135000045"></a>coupled with &#147;some bad judgment&#148;, and that this had,</p>
<ul><a name="080611135000054"></a>&#147;dogged the subsequent history of Britain in Europe&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611135000046"></a>There is a lot in that. We are often on the back foot, and there is a lot to be said for being much more positive about what we see as the benefits of the European Union. As my noble friend Lord Howell pointed out, we are constantly trying to improve the negotiations. We greatly regret that the Government adopted the negotiating stance that they took&#151;but that has been dealt with in previous debates. We are looking now at how we can get across to people the benefits of European Union membership. I hope I carry the Benches on my right with me when I say it is about time that we fought back. There are so many scare stories that one reads in the press; I think the noble Lord, Lord Kerr referred to the editorial in the <I>Times</I>.</p>

We would far prefer Europe to be developed in a way that made Britain feel &#147;at ease with itself&#148;, to quote the previous Prime Minister, John Major. We need a Britain at ease with its membership of the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="080611135000010"></a>How do we do that? As I say, I have found that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, in referring to the fact that we are always on the back foot, had an important point. How do we ensure that we are able to get across the positive case? In 2004 Tony Blair decided to publish a leaflet. This speech was triggered by a warm hearted gesture on the part of the noble Baroness the Leader of the House. When she saw this amendment on the Marshalled List, she sent a large package round to my office containing the many documents that the Government have produced. In many ways she triggered quite a bit of what I am about to say, because she included the <I>Guide to the European Union</I>. I think that by including this she wanted to demonstrate that the Government were getting across a positive case for Europe. When I saw that document&#151;which has a beautiful photograph of the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, on the front cover and says that he wishes to explain how the treaty of Lisbon will allow,</p>

<p><a name="080611135000047"></a>I said, &#147;I wonder whether a previous leaflet was issued?&#148;. I found a leaflet that was published in 2004, which my noble friend Lord Howell referred to. We have compared the two documents, and they are virtually identical.</p>

The 2004 leaflet explains how the constitutional treaty will allow the enlarged European Union to work more effectively and efficiently. The marvellous Foreign and Commonwealth Office produced these two documents. There was probably a very overworked, overstretched individual there who simply took most of the text of the leaflet to explain the European constitution and transposed it into the leaflet explaining the treaty of Lisbon. Let those who say that they are completely different documents compare these two explanatory leaflets.</p>

<p><a name="st_212"></a>
<a name="080611135000013"></a><a name="80611-0012.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80611-0012.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080611135000064"></a>Lord Jay of Ewelme:</b> My Lords, I have just one question for the noble Lord. I did a little research on the two documents during the dinner break, having been at least indirectly responsible for the first of them. Are they not guides to the European Union and not to the Lisbon or the constitutional treaty? Since the European Union has not changed fundamentally since 2004, would one not expect the majority of the leaflet to be the same in 2008 as in 2004? As I understand it, there are references in the document to the Lisbon treaty rather than to the constitutional treaty.</p>

<p><a name="st_213"></a>
<a name="080611135000014"></a><a name="80611-0012.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80611-0012.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080611135000065"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral:</b> I hope that the noble Lord will continue to participate in the debate, because it is very helpful to have one of the authors of the document with us. I dare say that what has happened on this occasion used to happen regularly to him when he served as one of our leading officials; that is, his text has been taken by Ministers and turned into a ministerial document. Gordon Brown has introduced his <I>Guide to the European Union</I>, which contains many references to the constitutional treaty, and turned it into a document which explains the treaty of Lisbon. I have been through the two documents carefully&#151;I obtained the former document from the House of Lords Library and am very happy to pass my copy to the Minister as she searches for further evidence. One sees that huge tranches have been taken word for word, with the treaty of Lisbon inserted where the constitutional treaty was.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="080611135000015"></a>I do not seek to rehearse all the arguments about the differences. The amendment would ensure that we explained in simple, understandable terms what the treaty of Lisbon meant. A huge bundle of documents was delivered to my office&#151;I do not know whether it was delivered by a fork-lift truck, but it was of a massive weight. One of the problems with converting a constitutional treaty into the treaty of Lisbon and rewriting it is that if one wants to understand the treaty of Lisbon a massive amount of documentation is now necessary. I urge the Government to look again at all this material and convert it into a readily understandable document which can answer and knock  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_644"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 644</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on the head some of the myths and scare stories which, sadly, are often put around by those who wish us to withdraw from the European Union.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="080611135000016"></a>I shall give one example, because I treasure giving as much time as possible for the noble Baroness the Lord President to be briefed by the noble Lord, Lord Bach. One of the documents that I treasure is the no document that went to every household at the time of the referendum in 1975. I know that some Members&#151;I do not see them here&#151;will say that all we ever agreed to in the 1975 referendum was a free trade association. I remember being on many platforms vigorously supporting our membership of the European Community and saying that it was a step in the right direction towards a more prosperous and peaceful Europe because we gave up sovereignty in key areas and, by pooling it, made ourselves stronger. At that stage, we had a very vigorous argument. I remember that the no document was headed &#147;The right to rule ourselves&#148;. In 1975, it said that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23"></a><a name="080611135000052"></a>&#147;The fundamental question is whether or not we remain free to rule ourselves in our own way&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611135000048"></a>and that the Common Market has set out,</p>
<ul><a name="080611135000056"></a>&#147;by stages to merge Britain with France, Germany, Italy and other countries into a single nation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611135000049"></a>That, of course, was not the case, but I fear that by allowing the anti-European lobby continually to peddle myths and misunderstandings, we have begun to lose the argument.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="080611135000017"></a>In the last debate, when we were talking about the referendum, I sensed that one reason why a lot of people who supported a referendum no longer do so is that they feel that the argument about our membership of the European Union would be lost. That argument would not be at all positive, but be all about what the Government have or have not done. In many ways, that is a reflection on our failure in our duty to present the positive facts about Europe that are agreed by all parties, particularly the one I regard as the European party&#151;my own.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="080611135000018"></a>I have seen the party opposite move from being one entertaining the idea of entry into one that, in its election manifesto, wanted to withdraw; that caused a number of people to leave the Labour Party at that time. My party has never adopted any such posture, and as far as I am concerned it never will. However, we want to see a much more positive attitude, so I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity given to her by this amendment to spell out for us all exactly what she and her colleagues will now be doing to present the positive case. I beg to move.</p>

I remember it vividly and rather agreed with it, but I nonetheless felt cautious about agreeing totally with that judgment that he is still a good European&#151;for he was in the past, and I remember that vividly&#151;because of the subsequent changes that had happened in the Conservative Party. It was not right for him just to

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="080611135000020"></a>I do not want to be repetitive tonight, and I shall be very brief, but when I sat in on the Committee stage of the Bill in the Commons a number of others, including people who were sitting and listening in the Gallery, but who were not really political&#151;for I deliberately made a point of asking them if they knew the Conservative Party&#146;s history on Europe&#151;were shocked by the intense hostility of the remarks made. They were made not just by the Back Benchers&#151;mainly Mr William Cash and Mr David Heathcoat-Amory&#151;but by the Front-Bench spokesmen and particularly the foreign affairs spokesman. There was a deep-seated hostility and antipathetic remarks, which were not just a marginal detail on the current attitude.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="080611135000021"></a>Years ago when we were campaigning together, I remember vividly that the noble Lord followed me as chairman of the Conservative group for Europe when I was a member of the Conservative Party. We remember those days, when the party was a strong European force: the whole ethos was strong, thanks to the leadership of Edward Heath when following Harold Macmillan. Those days are no longer here, so in the spirit in which the noble Lord is not suggesting in any way that there should be a formal vote on the amendment but pressing for a good idea&#151;to have more information, leaflets and so on our membership of the European Union, the Lisbon treaty and the rest of it&#151;then one would welcome that.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="080611135000022"></a>In fact, the noble Lord has redeemed himself in the course of these proceedings, if that does not sound condescending, because he conveys his enthusiasm for Europe in his remarks and when he wants more information from the Government that is, understandably, part of that. So much information is provided already, both through official channels from Her Majesty's Government and through all the other things. I can quote an interesting pamphlet&#151;a guide to the Lisbon treaty&#151;from the forum group, which I am sure that the noble Lord has read as well. It says some very good things about the Lisbon treaty. One can quote the Foreign Office&#146;s recent pamphlet on the Slovenian presidency period, which on page 13 sums up just what the Lisbon treaty means to everybody.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="080611135000023"></a>Also, the noble Lord has to bear in mind one very significant point. What if there had been lots of argy-bargy in the other member states, particularly the older members, or what they call the more mature members of the European Union? What if there had been a lot of Sturm and Drang in the German Parliament about the Lisbon treaty&#151;apart from the constitutional court point, which is the only one that has come out of the German scene. In France, too, which the British press has always described as a very bloody-minded nationalistic country and extremely difficult, what if there had been lots of anti-European people around, apart from just the National Front and the Communist Party? What if there had been those manifestations of disaffection for the Lisbon treaty? And then in the 10 new countries&#151;or the eight plus the two islands in the Mediterranean and Bulgaria and Romania&#151;what if there had been huge hesitations in that regard, as there  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_646"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column 646</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>were in Poland for a short period, although not for very long? After that, it went back to the equilibrium state of a massive amount of parliamentary enthusiasm for the Lisbon treaty and the opportunity that it provided.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="080611135000024"></a>The point came up earlier&#151;I made it myself, though not very well, and the Leader of the House referred to it&#151;that nine of the new countries thought that they were going to have a referendum, and then they did not need it. Yet the &#233;lan for a referendum in a newly democratic country is very great indeed, when you get the initial expressions of the whole people. Often when they devise their own constitution they have a referendum on it, and some of the member states did that. Yet, despite that, in all those member states the public accepted that there was no need for a referendum. But I do not want to go back over the old ground covered in the previous debate. The Leader of the House nods vigorously at that point.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="080611135000025"></a>All this shows, surely, that there is an ample amount of information about these matters. This is no criticism of the public at all; I am not saying that they are stupid or ignorant, but the understandable commonsense position of the British public is that they are not very worried about all this. The right-wing newspapers are trying to start huge campaigns and the <I>Sun</I> newspaper tried to get a large number of signatures, but it could not do so. So I believe that there is an adequate amount of information.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="080611135000026"></a>Last year, I launched the European Union (Information, etc.) Bill, which I presented to the House and sent to the House of Commons. Although the Conservative Party did not formally oppose it, I did not notice any enthusiasm on its part at Second Reading or in Committee. The Bill provided for the installation of European information centres in public libraries, other municipal centres, and obvious, official local buildings, along with plenty of information on the internet being freely available. One of the subsections in the noble Lord&#146;s amendment proposes the same thing. I should like to reintroduce that Bill some time, not least because it also dealt with the display of flags.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="080611135000027"></a>It is extraordinary that the only European flag within several kilometres of this place, apart from on hotels, which are good at putting them up because it is cheaper just to have one European flag, is on the Slovenian embassy, round the corner. It flies one all the time. The British Government put up the European flag the other day, along with the European member states&#146; flags around Trafalgar Square, but they were put up very quickly and taken down so quickly. Why did they not leave them there for a week, or longer? This is the only member state where there are no displays of European flags on official government buildings. If you look at the National Assembly and the Senate in France&#151;again, a bloody-minded nationalistic country&#151;there are plenty of European flags. There are 65 European flags in Lille Europe station. That would be a good start. The Government should encourage that kind of thing. We can return to debate those matters later, maybe under separate legislation.</p>

I have not been able to put my hands on something so as to be able to say, &#147;Here is a leaflet, it&#146;s all explained in here&#148;.

I have never heard anybody say, &#147;What is all this about the latest NATO treaty proposals?&#148; People do not talk like that on the doorstep.

In the 50 or 60 hours of debate on this matter that I have attended in this House, I have been called far worse things than a bureaucrat. I can probably survive. It was very nice of the noble Lord to say what he did. In some ways I am extremely sympathetic to the thoughts that have been expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, but I am not at all convinced by the method advocated in the amendment in the Marshalled List. A government document on these points will not change public opinion in a helpful way, particularly if&#151;this point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes&#151;a number of the noble Lord&#146;s colleagues, here and in another place, rapidly rubbish said government document. It is pretty certain that they would do so, starting up again the whole debate about whether the Lisbon treaty is really as helpful, positive and harmless as the Government say. I fear that such a government document would simply not do the trick.</p>

That is absolutely crucial. If they do not say that, and the thought hovers around that in

It will remain in partisan politics. The best thing that could possibly happen is for all three large parties to join in an information campaign. That would not then be open to the same problems as a campaign run simply by the Government. They should also agree not to score points off each other on European issues in the next election campaign, which must come by 2010.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="080611135000034"></a>The Irish can do it. Every single party in Ireland, except Sinn Fein, is today campaigning for a &#147;yes&#148; vote. In every other European Union country, the norm at election time is for parties not to disagree fundamentally on European issues. They disagree about a whole lot of other things, and have a very good election. The winners become the Government and introduce the policies that they have been elected for. Europe is not greatly affected because it is a bi, tri or quadripartisan issue in those countries. If we could get to that situation, we would have some chance of turning the position around, even in the teeth of the Murdoch, Rothermere, et al., press. That is a terrible handicap to all of us, including noble Lords on the other side who take the same pro-European view as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. This is honestly not the right way to do it, but the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord are admirable and I share them totally.</p>

I encountered him over a difficult educational question in Brixton. I came across somebody who was interested in informing people because he believed that knowledge and information brought power.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="080611135000036"></a>Having said that, I do not think that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is right to do things in this way. I associate my words with those of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, who said that this is not the best way. In an earlier debate on Amendments Nos. 29 to 31, the whole question of trust was seen as a Trojan horse&#151;you are breaking trust because it was in the manifesto. If our Prime Minister has broken trust, how can you persuade the public, as in paragraph (d) of the amendment, which states that,</p>
<ul><a name="080611135000057"></a>&#147;a letter from the Prime Minister is set out with every leaflet&#148;.?</ul>
<p><a name="080611135000050"></a>If trust has already been broken, how does that square up? It does not. There is a sense that you have had your argument and defeated the very reasons that you are advancing.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="080611135000037"></a>I said to myself, why is the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, who is the most reasonable person I have ever encountered, using this tactic? He wants to explain why the referendum is not necessary. That is not information: it is regurgitating what we have heard. There is an unfortunate phrase; the dog has returned to its vomit. Why should we go back there?</p>

Let us do that. Let us do it from our primary schools, secondary schools and have everywhere in the community engaging with everyone, if I understand how the whole new world we are living in is turning out. We should then deal with it, support it and encourage it, but we do not need it on the face of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="080611135000039"></a>I would rather the Bill stayed as it is, without any more additions because it is clear. I hope that those who follow after us will say that there was one gentleman who spoke a lot of common sense, but common sense does not always need to be included in legislation.

We do not need this on the face of the Bill. It would simply re-open the issue of the legitimacy of the Lisbon treaty.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="080611135000041"></a>One of the depressing things about the whole European debate in this country is that it is seen as a zero-sum game. It is perceived as being the concession of sovereignty and a concession that is lost. It is never seen as a win-win situation; namely, that we are sharing sovereignty not to do the same things, but to do more things and do them better. The Lisbon treaty, as has been pointed out several times during the course of today's debate, is essentially a facilitation treaty. It is enabling us to do rather better what we are already empowered to do. It is to manage shared sovereignty, as it has already been agreed, more effectively.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="080611135000042"></a>To come to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, about what sort of information effort we need in order to embed in the British consciousness a greater awareness of the benefits of European co-operation and integration, surely the essence is to move the agenda on. The whole point of this treaty is to move the agenda on. I urge the Government Benches: instead of endlessly going round this course talking about the red lines and trying to confirm to people that no sovereignty or the very least amount of sovereignty has been shared, start to make the case for what you can do with shared sovereignty about the problems which everybody now acknowledges are at the centre of our public life, such as climate change and other problems. That shift of gear would be crucial.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="080611135000043"></a>I should like to make one other point which has been made from our Benches tonight. The challenge for the Conservative Party is quite straightforward. It can either pretend that this is an unresolved issue, that it will not accept the parliamentary verdict at the end of the day on the Lisbon treaty and will wish to re-open this if and when they have the opportunity. If they do that they defer the whole ability of this country to move forward in Europe. They have got to accept what has now happened. They have got to tell us what their forward agenda is.</p>

<a name="80611-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="080611135000044"></a>If their forward agenda is to return to a European free trade area they had better forget it because that is nobody else&#146;s agenda. The agenda is now quite different. I look forward to a new realism from the Conservative Party on the future of Europe and a new willingness to

Sparing his blushes, I know that the noble Lord has for many years been a strong proponent of Europe and a strong leader in his party on the values and benefits of the European Union. I take this amendment in that spirit. I will take a lesson from the noble Lord here because his track record on this is second to none in his own party. That has probably ruined his career for the rest of his life, but I do not care because it is well worth saying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="080611139000007"></a>I agreed with a great deal of what the most reverend Primate said because the focus of this amendment above anything is for us to have a short debate about the importance of promoting what we are doing in the European Union. I am not going to get into the arguments about this or another booklet. Both booklets were primarily about explaining the European Union and both referred to what was, at that point, where we were in our deliberations&#151;one on the constitution, one on the Lisbon treaty. Let us leave that aside. It would perhaps have been relevant in the previous debate but it is not now. What matters is what we do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="080611139000008"></a>I am not going to apologise for putting a lot of information before the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, because I keep being criticised for not doing that.

I am afraid the results do not seem to be evident. As part of this exercise, will she ensure that she feeds in to her ministerial colleagues the fact that citizenship education is meant to include knowledge of the European Union but does not seem to be doing so? It is vital that young people grow up aware of just the basics about the EU. It is really not that complicated and it is crucial.</p>

<a name="080611139000010"></a><a name="80611-0013.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80611-0013.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="080611139000054"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, I agree with the noble Baroness completely. It is important that young people, indeed all citizens, learn about the European Union and I accept that we need to do more. Yet the noble Baroness will not be surprised by the criticism that I, as an education Minister responsible for citizenship, would get were it suggested that we should do more to promote the European Union&#151;it would be &#147;propaganda&#148;. The noble Baroness will not be surprised at all by that but that is indeed an issue and a problem the Government face all the time when people suggest it.</p>

<a name="80611-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="080611139000011"></a>It was particularly true when the euro was brought in across many parts of the European Union. I for one was keen to&#151;and did&#151;produce something for young people to make sure that they knew what the euro looked like, that they understood what it meant. That was not least because teenagers have a habit of travelling across the European Union and not knowing what the money looks like could lead them into some difficulty. We did, therefore, produce a lot of information, but this is an issue that we always have to deal with. I am very grateful that the noble Baroness raised the importance of making sure that young people are educated, because I agree completely with that.</p>

<a name="80611-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="080611139000012"></a>I could go into a list, which I have, of all the different aspects of information that we produce. I will not do so, for I sense the weariness of the House even before I begin. We do make sure that we have on the website all of the available information, which is particularly relevant for young people. That is available at www.europe.gov.uk, where anyone is able to obtain as much information as possible.</p>

<a name="80611-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="080611139000013"></a>Where I join with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, in his amendment is in my commitment to ensure that people get as much information as possible in the appropriate manner to enable them to understand the European Union. When we held the presidency, I tried extremely hard to get media attention on some of our work on civil justice which was relevant to people&#146;s everyday lives, and I found that almost impossible. If, as a result of this discussion, all noble Lords would join me in trying to find ways to promote the European Union in our media, in the broadest sense, I would be more than delighted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="080611139000014"></a>The amendment is not necessary because we already produce a lot of information. We seek to circulate it as widely as possible. We want members of the public to look at the Foreign Office and No. 10 websites, and we have blogs from the Foreign Secretary and the Minister for Europe, which are run weekly and, I gather, attract a great deal of interest and comment from members of the public. I am sure that noble Lords will support them in that.</p>

I would say to the Minister that when I suggested that the Government should publish an explanatory leaflet on the Lisbon treaty, she sent me the leaflet that I have in my hand. I was criticised by the noble Lord, Lord Jay, for saying that it explained the Lisbon treaty. He said, &#147;No, it&#146;s a guide to the European Union&#148;. It has been sent to me by the noble Baroness to demonstrate that information has been published about the Lisbon treaty. We have to decide which is which. An explanation of the treaty of Lisbon is very much a part of this leaflet, but the noble Lord is quite right that it contains a lot of information that is nothing to do with the Lisbon treaty. We do not have a leaflet that explains the treaty of Lisbon. My point was that we ought to have one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="080611139000016"></a>I say to the most reverend Primate that I do not think anyone has ever been as complimentary about me as he was tonight. I much appreciate that, because I have enormous respect for him and the courage that he shows in giving his views. He is a prime example of someone who I look up to in the whole area of communicating with people. I would also say to him that someone has to explain the Government&#146;s position on not having a referendum because, according to the latest poll, 64 per cent of the public believe that there should be a referendum. That could be ignored, but by ignoring the issue, it festers and inhibits the positive case that can be put forward for making sure that Britain is right at the heart of Europe, which is what I have always believed.</p>

Therefore, it is important to say that there has to be some explanation in simple and easy-to-understand terms why we will not get the opportunity that the Republic of Ireland will have tomorrow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="080611139000018"></a>The noble Baroness has not referred to what happens if Ireland votes no. That is the great unknown, or the known unknown. If the Republic of Ireland votes no, what happens? Do we go on regardless? Do we still have Third Reading; or do we do what the Conservative Government did over the treaty of Maastricht, which was to suspend parliamentary scrutiny for a considerable period until the heads of state had met and discovered what would happen next. All those are questions that we should be addressing.</p>

I am Sentamu; I am not Hind. The moment that they say Hind is going to be Archbishop of York and then put in Sentamu, everyone would be quite angry&#151;and quite rightly so.

I believe that in York, where I am, they know. They listen to the debates, and they will say, &#147;Oh, Wirral, he comes from the same place as York; they are part of the North. They disagreed but, in the end, the vote was probably right&#148;.</p>

I am very willing to go along with that. When he talks of the concern about shared sovereignty, he is not so much wrong, as focusing on a past state of affairs. There are people in all political parties and in the media who use that phrase and who are concerned about the concept of sharing sovereignty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="080611139000032"></a>Although in a very narrow legal sense, any nation state can put up the shutters and close down or do what it likes, alas&#151;even that may no longer be possible in this era of liberal intervention&#151;we all know that we are completely inter-dependent; that we have to restrain our own ambitions and aims in the light of others; and that we have to work together in a whole variety of international affairs. In the past half century, this country has been superb in developing an effective role in a number of forums or fora&#151;whatever the plural of that word is&#151;and I hope we shall continue to do so. All right, share sovereignty, participate in inter-dependence, but the question for those who come back again and again to a Eurocentric way of thinking is: with whom?</p>

<a name="80611-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="080611139000033"></a>We live in a network world in which Europe is certainly our geographical region. We want to be very good Europeans and work with them intimately within the European Union, from which we will not be withdrawists. What has happened in the past five to 10 years makes one think again. When I hear such speeches, I do not sense that the &#147;thinking again&#148; has gone on. Even the Foreign and Commonwealth Office says in its annual report, &#147;We must look to international institutions to make them more effective&#148;. Mr Miliband has made four new goals, three of which are stratospherically vague but one of which is to make institutions more effective. The document goes on to say that that involves the UN and the EU. But the UN and EU are not the only game in town. The idea that our foreign policy will be conducted entirely through our European partners is not a way forward in promoting our contribution to world stability and peace, overseas development and in protecting our interests. Many other avenues are open.</p>

Could he talk to us&#151;perhaps not now but on another occasion&#151;about shared independence and sovereignty with the great powers of the Commonwealth, which happens to contain some of the fastest growing and most dynamic countries in rising South-East Asia and East Asia? Are these not areas, too, where we have a foreign policy to develop? Should we not be careful in looking exactly at our own common foreign and security policy regulations with our good neighbours in Europe? The wider area and the wider importance are growing in all our relations: with India, Malaysia, Australia, Canada, the old Commonwealth and the new. Should we not be careful to promote those interests, those shared sovereignties and those degrees of interdependence, rather than living in a world where we feel that the EU is the only game in town?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="080611139000036"></a>Behind what a lot of the noble Lord has said is a sort of assumption that Europe&#146;s relationship with a wider non-European world is an alternative relationship to the ones that we have. If you look, for example, at the level of trade and investment between the Federal Republic of Germany and China, you will find that it is quite as great as our own. If you were explaining this position in Germany, the Germans would find it almost incomprehensible. They do not see their relationship within the European Union as an alternative to their relationship with China. They see them both as being essential. Frankly&#151;this is my question for the noble Lord&#151;why pose these things as alternatives? Within the European Union we have a pivot which is vital to our relationship with the Commonwealth, the United States and China. These are not alternatives. They all converge and relate to each other. To pose it as black and white alternatives is deeply misleading.</p>

However, I must say in response to that lovely intervention from the noble Lord, Lord Watson, that that is precisely the point: I am not talking about alternatives. I am talking about the proposition that I would like to resist. I sometimes hear advancing towards me the argument that the European relationship with China is a substitute for our own bilateral relations. None of my German or French friends would accept that for a moment. They would laugh at us. They are developing their own bilateral, as well as their European relations with China and Japan. We arrived in China and found that it is not the EU propositions or EU trade policy that have arrived, it is German concessions, French contracts and German franchises&#151;they have got the advantage of us. It is about time that we realise we must act in this network world bilaterally as well as through various organisations, of which the EU is only one. Unless we understand that, we are going to be outwitted at every point. That is why one feels very deeply about this constant distortion of the argument, as though we are proposing either Europe or something else. That is nonsense.</p>

Investment, capital movements, trade between affiliates, which is not even covered by EU trade agreements, and a vast range of contracts and politico-economic and politico-business arrangements happen well out of the sight of the trade mandate that the noble Lord mentions.

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="080611139000041"></a>I beg your Lordships to let me turn to the amendment where my proposition&#151;what we have discussed is related to it&#151;is simply that this is a Bill and a treaty that leaves an enormous number of unanswered questions. It was the noble Lord, Lord Watson, who I think talked about a further agenda. Everyone has talked about treaties ahead and a number of European integrationists in the European capitals are ready to talk about the next treaty and another IGC. So the idea that this is a settled matter is unlikely.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="080611139000042"></a>I am fully aware that I am treading an ambiguous path in the sense that we have argued that this treaty is self amending&#151;as it is. Some of my noble friends, and others, have argued that that means there will not be any more treaties because this one can expand the powers of the European Union and remove the vetoes of nation states on European Union activity to an almost unlimited degree, barring only the areas of CFSP and so on, where we have debated how far they can get into those areas.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="080611139000043"></a>Those who talk as thought this treaty and its ratification is somehow the end of matters and that they have all been settled and tidied up&#151;the language that the officialdom of the world loves so much&#151;are on a completely erroneous path. We are dealing with the distribution of power and the argument will go on for ever. There will constantly be new pressures for nation states re-acquiring powers and for things to be done in common in the European region. There will be other pressures to link up and share our sovereignty with other bodies outside the European region. That will go on and those who think that they can tidy it up and tie it down are living in a fool&#146;s paradise because that is not the way it will be. Future Governments, including ours&#151;everyone seems to assume that there will be another Conservative Government although I think we should be a little more cautious&#151;will be facing this relatively fluid situation. The distribution of power will not all be settled.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="080611139000044"></a>I recall, many years ago in the other place, dealing with budgetary legislation coming forward from the then Labour Government. We had to christen it &#147;liquid legislation&#148; because as it came forward, although things were stated on paper, hardly had they been set down than they were constantly being changed&#151;they were evolving all the time. There is a sort of liquid legislation aspect to this Bill as well in a way that I think did not exist in the previous treaty Bills relating to Maastricht, Nice and Amsterdam. I believe, incidentally, that some of my colleagues in the House of Commons when encountering current budgetary legislation from the present Government find it takes rather a liquid form in the sense that an announcement one week tends rather frequently to be modified, or amended, the next week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="080611142000001"></a>Therefore, a whole series of concerns which have come up in the Committee and Report stages are open-ended. The obvious ones, which we have debated endlessly, are the self-amending nature of the new passerelle provision on top of the existing passerelle provisions. There are ambiguities which have yet to be settled&#151;although I do not know how&#151;on the sharing of competences, given the new list of extended competences. There are the issues under Article 352, which we debated on Monday. It used to be Article 308 but is now Article 352. There are also the so-called &#147;hidden wiring&#148; features of the treaty, all of which are to do with matters yet to be settled, although some may be at the shortly forthcoming June EU summit.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="080611142000002"></a>We are told that a little more may be learnt&#151;and, I hope, communicated to Parliament&#151;about the job specification of the President. We have debated that but we have not voted on it. We have not even had a clear answer on it because the Government are not in a position to give one. It is a matter yet to be settled. Then we have the European External Action Service and the streamlining of diplomatic functions which it is said to involve. We do not know anything about that at all. Apparently, an argument is still raging in Brussels about where it should be, to whom it should report, how it will work and how it will draw on national diplomatic services. We have debated that but we have not reached a final view on what is to happen. Again, we have debated the question of the public prosecutor, but when will the matter be settled? Who is to be appointed and what powers will that person have? A power to define to criminal offences is to go to the EU but the list can be expanded indefinitely. How will that be settled? How will borders be secured?</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="080611142000003"></a>The energy field is an area of maximum vagueness, as it is not clear exactly what powers we are handing over. It is not clear whether the new suggested powers over sharing oil stocks supersede, dovetail with or undermine the powers of the International Energy Agency, which, for a brief time, I once had the honour of chairing. We worked out the original oil-stock system and it has worked pretty well since then, but there are some very vague propositions here about the sharing of oil stocks in the future. As for the formulation of common energy policy, we know the gap between the theory, which is that we all share energy through the gas grid and the electricity grid in Europe, and the practice, which is that the gas does not come through and someone else has negotiated the contracts. Those are very serious matters, particularly because, as a result of neglect of our energy policy, this country is sleepwalking into extreme difficulties over energy supply and energy costs. Those will cost this country dear. These things need to be 10 times clearer as a result of this treaty than is the case at the moment.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="080611142000004"></a>Those are all treaty areas where there is unfinished business and, to use the American phrase, known unknowns. We do not really know what is round the corner and we need to know a little more, although we can never know it all. I can see that added to my list is the point that we do not know how the European Defence Agency will be set up, although it will be under QMV.</p>

I have a lot of questions on the very unfinished business arising from the new powers the Government hope to take in order to fulfil this scrutiny-plus arrangement, which we debated at length on Monday. I will not go into that again but there are new powers and consequences from how they will be used. The methods by which they will be used will require very careful examination.

We have enjoyed listening, even after dinner this evening, to the good cop/bad cop routine on the Conservative Front Bench, with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, telling us that he loves the European Union and the noble Lord, Lord Howell, telling us that he hates the European Union. We should not have what is a Second or Third Reading speech in the final stages of Report, but here we are, so let us grasp what we have.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="080611142000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howell, wants to have an end to politics. He says he wants to have all the questions completely answered. My understanding of democratic politics, let alone international politics and diplomacy, is that politics never stops. You never get a final answer and if you ask to stop the world and get off, you will never achieve that. Of course we will continue to cope with new problems by negotiating new solutions. That is the nature of the world in which we live.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="080611142000014"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, mentioned canvassing how often we hear the issue of the EU raised on the doorstep. I have been trying to remember if there has been any occasion in the last five years when I have heard someone mention the European Union on the doorstep and it is very difficult. I remember canvassing in Hull in 2004 with an American friend from the <I>National Journal</I> in Washington who wanted to hear responses to the Iraq invasion. The first door we knocked on, we got a very strong reaction on parking on the verges in the local council estate. Ninety seconds later we had moved on to Iraq, passing through the European Union mean time. But the European Union is not something I often hear about on the doorstep.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="080611142000015"></a>I hope what I am about to say is not entirely out of order. We have heard a lot from the Conservative Benches about flags. I hope that this is not a story about one of our noble Cross-Benchers. When the European Union negotiated the question of a European flag in the mid-1980s under the Government of Mrs Thatcher&#151;now the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher&#151;the proposal was made that the European Union should adopt a flag. An anonymous British official is alleged to have said&#151;I have this story from someone in another Government&#151;that Mrs Thatcher would never accept a flag, but if the European Union would agree to accept an emblem which could then be put on a flag, that might be acceptable to the Conservative Government and herself. We do not officially have a European Union flag; we have an emblem which is carried on a flag&#151;a very important and subtle distinction which infringes British sovereignty less.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="080611142000016"></a>That is quite enough for a short after-dinner speech, but I simply want to say that I still do not understand why this amendment is on the Marshalled List and why we are repeating arguments that have already been made several times. I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw it.</p>

There will be flexibility, which is revealed mostly in the details of the treaty in order to avoid holding intergovernmental conferences ad nauseam. It would be absurd to follow the reasoning of this amendment.</p>

<a name="080611144000004"></a><a name="80611-0014.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80611-0014.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="080611144000035"></a>Baroness Ludford:</b> My Lords, over our seven hours of debate I have listened to many Conservative speakers. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, claims that the Conservative Party is the nice party now, but I think that it is the confusing party. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, told us that the approach of the Government should aim to be at the heart of Europe. I certainly agree. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, seems to be reluctant to recognise any role for the European Union. He says that on the one hand the Lisbon treaty will be followed by more treaties, but on the other hand it is self-amending so there do not need to be any more; it is liquid legislation.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="080611144000005"></a>Many questions have been asked today. At one point the noble Lord, Lord Howell, made an important statement to the effect that&#151;I do not want to misrepresent him, but I cannot recall whether he was speaking for himself or putting forward the Front Bench position for his party&#151;had there been a referendum on the Lisbon treaty, the Conservative Party would have campaigned for a no vote. I am not clear whether that represents the settled view of the Conservative Party as a whole, but I cannot see the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, taking the same position. In summary, I remain confused on exactly what the Conservative Party position is on the European Union and indeed on the Lisbon treaty.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="080611144000006"></a>To conclude, I agree with some of the spirit of the amendment in the same way that I intervened earlier to ask the Minister about citizenship education and the basics of the EU. I agree that there simply is not enough explanation about who does what in the Union. I have a theory that when people say that they do not know what the EU is or who makes decisions, it is because one of the problems is that they do not really know how their local council works, and they certainly do not know how the Government in Westminster works. However, because those institutions are within their sphere of legitimacy, they do not question them so intently. But I have to recognise that they do question the legitimacy of the European Union. It is not that they are burning to know all about the Union, but it amounts to people saying, &#147;We don&#146;t like what we don&#146;t understand&#148;. There needs to be a great deal more relatively simple but not unintelligent information&#151;not too simple because people are not stupid&#151;about the EU.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="080611144000007"></a>Finally, on the one hand we are supposed to accept that there are a lot of Eurosceptics, while on the other hand reports from respectable polling organisations and Eurobarometer surveys carried out on behalf of but not by the European Commission show consistently that a large majority of people even in this country want the EU to be competent on issues such as tackling serious crime and terrorism, climate change and helping to solve the problems of poverty in the third world. They want the EU to be able to do things. There is something of a contradiction in those results, but I believe fundamentally that the British population supports a competent EU that is good at solving problems. It

This is a departure from the way Acts of Parliament in this country work. Parliament passes an Act and it is for the courts to interpret and clarify it. We are creating another category of legislation here. I am quite dubious about frequent regulation&#151;you can govern by regulation&#151;but that process has increased under the present Government and I am quite anxious about it. Parliament by regulation is always dangerous. I can associate myself with Acts and Bills, but if you want clarification and interpretation it is for the courts to provide it, not the Government who have brought forward the Bill. The Prime Minister&#146;s reporting, clarifying and explaining will again be subjected to the courts, so why are we doing this? I would rather stick with the Act and forget this malarkey.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="080611144000013"></a>I shall be rather old fashioned and talk briefly to the amendment before us. We have discussed the substantive issues in the amendment on many occasions, including the role of the full-time president of the European Council. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, has accepted that there are aspects of this amendment on which we have already voted and therefore should not have been included in the amendment.

<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="080611144000014"></a>I have said a number of times that when one is looking to ratify a treaty there are two principal issues. The first is to make sure that the work is done by officials at the right level to ensure that should ratification occur in all 27 member states, and thereby we move on with the Lisbon treaty, we are able to implement it properly. That happens with all legislation in a national Parliament and there is no difference in anything we

There have therefore been discussions. I have explained them at great length and I am not going to go over the same ground again.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="080611144000015"></a>We have been very clear that the decisions will be taken post-ratification and that Parliament will be involved appropriately in making sure that the Government are held to account, through scrutiny processes, for all the decisions that will probably take place throughout the remainder of the French presidency. The Minister for Europe has set out in a letter, which noble Lords have seen, how the Government intend to keep Parliament involved and has committed to ministerial contact with the committees ahead of ministerial discussions of these implementation issues. As I have indicated, there have been some preparatory discussions at the right level but, I repeat again, no final decisions will be taken until the treaty has been ratified, and they will be taken only by Ministers.</p>

<a name="80611-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="080611144000016"></a>The scrutiny committees are receiving the draft annotated agenda for the European councils and the Foreign Secretary has given evidence today to the Foreign Affairs Committee. We expect there to be an informal discussion over dinner at the junior European Council on issues of implementation. It is important to have these informal discussions in order that officials are able to prepare for the moment when we hope ratification occurs across the European Union. The Prime Minister will be reporting back to another place from the European Council and, with the leave of the House, I shall repeat any Statement that is made on 23 June. That is one way in which we are able to keep noble Lords in touch.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="080611144000017"></a>I think I indicated previously, so I will not go over this ground again, that when I was in Brussels I talked at length to a number of different people, such as the head of the Council Legal Service and the secretary-general of the Commission, about all these issues. During all those meetings it was made clear to me that although there were official-level discussions were necessary to ensure that the arrangements were properly dealt with, no decisions would be reached without ministerial agreement. As I have said, we will keep both Houses informed.</p>

There will be more to be kept informed about, both in this House and in the other place. Not all is clear. As the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, who is immensely experienced in this area, rightly said, there is not enough explanation about who does what. That is just a small consideration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="080611144000020"></a>Sadly, the noble Lord Wedderburn, cannot take part in these debates because he is not well, but he reminded us earlier that the appointments of presidents and so on are serious matters. We may be setting in train areas of expansion of powers that are a zero sum, in the sense that powers taken in those sorts of areas can be powers lost in others. In many areas, the Lord Watson dictum&#151;that it is not a zero sum&#151;is correct, but in these areas it could be wrong.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="080611144000021"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, is also very experienced in foreign affairs and had 10 years&#146; command of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I think he followed me in that role. It is a splendid committee; he knows a lot about it, and he says it is all a journey. It certainly is, in the Foreign Affairs Committee&#151;a lot of journeying takes place. All I would say about the journey we have had with the Bill in Committee and on Report is that it is rather like travelling on one of our older motorways. There seem to be a lot of road repairs and a lot of traffic jams. We are clearly going to have to do a lot more waiting before these things become clear.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="080611144000022"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Anderson, said that these matters are all small details&#151;but he will not have forgotten where the devil resides. There are many issues here that we have to be clearer about before one can be entirely happy that the proper role of parliamentary control is being fulfilled in satisfactory ways and we are not once again parked on a bypass while the traffic of legislation and the redistribution of powers rolls by.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="080611144000023"></a>It was said&#151;again, perhaps, by the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford&#151;that we should all be happy about the treaty because we wish the EU to do certain things. Indeed we do, and we have legitimate arguments about the ways in which they should be done: how much legislation is needed, how much centralisation and harmonisation, how much variety and diversification. We all want the UN to do things as well, and I personally want the Commonwealth to do things. We want NATO, which obviously needs to adjust to the 21st century, to do things; many of the things it did in the past century will have to be done in quite a different way in the present century.</p>

It is marvellous that he should have the time to be with us this evening, right at the end of Report. He is with us, but he is not quite with me, on a rather central point: that this legislation is not like other legislation. It does not end up with the difficulties sorted out in our courts. Rather, those difficulties are sorted out in the supreme court, which all our lawyers have told us again and again is the European Court of Justice, whose powers, and the extent of those powers, are vastly increased by the treaty. All are agreed on that; no one has disputed that the extension of ECJ sovereignty, as it were&#151;or at least of its powers and influence over the so-called Third Pillar issues with the exception of CFSP, although certainly intruding into aspects of foreign policy in different ways, as most people have agreed&#151;is an important constitutional change. It takes our affairs into the hands of the European Court of Justice in a way that we did not always expect.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000009"></a>The noble Lord said: The two amendments tabled in my name, Amendments Nos. 97PA and 97PB, would give the Secretary of State the power at some later stage to extend the scope of the new regulator for social housing tenants to other bodies as well. At Second Reading, I made the point that the part of the rented sector most in need of regulation is the private rented sector. Tenants of private landlords, as we all know, can find themselves exposed to appalling practices with no protection from any regulator, in contrast to the position relating to the services they receive in their apartment, whether that is gas, electricity, water  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC198"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC198</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or whatever, and not even with the protection of a redress and ombudsman scheme. However, the Minister will be delighted to hear that I am not proposing to pursue this campaign any further within the context of this Bill since I understand that its scope is more limited than for the private rented sector and that battle must wait for another day.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000010"></a>However, I think it extremely important that the role of the regulator is extended in relation to those other tenants within what is know as the social housing sector; that is, principally the tenants of local authorities, whether those tenants are in homes that the council continues to manage itself or in homes that are now run by ALMOs&#151;the arm&#146;s-length management organisations.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000011"></a>Fortunately there is, I think, no disagreement on any side that the scope of the regulator should be extended to cover all tenants within the social housing sector. I am grateful to the Local Government Association and indeed to the Chartered Institute of Housing, the National Housing Federation, the National Federation of ALMOs and the Tenant Participation Advisory Service for their input to these amendments. There is unanimity among them that the regulator should cover all tenants in social housing, including those who are tenants of local authorities, for reasons of equity and to overcome the anomalies that would be perpetuated if tenants within the council sector remain outside the scope of the regulator and the tenants of housing associations are within in it.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000012"></a>Perhaps I may illustrate how those anomalies work through. It is quite likely that someone will be almost randomly nominated by a local authority to a housing association or to the council&#146;s own stock depending on where vacancies arise or the number of children the person has at that time. It is not necessarily the person&#146;s choice: they will accept the social housing to which they are nominated. In other cases, people transfer. They move home. There will sometimes be a mutual exchange between tenants of housing associations and local authorities. People move between these sectors quite freely. The entire stock of some councils has transferred through large-scale voluntary transfers into the housing association sector. Many tenants of ALMOs may believe that they have moved outside the council sector but in fact they are still council tenants and within it.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000013"></a>So anomalies abound. Indeed, it is possible that the existing tenants of ALMOs and joint venture local housing companies in future will not be covered by the new regulator, but that the tenants who move in, whose homes will have been provided with help from grant, will be brought within the regulator. So, even the same landlord or owner of the property may find that tenants are in different categories after this legislation is passed unless we can create what is known as a domain-wide regulator that covers comprehensively all those tenants in social housing.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000014"></a>There is unanimity of view that this measure is needed. The question is when should we extend the role of the regulator. I think that the service is now to be called the Tenant Services Authority rather than Oftenant. That sounds like an improvement to me, though possibly the name will change before the end  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC199"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC199</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of the afternoon. At the moment, though, we are going for the Tenant Services Authority. But my fundamental question is: why should we delay in having at least an opportunity for the Secretary of State to bring forward at a later date measures to extend the scope of the regulator to cover all the tenants of social housing, including council tenants?</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000015"></a>I will not spend much of the Committee&#146;s time arguing the case for the democratic process in itself being a sufficient protection for tenants to make it unnecessary at least to move speedily with this change, since very few people believe&#151;and indeed the local authorities themselves, through the LGA, are not arguing&#151;that council tenants should be put in a separate or different category because they have elected masters somewhere at the end of the line of accountability. Let me dismiss that potential argument and look at two other reasons that have been advanced for the delay in including something in this Bill to cover the extension of the role of the regulator.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000016"></a>The first is that this measure is better dealt with in the legislation which will possibly be called the empowerment, economic regeneration and community Bill&#151;I may have missed a word or two in that one. The Government have properly announced that they intend to introduce that legislation after discussion on a White Paper in the autumn. It would fulfil their original intention that, within two years, the role of the regulator will be extended to cover council tenants. One ground for holding back is that other legislation is in the pipeline and it should make its way through the process in a couple of years and bring those tenants within the same regulatory system.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000017"></a>Professor Ian Cole&#151;who with a number of colleagues has done much important work for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which I greatly appreciate&#151;has been looking at the practicalities of the extension of the role of the regulator. The group had its last meeting on Thursday of last week and its report, agreed across the piece, is winging its way to the housing Minister, Caroline Flint. It is likely that that report will say that the members of Ian Cole&#146;s group are all agreed on the principle that one should press forward for domain-wide regulation, even if there are still one or two parts of the small print on which the arrangements that relate to council tenants would need to be different and refined in a couple of ways before the process is concluded. The group has been robust in working together to say that the time is right for this extension to happen as soon as practicable. I cannot see that the receipt of that report would lead anyone to form the view that the time is not right to include amendments to that end in this part of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000018"></a>The next reason why it might be said to be a bad idea to include clauses in the Bill to extend the regulator&#146;s powers is that these are enabling powers for the Secretary of State. They are Henry VIII clauses and there is an aversion in your Lordships' House to enabling powers. To counter that charge, those of us who have brought together these two amendments have sought to hedge, surround and box in the provisions that would give the Secretary of State additional powers, for example making it very difficult for my hopes of the private rented sector being incorporated ever to be fulfilled  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC200"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC200</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>through these clauses. If the Minister and her colleagues believe that different wording would do the job better, or if there is anxiety that this extends the powers of the Secretary of State too liberally, I am sure that the wording can be tightened. The hope is that the clauses are sufficiently restrictive to ensure that this is not simply giving the Secretary of State more powers than Members of the Committee would wish.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000019"></a>The proposal is to do something that the Government already believe is good&#151;extending the power of the regulator to cover all social housing tenants. It does so in a way that means we get a bird in the hand instead of one in the bush; we are not going to have to wait for two years for something that may or may not happen. It places in the Bill the chance for this to be triggered as soon as the negotiations&#151;which I do not think are too far away&#151;can be concluded between the different parties on exactly how the practicalities of this can be operated. It means that events will not intervene between now and the legislation that may or may not happen in a couple of years&#146; time. I think that it would make everybody happy. I hope very much that the Committee will agree. I have pleasure in begging to move.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000020"></a><a name="80611-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080611137000389"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I have two amendments in this group at the more extreme end of the matter. They delete the ineligibility of local authorities and ALMOs from registration. Regulations are second best. Sometimes it is better to have a regulation-making power than no power at all, and this may be such an occasion. However, we are all familiar with the procedures&#146; shortcomings, particularly in that no amendment can be made to an order.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000021"></a>Another reason for wanting to see local authorities included from the start is that the new agency&#151;the Tenant Services Authority, did the noble Lord say?&#151;should start by involving local authorities and local authority tenants, who should be involved in its development right from its inception and not as an add-on. Culturally it is important to include all those with an interest right from the start; it is quite hard to change an approach after two or three years. Having said that&#151;and having referred to the regulation-making provisions, perhaps more scathingly than I intended, as second best&#151;I would certainly be happier if the Government could be persuaded to go down that route than I would be with no reference at all to local authorities, or rather with the only reference to them being to exclude them.</p>

I shall not speak at length. It is an unusual and impressive situation that we have support from bodies like the Local Government Association and the National Federation of ALMOs, which would be captured by this self-volunteering, all-encompassing regulatory proposal, but also the Chartered Institute of Housing and TPAS. I pay tribute to the way in which they have worked together and put forward a progressive and mature case for change. I will not repeat the arguments on why domain-wide regulation  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC201"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC201</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is in the interest of tenants. The Committee knows that, not least the requirement to have a set of performance data.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000023"></a>I still struggle to understand why we are making such heavy weather of this. My good and noble friend Lady Andrews has tried to cheer me up in her kind way by saying that she has a little Bill coming along soon which will put it all right. I hear that. But the Government have known what CABE was going to recommend before it was published. They have known for well over a year that CABE was going to recommend this. Therefore, officials have had plenty of time to do the necessary policy work. I recognise that part of the anxiety was at a time when the Government rightly were seeking to deregulate local government through one door and that they did not want to re-regulate it through another. No doubt there were some good battles between officials within the department. But the LGA has cracked that problem for the department. Therefore, that is no reason for not moving forward with this.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000024"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Best, that in a situation where the House itself may be suggesting&#151;or even going bolder and promoting&#151;a powerful set of powers, the Minister need have no fear that the scrutiny process of this place will fall foul of that. I cannot speak for the whole House, but I would nevertheless want to see a different set of situations addressed in amendments. We have waited 30 years for an improved regulatory system for social housing. It is common sense to all of us that it should be domain-wide. It is not sensible to start a bus with one of its wheels missing. I urge the Government, even at this late date, to encourage their officials to get this together so that by Third Reading we can have the Bill which all of us believe is right and necessary.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000025"></a>I do not wish to be rude and make comments about future promissory notes from the Government, who I support and love. But Members of the Committee know what I mean: no Government or Minister can at this stage guarantee that a Bill will come forward. What goes into the last Queen&#146;s Speech of a Parliament is very different from what went into the first one. The Minister is not able to deliver on her promise that this will happen within two years. We should therefore put it into the Bill now.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000026"></a><a name="80611-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0001.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="080611137000391"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Best, has introduced what I would call the uninvited guest to the feast. Whether it is an unwanted guest is another matter. It is quite clear that there is a great deal of support for this proposal. I add my voice to those of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, to say that we really ought to do this now. The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, made the political point&#151;which I might have done but now have no need to do&#151;that certainty about a future legislative programme is something that is not in our control. Even if we had been three years earlier in this cycle it still would not have been certain, but now there is particular uncertainty.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000027"></a>Everyone&#151;the sector, the housing authorities and the LGA&#151;agrees that we have the opportunity here. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I accept that  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC202"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC202</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the regulatory processes are not what we would desire. But I have to tell her that it might have come up later in the Bill, because elsewhere in the Bill we have mention of regulations that have had a special procedure. The regulatory procedure is what we define it as. If we amend this Bill, we can draft the regulatory procedure to permit draft regulations to be seen and amended before we have to deal with the regulations. That is technically possible to do. I think that difficulty can be overcome, and it is important to make that point.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Best, made the case that this will mean that a large part of the process of producing a unified domain for the social housing sector is possible if we do this. If we do not do it, frankly, it is uncertain. I am a great believer in availing oneself of an opportunity if it does arise, so I support the amendment. If the wording is not perfect, I am sure that it can be adjusted between now and Report, when we might in any event want to consider it further. I hope that this will be taken further.</p>

Noble Lords might think that as a former employee of a regulator I would welcome this very handy tool, but I think that so-called Henry VIII provisions are to be resisted if at all possible. This one is not just enabling; it is enabling primary legislation to be amended by subordinate legislation. On the whole, that is not a democratic procedure. In any case, as far as I can see, the process is not likely to go faster than the primary legislation which, I understand, my noble friend intends to bring forward. I feel uneasy about the Henry VIII aspect.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000030"></a><a name="80611-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="080611137000393"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> I start by welcoming Members of the Committee to Part 2 of the Bill. We have looked forward to this day for some time, and so far it has lived up to expectations. I am glad that we started with an amendment that raises some important issues that cross the whole platform of what we are discussing in this part of the Bill. I was relieved when the noble Lord said that he was not going to pursue the private rented sector, because it creates even more complexities than the local authority sector. The noble Lord knows that it is Julie Rugg&#146;s task to come to the department to tell us about some of the options that we might have, after she completes her review of the private rented sector.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000031"></a>The noble Lord also told the Committee, rightly, that we have decided that Oftenant was not the best possible choice of title; when we think about it, it may have been the worst choice. The Tenant Services Authority is what it will be called, which is much better because it represents what it is going to do. The amendment proposes to introduce an enabling power to provide a framework under which the future regulation of local authority housing would operate. It has been obvious from the way in which the noble Lord presented the case&#151;he is the best possible advocate&#151;the support around the Committee and the evidence that he drew on, that there is considerable sympathy with the process  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC203"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC203</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that he has proposed. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Whitaker for raising one of the problems that we have with it, which I will come on to.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000032"></a>I want to be sure that Members of the Committee understand that we have never, ever thought that cross-domain regulation was anything other than a good thing. We have always been committed to it, so it has not been an uninvited guest. It has been a guest that has been under inspection, in a way that is perfectly proper and necessary. Martin Cave was clear in his report, and he was clear when we met him, that cross-domain regulation is designed to improve standards for every tenant, and that is right. The examples of the flows of tenants back and forward between the sectors, which the noble Lord, Lord Best, pointed out, are accurate. It illustrates the complexity. The only thing between us is how we move forward. This will involve taking enabling powers. We have had to consider a Henry VIII power many times in this House. It enables primary legislation to be amended or repealed by subordinate legislation. Our problem with an enabling power in this case&#151;we do not have a natural aversion to it&#151;is with the process to which it gives rise. I will come to that.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000033"></a>In a way, I was hoping that noble Lords would think that the amendment had been overtaken by events, given our commitment, which we announced in the draft legislative programme, to legislate for cross-domain regulation through the Community Empowerment, Housing and Economic Regeneration Bill. The noble Lord is quite right, but he had the words in the wrong order. It will not be a slight Bill; it will be substantial, and this will be an important part of it. I do not share the gloomy prognostications of noble Lords. I do not believe that there will be any issue. We will introduce the Bill in the autumn following a White Paper this summer, and we will be secure in our expectations that this will be an element of that. There is no question of our passing up a golden opportunity.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000034"></a>Our intention is to proceed, and our timetable is very clear. In that case, we really must subject the notion of an enabling power to proper scrutiny, because it offers no advantages with regard to timing. The noble Lord, Lord Best, was very firm on this point. He said that it was about timing; he did not want to contemplate delay. I understand the sense of urgency, but we can hope to achieve cross-domain regulation only by April 2010 at the earliest through either route. I shall explain why.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000035"></a>The amendment is hardly light on process. The enabling power proposed in complementary Amendment No. 97PB would place requirements on us to consult and to publish a draft order and a statement of representations. The order would have to be debated and agreed by both Houses. That process is quite lengthy. It could certainly not be concluded in time to deliver cross-domain regulation from April 2009. It would have to have proper scrutiny. We would have to protect against unintended consequences. Nothing would be more disastrous if we brought forward something with aspects which we simply did not predict. There is

<a name="80611-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000036"></a>The remaining case for an enabling power seems to rest on two points: the desirability of providing a safeguard, should we not be successful in including measures in the future Bill&#151;I hope that I have dealt with that; and the idea that regulations are somehow a more appropriate way to proceed than primary legislation. I take issue with what my noble friend Lord Filkin said about the timing. The co-advisory panel has been of enormous benefit to us. It is working extremely hard. Its task is to work with the stakeholders who will be responsible for implementing this, as well as with those who tell us how to address the wide range of implications involved. These are very complex matters. It is not a question of officials in the DCLG working with the regulator; it is a question of everyone who is involved in this process knowing exactly what the implications are and how this will be achieved. The co-advisory panel is now nearing the final stage of its work. It has made welcome progress in working through many of the complexities, but there is still a little way to go.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000037"></a>On the second point, it is difficult to see why secondary legislation would be a better approach than taking measures through a Bill. It is absolutely right that this House and all the stakeholders, of whom there are many&#151;the LGA is not the only one, although it is playing a sterling role&#151;can scrutinise these proposals in detail. We can then propose amendments. Despite what the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has said, the process is infinitely more satisfactory, transparent, open and robust. For an issue which is as complex as this with major implications for tenants and local authorities I believe that noble Lords will certainly want to scrutinise these provisions at length on the Floor of the House and bring forward amendments. I do not believe that a debate on regulations would give anything like that opportunity.</p>

Draft regulations can be published, debated in both Houses and amended before they are finalised. Even if that were not the case, the Clerks have informed me&#151;I took the trouble to check this with them&#151;that the law is what Parliament says it is. If we decide that a procedure in the Bill is satisfactory, that will become the law as regards the relevant issue. We need to be clear about that. What the Minister said does not constitute a plausible excuse in my view.</p>

Ian Cole has led this very

As I say, the debate has never been about whether we put this ideal into practice but about how we do it. How do we provide a consistent deal for all tenants while designing a system that fits with the local government performance framework? Given the changes in that framework, that in itself requires scrupulous attention. I am not persuaded by the amendment. I very rarely disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Best, but I do in this instance.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000040"></a>As regards the amendment put forward by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, I appreciate her general argument, which I addressed. It is important to note that there is a world of difference between our removing an explicit bar to the registration of local authorities and providing for a framework to accommodate them. I know that the noble Baroness hoped to have the wider debate and I respect that but the amendment would take us to a confusing place where local authorities, though not prohibited from registering, would be under no obligation to do so. If they chose to do so, the regulator and any authorities that registered would face serious problems struggling with a framework which is obviously not designed with that in mind. It is better that we proceed as we are with the necessary work to ensure we have provisions which provide for the right form of regulation.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000041"></a>However, I take this opportunity to address concerns regarding potential problems which stakeholders fear could arise if there were a delay in achieving cross-domain regulation. We have said from the outset that we want to extend the regulator&#146;s remit within two years of it starting to regulate registered providers. The timetable I have outlined would allow for that. As I have emphasised, an enabling power would not significantly reduce the timetable.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000042"></a>The transition team leading on the work necessary to take us from the Housing Corporation to the new regulator is well aware of the need to plan ahead for cross-domain. In the coming months we will need to ensure that stakeholders are fully involved in developing the detail of legislation and helping to define how regulation will work. I am confident that the LGA and its representatives and the groups that represent tenants&#146; interests will play a full role in helping to shape that new organisation in anticipation of achieving single-domain regulation.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000043"></a>I believe that absolutely nothing divides us except process. The timing can be reconciled but giving the House an opportunity to have a full debate on what is proposed is the proper way forward. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000044"></a><a name="80611-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080611137000396"></a>Lord Best:</b> I am enormously grateful to colleagues on all sides for their support. The only word of dissent revolves around the use of enabling powers. I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, for preceding the meeting by finding out exactly what the processes and procedures may be in that regard. If an enabling power is being used confined to an issue on which there is cross-party support for the outcome and in which the potential protagonists, both landlords and tenants, are in full agreement, one is not extending

If there is the chance to debate draft regulations, one really gets the best of all worlds.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000045"></a>The question of culture, which the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised, seems quite an important one. Even if it is only two years before these council tenants are brought within the fold&#151;this is, after all, the successor of a body that confined itself entirely to the tenants of housing associations&#151;people will not have the time and energy to take account of the slightly different ways of working that would be appropriate if council tenants were within the fold. I feel that that is an important and useful additional point.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000046"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said, the Minister, however well meaning, is not able to deliver the legislative timetable. One is acting on faith if one walks away from this opportunity now to secure something that can be used when the moment is right. As to the timing, I cannot believe that consultation on the details of this would take very long. Following Professor Martin Cave&#146;s work, Professor Ian Cole&#146;s work has included the people who would be at the core of the consultation. They have worked very hard and very speedily to bring the matter to a point where an agreed report is going to the Minister for Housing this week. We know that the residents within council housing would find this a more than acceptable extension to the protections that they already have and that the landlord bodies already are in agreement. So the consultative process is able to be extremely speedy. We are ready to go. It seems an awful shame to miss this golden opportunity.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000047"></a>The next Bill will, I am sure, be important and useful, but it will not be specifically about regulation of this sector. This Bill is about the Tenant Services Authority and this seems to be the time when we should be making it as good as it can be. With a promise of returning to this matter, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000053"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment is a short and brief probe about eligibility for registration with what, as my noble friend muttered to me, sounds a bit like the caretakers&#146; organisation&#151;the Tenant Services Authority. However, that is better than Oftenant. Why can it not just be the Tenants Authority? My amendments ask, in the case of a body principally concerned with Welsh housing, what does,</p>

<p><a name="080611137000312"></a>mean? Does that mean a bit more than half of a body&#146;s properties? Are we talking about properties or the number of tenants? I think that it probably refers to the number of properties. What is meant by the phrase,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000362"></a>&#147;activities are principally undertaken in respect of Wales&#148;?</ul>



<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC207"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC207</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="080611137000313"></a>It does not refer to activities in Wales but to activities in respect of Wales. What are these &#147;activities&#148;? Does it refer to properties, or the size of its investment, or the number of tenants or staff?</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000054"></a>Obviously this is a comparatively small point, though in practice it may not be. I do not know how many bodies potentially would fall within this category. Would the Welsh arrangement continue to apply to properties in England and therefore to tenants in England? This might appear to be a straightforward definition clause but it may raise bigger issues. I hope the Minister, who has had notice of these points, can flesh them out a little. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000055"></a><a name="80611-gc0002.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0002.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080611137000398"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This amendment, in the context of Welsh housing, probes the extent of the Bill and the separation between the functions of the regulator in England and the Welsh Minister in Wales. It would help if I set out clearly the position on the territorial extent of Part 2 of the Bill.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000056"></a>Part 2 sets out a new system of housing regulation for England only. It replaces Part 1 of the Housing Act 1996 which set out a system of housing regulation for England and Wales. That system is currently operated by the Housing Corporation for England and the Welsh Ministers for Wales, reflecting the devolution settlement. The new system of regulation that we set out in Part 2 is therefore for England only. This means that we need to preserve the existing system, as set out in the Housing Act 1996, for Wales only. Clauses 63 to 65 achieve that.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000057"></a>In particular, Clause 63 distinguishes between &#147;English bodies&#148;, which may register with the regulator, and &#147;Welsh bodies&#148;, which may not because they are more properly dealt with by the Welsh Ministers. English bodies must be established in England and Welsh bodies must be established in Wales. In order to be eligible for registration in Wales, a Welsh body must own housing,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000363"></a>&#147;only or mainly in Wales&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000314"></a>or undertake its activities principally in respect of Wales. The amendment limits that definition so that a Welsh body must own housing &#147;only in Wales&#148;. The effect of that is that a Welsh landlord who owned a single property outside Wales could not register with the Welsh Ministers, and could therefore not receive a social housing grant from the Welsh Ministers under Section 18 of the Housing Act 1996.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000058"></a>We obviously want to ensure that landlords are subject to the right form of regulation and that tenants in England and Wales have the protection I have described. However, it would be impractical to legislate so that new providers of social housing are excluded from registering in Wales if they have any properties at all across the border in England. I know that the noble Baroness has concerns about English tenants of Welsh landlords, who would not be accountable to the regulator even if English homes comprised 49 per cent of the stock. &#147;Stock&#148;, as she has demonstrated, means properties rather than tenants.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000059"></a>In practice, however, this situation is unlikely to materialise. We must bear in mind that the criteria for registration affect only new providers. Existing RSLs

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000060"></a>Other parts of the Bill ensure that landlords of new rented social housing funded by the HCA must be registered with the regulator. Here, I am referring to Clause 34, which provides that where the HCA builds or funds housing that is to be low-cost rental accommodation, the HCA must ensure that the landlord of that housing is either a local authority or a registered provider. Being registered with Welsh Ministers would not suffice. I cannot see a situation in which the problem would arise; whereas the amendment would be disabling.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000061"></a>The noble Baroness also asked two questions about the vocabulary that we use. There is no distinction between &#147;mainly&#148; and &#147;principally&#148;. There is no material difference in that context. &#147;Housing activities&#148; means housing activities as defined in the Housing Act 1996. That does not really address her question, so I will write to her about that and about any other aspects of the relationship that she feels I have not explained fully enough.</p>

The noble Baroness gave a useful explanation of what underlies all of this. It is difficult to probe without being accused of trying to dismantle the Bill. This sort of thing is a genuine attempt to understand what words mean, because someone is going to have to interpret them at some point, and I would like to know the criteria that will be used for the interpretation. If we do not ask, who will? That is our function. After that little outburst, I would be grateful if she would answer that question in a letter. We should pursue it.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000070"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a technical but important provision which will help to ensure a smooth transition from the Housing Corporation to its successors in the regulator and the Homes and Communities Agency. The Bill already includes provision for the transfer of assets from the Housing Corporation to the new bodies, and for co-operation in an interim period, including the lending of staff and buildings. While those provisions address assets and staff, the new clause addresses functions.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000071"></a>The establishment of the regulator in particular will involve detailed work on new systems that will require extensive consultation with stakeholders, for example, on the regulator&#146;s standards or on eligibility criteria for registering with the regulator. It is therefore likely that, when initially established, the regulator&#146;s powers to set and consult on standards, registration criteria and so on, will need to be commenced first, so that when the new register becomes live, all the necessary parts of the regime are in place.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000072"></a>Therefore, to ensure an early transition, and to ensure that there is no regulatory vacuum, we will need to transfer the existing regulatory powers of the Housing Corporation to the regulator for a transitional period. That will enable the regulator to take over operational responsibility for regulation as soon as possible. The new clause simply enables those arrangements to be put in place. It is necessary. It is modest, but it is important, and I hope that the Committee will accept it. I beg to move.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080611137000344"></a>&#147;In the case of the Regulator, it is considered that it would be impossible for it to begin exercising all of its new regulatory functions for a considerable period of time (because of the requirements for consultation in relation to setting standards under Clause 191) and it will therefore be necessary, in the short term, for the Regulator to exercise the Corporation&#146;s existing regulatory powers&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000082"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 97R to 97T, all of which are in my name, are grouped with this amendment. These are fairly modest amendments probing some aspects of the part of the Bill to which we are now moving and which is headed &#147;Social housing&#148;. I have exercised some self-restraint as I had thought of tabling quite a few more amendments to this part of the Bill about social housing, because there are some very important issues here that would bear discussion. The main reason I did not do so is that I was not sure that I would be able to be here this week. One of the reasons I have exercised self-restraint for the coming part of the Bill is that I shall not be here on Monday, for which I apologise. I imagine that apology will be accepted with alacrity by people wanting to get on.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000083"></a>The purpose of these amendments is to test two things. The first, which we discussed briefly yesterday, is the meaning of &#147;low cost&#148; and &#147;affordability&#148;. As part of a different discussion yesterday I made the point that in some places there is a requirement for social housing that may be let at a price that is not significantly lower than the market price for rented accommodation in that area because of conditions. Amendments Nos. 97Q and 97R are the other side of the same coin. They test how far below market rents affordable housing or low-cost rental accommodation has to be in areas where market rents are high. The amendment inserts the words,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000364"></a>&#147;to such an extent that it is affordable for those on low incomes&#148;.</ul>

<a name="80611-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000084"></a>In other words, providing accommodation at a rent lower than the prevailing rent does not mean that it is low cost or affordable if the prevailing rents are high; it has to be sufficiently below the prevailing rent levels for people to be able to afford it. Circumstances are different in different parts of the country and in different areas. It would be unfortunate to have definitions that do not take account of that. When people look at needs in different areas, they would probably agree that that is the need. The wording of legislation should reflect that even though the need is different in different areas.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000085"></a>Amendments No. 97S and 97T&#151;I do not understand how people cope with all these numbers and letters, especially when the order in which Z comes in the alphabet is different in different amendments; some people understand these things but the rest of us just try to cope&#151;make the same point, that while preference in social housing should be given to people in need of housing, it is also necessary to look at the nature of the communities that are being created, affected or changed. One of these amendments relates to accommodation for rent and the other to owner-occupied accommodation, but in both the key is the need to promote mixed and sustainable communities. To some degree this goes back to the report produced rather more than a year ago by Professor John Hills on the role of social housing, in which he identified a number of problems specifically about council housing but which also relate to social housing in general. One of the main problems he identified was the unsustainability of communities increasingly dominated by the poorest and most vulnerable. There is tension between providing accommodation for people in the greatest need and creating communities that are sufficiently mixed and sustainable.</p>
<h5><a name="080611137000376"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000086"></a>There are all sorts of different ways of dealing with this, but this is not the time to go into them. However, the purpose of the amendment is to make the point that, if we are not careful, social housing becomes ghetto housing of one sort or another, and it is very important that we avoid that. Let us consider what has happened to council housing in many areas over the years. Some council estates used to be entirely or mainly owned by the council. In many areas, particularly when the estates had existed for 25 years or more, there was a balanced and sustainable mix of ages, occupations, incomes and lifestyles, and the estates had become mature communities.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000087"></a>The twin pressures of allocation policies that restricted new allocations to people in the greatest need for the very best of reasons, which we all supported, and of the right to buy, in which substantial parts of the estate were sold off and went into the private ownership sector&#151;in many cases, these are now being sold on to private landlords, unfortunately&#151;have resulted in those council estates being less mixed, less sustainable and less mature communities than they used to be. These are important issues. I do not want to detain your Lordships for very long, but these issues must underlie discussions about social housing in general, where we are going with it and what sort of communities we are creating. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000088"></a><a name="80611-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080611137000408"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> I greatly enjoyed the restrained contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on what he described as modest amendments. It was a useful beginning to a discourse on the philosophical underpinning to the issue. I congratulate him on that, because we sometimes lose sight of where the whole notion of social housing comes from and it is helpful to be reminded. His observations about the impact of the right to buy on some council estates were very interesting. I recognise some of them from my experience of my time on my old local authority.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000089"></a>The council estate adjacent to the university has in part become studentified, which is an issue; there is no question about that. It was a strange spin-off from a policy that was put into place by Conservatives in an earlier Government, from motives that one well understood at the time. That Government certainly believed that they were taking a measure that would provide a greater social mix in many of the council estate areas in which the right to buy was taken up.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000090"></a>In general, the amendments return to the definition of social housing, which has been the subject of running debates not only in your Lordships&#146; House but in the Commons Committee. They follow on directly from that and seek to provide, as the noble Lord has argued, further instances of where the clauses operate. I can offer the reassurance that the clauses do not introduce any element of means-testing into social housing, if that is a concern, and that his amendment to Clause 70 explicitly refers to promoting mixed and sustainable communities as a criterion for allocations.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000091"></a>The noble Lord has explained his amendment to Clause 71, which attempts to address a number of important social housing issues, such as the affordability of rent levels for those on low incomes. He referred particularly to how that affordability might vary, as he sees it, in different parts of the country, and to the importance of creating mixed and sustainable communities.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000092"></a>Amendment No. 97S intends to influence allocations policies so that they promote more mixed communities within social housing estates. However, these clauses do not affect allocations policies. They refer to the existence of allocations policies simply because they are one of the features that define social housing. The amendment would therefore have no impact on day-to-day allocations, but may have a perverse impact on regulation. It might mean that some new homes for rent could not be classified as social housing, because the allocations policies were not in line with the definition.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000093"></a>If, for example, a registered provider was operating an allocations policy that was not in line with the regulator&#146;s standards, any new homes that were built would not be defined as social housing, and those homes would therefore fall outside the scope of regulation. The effect would be precisely the opposite of what is intended. The homes need to be defined as social housing so that the regulator can enforce its standards.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000094"></a>Amendment No. 97T makes a similar amendment to the definition of low-cost home ownership accommodation. It includes a similar reference to promoting mixed and sustainable communities and refers to,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000365"></a>&#147;affordable for those on low incomes&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC213"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC213</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="080611137000315"></a>That language is unhelpful, because most low-cost home ownership purchasers often can afford to rent at a market rate. This would in fact restrict low-cost home ownership to very marginal purchasers and would seem to go against the main purpose of  bringing about more mixed communities with a range of incomes.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000095"></a>However, we agree that the amendments probe some pertinent issues. For example, the question of how we can achieve more mixed and sustainable communities in social housing goes to the core of what the department does on a day-to-day basis. Our concern is that these issues cannot be addressed by these clauses and that the amendments seem to be attempting to achieve policy outcomes that the clauses have little or no impact on.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000096"></a>It may be helpful therefore if I set out again the purpose of these clauses. The clauses define which new homes become social housing. I reiterate that all existing homes owned by existing registered social landlords are automatically defined as social housing unless they are specifically excluded, such as care homes, for example. Once a home is classified as social housing, it remains social housing unless a specific event occurs, for example the tenant exercising a right to purchase.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000097"></a>In terms of the amendments, the clauses do not affect how homes are allocated. They do not affect the tenure of the tenant, and they do not make it possible for homes to leave the social housing stock. These clauses refer to allocations policy, for example, because that is one feature which defines social housing and therefore helps us to identify which homes need to be regulated. The clauses do not have any impact on allocations policies in their own right.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000098"></a>While the regulator will play an important role in ensuring that rent is affordable for people on low income, through its ability to set standards on rent and the Secretary of State&#146;s ability to direct on rent standards, the clauses are not the right place for these important issues to be addressed and they will have no impact on long-term rent setting. I have some sympathy with the aims of the amendments, but I do not believe that they would achieve these aims and, in some instances, they may even be counterproductive.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000099"></a>To protect tenants, it is important that all new publicly-funded social housing falls under the scope of the regulator. In particular, the amendments might mean that some new homes could not be classified as social housing, for example, because the local allocations policies were not in line with the definition. That would leave tenants vulnerable and would leave the regulator unable to enforce standards. I understand what the noble Lord is trying to achieve, and he has raised some important issues in the amendments,  but I rather fancy that the amendments do not  achieve their objectives and that they might have perverse consequences.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000115"></a>This amendment is a way of getting on to the agenda an issue that we have not addressed hitherto in relation to what areas the regulator should cover. I am sure that these clauses as drafted do not do what I intend and&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, admitted with his amendments&#151;I am sure there are some serious technical problems with them. However, they put on the agenda the fact that social landlords, whether they are councils, ALMOs or, in some cases, registered housing associations, manage large estates. On those large estates there are not only tenants in the strict sense of the word&#151;direct tenants of the social landlord&#151;but also ex-tenants who bought their flats, who are of the first right-to-buy generation and very similar in demographics and attitudes to the tenants, and those   


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC215"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>who bought the flats as the second generation and live on the estate of relatively low-cost housing, but not that low cost these days. There are also flats that were bought to let and are therefore occupied by sub-tenants who may be sub-tenants of other registered social landlords. This achieves the kind of mixed communities that we are all after in that there are owner-occupiers and direct tenants, often short-term tenancies fulfilling priorities in housing allocation priorities.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000116"></a>However, certain services, charges and relationships are still with the main landlord. On a large council estate a lot of things are dealt with on a more or less equivalent basis for tenants, sub-tenants and lessees, yet the Bill does not allow the regulator to intervene in the areas relating to non-direct tenants: for example: cleaning services; environmental services&#151;the gardening, to put it crudely; big bills that relate to major works; smaller episodic bills relating, for example, to the introduction of digital television, which I have had cause to raise in other contexts in this House; and issues such as additional heating where charges are imposed by the landlord or the ALMO on tenants and lessees alike and will ultimately fall on the sub-tenants as well. They are calculated on the same basis and the services are the same for all forms of tenure.</p>
<h5><a name="080611137000377"></a>5 pm</h5>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000117"></a>While accepting the priority in the Bill on those areas that were previously regulated by the Housing Corporation&#151;and housing associations essentially&#151;and the assumption of the noble Lord, Lord Best, that we could later extend this to ALMOs and local authority tenants, it needs to be recognised that there are residual landlord functions that also relate to other forms of tenure on that estate that will not be allowed within the purview of the regulator. The noble Lord, Lord Best, used the word &#147;domain&#148;, which to me is not just a status issue but a physical one, where the later landlord is covering all these different forms of tenure. Many quality of life issues, some expense and value-for-money issues and some fairness and equality issues arise in relation to all these forms of tenure.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000118"></a>That is not a particularly acceptable message to some of the representatives of tenants and lessees who often see things through different lights and who are very much in the domain of improving the quality of life and genuinely creating mixed and sustainable communities in these areas. If nothing else, I hope that the Minister will give some indication that the department is prepared to take on board in this context, and in other parts of the Bill, that there are issues to be addressed that are appropriate for regulation and regulatory intervention. The general regulation on lessees or in tenancies in the private sector will not cover these.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000119"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Best, I would have preferred the regulator to have a very wide function in the first place. Down the line we will have to address the situation; otherwise we will create another form of inequity and inflexibility in housing provision by restricting the regulator to dealing with only one channel of communication between the provider and the occupier when there are multiple forms of relationship. I beg  to move.</p>

Sometimes that is true where you would not expect it on ordinary estates, but it is particularly true in blocks of flats and such developments. I remind the Committee that my daughter is a tenant of a private landlord in a former council flat, and she is surrounded by tenants in similar situations, those from housing associations and people who own their own flats. It is very mixed indeed and it can get complex, which is exactly why people need the sort of regulation that the noble Lord suggests.</p>

I heard what the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said, and there is clearly a problem, but the people who bought the properties presumably thought that they were escaping from the inclusiveness of the original arrangement. If we do this, we will make the regulatory process more complex. It would be inappropriate to have blanket regulations applying to somebody who had bought their way out and had only a residual liability in respect of estate development. One would have to draft regulations to take account of the variations in tenure, which would make them more complicated; but the amendment would make that necessary.</p>

Where there is mixed tenure, does he envisage financial arrangements applying to the provider of the services? I am in broad sympathy with what he says, but I cannot see how it would work in practice. Would those financial arrangements be different according to the kind of tenure that people have on the estate, and what would be the implications?</p>

It is a relief when the questions are put to other Members of the Committee.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000124"></a>An important set of issues has been raised in this short debate. My noble friend is exercised by the fact that, for very good reasons, we have mixed economies within some of our larger estates and in blocks of flats where there is a mix of tenure. There are issues about those who have bought their properties and who are now faced with major bills for repairs, some of which are prompted by the fact that decent homes legislation enables local authorities to spend considerable amounts of money doing up their own properties. That implies and brings with it a cost to those who own their own homes, which illustrates my response to the amendment as a whole. It may sound a bit harsh that we do not think it is necessary for the remit of the regulator to be extended to leaseholders. It is not that we are not concerned about them but we consider that, because they are in a different position, they are more appropriately dealt with through other regimes, systems and services than through the wholesale extension of the regulatory framework.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000125"></a>If all the occupiers of an estate are owner-occupiers, they will clearly get the benefits of the legislation. However, where some of the properties are owner-occupied  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC217"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and some are let on a social housing basis, the owner-occupiers will have the benefit of leasehold legislation. In addition, the standards that may be set by the regulator under Clause 191 will give tenants on those estates and owner-occupiers protection, because in practice it will be extremely difficult not to do so. That clause will give power to the regulator to set standards for registered providers as to the nature, extent and quality of accommodation, facilities or services provided by them in connection with social housing. The legislation provides that that those standards may cover such areas as maintenance, environmental and social matters, as well as estate management.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000126"></a>While the standards will be set for the benefit of the social housing sector, many of them will also be of benefit to owner-occupiers living in estates with a mix of both owner-occupiers and social tenants. We need to go back to the principles of why we need a regulator for social housing, and we shall come on to that in later amendments. However, the problem is that social housing is not subject to the usual competitive pressures and therefore one is looking at a very contained market with few market incentives for good management and little entry to, or mobility within, the sector. Owner-occupiers have greater control over their housing circumstances, as the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, said. They have more mobility and choice. However, it is important that properties should be properly managed, irrespective of landlord or ownership.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000127"></a>We also have to remember that leaseholders have a wide range of rights, protections and responsibilities set out in their leases and in the body of the law; for example, in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985. The lease sets out enforceable contractual rights, and legislation places a condition of reasonableness on variable service charges which a leaseholder has to pay. They can be challenged through the leasehold valuation tribunals, and further court action is possible.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000128"></a>There are statutory requirements for all landlords, including those in the social sector, to consult with leaseholders before carrying out works to buildings and estates. There is a set of principles around that consultation and notices of intention. We have strengthened that. We are proposing changes to the legislation, for example, so that leaseholders will automatically receive a regular statement containing information about their service charges with the same right to see supporting documentation. Amendments have been included in the Housing and Regeneration Bill to allow this to happen. There will be sanctions if this is not complied with, including the right to withhold service charges. So we are strengthening the protection available to leaseholders.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000129"></a>Perhaps I may say something about what we are doing on large major-works bills in parts of London that have caused particular problems. I think that it is fair to say that this issue has been exercising my department for some time. We have been very conscious that the problem is very variable. Some boroughs have much higher numbers of leaseholders faced with these very high bills but some are not affected; it depends on the stock and patterns of ownership. Nevertheless when a leaseholder, particularly one on a low income,  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC218"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>is suddenly faced with a bill for &#163;10,000 or &#163;20,000 because his block of flats is being upgraded, it is a real issue.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000130"></a>We have looked at various ways of addressing the issue. We set out in a Statement to Parliament last March how landlords, who already have a lot of scope in what they can do, can do more. When we reviewed it last year, we set out how we would look at extending the payment options. At the moment&#151;I put this on the record because I think that it is important and I want local authorities to take note of it&#151;local authorities can provide a loan at a low rate of interest, spread payment over a longer period or agree to delay payment until the property is sold. They can also buy back properties from owners who are in arrears with service charges or cannot cope with the costs of looking after their homes. The Government fund part of the cost of their doing so by letting them retain more of the receipts from property sales.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80611-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000131"></a>We are extending the options on offer to local authorities through the Housing and Regeneration Bill. Clause 308 will give local authority landlords a power to buy shares in properties in order to assist leaseholders to pay their major works bills. Clause 307 will give such landlords a power to offer leaseholders equity loans. These are interest-free loans which pay a percentage of the market value when the property in question is sold. I think that that is an extremely important new power. However, I should also like to ensure that local authorities use the powers that they already have to help leaseholders in difficulty and that they do so systematically and consistently. In addition, we are boosting the support available via LEASE, the body which supports, helps and advises leaseholders.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000132"></a>We are doing a range of things in relation to these situations and I think that they will really help. That is a powerful reason why it would be better that, rather than extend regulation in the way in which the noble Lord would like to see, we actually used, developed and promoted the powers that already exist.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000133"></a>Digital switchover is another, relatively recent issue which is important to those living in mixed blocks of flats. We are working very closely with Digital UK and have for some time been embarked on a campaign to inform local authorities to ensure that they know where they are in the timetable for switching off the analogue signal. They are bound to give their tenants access to the new technologies. Working with us, Digital UK is encouraging landlords, regardless of whether it is covered by statutory requirements, to consult residents about upgrades. There is an issue about landlords sometimes going for the most expensive option. Digital UK recently published good practice on resident consultation for landlords, entitled <I>Calling All Landlords</I>.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000134"></a>So we have in place different partnerships and different ways of dealing with some of the issues that the noble Lord raised. In all fairness, I think that that is a better, more sensitive and more targeted way of achieving the outcome that he wants to see, which is to ensure that leaseholders have a fair deal. I hope he will be able to withdraw his amendment on that basis.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000135"></a><a name="80611-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="080611137000416"></a>Lord Whitty:</b> I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. I am particularly grateful to the Minister for putting on record the situation with local authorities and major repair bills. I endorse her view that local authorities should use their powers to the full, because quite a lot of lessees who are faced with major works bills bought their homes in the first flush of the right to buy, and they are now pensioners. They may be just above the housing benefit limit, but they are very pressed to pay and are very frightened by those bills.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000136"></a>The main point of my amendment relates to collective services in a block where there may be three or four different forms of tenure on any floor. Exactly the same issue arises when the lift does not work, for example. In those circumstances, it is not sensible to have different forms of regulation and different levels of payment according to the different types of tenure. It is possible to collect any payment differently&#151;through service charges for lessees and through rent, spread over time, for tenants&#151;but, in essence, fairness and quality of service apply to all of them equally. Some services, such as district heating, literally apply to them equally, because they all have the same charge and the same bill.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000137"></a>I appreciate what the Minister said about this being complex. I also appreciate, as I said at the beginning, that these amendments are probably not the appropriate ones to accept, but if we are to have a coherent approach to housing, particularly on some of our largest estates, ultimately the regulator should be able to cover these areas. These services are clearly different. As the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, says, we are dealing with a much narrower range of services in relation to indirect tenants. However, unless we have a coherent approach and a coherent set of regulations, the piecemeal help, which the Minister has rightly spelt out, is not very evident to the residents and could lead to new inequity and unfairness between different forms of tenure.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000138"></a>I therefore hope that this issue is kept alive. I should have declared an interest as chair of the National Consumer Council, which represents the interests of all consumers&#151;all occupiers&#151;in this respect. They all have a right to expect good quality collective services for which they are appropriately and not unfairly charged. That seems to be a communal issue that is not covered by the legislation or by the scope of the regulator. I suggest that we should extend it to them further down the line. As I said, I hope that this remains a live issue, but in the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>

I take this opportunity to draw to the attention of the Minister and his advisers something that has been bubbling along for a little while. As one can see from the Marshalled List, I am not alone. I am delighted by the support that the amendment has received.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000143"></a>When the Government introduced the housing Green Paper in 2007, they paid tribute to the possibilities of the community land trust. The Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrat Party have also indicated their sympathy for it. We also have in the Committee the housing expert, the noble Lord, Lord Best, who has put his name to the amendment. One could therefore ask what on earth is stopping progress in the Bill. I am sure that the Minister has a number of very good reasons.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000144"></a>When the noble Lord, Lord Best, moved his amendment earlier this afternoon, he said that there was no disagreement, but that we had been told to wait. That may well be the fate of my amendment. I ask the Committee to understand the history of the community land trusts and the garden city movement, which is well known to me. Experience in America and Australia proves that this mechanism is capable of serving the needs of the public. The purpose of the CLT is to hold land and other assets for the benefit of its defined local community. It balances the needs and interests of the individual with the interests of the community as a whole, by separating the value of the land from the value of the property on it.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000145"></a>A CLT holds the land in perpetuity. The owners of the buildings on it may be individual home owners, mutuals and co-operatives, or occupants of affordable rented housing. It is the community ownership and stewardship of the land asset that regulates the occupancy, limits the resale value of the homes built on it and ensures that the housing remains affordable to the community. It is such a simple prospect and project. For many years one has considered the two costs involved in housing. The cost of land was once very low. I remember that we were building well constructed council housing in Enfield and that the land cost less than &#163;2,000. Now I shudder to think what it would be, but it must be up to &#163;100,000, so the cost of land is prohibitive.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000146"></a>When I ask questions of those who advise me on these matters, they tell me that Salford University conducted a survey that reported that inhibition flowed from the uncertainty of a legal definition of a CLT. I can understand that. The report said that authorities and communities, and especially those who fund them, want to know the precise standing of the CLT before putting money in.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000147"></a>That is a good idea. I am willing to hear the Minister tell me that it is a good idea but that it is not in the right form of words. I would be saddened if he were to say that there is another opportunity, but not yet. There is no better opportunity than now. The Housing Corporation permitted and encouraged pilot projects in Stroud, Plymouth and Bristol, which were enthusiastically received. In my post last week came a letter from the community asset trust in north Shropshire which had heard about the initiatives. It has written to me, telling me what it is about and what it hopes to do. Frankly, it says everything that I believe should happen.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000148"></a>Local people will have an asset owned by the community. As the Committee knows, one of my objections to the sale of council houses is that they have been taken out of community control. The houses are controlled by private landlords or private owner-occupiers. I see an opportunity for the Government to give their blessing&#151;I am not talking about funding, resources or priorities. The amendment asks the Government to agree that a legal definition is needed and to authorise their colleagues to table a better drafted definition on Report; I have been in this place long enough to realise that my wording may not be in the correct form.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000149"></a>I declare an interest: as the Committee will know, I am well associated with the Co-operative movement. Those involved in co-operative housing are anxious to serve the community, particularly David Rogers, the chief officer of CDS co-operatives, who has a lot of experience. It was only a working party that made the recommendation for a legal definition. The Government are also anxious to serve the community. Nothing divides us politically or in trying to make progress. I welcome the Government&#146;s stance in having not just one aspect, arrow or bow, but a number of them. This solution will not suit everyone. In north Shropshire, a thriving group of people represents many aspects and they should be encouraged.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000150"></a>Land is precious. Where will it come from? It could come from redundant brownfield sites owned by the council, the Ministry of Defence or other parts of government. It could come from private individuals, who wish to say, &#147;I love this community. We are being denuded of our young people who cannot afford a house. I will donate acres of land. Instead of making a killing and getting millions of pounds, I will give it to the community&#148;. The community then has the knowledge that that is an asset controlled by the community to serve the community in perpetuity.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000151"></a>I hope that the Minister will say something sympathetic. I hope that he will not ask me to wait for a better opportunity in another Bill. Time is pressing. This idea has been about for some time. People are making plans, possibly based upon the fact that this is a housing and regeneration Bill. They may be naive in believing that this is the best vehicle to take this idea forward. It is the best idea, so I hope that the Minister can help. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000152"></a><a name="80611-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080611137000418"></a>Baroness Jones of Whitchurch:</b> It gives me great pleasure to be associated with the amendment of my noble friend Lord Graham, and I do not intend to repeat his eloquent case for local communities having some say and control over how land in their area is utilised. I hope that the Minister will recognise that it is in tune with the Government&#146;s current agenda of empowering local communities. It will do what we were talking about earlier: it will ensure&#151;as my noble friend said, in perpetuity&#151;that we have mixed communities and that our local housing stock does not become skewed in some way by market pressures. This is one of a range of future measures that local communities could have, and it should be seen in that light.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000153"></a>As my noble friend has said, these amendments appear here for a particular reason: the absence of a legal definition currently hampers the development of  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC222"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>these activities. In this respect, this is a modest amendment. It does not propose to extend community land trusts, ask for extra funding or state that they are in any  way superior to other forms of provision. It simply  enables them to operate as a partner with other housing sectors.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000154"></a>I, too, am slightly concerned that the Minister will say nice words about this and then add that this is not the appropriate place. In <I>Inside Housing</I> a few weeks ago, the Minister Iain Wright said that he was sympathetic and would do more work on this but did not feel that the Bill was the right place. Doing more work on this is not in contradiction to putting a modest definition in the Bill. Some of the Government&#146;s aspirations for consulting on how this can be used more widely are fine. Let us have that consultation. But, in the mean time, let us include that definition and work on it. It may be that the Government can come up with a better form of wording, but I do not see why we cannot have the definition and the consultation at the same time. The two issues are not in contradiction. This is a small and modest enabling clause. Let us have a wider debate further down the line. In the mean time, I hope that the Minister will feel able to agree to this amendment.</p>

I, too, support this group of amendments. This subject has been hanging around for a long time. My noble friend Lord Cathcart made a particular plea for rural areas and housing earlier in this Bill. In many rural communities, there are people who would make land available for way below the commercial value of development land on the basis of a community land trust, so that houses would be available to the local community and would remain so in perpetuity. This would help rural areas very much; so, on that basis, I support this group. It is interesting that the proposed system would be available to all communities where land was in the ownership of people who might make it available on this basis.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000157"></a>However, this does not overcome all the obstacles. This is only one technical lacuna&#151;if I can put it that way. The land would still have to go through the dreaded planning system. This does not remove that obstacle at all, as the Government have found when their eco-towns are considered, which seem to have raised a battery of negative sentiment. Going back to rural areas, this would be on such a scale that most communities would welcome it. Whether it would fit with the detailed village envelope as it existed would always be a matter of contention. It may be a matter of time before one can do something about that, because that is the planning system.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000158"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, will say, &#147;We will take this away, look at it and produce a better form of words&#148;, if he does not think that the wording is adequate. If a better form of words cannot be found before Third Reading, I suggest that he does the honourable thing and accepts this form of words. It is a fairly modest challenge. If the Government do not like this form of words because there is some insuperable obstacle in them, they should produce a form of words which would make it work. This is the opportunity. The time is now. I am very much with the noble Lord, Lord Graham, on this. Heaven help us, we are all getting older and we would like to see it happen.</p>

That is clearly admirable. However, she did not, of course, have to achieve best consideration, which a local authority or any other public body would presumably have to do. I imagine that is one of the problems in creating CLTs, which is a concept that we on these Benches very much support. As I read this&#151;I may have got it wrong&#151;these amendments would make CLTs subject to registration. I do not know whether that is what it is intended.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000161"></a>The noble Lord said that this is a very modest amendment. I was taken aback to discover there was an issue over the absence of a definition. I can understand that the absence of accepted structures could be a problem but not the absence of a definition. However, I am not trying to create these bodies and I take his word for it. The Housing and Regeneration Bill is exactly the right place to consider this matter, but we should be looking for something that is not necessarily very long but that gives a basis on which authorities can work and, forgive the pun, build on.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000162"></a>I appreciate that the Bill is at a relatively late stage but, more to the point, the Government are under pressure to get legislation through before the end of the Session. Nevertheless, I hope that we take this opportunity to facilitate the outcomes that we want to see. After all, what should legislation achieve other than to facilitate an outcome?</p>

My political spirit is very much with the amendment. As I listened to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Graham, I thought back to when I chaired a housing committee a long time ago. We wrestled with some of these issues but managed successfully to resolve them when we created the Two Piers Housing Co-op in the 1980s. This issue has been around for a long time and noble Lords with more wisdom and knowledge than I have discussed it.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000164"></a>We understand what the noble Lord is trying to do here and we are very much in tune with its direction and political spirit. His amendment seeks to add community land trusts to the list of organisations which are defined as &#147;English bodies&#148; and which may consequently become registered providers. It is a clever way of trying to get the issue into the Bill. In doing so,  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC224"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC224</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he has argued about the important role that community land trusts can play in helping to deliver affordable homes, which we all agree are much needed by communities, in a way which is sustainable and supported by the community.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000165"></a>As I said, I am sympathetic to the arguments behind these amendments and the Government very much support the whole concept of community land trusts. My notes say that I must resist these amendments but I shall explain why that is the case. First, I emphasise that the Government believe both in empowering people to make decisions about their own lives and in the importance of home ownership in giving people a stake in their community.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000166"></a>We want to capture people&#146;s enthusiasm, solve the problem of affordable housing supply in a way that is right for their local area and give them the opportunity to get involved and influence decisions about local services and assets. The CLT approach is a way of doing that. Community land trusts provide an opportunity to enhance those policy aims and objectives, and we are keen to explore what role they have to play in providing more households on lower incomes with the opportunity of home ownership. We have therefore provided community land trusts with access to funding through the Housing Corporation&#146;s national affordable housing programme. That programme has been working closely with the University of Salford to assist 14 pilot community land trusts across the country. Seven of them are in urban areas, and the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, will be pleased to know that a further seven are in rural areas, so we recognise the contribution they can make in both settings. The university recently released a report on the experience of the seven urban pilots. It included some helpful pointers for communities wishing to explore the potential of a land trust. It also provided the Government with food for thought and observation in recommendations about what we can do to pave the way for the development of more community land trusts.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000167"></a>As the Government, our task is to take the lead. We will be consulting further over the summer and seeking views on how we can develop the community land trust and address some of the issues that the report raises. The noble Lord anticipated that I would ask the proponents of this approach to wait&#151;</p>

<p><a name="080611137000168"></a><a name="80611-gc0004.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0004.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="080611137000424"></a>Lord Graham of Edmonton:</b> Was I wrong?</p>

<p><a name="080611137000169"></a><a name="80611-gc0004.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0004.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="080611137000425"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> The noble Lord was not wrong, but I want to go further than that and make the simple point that the amendment is not necessary because community land trusts use a variety of legal entities, some of which are charities, some are industrial or provident societies&#151;the noble Lord knows more about those than I do&#151;some are companies and some are other community bodies. Clause 80 simply defines what is meant by the term &#147;English bodies&#148;. As noble Lords can see, all these types of bodies are already included within the definition of &#147;English bodies&#148;, provided that they are registered in England or intend to make accommodation available in England.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000170"></a>Therefore, we do not think that the amendment is necessary. Community land trusts have real potential to help provide more affordable housing and they are  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC225"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>an exciting model, but it is inappropriate to put this mechanism to define community land trusts or any other vehicle, such as local housing companies, in legislation. Nor do we think it is wise or necessary. For example, development trusts are similar and hold assets for communities but do not have a definition in law, so there is no barrier there. To embed one particular mechanism in legislation is perhaps too short-term an approach. Circumstances differ and times change, and we would not want to see future innovative proposals or models held back because they do not fit a particular definition.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000171"></a>We have listened to the views of community land trust representatives, and Iain Wright announced at the Community Land Trust conference that we will be seeking views in the summer on the need for a legal definition. However, we do not think it is appropriate legally to define community land trusts without proper or full consultation. It is not just the Government who need to be convinced on the right words for CLTs; the financiers, the Local Government Association, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and housing lawyers need to have their say so that we can get this right. We are committed to getting this right so that we can take this policy area forward. If we were to accept this wording or an improved wording, we would be pre-empting that consultation.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000172"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, made a point about people waiting to gift land for housing. They can do so, and gifting land for housing has already enabled some community land trusts to get off the ground. That work is there and can be built on. We are looking at pilots and want to ensure, through consultation, that we get this right so that we can further encourage, develop and support community land trusts as my noble friend Lord Graham seeks. We are as one. We will get there. It is about getting this right and ensuring that we can make progress that stands up effectively and enables us to develop further this avenue of providing affordable housing.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000179"></a><a name="80611-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="080611137000427"></a>Baroness Hamwee</b> moved Amendment No. 99A:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080611137000352"></a> Clause 81, page 38, line 21, at end insert&#151;</p>
</ul>&#147;( ) are public authorities for the purposes of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (c. 42) and for the purposes of amenability to judicial review by the Administrative Court.&#148;
<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000180"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is grouped with Amendments Nos. 100, 103, 104 and 110 of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow. I apologise to him for stealing his thunder. I tabled the amendment after discussions with the Housing Law Practitioners Association, a group of lawyers which has briefed me from time to time over the years and which I have always found extremely helpful. It has raised points which need dealing with. I did not realise when I tabled the amendment that it would be the first in the group. As I say, that is a pity; it is not intended to detract from the points of the noble Earl.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000181"></a>This brief point is again about a level playing field. Are tenants of housing associations in the same position as tenants of local authorities in that they have the benefit of human rights legislation? Put the other way round, is their landlord body under the obligations of the Human Rights Act? We are all aware that provision of social housing has increasingly moved away from local authorities. It is quite odd and coarse to distinguish between the providers of housing in a way that affects tenants. Indeed, the whole thrust of the Bill, subject to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Best, at the beginning regarding local authorities, is that every tenant matters and that every tenant has similar protection.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000182"></a>There is a chain of cases, of which the Government will of course be aware, but what they seem to boil down to, and what the Government have to say, is: &#147;Let the court determine in any particular case whether the relationship between the housing provider and the local authority is such that it comes down on one side of the line or the other&#148;. That is a very unsatisfactory position, and I believe that the Joint Committee on Human Rights takes the same view.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000183"></a>The issue arises in areas such as allocations and grounds for possession. While I appreciate&#151;probably not adequately&#151;the Treasury point about categorising housing associations, I am not persuaded that we should not be looking for a way of getting round that. This may not be the right way, but to leave a large group of tenants without the protection that they would have had had circumstances which are probably entirely outside their control been different, seems to me a very sad thing. It cannot be a good thing for people&#146;s rights to depend on who their housing provider is when, in almost every sense of the word, we are talking about public provision. I beg to move.</p>

She is perfectly welcome to open the batting if she wants to.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000185"></a>I had a meeting this morning with the noble Baroness, Lady Andrews, for which I am grateful. I explained to her, I hope, that this arose in the Joint Committee on Human Rights out of a case that was brought before  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC227"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC227</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the courts over a lady who was being looked after in private healthcare. In the YL case, because her care was provided privately, it did not count as a public function. Up until then, everyone had assumed that the Human Rights Act was supposed to cover anything that was providing a public function.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000186"></a>The difficulty here for me is that if landlord and tenant is not a public function, the Human Rights Act does not apply to the duties. If it is a public function&#151;I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Faulkner, who drew this to my attention&#151;when in Clause 88(2) under &#147;Fundamental Objectives&#148; there is objective 1,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000366"></a>&#147;to encourage and support a supply of well-managed social housing, of appropriate quality, sufficient to meet reasonable demands&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000316"></a>that strikes me as a public function that is being imposed on the regulator to provide social housing, either publicly or privately owned. Therefore, it seems to me that a public function performance is needed.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000187"></a>I am also told that there is a Treasury rule and that the moment the public function is admitted, it will come under Treasury rules for borrowing. I simply cannot believe that. Is the Minister seriously saying that if the YL case on social housing is reversed then a small company taking out a mortgage to provide social care housing will be subject to Treasury rules? Of course it will not. What is the PFI if it is not designed solely to keep every piece of borrowing off the Treasury books? Some of us have called that &#147;Enron accounting&#148; before now. This is an excuse produced to say that it is a bad idea.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000188"></a>The noble Baroness told me this morning&#151;I am sure that she will tell the Committee, too&#151;that the Ministry of Justice is looking into this whole affair. I quite accept that to try to fix the particular YL problem in one Bill may not be the right way to do it. It is a problem that must be brought to the attention of Ministers. That was the view of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which considered the matter in a certain amount of detail. We are advised by some clever lawyers who know what they are talking about, and we thought it appropriate to bring this to the Committee&#146;s attention and table an amendment, so I have great pleasure in supporting the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000189"></a><a name="80611-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="080611137000429"></a>Baroness Whitaker:</b> The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, reminds me of my days on the Joint Committee on Human Rights, when right from the beginning we had to grapple with this awkward area of bodies which carry out public functions, but which are not inherently public. The courts&#146; piecemeal judgments have not helped.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000190"></a>Perhaps my noble friend can answer the two questions in these amendments. The first refers to RSLs and the Human Rights Act and the other is about the regulator. I hope that I understand them, but it seems to me that Amendments Nos. 99A and 100 would make the landlords public bodies, which is obviously a huge issue. The other three&#151;Amendments Nos. 103, 104 and 110&#151;are about the conduct of the regulator. The regulator is absolutely a public body and must comply with the Human Rights Act. Perhaps the duties could be made   


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC228"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC228</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more explicit as the latter three amendments suggest. I am not sure whether they are necessary but there would be no objection in principle to what they seek although they may not be correctly worded.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000191"></a>Would the objectives of all the amendments be fulfilled by the regulator setting Human Rights Act compliance standards? If the RSLs&#146; conduct fell short of the standard the regulator could deal with it. That would be much faster than the tenant going to court saying, &#147;My human rights have been breached&#148;. The question is whether this important area of tenants having the fullest human rights protection would not be satisfied by making it clear either in legislation, or even by the remarks of my noble friend, that the conduct of the regulator must comply with the Human Rights Act.</p>
<h5><a name="080611137000381"></a>6 pm</h5>

I am grateful for the way in which it was opened, in competition, by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and the noble Earl, Lord Onslow. We had a productive meeting this morning, and I hope the noble Earl will forgive me, because these are complex areas, as we agreed this morning. My noble friend has just described them as rather awkward. I shall spend a little time explaining how we have come to our position and reassuring the Committee about the range of issues and the relationship between them. I will answer the two questions asked by my noble friend when I come to that part of my explanation.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000193"></a>I will pitch my words primarily at Amendment No. 100 in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, as it brings in the breadth of the issues raised by the Joint Committee. These are all subsequent amendments, to which we will return. Briefly, Amendment No. 100 would make the provision of social housing a public function for the purposes of Section 6 of the Human Rights Act. The substance of it arose from the report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights at the end of April. Amendments Nos. 103 and 104 were also recommended by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. They are consequential, so I will deal with them in passing. I will not deal with Amendment No. 106 in the group. We will come back to that, because I have some good news for the noble Earl.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000194"></a>Amendment No. 99A goes rather wider than Amendment No. 100, because the noble Baroness seeks to make all registered providers of social housing public authorities for the purposes of the HRA. That would mean that all functions performed by registered providers would be public functions for the purposes of the HRA. As I said, Amendment No. 100 was originally recommended by the Joint Committee, to which we are very grateful for going into these complex areas with the clarity and depth that it did. It has made an important contribution to Parliament&#146;s scrutiny. The noble Earl started by referring to the case of YL. I will conclude with that, if he will bear with me, because I want to make clear the distinction between social care and social housing in its context.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000195"></a>The Joint Committee&#146;s report proposed amendments to three areas of the Bill: first, the application of the Human Rights Act to the provision of social housing;  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC229"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC229</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>secondly, the regulator&#146;s information-sharing powers; and, thirdly, the current incompatibility in the homelessness legislation following the Morris judgment. We will deal with them in sequence as they arise in the Bill. I cannot accept the amendment, because it proposes that the provision of social housing should be deemed a public function under the Human Rights Act. I will make it absolutely clear why. My arguments are based on logic and principle. I will come to the funding issue later, but that is a consequence rather than an issue of principle.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000196"></a>The noble Baroness talked about the level playing field, and she is quite right to raise those sorts of issues. We strongly agree that social housing tenants need to be protected. Indeed, that is what the Bill is about. Our tenants are already protected, not least through their tenancy contract, which normally offers an extremely high level of security and protection. In addition, we are now giving social housing tenants real protection for the first time in different ways through regulation.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000197"></a>The second objective is to ensure that actual and potential social housing tenants have appropriate protection. The remainder of Part 2 gives the regulator the powers that it will need to ensure that tenants are protected. It covers the ability to set standards, to investigate problems, to enforce regulation in the event of breaches, and so on. In answer to the point made by my noble friend, it is perfectly possible for those standards to include even requirements that landlords act on the same principles that might be covered by the HRA. I should stress that it is up to the regulator, but my noble friend has made a significant point in that context.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000198"></a>The second question my noble friend raised related to the HRA itself. As a public authority, the regulator will be subject to the HRA. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment needs to be seen in that wider context. The definitions of &#147;public authority&#148; and &#147;public function&#148; are crucial. Noble Lords will be aware that adherence to the Human Rights Act is compulsory only where a body is a &#147;public authority&#148;, or where it is undertaking functions of a public nature. So HRA duties arise not only where bodies are obviously public&#151;the historic example is local authorities&#151;but where any body performs a function that is of a public nature. We can bring the housing associations into that category because they perform one function which is of a public nature. However, an important difference is that everything a local authority does will be considered a public function because it is a public authority, whereas for a housing association, as a private sector body, some functions may be of a public nature and others will not.</p>

Before the YL case it was assumed that private nursing homes while providing care for the elderly which was paid for by the local authority were performing a public function. The difficulty is that when they were providing the same care for people who were paying their own bills they were not performing a public function.

However, before the YL case would we have thought that the public function would have applied to housing associations, which are helped by the regulator in a way that we thought care homes were covered by the Human Rights Act? I do not know what the answer is and, frankly, I do not think that anybody else does. However, I should like the noble Baroness to have a bash at answering it, if nothing else.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000200"></a><a name="80611-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="080611137000432"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> The simple answer is that we have never considered that housing associations performed functions of a public nature in providing social housing. I shall come on to the contrast with the social care provision and the noble Earl will appreciate the point I shall make about the differences in those functions.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000201"></a>Housing associations have always been private bodies. Why is that? I can give several reasons. This is what we would have said to the committee had we been able to submit a more substantial response. Housing associations are not controlled or owned by the state. There are about 2,000 of them, they are independent and most of them are charities. They have long and very honourable histories, often rooted in the personal benevolence of benefactors providing housing as a private function. That is what makes them so unique and independent. We are committed to that independence. I accept that they have one very limited public function. They were recently given statutory powers to deal with anti-social behaviour. While we accept that they have a public function in that context, that is very different from their core business which is to own and manage social homes&#151;I think that the noble Lord and the Committee saw the letter from my honourable friend Iain Wright to the Joint Committee&#151;so anti-social behaviour is very much the exception.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000202"></a>As I say, there is no logic or tradition which suggests that the provision of accommodation below the market rate, as in social housing, is in any way inherently a public function. For 40 years the Housing Corporation supervised the provision of social housing by most housing associations and these bodies raise most of the money they need to build houses from private sources. They do not rely on public money to own and manage them, and have no role in the allocation of that process.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000203"></a>So I agree with the noble Earl: it is not the nature of the organisation providing the function, it is the nature of the function provided. On that basis, you could draw a parallel with some of the functions carried out by commercial organisations. Provision of social accommodation is almost identical to providing market housing except that the price and distribution of the service are controlled through regulation. In summary, social housing is not a public service which has been recently privatised, it is a regulated voluntary activity which local authorities become involved in. For these reasons, we disagree in principle with the Joint Committee&#146;s conclusion that social housing is an inherently public function. By implication, I therefore also disagree with the amendments and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that registered providers&#151;whose core functions are about social housing&#151;should be public authorities for HRA purposes.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000204"></a>The practical implications are not an excuse, as the noble Earl suggested. I am arguing this case from a position of principle and logic. The consequences are serious not just for the sector, but for the whole provision of social housing in this country. The first point is relatively minor, but it will not be minor to the associations themselves. Putting the provision of social housing as a public function under the Human Rights Act will obviously impose additional costs on the sector in preparing for and dealing with the possibility of legal challenge. This is not a minor issue; some of these RSLs are very small and would not be able to cope with these sorts of legal challenges. Those costs would need to be met by increased rents and, unlike local authorities, they would not be subsidised by government grant and would clearly not be of benefit to tenants. As a principle, we seek not to impose burdens or costs on independent organisations without at least a consultation.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000205"></a>However, the most serious point raised by the noble Baroness and the noble Earl is that classifying social housing provision&#151;or, indeed, RSLs themselves&#151;as &#147;public&#148; for the purposes of the HRA could affect the present classification of housing authorities as private-sector bodies. The noble Earl and the Joint Committee argued that treating the provision of social housing as a public function would not necessarily imply that any organisation that performed the function was institutionally connected with the state, nor that the state would be required to exercise control over its management or operation. That is true: it would not necessarily do that. However, it is a serious risk. Even if the probability is low&#151;and I do not think that it is&#151;the impact would be very serious indeed for the future of housing supply in this country. The point is that if the current ability to borrow were choked off, &#163;35 billion would be added to the public balance sheet. We would simply be unable to build the social homes we so desperately need in this country.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000206"></a>This question of risk was seriously examined in the other place, changes were made to the Bill to ensure that those risks were not run and relationships were clarified in such a way that everyone could see that these remain private functions. Those were important changes. If we were to make the core service&#151;the raison d&#146;être of the housing associations&#151;a public function, it might pose a material risk of reclassification. Far from being an excuse, that is a terribly serious implication.</p>
<h5><a name="080611137000382"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000207"></a>As I say, that is not my prime argument. Finally, there is the question of case law. In considering the amendment, we need to take account of emerging case law. The noble Baroness referred to it in the amendment, and the JCHR did so too. The current position of the courts supports our view that the provision of accommodation by private bodies, including housing associations, does not amount to a function of a public nature for the purposes of the HRA.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000208"></a>The noble Earl referred to the recent decision by your Lordships&#146; House in YL and Birmingham City Council. The ruling in that case held that an RSL-owned residential care home was not undertaking functions  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC232"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC232</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of a public nature for HRA purposes, despite the fact that the appellant&#146;s care had been arranged by her local authority under the National Assistance Act. However, it remains the Government&#146;s view that, in general, the provision of publicly-arranged health and social care should be considered a function of a public nature. Amendments have been tabled to the Health and Social Care Bill by my noble friend Lady Thornton to restore the Government&#146;s intention in relation to that function.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000209"></a>Why is that consistent with our position that social housing does not constitute a public function? There are two reasons. First, unlike social housing, care homes provide both accommodation and, critically, social care. They are restricted to extremely vulnerable people and are very heavily regulated. The same is not true of social housing, which caters to a much wider client group and covers accommodation only. Social care inspections are frequent and intrusive; the inspection of social housing provision happens about once every five years.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000210"></a>Secondly, social care tenants do not have the sort of contractual relationships that are governed by and govern the relationships that tenants and social housing have under the Landlord and Tenant Act. An important point is that YL affects only publicly-arranged care home places. General needs social housing provided by housing associations is not normally publicly arranged. Most of the funding is sourced from rents, private borrowing and the RSL&#146;s own resources; not grants. It is not carried out under contract, but as a private function with appropriate regulation.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000211"></a>So stark are the differences between social housing and care homes that I suspect that, if it was accepted that social housing provision was a public function because it was similar to care home provision, the next argument might be that private rented sector provision is a public function because of its similarities to social provision.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000212"></a>I want to conclude on a positive note. I have gone into that detail for all the reasons that the noble Earl invited me to; these are complex and important issues. This whole debate has raised important issues about definitions. As part of the Government&#146;s response to the YL case, my honourable friend the Minister for Human Rights intends to undertake a consultation on the scope of the Human Rights Act. We think that this is the best way of taking forward the broader question of what should and should not be considered subject to the Human Rights Act. I was grateful that the noble Earl said that he did not think that this Bill was the right place to address this much larger issue, and he is right in that judgment. The preparatory work for that is under way, but we do not have a strict timetable for it.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000213"></a>In summary, I hope that in that context, and for all the reasons that I have mentioned, the noble Earl will have the confidence not to press his amendment, now that the question has been addressed before a larger audience.</p>

The distinction between public and private provision is interesting. However, there may perhaps be a particular regarding allocations where a local authority is dependent on nominations to a housing association or uses its nominations, but the housing association has different allocation policies from the local authority. More particularly, what is the position where there has been a transfer of stock from a local authority? What is the position with an ALMO? That was clearly public provision which has become private without the tenants being involved in the process. That is a technical point, but the answer may be winging its way to the Minister. It had not occurred to me to ask that before.</p>

I do not think that we can assume that the tenants lost rights. As I have said before, tenants have a wide range of rights, almost all of which are retained on transfer. Tenants are protected by regulation. Under this Bill, they will get all the protections that we can make possible. There are minor changes. The noble Baroness will know that tenants on transfer do not have a right to manage. Although that is a slightly difficult issue, in our view it is not subject to the HRA. We would be hard put to say that the tenants have suffered by the decision to transfer.</p>

I am grateful for the care with which the Minister gave her answer, which I shall read. I am intrigued by the suggestion made by the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, although non-compliance which would bring the regulators&#146; powers into play is not quite the same.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="080611137000353"></a> Clause 83, page 39, line 1, leave out &#147;3&#148; and insert &#147;6&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000225"></a>The noble Viscount said: I feel a bit as though I am coming down to Earth, so I shall start with a short anecdote about public appointments. I was deputy chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It was January, and I was chairing five inquiries under the Fair Trading Act. My appointment was coming up for review at the end of the month, and it was clear that there was no way in which the five inquiries could be completed in time. I went to see the chairman, who said, &#147;I wouldn&#146;t worry, as long as your salary comes in&#148;. It is therefore appropriate at this stage to look at the drafting.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000226"></a>There is no great difference between me and the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, on the numbers on the board. We have come up with different answers, and I am sure that the final answer does not need to follow my prescription precisely, but three members of a board are, and always would be, too few. You only have to have someone with a bad cough and you are down to two. As to the maximum, I have not sought to change the figure of 10, but I suppose that if I were in a position to choose I would argue for 12. In addition, renewable five-year terms are not as good as renewable three-year terms. I accept that that could be debated and that there would be genuine disagreement, but if you have three-year terms, the best expectation is that a member of the board who is diligent will always get one reappointment, which will mean six years, or two, which will mean nine. In exceptional circumstances, members could serve for 12 years.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000227"></a>There is always a problem at the beginning of a new organisation because how do you ensure that, when people retire after three years, the whole board does not have to go because all the members were appointed on the same day? There needs to be some provision, which I have not put into my amendment, to deal with that issue so that you get on to the &#147;one-third, one-third, one-third&#148; system without the whole board having to go at once. In this case, however, despite one of the amendments which the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, will talk to, I imagine that some people will continue. Indeed, I very much hope that some board members from the organisations that are being merged will continue because in such a merger there is a need to have people who know what has happened and can give the right advice to the new chairman, whose tenure we are all looking forward to.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000228"></a>In conclusion, Amendments Nos. 101 and 102 seek a rather more standard approach to board appointments that is consistent with Nolan. In this case, I see no reason not to read across from Nolan, who had views on the private sector as well as the public sector. I also seek to introduce consistency and certainty into how boards are appointed and their length of tenure because, as has been said many times in this Committee, the more consistency and certainty that we can provide to all the people who are interested in such an important organisation as the regulator, the better. I beg to move.</p>

There have been a number of occasions over the years where the results or the progress of sporting fixtures have been shared publicly.

I do not know whether I am correct in likening it to a sporting fixture.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000230"></a>I have a bit of a ragbag of amendments. The first is Amendment No. 101A, in which, like the noble Viscount, I am probing the reason for the size of the board of the new regulator. I had suggested a minimum of five and a maximum of 15, as distinct from the three and 10. Like the noble Viscount, I am particularly concerned about the minimum size, and for all sorts of reasons it is appropriate to have more than a tiny handful.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000231"></a>The second amendment is a probing amendment. Clause 83(4) says that former membership of the Housing Corporation is not a bar to appointment. I declare an interest because I was one of the referees for the person who has been appointed as chair, so I am certainly not trying to undermine his appointment. It seems a curious thing to say. There are a number of things here that indicate to me that there is a different hand in its drafting from the drafting of Part 1. I do not know why one should say that. The fourth amendment is Amendment No. 102ZA, which takes us to Clause 84, where Clause 84(2) says that a period of appointment may not exceed five years but that there can be a reappointment. I do not think that appointees should be able to go on and on, so I am saying that there should be only one reappointment, so that there would be a maximum period of 10 years in office.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000232"></a>Amendment No 102ZB and Amendment No. 102ZC, which is consequential, take out the reference to &#147;misbehaviour&#148;. I am intrigued about what might be meant by that in this context. Surely, the point is covered by the rest of the paragraph on dismissal of a member who is unable, or has become unsuitable or unwilling, to perform the functions. Misbehaviour is different from all that; it could be anything. I ask rather frivolously whether that means throwing bread rolls at dinner&#151;that is misbehaviour.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000233"></a>Amendments Nos. 104AB and 104AC are to Clauses 90 and 91. On the issue of conflict of interest, which we dealt with in respect of the HCA, Clause 90(2)(b) provides that someone who has an interest must withdraw,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000367"></a>&#147;unless the regulator directs otherwise&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000318"></a>I thought that was curious. I could see an argument for the regulator permitting that member to continue, but for the regulator to be saying, &#147;Thou shall stay in the room; thou shall take part in this decision&#148;, is an odd way of going about it.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000234"></a>The last of the amendments&#151;Amendment No. 104AC to Clause 91&#151;refers essentially to co-optees. It states:</p>

<p><a name="080611137000236"></a>I do not know whether there was a technological problem, but somewhere between the amendment that I was asked to table by the National Consumer Council being typed in our Whips&#146; Office and it arriving in the Public Bill Office, it went astray. I realised it only this afternoon, so clearly I cannot expect an answer. I will make the point that the council made to me that to have a committee that is in effect an advisory panel whose members are, or have recently, been occupiers of social housing would be a very good thing&#151;a sort of lay panel. I am not arguing against the point that I have just made about non-members, but about keeping feet on the ground and having a critical friend with both personal experience and that gained through talking to neighbours.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000237"></a>We talked briefly about the culture of the regulator, and having such a group involved in the very early stages to see how the board goes about its planning, makes its choice of thematic reviews, prioritises for activities and develops its methodologies would be a very good thing. I am sorry that the amendment did not reach the published list.</p>

The chairman plus three does not seem to be the right answer at all. It is far too few. Whether it is chairman plus five or six is a matter for further debate. I would have thought that a top number between 12 and 15 could be discussed as well. If members are allowed to be re-elected, I would have thought that three years would be ample, which would give them six years doing the job. I would have thought that that was enough for anybody, but otherwise we support the amendments.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, referred to membership of the Housing Corporation not being a bar to appointment. I support that because it is a fair, clear statement. The amendment wants that to come out, but I believe that it should stay in. Much of the experience on the regulatory side will need to come from people who may well have worked as members of the Housing Corporation&#151;maybe some time ago&#151;but this would debar them entirely.</p>

The words, &#147;membership of the Housing Corporation shall qualify an individual for membership&#148;, would have seemed odd. As I have said, I do not oppose this proposal, but I do not understand why it needs to be said. That is the reason for my amendment. I should have thought that it would apply. I do not know whether we should understand from this that membership of the Housing Corporation is a bar to appointment to the HCA, because that is not said there.</p>

I am not suggesting that it should be a bar. It may look odd, but it gives clarity. With the appointments that we are going to have, that is important. On the amendment, in regard to the provision that the term not exceed five years, I should like the Minister to explain why. In most public bodies, the term is now three years. But, on looking at the Bill, the term could end up as 10 years. That is how it is packaged. If the term is to be only three years, one would not want the new body all to be appointed at the same time and, thus, finish at the same time. You will want them to finish in numbers and the five years may give that opportunity. It would be helpful for me to understand why the term is five years. It is the first time I have come up against that for some time.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000242"></a>As regards the amendment to Clause 91(2), I understand the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. But, with all due respect, when working in this kind of complicated area, sometimes committees need to be set up that are made up of people who are not members of the body, but which are chaired by a member of the body. Two such examples came to my mind as the noble Baroness was talking; for example, how the Housing Corporation developed its policy on rural housing. I chaired that group, and there was no other member of the Housing Corporation board on it. The recommendations from that group fed into the main board, just as did those from other committees of the group.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000243"></a>My second, and perhaps lasting, example concerned tenants. There was no provision at that time for tenant involvement directly in the policy development of the Housing Corporation. We set up a body, which, again, I chaired. Those were two areas that I was particularly keen that we should do something about. Not one member of the board was on that body either. We felt that if we were going to consult with tenants, we wanted to listen to them, not to members of our board. We knew what they thought. We wanted to get the tenants in and to ask what they thought. Similarly, we did that on the rural areas policy.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000244"></a>I hope that this provision stays. It will be very helpful, particularly if you have a small board. I cringed when I heard the figure of 15 members mentioned. That is a large number of members for any chairman to manage. I suggest that the most effective boards do not have that number of members. Whereas three members, with a maximum of the lower number of six, may not be quite right, I think that the higher number of 15 is probably too high. It would be very interesting to hear the Minister&#146;s thinking and rationale for these points.</p>

It has been very helpful. I shall go through each amendment carefully and explain some of our thinking on it. I observe at the outset, although I have not sat on the Monopolies Commission or the Housing Corporation, I had a fairly large responsibility in running a local authority. I know that we had annual terms, which was very useful if you were the leader of the council, for fairly obvious reasons.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000246"></a>Committee size was an issue, which cuts to the point raised by my noble friend Lady Dean. Some of the sizes of the committees were absurdly large. The notion that the quality of debate improved the more people you had was fatuous. Over the years, I brought the numbers down to a manageable size that provided for breadth of debate. That is where I am coming from on this.</p>
<h5><a name="080611137000384"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000247"></a>Amendment No. 101 was moved by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles. We do not think it is necessary, and we think that it would run against the spirit of the Cave review. Cave recommended that the regulator&#146;s board should consist,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000368"></a>&#147;of a small number of executive and non-executive board members, with a non-executive chair and majority, to which regulation should be entrusted&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000319"></a>We have begun the process of recruiting a board for the regulator and the HCA. I was flicking through the <I>Sunday </I><I>Times</I> last week, and there were the big adverts. I understand that adverts were placed in other national newspapers. Do not press me, but I think the <I>Sunday Mirror </I>might have been one of them, but I am not a <I>Sunday M</I><I>irror </I>reader. The exact composition of the board will be for the new chairs, in conjunction with Ministers, to decide. However, we currently envisage that the board will comprise the chair, the chief executive and seven members. Among the seven members, we would like to see at least two with direct experience of being a tenant&#151;I would have thought there is a powerful argument for that. However, the most important thing is that the board is comprised in a way that enables the regulator to meet its 10 objectives.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000248"></a>However, the stipulation that the board should have three to 10 members provides flexibility for the chair, while being faithful to the Cave aim of a having a small and focused board. Let me be clear that three members is an absolute minimum&#151;the noble Viscount got it right when he said that if one of them caught a cold there would be a bit of a problem, and I entirely understand what he was saying. We discussed this with the Homes and Communities Agency, and three is just the bottom of the possible range. We would certainly expect the membership to be nearer to the maximum of 10 in order to allow the necessary range of skills and expertise to be reflected at member level.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000249"></a>Noble Lords will have noted the difference in the size of membership between the regulator and the new agency and, indeed, the current Housing Corporation board. These minimum and maximum numbers are smaller than the current arrangements and the future HCA arrangements. That is deliberately so in order to reflect the narrower and more focused functions of the regulator compared with the scope of the new agency or the Housing Corporation&#146;s current role which, as noble Lords will appreciate, includes investment at present.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000250"></a>Amendment No. 101A, was tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who unfairly described her amendments as a ragbag. I think that they were an interesting collection, and they have helped us to focus some of our thinking on these issues. This amendment amends Clause 83(1)(b), which enlarges the membership of the regulator&#151;its board, if you like. The Bill currently  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC239"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC239</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>permits the membership to consist of a chair, a chief executive and between three and 10 other members. All are appointed by the Secretary of State, though the Secretary of State must consult the chair on all appointments, except that of the chair. The effect of this amendment would be to raise the membership to between five and 15. The noble Baroness, Lady Dean, was right in her argument.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000251"></a>I am unsure of the noble Baroness&#146;s reason for tabling this amendment. I suspect it was that, like the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, the noble Baroness was concerned that there would not be sufficient breadth or that the board would be unrepresentative. In his recommendations, Professor Cave argued that the regulator should consist of,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000369"></a>&#147;a small number of executive and non-executive board members&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000320"></a>Our view is that the regulator will be a relatively small body, funded by providers&#146; fees. That, in essence, is part of the thinking behind having a difference in the sizes of the memberships of the regulatory board and the new agency. I do not think that there is a case for having a board as large as that of the Housing Corporation, which also covers investment and regulatory functions. It has 11 members, not including the chair and chief executive. We have to have a rather more focused view on the size of that board. The important thing is that the board is comprised to enable the regulator to meet its objectives and perform its functions. That means getting the right mix of skills to do the job properly, so that we can get it up and running in good time. Three to 10 members, plus chair and chief executive, is sufficient.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000252"></a>Amendment No. 101B, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, would remove a subsection stating that former membership of the Housing Corporation is not a bar to appointment of the new regulator. We are grateful to the noble Baroness for informing officials of the intention behind the amendment and appreciate her usual courtesy. I hope that I can provide her with the clarification she seeks. Clause 83(4) is merely for the avoidance of doubt. It merely makes clear that former membership of the Housing Corporation is not a bar to being appointed as a member of the regulator. We want to avoid any uncertainty over this, which is why the subsection has been included.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000257"></a>Amendment No. 101C of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, would require the Secretary of State, when appointing new members of the regulator, to ensure that at least  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC240"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one-third of them are current tenants of social housing providers. We do not disagree with the spirit of the amendment, because we too want there to be tenants as members of the regulatory body. Having experience of living in social housing will clearly be advantageous for potential members, as it will give them first-hand knowledge of the problems that tenants face.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000258"></a>As I explained earlier, we are now recruiting through the normal public appointments procedure, and we have specified that some members should have experience as tenants. We currently envisage that the regulatory board will comprise the chair, chief executive and seven members and, among those seven, we would like to see at least two with direct experience of being a tenant. Caroline Flint made that clear in her announcement of 6 June. However, an amendment is unnecessary to establish that.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000259"></a>While we resist Amendment No. 102 of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, we understand the underlying concerns behind it. An important point is that Clause 84(2) specifies that a period of appointment may not exceed five years. It does not stipulate that appointments must last for five years, but merely sets it as a maximum length. In practice, it is likely that board appointments will last for three, or perhaps four, years&#151;not least because a three-year appointment will probably be seen as a less daunting commitment for potential members. Housing Corporation board members have generally served three-year terms followed by a three-year reappointment, dependent on a satisfactory appraisal and recommendation by the chair. We would expect that practice to continue; indeed, as I have said, we are currently advertising for board members.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000260"></a>My noble friend Lady Dean made an important point about not having everybody going at the same point in the cycle. Certainly, when I have been involved in these appointments in the past, it was an issue. By having that flexibility with a five-year term, one potentially creates a situation where retirements come up periodically. That is an important consideration.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000261"></a>Amendment No. 102ZA would add the word &#147;once&#148; to the end of Clause 84(2). Hence the subsection would read, &#147;A period of appointment may not exceed 5 years (but a member may be reappointed) once&#148;. The amendment would clarify how often reappointment will be permitted. It is not necessary to include this in the Bill. The regulator is a public body whose appointment must comply with the guidance of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. This guidance makes it clear that public appointments should not last longer than 10 years, which allows for an appointment of five years and one additional reappointment. The purpose of the amendment is therefore already served through that route.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000262"></a>Amendments Nos. 102ZB and 102ZC seek to amend Clause 84, which permits the Secretary of State to dismiss members of the regulator in only five circumstances. These include absence of over six months, bankruptcy, financial interest and other forms of inability, unsuitability or unwillingness. This is the only way in which a member can be dismissed. The amendments seek to remove the specific reference to misbehaviour, so that &#147;Case 5&#148; refers only to members being unable, unsuitable or unwilling to perform duties, without  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC241"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC241</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>specifying that this includes when there is misbehaviour. I therefore assume that the noble Baroness is content with the general principle behind the clause and behind dismissal in this case, but simply dislikes the use of the term &#147;misbehaviour&#148;.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000263"></a>It may help if I define misbehaviour. It is an entirely standard ground for removing a board member of a public authority. It covers two main circumstances: first, misbehaviour in office, such as using a position to confer benefits on family or harassing employees; and, secondly, misbehaviour that might affect the reputation of the body, which would normally involve the commission of a serious criminal offence.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000264"></a>If the clause no longer specifies misbehaviour, the Secretary of State would instead have to show that the acts that the person had committed made the person &#147;unsuitable to perform functions&#148;. However, unsuitability is probably a more difficult test to prove, as the Secretary of State would have to limit her considerations to the effect that the person&#146;s actions would have on his or her suitability to remain a member. She would therefore be unable to take account of the reputational risk to the regulator of keeping the person as a member. That might be acceptable for criminal offences involving dishonesty, as it is reasonable in these cases to conclude that a person who is dishonest is not suitable to be a member of a public sector body. However, for other criminal offences or other serious misbehaviour, it is less clear that the unsuitability test would be satisfied. The wording should therefore stay as it is.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000265"></a>Amendment No. 104AB seeks to change the wording of Clause 92(b) by replacing the word &#147;directs&#148; with &#147;permits&#148;. The clause requires members or employees of the regulator to withdraw from performing a function where they have a conflict of interest, unless the regulator directs otherwise. The person is therefore automatically disbarred from that function unless the regulator directs that he can be involved; in other words, if the regulator permits him to be involved. The regulator is directing that the person is not disbarred from performing the function; he is not directing that the person must perform the function. It would therefore make no difference if &#147;permits&#148; were to replace &#147;directs&#148;. The two verbs have the same meaning in this context, so the amendment would have no effect.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000266"></a>Amendment No. 104AC seeks to change the wording of Clause 91(2) from:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080611137000355"></a>&#147;A committee or sub-committee may include non-members (provided that it includes at least one member)&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000321"></a>to, &#147;A committee or sub-committee may include non-members (provided that it shall not be quorate unless a majority of those present are members)&#148;. The regulator has the power to set up committees and sub-committees. It can delegate authority over those committees to a member or an employee to exercise a function, and it needs to be able to do this for the committee to function.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000267"></a>Clause 89(1) permits the regulator to determine its own procedure, including provision for a quorum. The effect of the amendment would be that more than half the persons present on every committee and sub-committee would have to be members of the regulator&#151;that is, they must be on the board&#151;or they cannot legally take decisions. We take the view that there  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC242"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC242</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should be representation from the membership  on each and every committee and sub-committee.  That makes sense and ensures co-ordination and communication. It is a safeguard to ensure that there is awareness of the board&#146;s policies on each committee. However, to have a majority of members is simply not practical and decreases the flexibility and, ultimately, the inclusiveness of the regulator&#146;s work. Those are our reasons for opposing these amendments.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000268"></a>The noble Baroness referred to an amendment that she did not move. I shall break with convention and refer to it. As regards the user panel, we already have measures in place to ensure that tenants are involved through tenant members of the board. As I explained, we seek to recruit those who might be involved in a sub-committee of the type envisaged. The National Tenant Voice will engage frequently at a high level with the regulator. The user panel point is already covered. I hope that the noble Viscount will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

As regards the misbehaviour point, my experience may be out of date but had the term been &#147;misconduct&#148; rather than &#147;misbehaviour&#148; I would have better understood it. &#147;Misconduct&#148; implies something rather more serious than &#147;misbehaviour&#148;, which is a rather broader term.

I thank everybody who has taken part in the debate. I particularly thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply. We are interested in precedents, and were reminded of them. If we look at the predecessor Bills and how the constitution and governance were set out, we see that it was rather sharper than in these clauses. Perhaps that is why interest has been aroused. On this occasion Ministers are not shy about putting forward government amendments. I hope to find a little more tidying up, if I may put it that way, between now and Third Reading.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000271"></a>On the point of substance, nobody could possibly object to the one-plus-seven balanced-board approach to the board of the regulator. I do not think that was what we were worried about; we were worried about the minimum of three. I told a story about government appointments advisedly because a Minister has often asked somebody in the department, &#147;Aren&#146;t we getting rather short of board members on such and such a body?&#148; The reply comes, &#147;I wouldn&#146;t worry Minister, we&#146;re allowed to go down to three&#148;.

<p><a name="080611137000273"></a>I thought that I had dealt with the &#147;all at once&#148; point. In the case of a new body you have to try to find a way forward which does not mean that everybody goes at once.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000322"></a>If you are recruiting in part from predecessor bodies and recruiting over a certain period of time, also in part, there is no reason to suppose that everyone would have to go all at once. It is a very simple administrative matter to put that right. I am tempted to remind the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, that she and I, on a particular day, resigned from a board together. It was a long time ago.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000274"></a>Finally, on Clause 84(4)(e) and misbehaviour, I cannot help thinking that if I were a lot younger I might organise myself onto this board and misbehave. Since my appointment cannot exceed five years, I could probably get that going in about six months. Then I would go to judicial review and see how much I could extract. In all seriousness, Clause 84(4)(e) is a complete hostage to fortune. Frankly, as drafted, it will not do.</p>

On declaration of interest and the regulator directing that someone should not withdraw, am I right in understanding that the regulator would do that through the board? I suppose that there could be a scheme of delegation, which would enable either the chair or the chief executive to give the direction. But is it anticipated that the board would vote, so that this would be by a majority? If so, does the person who has the conflict of interest in question vote, withdraw from the vote or what?</p>

<p><a name="080611137000290"></a>Clause 88 [<I>Fundamental objectives</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="080611137000291"></a><a name="80611-gc0007.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0007.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="080611137000454"></a>Earl Cathcart</b> moved Amendment No. 102ZD:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080611137000356"></a> Clause 88, page 40, line 17, leave out subsection (1) and insert&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080611137000357"></a>&#147;(1) The regulator shall perform its functions in a manner which&#151;</p>
</ul>(a) minimises interference,(b) is proportionate, consistent, transparent and accountable,(c) complies with any duty of the regulator under section 22 of the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 (c. 51) (code of practice), and(d) seeks to achieve the following objectives as far as possible.&#148;
<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000292"></a>The noble Earl said: The group of amendments to which I shall speak is headed by Amendment No. 102ZD, which is tabled in my name and those of four other noble Lords. Clause 88 sets out 10 objectives for the regulator and states that,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000370"></a>&#147;the regulator shall balance them as it thinks appropriate&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000323"></a>Objectives 1 to 9 include encouraging a supply of well managed social housing; ensuring protection and choice for tenants; tenant involvement in management; efficient, economical and properly managed providers that contribute to their local areas; and encouraging investment in social housing without burdening or misusing public funds. These objectives are all excellent, but they show what the regulator is expected to achieve.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000293"></a>However:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080611137000358"></a>&#147;Objective 10 is to regulate in a manner which ... minimises interference, and ... is proportionate, consistent, transparent and accountable&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000324"></a>We believe that this objective is fundamentally different because it is not about the aims of the regulator but about how the regulator has to proceed and the manner in which it proceeds when seeking to achieve objectives 1 to 9. It is not in itself an objective. I suggest that the regulator should always operate in a manner that minimises interference and is proportionate, consistent, transparent and accountable in all the objectives it undertakes and in pursuing all its objectives 1 to 9. The regulator should not have to balance that against the other nine objectives as required in sub-section 13. That is why we have tabled Amendment No. 102ZD and its consequential amendment, Amendment No. 103C, which ensure that the obligation of proportionality applies to the way that the regulator pursues all its objectives.</p>




<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC245"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column GC245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000294"></a>Amendment No. 103ZA is also in this group. It places an onus on the regulator to ensure that tenants have adequate information about the standard of their housing services. It would ensure that under objective 2 actual or potential tenants of social housing would have an appropriate degree of information about the management of their homes. That is essential if they are to have effective choice and be able to take part in management. As Professor Cave stated in his report, empowerment requires information. He reported that the Tenant Involvement Commission found that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080611137000359"></a>&#147;Awareness of how housing associations perform is very low ... Few tenants know how to find out how their association performs compared to others&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000325"></a>Tenants need information, but there is nothing in the regulator&#146;s objectives that imposes an obligation on providers to provide that information. This amendment places an onus on the regulator to ensure that the information provided is directly relevant to the tenants and is adequate for them to make choices and be involved with the management without at the same time placing an undue burden on the provider. This information must be available for comparison at a local level.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000295"></a>The Cave review accepted that providing local comparative information may be problematic for landlords who operate across many local authority areas. Professor Cave said that the regulator should play a key role in ensuring that the core information requirement is manageable and consistent across all areas. The optimum level at which information should be provided is for housing within a local authority area. That would enable tenants to make like-for-like comparisons. It would provide them with the material they need to consider whether their homes could be better run by another provider in the same area.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000296"></a>The next amendment is Amendment No. 103E, which is given a definition by Amendment No. 104ZA. It would ensure a level playing field for the public, private and third sector providers of social housing property and services. Those involved in the provision of such housing fear that some types of provider will have an unfair advantage because the rules do not apply to all types of providers. An explicit requirement on the regulator to promote competitive neutrality would help to prevent the development of disadvantage in the regulatory framework as well as help to eliminate barriers to developing a more effective market in housing services. That would have the effect of empowering tenants and enable a lessening of regulation over  time.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000297"></a>I know that other amendments are grouped with mine and I want to give other Members of the Committee a chance to speak to them. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000299"></a>The Housing Corporation has design standards for new homes and this amendment, which has been sponsored by RADAR, Habinteg Housing Association and Care and Repair, proposes that the new social housing regulator should set standards for housing and the wider built environment and infrastructure as an important component of the Government&#146;s goal of building inclusive communities.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000300"></a>I quote from the debate on this amendment in the other place in which Sir George Young states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="080611137000360"></a>&#147;By an inclusive community, I mean something broader than accessible housing. I mean homes and infrastructure that are planned and delivered to empower disabled people and other groups to get out and about ... It means accessible and integrated transport, ensuring that facilities are located in places that everyone can reach easily and cheaply and that people in sheltered and supported accommodation can play a full role in a properly mixed community. The Disability Rights Commission has provided some invaluable guidance for planners and housing professionals on what it thinks should be factored into the planning of such communities&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report,</I> Commons, Housing and Regeneration Committee. 10/1/08; col. 183-4.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000301"></a>I apologise that I could not be here when the HCA&#146;s responsibility for accessible housing was discussed. My noble friend showed a deep understanding of the need to ensure that housing and the community infrastructure are capable of meeting the changing needs of the whole population, and that disabled people are not defined as a ghetto group to be dealt with separately. We are all liable to need accessible facilities at some time in our lives. I hope that she will respond accordingly to these two amendments.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000302"></a><a name="80611-gc0007.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80611-gc0007.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="080611137000456"></a>Baroness Hamwee:</b> I shall probably be the one who has to stop mid-sentence.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000303"></a>I have a good deal of sympathy with the noble Earl&#146;s Amendment No. 102ZD. I have read the assurances given throughout the debate in the Commons about the importance of objective 10. I do not think that anyone is quarrelling with that in itself but it just feels uncomfortable. I had difficulty articulating my problem with it but thought this morning that that is perhaps because objective 10 is how things are done, not what is done. That is why it is absolutely right that proportionality&#151;I will use that word to encompass everything&#151;should apply, but it is an overarching approach that applies to all the objectives. That is why it feels uncomfortable. When I first read the noble Earl&#146;s amendment, I was not sure about paragraph (d), which seeks to achieve,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000371"></a>&#147;the ... objectives as far as possible&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000326"></a>I then realised that it is already in Clause 88(1), so I cannot take issue with it.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0007.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000304"></a>We very much support the amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins. I made that point when we discussed similar issues in the context of the HCA. I hope the answer will be that that is all wrapped up in objective 1, which deals with,</p>
<ul><a name="080611137000372"></a>&#147;housing, of appropriate quality, sufficient to meet reasonable demands&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="080611137000327"></a>I read &#147;demands&#148; as a range of demands for different types of housing. This is not simply a numbers matter. It may well be picked up. I am sure that that is intended.</p>

<p><a name="080611137000305"></a>My amendments are minnows compared with those. Amendment No. 102B is the same amendment which the noble Earl moved in a different place, and is about information for tenants. I confess that I do not really know why I tabled Amendment No. 102C, as it is in objective 3. I do not know why I wanted it in objective 2. Perhaps that was the point at which I fell asleep. Amendment No. 103D is another way of probing whether objective 10 is overarching and applies to the whole package, as I understand it to be from what has been said.</p>

The housing association movement was begun by social entrepreneurs of their day, who used their independence from the state to begin to pioneer new and innovative ways of creating social housing. The capital development programme has often been used as a mechanism for stimulating new and innovative approaches to social problems.</p>

We developed and ran for many years an all-night club that ran one

We also developed educational programmes, and provided a nursery for children of addicts and a church-based community setting in which people could rebuild their lives. The hostel accommodation, which was subject to regulation by the Housing Corporation, gave us the freedom to pioneer new ways of working with this hard-to-reach group.</p>

<a name="80611-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="080611137000308"></a>Until the 1980s, the first duty of the Housing Corporation was to promote housing associations. Only in recent years has it moved from promoting new ways of working to regulating and controlling. The Bill takes this logic to its next logical stage, and even now not only gives powers to the Secretary of State to regulate the first-line service to tenants&#151;housing and the protection of public investment, which I agree with&#151;but gives the regulator powers to control social innovation.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08061196000015"></a>In road transport, there were progress reports to the April council on three current legislative proposals: the recast regulation on common rules for access to the international road haulage market; the regulation on common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator; and the recast regulation on common rules for access to the market for coach and bus services. The council will aim to reach a political agreement on these proposals.  These include include new provisions setting up national registers so that information about road haulage and coach companies operating within the EU can be exchanged between member states' authorities for enforcement purposes.  The proposals also seek to clarify and simplify the rules for hauliers and coaches working outside of their home territory, including the rules on cabotage.  The Government still have a reservations on some of these proposals and will be putting our case to the other members of the Transport Council.  </p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08061196000016"></a>The council will aim to reach a general approach on a recast directive on roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers. The proposal is essentially a consolidation&#151;as well as providing for a very minor update&#151;of existing directives covering the periodic technical inspection of vehicles to verify that they are roadworthy. UK domestic legislation already makes equivalent provision to the two changes in the text.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08061196000017"></a>The council will be asked to adopt conclusions, following the Commission communication on multi-annual contracts for rail infrastructure quality. The aim of the communication is to promote the adoption through the Community of multi-annual funding agreements for rail infrastructure, in order to provide a more stable and efficient financial environment for the delivery of improvements in rail infrastructure quality. We support the adoption of the council conclusions.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08061196000018"></a>There will be a progress report and the council will aim to reach a general approach on a directive on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles. The UK Government support the policy objectives behind the proposal, as well as the principle of using public procurement to help stimulate the market for cleaner and energy-efficient vehicles. We consider that the revised text submitted to council is a significant improvement on the Commission's original and goes in the right direction of encouraging cost-effective green procurement without imposing an unacceptable burden on public authorities. However, we regret the lack of a formal impact assessment, and will want, with the Commission, to keep the costs and benefits of the proposed measures under review, as discussions progress.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08061196000019"></a>The council will be asked to adopt a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations towards an EU/western Balkans transport treaty. The UK welcomes this opportunity to work towards improvement of the infrastructure of the western Balkans and better transport links.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08061196000020"></a>In aviation, the council will be asked to adopt decisions authorising the Commission to open negotiations on comprehensive air transport agreements with Australia and New Zealand. The UK can support the opening of negotiations with these countries and is content with the proposed negotiating mandate.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08061196000022"></a>I am today publishing a plan that sets out the Government&#146;s approach to managing the impacts of migration.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08061196000023"></a>We believe that migration to the United Kingdom brings substantial benefits to our economy and to society as a whole. Our response to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Select Committee&#146;s inquiry into migration, published alongside this document,  


<notus-date day="11" month="6" year="2008" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS49"></a><b>11 Jun 2008 : Column WS49</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>restates our case for these benefits. Together these documents set out our objective: to maximise the benefits of migration while minimising any transitional pressures experienced by communities and local service providers.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08061196000024"></a>We are carrying out the biggest shake-up of the UK&#146;s border security and immigration system for 45 years and introducing a new points-based system to attract those most able to make a positive contribution to the UK.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08061196000025"></a>We will continue to provide refuge for those fleeing persecution, as we have done for centuries. Once people are here, we will ensure that they are able to integrate and make a positive contribution to their community. We are also taking steps to ensure that they learn English and do not access benefits or services unfairly.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08061196000026"></a>Migration brings significant benefits nationally but the precise difference that migration makes to local places and people will vary from town to town, neighbourhood to neighbourhood, and sometimes even street to street. Some local areas are more affected by change than others and some communities feel the effects of change more than others. Public concern about immigration remains, particularly about pressures on public services and impacts on the labour market.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08061196000027"></a>In some places it is the rate and scale of change which have an impact on local communities and services. Other places experiencing significant migration for the first time may not have the institutions and programmes in place to help them manage that change. And for some areas, there may be further challenges to face if net migration reduces.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08061196000028"></a>We want to enable all places to share in the positive benefits of migration. But this will take practical action. Local authorities, working closely with their communities and public, private and third sector partners, are best placed to manage change. And, where it is necessary, the Government are committed to providing support in three ways.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08061196000029"></a>First, it is our responsibility to understand the change that is taking place in our communities. We are committed to getting better at planning for the future, anticipating shifts in migration patterns and helping local authorities prepare for them. This work includes a &#163;12 million programme led by the Office for National Statistics to improve population and migration data.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08061196000030"></a>Secondly, we shall help public services respond in those places most affected by demographic changes, including the arrival of new migrants. We have already made specific funding available&#151;such as additional resources for schools experiencing rapid growth in pupil numbers. We are committed to developing a new transitional impacts of migration fund to help manage the local impacts of migration. Money for the fund will be raised through increases to certain fees for immigration applications.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08061196000031"></a>Thirdly, we will support people and communities to be confident in the face of change. We have already provided significant funding for community cohesion by helping new migrants understand local customs and make a positive contribution to local life, and by breaking down the misconceptions that can sometimes cause anxiety or tension with the settled community.

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08061196000053"></a>In 2006, the Railways and Other Guided Transport Systems (Safety) Regulations 2006 (generally known within the rail industry as ROGS) (S.I. 2006/599) were introduced as the new safety regulatory framework applicable to all rail-based transport systems. ROGS include new arrangements for ensuring the safety of new or significantly altered rolling stock and infrastructure via a system of independent safety verification that is managed by rail operators.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08061196000054"></a>When ROGS were introduced, the application of the new safety verification arrangements to tramways and heritage rail was postponed until 1 October 2008, to allow further time for the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) to work with the tramway and heritage rail sectors to resolve their remaining concerns surrounding the safety verification process.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08061196000055"></a>Chris Bolt, the chairman of ORR, wrote to me on 15 April 2008 to update me with progress on the work undertaken by ORR to address the concerns of the tramway and heritage railway sectors and recommending that safety verification should be applied to those

A copy of the letter is available in the House Libraries. Following this, I received a number of representations from both sectors advising that they still have outstanding concerns and requesting that the application of safety verification be postponed for a further period.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08061196000056"></a>ORR acknowledges that the tramway and heritage rail sectors still have some remaining concerns. However, ORR is confident that application of safety verification to these sectors will secure safety in a proportionate and pragmatic way and have given a commitment to provide both sectors with enhanced support when safety verification comes into effect for them. Safety verification has already been successfully applied to the mainline railway network and the London Underground and Docklands Light Railways systems since October 2006.</p>

<a name="80611-wms0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="08061196000057"></a>Having considered the advice and recommendation from ORR and the written and verbal representations from the tramway and heritage rail sectors, I am satisfied that, with the enhanced support to be provided by ORR, the application of safety verification to these sectors will ensure adequate levels of safety are achieved in a pragmatic and proportionate way and am therefore content for ROGS safety verification automatically to come into force for the tramway and heritage rail sectors from 1 October 2008.</p>

In doing so, they can already use planning conditions to require the removal of a renewable energy installation at the end of a specified period. In such cases planning conditions can also be used to require that a site is restored to its former condition. In the case of wind farms, a guidance note prepared for the Renewables Advisory Board and published by BERR<sup>*</sup>, highlights that decommissioning conditions can be used to ensure full and satisfactory restoration of a site, either in whole or part, should one or more turbines cease to be operational for a given period of time prior to the cessation of a planning permission. There is no reason in principle why such conditions should not be applicable to other installations for renewable energy. Planning authorities can also impose planning conditions relating to other environmental matters such as noise emissions. The companion guide supporting Planning Policy Statement 22 on renewable energy<sup>**</sup> provides practice guidance on the use of planning conditions and their applicability to a range of renewable energy technologies.</p>

Earlier years' figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years' figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents).
