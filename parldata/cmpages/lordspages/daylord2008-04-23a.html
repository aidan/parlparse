Meanwhile, the market is bringing forward a substantial increase in our gas storage capacity to offset the decline in flexible gas production from indigenous sources. Our energy efficiency measures will also help to reduce the need for gas imports.</p>

Does she accept that on present trends, the UK&#146;s imports of gas could rise to 80 per cent by 2020 and that this would present an entirely unacceptable security risk, bearing in mind that at our present much lower levels of imports, there have been reports of diversions of supplies destined for this country? In those circumstances, should there not be an intensification of the efforts to which she referred, notably to increase the amount of gas storage capacity, greater efforts to save energy and the development of alternative energy sources?</p>

As the energy White Paper set out, we are looking at a range of between 60 per cent and 80 per cent. If we implement these measures with the intensity rightly pointed to by the noble Lord, we will be able to reduce our dependence on gas imports to around 60 per cent. Gas storage capacity is indeed the key. A further 1.2 million cubic metres is under construction with another 8 million cubic metres being planned, and we have improved our import infrastructure to three and a half times the 2005 level.</p>

This has been led by economists, I regret to say. Is she not aware that, on the whole, world energy markets work very well indeed and there is not the slightest doubt that we will be able to obtain the energy supplies we need? That is not to say that we should not build a new nuclear station, but it is not fundamental. What is fundamental is that we should appreciate that in this area the market works.</p>

The energy markets have been working reasonably well, although we remain concerned about the lack of a functioning market in the EU which led to some of the interconnector problems that we had two years ago. That is why we continue to press the EU for a liberalisation of the markets so that they can work effectively.</p>

Is not the danger that when we get to the coldest hours, the coldest days and the coldest winters ahead&#151;some will certainly come despite global warning&#151;once again we will find that the gas does not get through to us because the monopoly distributors in France and Germany will take it? What are we going to do about that?</p>

That is why we have continued to press on liberalisation and supported the Commission, whose inquiry came to the very same finding on the third package on energy. We hope that will come to resolution at the June council. Nevertheless, it is fair to say that, despite that, we have significantly improved the security of supply through the import storage infrastructure that I have mentioned already. So we should not be as dependent, for example, on the interconnector with which we had a problem two years ago. We have another interconnector, we have a pipeline, we have LNG terminals and we have storage capacity.</p>

My noble friend now tells the House that they are going to do that for a fourth time. Why will the Government not take this opportunity to legislate at long last to reconstitute the Appointments Commission and to give it democratic legitimacy?

My noble friend raises an important point about the future of the commission. Certainly, in looking to appoint a new membership we have been minded to ensure that, should we decide to put it on a statutory footing, it would be a very simple process. The difference fundamentally is that we would turn it, by statutory provision, into a more independent body; but I hope that noble Lords will accept that the functioning of the commission, to which I pay tribute, as I do to all those who have participated in it, has indeed been independent. My noble friend is wrong to suggest that the cross-party group has not thought about these issues. Indeed, it has.</p>

People have died and been replaced, so the actual growth over the past eight or nine years has been by only eight Members.

In future we will have to consider all those issues.

Will the Government explain in simple terms to the British people the precise nature of the Iranian threat and its timescale? How do they intend to engage the key countries in the Middle East in reaching an outcome that we can all live with? In that context, does my noble friend agree with the analysis of Dr Rebecca Johnson, who spoke recently to the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Global Security and Non-Proliferation, that Israel&#146;s interests may now be best served by it co-operating in achieving that goal?</p>

It comes from our deep distrust of Iran&#146;s nuclear intentions. This is a result of the fact that it has kept the most sensitive parts of its nuclear programme hidden from the IAEA for the last 18 years. Even now it makes no effort to restore this trust by taking the steps the international community requires of it. Furthermore, there are serious concerns about the nature of Iran&#146;s programme. In its most recent report, on 22 February, the IAEA raised numerous questions about that work and its possible nuclear weapons application.</p>

At least we have made progress. I have two questions for the Minister. First, will he give a commitment that the action that the Chancellor has promised today will fully compensate every one of the 5.3 million poor people who are suffering financially?

<a name="80423-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="08042355000066"></a>The position is straightforward. The last Budget significantly reduced child poverty in this country and significantly helped the less well off. The vast majority of people benefited from the last Budget, and the Budget carried out the Government&#146;s intention to simplify taxation. Two groups have been identified as not benefiting from the changes; we have indicated today that we intend to seek compensatory arrangements for those two groups. The arrangements cannot be put in place immediately, but we intend to ensure that they are backdated to cover the period from the introduction of the Budget.</p>

Does he further accept that most people&#151;including, I thought, the Opposition&#151;are in favour of a single, simple reduced basic rate of 20 per cent? Perhaps some time or other he might ask them. On the other hand, the tax credits, which are supposed to be helping, are very complex and are usually misunderstood or not understood at all. Will he ask the Inland Revenue to look very closely at identifying those who should be getting benefit from tax credits and who are not doing so at the moment?</p>

On the more general issue, my noble friend is absolutely right; if the Opposition have ever managed a semblance of consistency, it is to ask for there to be simplicity in the tax system, which is exactly what the last Budget provided.</p>

My amendment makes sure that the genuinely held belief of a threat is a reasonable belief. This matter was brought up in the Joint Committee on Human Rights where the example was given that if there is an intruder in someone&#146;s house and he is, let us say, black, and the householder believes that all blacks are dangerous, that is, by itself, an unreasonable belief. But we felt that, under the Bill as drafted, if the householder genuinely believed that, he would be entitled to shoot the chap dead, cut him up with a Japanese sword, or whatever it is you do to people who come into your houses. This amendment tries to make sure that the belief that the assailant is a threat must be reasonably held. I beg to move.</p>

As the noble Earl pointed out, the law as it exists and as the Government propose to codify it makes it irrelevant whether the belief held by the perpetrator of violence&#151;the defendant in the case&#151;is reasonable; it can be completely unreasonable. However, provided that he holds that unreasonable belief, he is to be treated as if that belief was correct. The purpose of the amendments tabled by the noble Earl, including Amendments Nos. 89 and 90, and in particular Amendment No. 91, is to bring the position established in case law much closer to the standards of the European convention. Although the amendments were not brought forward at an earlier stage, they are to be treated extremely seriously. Should the noble Earl put the amendment to a vote, we on these Benches will support him.</p>

A later amendment, to which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has, among others, put his name, proposes that the clause should simply be taken out. If I may just for a moment forget the noble Earl&#146;s amendment, to which I shall come in a second, my underlying point is that the Government are taking a bit of the common law and trying to put it into statute but without explaining their intention in doing so.</p>

<a name="80423-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08042355000091"></a>The Explanatory Notes&#151;I raised this point on Second Reading but have not had an answer to it&#151;tell us that this clause, which used to be Clause 128,</p>
<ul><a name="08042355000153"></a>&#147;provides a gloss on the common law of self-defence&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000125"></a>and the statutory defences under the two sections mentioned, in particular Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967. The notes continue:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="08042355000142"></a>&#147;It is intended to improve understanding of the practical application of these areas of the law. It uses elements of case law to illustrate how the defence operates. It does not change the current test that allows the use of reasonable force&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000126"></a>We get a repetition of that sort of education concept if we look at Clause 75(7), which is a very curious provision to find in statute. It says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="08042355000143"></a>&#147;This section is intended to clarify the operation of the existing defences mentioned in subsection (2)&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000127"></a>which are the common law of self-defence and the statutory provisions that have been mentioned. No change is apparently being made, but now the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, is proposing the introduction of the word &#147;reasonably&#148; in relation to the state of mind of the accused or the person who is running the defence of self-defence when it is said that the amount of force that he used was not reasonable.</p>

<a name="80423-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08042355000092"></a>If we are to get down to this and examine it properly, it should go to the Law Commission and not just be put into a Bill with no adequate explanation, which opens the way for amendments. The Government are introducing tinkering amendments which add nothing to what is already in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80423-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08042355000093"></a>In fact, the noble Earl is altering the law and I shall illustrate that. I apologise for taking a minute or two but this is a serious matter: it is playing around with the defence of self-defence in common law. I shall cite the 17th edition of a book on criminal law by Card,  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1509"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1509</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Cross and Jones&#151;originally just Cross and Jones. I declare an interest in that Cross was my tutor. A professor of law in Leicester has produced the recent editions of the book and in his preface he disarmingly says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="08042355000144"></a>&#147;There is no other book on the criminal law published in England which deals so comprehensively with the subject of criminal law&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000128"></a>What modesty! I feel very reassured when I quote from his book&#151;he cannot be beaten. He starts with a proposition in the following terms. I am reading from page 774, paragraph 19.8. I shall keep it as short as I can but I attach importance to this:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08042355000145"></a>&#147;Except that it is based on the facts as the defendant believed them to be, the test of whether reasonable force has been used in the prevention of crime, self-defence etc is an objective one&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000129"></a>I repeat: &#147;is an objective one&#148;.</p>
<ul><a name="08042355000154"></a>&#147;In other words, the question is whether, on the facts as the defendant believed them to be, a reasonable person would regard the force used as reasonable in self-defence etc&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000130"></a>That is nice and simple. It is a clear proposition. You just put yourself in the position of the man in the street watching the event and you take what the defendant believes the situation to be. He thinks that he is being attacked by three people, although one man is there. You take his belief but then you ask what the reasonable man would think he was reasonably doing.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80423-0003.htm"/>


<a name="80423-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08042355000094"></a>The nice simplicity of the professor&#146;s proposition is somewhat qualified by what follows when he goes into some of the case law. I quote from page 775:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="08042355000146"></a>&#147;In assessing the reasonableness of the force, the jury or magistrates should take a liberal approach; they should &#145;not&#146;&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000131"></a>to use Lord Lane&#146;s language,</p>
<ul><a name="08042355000155"></a>&#147;&#145;use jewellers&#146; scales to measure reasonable force&#146;. In addition, and this goes even further in tempering with leniency the objectiveness of the test, there must be taken into account the time available to the defendant for reflection&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000132"></a>Then the words of Lord Morris are quoted in the case of Palmer. Subsection (5) uses this rather curious language, which is an exact reflection of what Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest, whom I well remember, said in the Palmer case in 1971:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="08042355000147"></a>&#147;If there has been an attack so that defence is reasonably necessary, it will be recognised that a person defending himself cannot weigh to a nicety the exact measure of his necessary defensive action. If a jury thought that in a moment of unexpected anguish a person attacked had only done what he honestly and instinctively thought was necessary that would be most potent evidence that only reasonable defensive action had been taken&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000133"></a>In other words, you look at what the man thought in the moment of agony or anguish. That case was followed by a judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal in a case called Shannon in 1980. It is easy to pick up on what was going on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="08042355000148"></a>&#147;In other words, if the jury concluded that the stabbing was the act of a desperate man in extreme difficulties, with his assailant dragging him down by the hair, they should consider very carefully before concluding that the stabbing was an offensive and not a defensive act, albeit it went beyond what an onlooker would regard as reasonably necessary&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000134"></a>Therefore, the Court of Appeal makes an express decision that in particular circumstances you will not judge the case by what the reasonable onlooker  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1510"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1510</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>watching the event thought but by knowing the facts as were believed by the man who had put forward the defence of self-defence.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08042355000095"></a>One begins to wonder whether this amendment has something to do with the Martin case. One tries to use one&#146;s imagination in deciding where the Government might be coming from. Everyone remembers the Martin case. He was the lonely, eccentric farmer whose house had been raided about six times. On the particular night, the intruder was a boy&#151;a youngish person&#151;and Martin took his gun and shot the boy in the back as he was leaving. In the end he was convicted and the issue went to the Court of Appeal. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, was the Chief Justice presiding when the case went to appeal. This passage is of interest and I hope will not upset him.</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="08042355000149"></a>&#147;In Martin ... on the question of what the defendant believed, the Court of Appeal held that psychiatric evidence that the defendant would have perceived the alleged circumstances as being more dangerous than would an ordinary person did not need to be considered by the jury in the particular case because it would not have assisted them, and indeed would have confused them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000135"></a>Then, with temerity, Professor Card adds:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="08042355000150"></a>&#147;This decision was surprising since a jury which knew of such evidence might view the claim that the defendant had the above perception differently from a jury which simply knew that he was very eccentric&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000136"></a>Noble Lords will be grateful to hear that I shall conclude my citation at that point. My simple point is that the noble Earl is changing the common law with the adverb that he wants to insert. We should not be conducting this exercise at all. It can all be worked out in future case law. It is not something that should be tampered with by this type of legislation.</p>

When we discussed this matter in the Joint Committee on Human Rights, the Martin case did not influence us. However, the committee was influenced by an excuse for doing something being based on such an unreasonable belief that no one should accept that belief. I am now very much better instructed than I was before the noble Lord, Lord Neill, stood up. I shall almost certainly withdraw the amendment, but for the record the Martin case was not an influence on what we said.</p>

It has clearly been thoroughly thought about within the Joint Committee on Human Rights and we should do the committee the courtesy of demonstrating that we are thinking about it equally seriously. One slight doubt about the circumstances in which the amendment would become relevant is how far, in a real situation of this kind, which can become pretty heated, people will sit around saying, &#147;What is reasonable? Now, wait a minute, I can act only reasonably, so what is reasonable?&#148;, work that out and then take action. I have a slight anxiety about what would really happen in the heat of the moment. However, that makes it all the more important for the law to be very clear that in a highly charged situation

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08042355000098"></a>This is a highly charged and quite emotional area. There is a lot of media comment, much of which is out to work up emotion on the issue. If the media are very anxious to work up emotion on this and to have a simplistic emotional justification for anything that someone might do, it is all the more important for the law to emphasise that anything that happens must be reasonable and must be believed by the person doing it to be reasonable. The amendment has raised a very important point and I should like to hear some assurance from my noble friend in his response.</p>

It is a difficult, delicate and extremely sensitive area. The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, has done the House a great service in telling us what the author of the leading law book on criminal law has said. I agree with the noble Lord that if there is to be a change, it is eminently suitable that it should be looked at by the Law Commission coldly, quietly and over time, and not if I may say so respectfully, by this House at this stage.</p>

Fortunately for all concerned, I never had to direct a jury, although I have addressed numerous juries in my time. I cannot think of an occasion when a jury by its verdict demonstrated an absence of common sense, which is the great justification for retaining the jury system. If I had to direct a jury along the lines of the text comprised in these grouped amendments, I would find it difficult to know who would be more deserving of sympathy&#151;myself or the jury. The matter would be far better left to the Law Commission. On the whole it is generally well understood case by case where the law stands and juries produce common-sense results. If the Government are looking for an initiative to be taken, let them refer it to the Law Commission and then break the habit of a lifetime by legislating promptly according to the Law Commission&#146;s recommendations.</p>

I am naïve enough to believe that the state of the law is thoroughly satisfactory and well understood by juries in the vast majority of cases. There may be a small minority of cases when there are complicating factors, but it is entirely proper for a judge to direct a jury on these lines, and the prosecution has to establish beyond reasonable doubt on both an objective and subjective test that it has expunged totally the consideration of self-defence. It is not a matter for the defendant to establish it or even to raise it, but for the prosecution to expunge it. The two limbs of the &#147;reasonable&#148; test are: members of the jury are asked to place themselves

They are simple tests that ordinary jurors well understand.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08042355000102"></a>I am sure that the House is deeply indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Neill, for the tour d&#146;horizon that he conducted in relation to this area of law. With the greatest respect, I do not follow&#151;or at any rate invite the House not to follow&#151;the authority that he quoted. I quote from the 11th edition&#151;the 2005 edition&#151;of <I>Smith and Hogan Criminal Law</I>, which makes no such inflated claim as the authority quoted by the noble Lord. Under the heading:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="08042355000151"></a>&#147;D&#146;s belief in need for force subjectively assessed&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000137"></a>the learned editor of that book states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="08042355000152"></a>&#147;The authority for the proposition that the defendant is to be judged on the facts as he believed them to be is <I>Gladstone Williams</I>&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042355000138"></a>a matter decided in 1984&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08042355000156"></a>&#147;repeatedly applied in the Court of Appeal and by the Privy Council in <I>Beckford v </I><I>R</I>. Williams was charged with an assault occasioning actual bodily harm to V. D&#146;s defence was that he was preventing V from committing an assault on X. But V may have been lawfully arresting X. The jury was directed that if V was acting lawfully, D had a defence only if he believed <I>on reasonable grounds</I> that V was acting unlawfully. It was held that that was a misdirection. D had a defence if he honestly held that belief, reasonably or not&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80423-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08042355000103"></a>The House will appreciate that the amendment proposed by Her Majesty's Government does exactly what the learned judge did, which was found to be wrong by the Court of Appeal in that case. If the learned editor of Smith &amp; Hogan is correct, and I believe him to be correct, that is exactly the effect that the government amendment, well meaning though it is, would have. It would not improve the position of the defendant; it would make it much more fraught and would place him in much greater jeopardy. It would not clarify the situation, which demands an appreciation of an objective test and a subjective test. If you mix the two, you create monsters. Interbreed the two, and you have immense difficulty. The amendment tabled by the Government enjoins the jury to decide a subjective matter by an objective test. That is wholly the wrong way to go about it. It is guaranteed to complicate and obfuscate the situation so far as the jury is concerned. On previous occasions&#151;and I do not apologise for this&#151;I have drawn attention to the fact that the tenor of Clause 75, as it is now numbered, is to suggest, mildly at any rate, that this is something for the defendant to raise as a special defence. It is not that; the onus is on the prosecution to expunge that possibility altogether. The best solution would be to omit the clause. I do not believe that it is necessary. The law is well understood and works well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="08042355000104"></a>In relation to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and others, I take the point that it may well be, as a matter of administrative policy, proper that some of these complicated and serious cases should be referred to the Attorney-General for her advice about whether the prosecution should proceed. That is the best possible way of dealing with them.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, tabled amendments in Committee. Some of them reflected a concern that what is now Clause 75 could be read as precluding a court paying any regard to the reasonableness of a mistaken belief relied on by a defendant. That was never the Government&#146;s intention. It was always felt that the courts would use common sense when assessing such claims. However, on reflection, we considered that the clause could benefit from further clarification. The resulting government amendments address that concern and clarify that the reasonableness of a professed belief is relevant to judging the genuineness of the belief. It is a crucial element that will inform the jury&#146;s belief in the defendant&#146;s case. However, a defendant is still entitled to have his actions judged on the basis of his view of the facts as he honestly believed them to be, even if that belief was mistaken or unreasonable in hindsight. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, for his assistance and hope that he and the House welcome these useful amendments. Indeed, I might even dare to hope that the noble Lord will now reconsider his support of the amendment tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, to remove the clause altogether, otherwise we will lose his valuable contribution.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08042355000107"></a>I turn to the amendments tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow. They, too, focus on the question of mistaken belief and stem from observations made by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which is concerned about that aspect of the current law. In general, the committee continues to welcome our efforts to clarify the law on self-defence. I may also observe that it also supports our firm resistance to any attempts at introducing a &#147;grossly disproportionate&#148; test&#151;something to which I shall come later when considering the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08042355000108"></a>Amendments Nos. 88 and 90 would mean that a defendant would be judged on the facts as he saw them only if his belief was &#147;reasonable&#148;. Rather surprisingly, such a requirement would run counter to the concern that householders and others should be judged sympathetically on the basis of their mistaken beliefs. Otherwise, it would erect a new and further hurdle to the plea of self-defence. Even had a defendant used more force than was in fact needed because he made an unreasonable mistake in his assessment of the danger faced, it seems unduly harsh to prevent him from relying on self-defence if in fact he had no aggressive intent and was simply reacting to the circumstances as he saw them, or at most an aggressive intent that was justifiable in reaction to and in the light of his mistaken perceptions.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08042355000109"></a>On that general point, it is important to recognise that although the current law allows defendants the benefit of their unreasonable mistaken beliefs, it does not by any means give them carte blanche. The degree of force used must still be objectively reasonable in those circumstances, so that there is not the dramatic immediate response of picking up the gun or the Japanese sword, which the noble Earl possibly saw as the next step. Amendments Nos. 88 and 90 therefore appear undesirable.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08042355000110"></a>The noble Earl&#146;s second set of amendments, Amendments Nos. 89 and 91, draw a similar conclusion to his previous set. However, they apply the restriction only to agents of the state. They are, in effect, an alternative, more restricted approach to addressing the issue of mistaken belief. The Joint Committee on Human Rights has suggested that human rights law necessitates an amendment to make clear that honest but mistaken beliefs must be based on good reasons when force is used by state agents. The Joint Committee argues that the Strasbourg law is &#147;clear&#148;&#151;it uses that term&#151;that allowing a defendant to rely on a mistaken belief that the use of force was necessary is compatible with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights only if the belief was reasonable. The committee also suggests that that conclusion is particularly inescapable in the case of state agents.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08042355000111"></a>We are aware of various indications in the European convention case law that might be read as supporting that view. The letter to the Joint Committee from the Minister of State, the right honourable David Hanson, of 12 March 2008, mentioned those, including, but not limited to, the reference to &#147;good reasons&#148; in the McCann case in its most recent report on the matter.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08042355000112"></a>However, we maintain that the position in human rights law is not in fact clear. We consider that the case law falls well short of a requirement to change our law. The passage in McCann to which the Joint Committee refers says that a defendant can rely on a mistaken belief which he holds &#147;for good reasons&#148;, but it does not say in terms that that is an exhaustive account of the situations in which a defendant may rely on a mistaken belief. What is clear is that the Strasbourg court has never taken the opportunities that it has had to rule that our domestic law is incompatible with the convention, as might perhaps have been expected if in fact there were an obvious incompatibility.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08042355000113"></a>On the substance of the matter, we submit that case law suggests that the current common law position is compatible with the requirements of the European convention in Article 2. It should be borne in mind that states are permitted a certain flexibility in determining how their national law deals with these requirements. We consider that the current position in our domestic common law, as reflected in the Bill, achieves the right balance between the need to protect life and the rights of persons accused of crime.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08042355000114"></a>As previously indicated, in coming to this view we rely on, among other things, the following. First, a person who professes an unreasonable mistaken belief as the basis of his use of force in self-defence is not   


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1515"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1515</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>automatically given the benefit of being judged on that basis. Rather, he is to be judged on the facts as he claims to have seen them only if the court believes that his view was genuinely held. If a defendant&#146;s professed belief is unreasonable, that can be a powerful reason for disbelieving him. Secondly, even in cases where a person&#146;s use of force is to be judged on the circumstances as he mistakenly saw them, the degree of force used must have been objectively reasonable in those circumstances. The Government therefore acknowledge that the position is arguable, and indeed has been argued in legal journals. Details of this were given in the letter from the Minister of State, to which I have already referred.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08042355000115"></a>There is, however, no consensus that the Joint Committee&#146;s view is right. In the same letter, we mentioned that the leading textbook, <I>Smith </I><I>and</I><I> Hogan Criminal Law</I>&#151;a source on which the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, relies&#151;takes the view that to invalidate a defendant&#146;s right to rely on a mistaken belief unless that belief was reasonable would be,</p>
<ul><a name="08042355000157"></a>&#147;an undesirable and unnecessary conclusion and the English courts should not arrive at it unless compelled to do so&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80423-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08042355000116"></a>On the general issue of a different and higher test for state agents, and for the Armed Forces in particular, some might argue that the state should train its agents to act only on the basis of well grounded beliefs. However, after careful consideration the Government feel that this expectation would place a tremendous burden on service personnel who already have to take snap decisions under high pressure when on duty in dangerous parts of the world. We question whether noble Lords would wish to impose such a burden unless we were compelled to do so by law.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08042355000117"></a>Moreover, this question again goes back to the credibility of the mistaken belief. Those considering a case, or a jury taking its decision, may well find an unreasonable mistaken belief on the part of, say, a highly trained member of the Armed Forces less credible than if held by a frightened member of the general public. There is therefore already a self-adjusting mechanism in the law without having to set a different test.</p>

<a name="80423-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08042355000118"></a>Setting European convention debates to one side, introducing two tests for self-defence&#151;one for the public and one for state officials&#151;risks further confusing the matter. The Government are clear that there should be one test for all. We must be clear and consistent and not unnecessarily burden people, whether civilians, police officers or members of the Armed Forces, with additional pressures in those very difficult situations. I therefore urge the noble Earl to withdraw his amendment. Although I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Neill, and others have made an attack on the whole clause&#151;I will return to this in the event that the amendment to strike out the entire clause is advanced&#151;the clause is primarily an attempt to clarify the common law and to keep it as it is rather than to permit innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="08042358000013"></a>My amendment addresses one particular set of circumstances: those in which an individual is confronted by a trespassing intruder on building premises. The amendment is cast in terms of buildings generally, but we had particularly in mind a situation in which a trespasser entered someone&#146;s home, probably during the hours of darkness. We have taken a different approach from the one normally taken by the common law, which is to substitute the concept of proportionality for the concept of reasonableness. In other respects our approach does not change; in other words, instead of applying a test of what was reasonable in the circumstances in which the defendant saw them subjectively, the test we wish to apply is that of gross disproportionality in the circumstances as the defendant subjectively saw them. We believe that is a clearer test and, in the circumstances of an intruder late at night where someone is perhaps awakened from peaceful slumber, a more appropriate test. Subjectively, the situation is likely to be extremely alarming. That, of course, applies to the subjective circumstances.</p>

<a name="80423-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="08042358000014"></a>We go on to say that unless the person into whose house the trespasser has entered behaves grossly disproportionately, the benefit of the doubt of the law should be on his or her side. That should be distinguished from other circumstances in which the law of self-defence applies. I explained the background to this in Committee. I have simply set out the principles of our amendment and I propose to leave it at that. I beg to move.</p>

We do not believe that there should be a distinction drawn between defendants depending on their particular position.

<a name="08042358000019"></a><a name="80423-0004.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80423-0004.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08042358001314"></a>Lord Neill of Bladen:</b> My Lords, I shall make two points quite simply on this amendment. First, it treats quite separately the Section 3 defence. We are off into a statutory provision in a 1967 Act which dealt with the use of force in achieving an arrest or preventing crime, and simplifying the language. They were the two main target areas. It has already been held in case law that the accused may take advantage both of Section 3 of the Act and of the common law of self-defence, and therefore it is totally undesirable to hive off Section 3 by altering the language and introducing stuff such as &#147;disproportionate&#148;, which is not being introduced anywhere else in Clause 75. That is not the sort of error that the Law Commission would make. I say that with respect: it is my view that if two defences are running, they ought to use the same language.</p>

<a name="80423-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08042358000020"></a>Secondly, what is the logic of limiting this to buildings? I go back to Mr Singh&#146;s case, which I mentioned in Committee. Mr Singh came out of his shop, got into his car and put his bag with the day&#146;s takings beside him. A man who turned out to be a criminal with a record as long as your arm, awaiting trial about a fortnight later, came up wielding what must have been quite a big knife, smashed the car window and tried to grab the bag. Mr Singh defended himself. According to the <I>Times</I> on 21 February and a small piece in the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>, Mr Singh could not give a coherent account of what happened, but the assailant ended up in the road with his own dagger through his heart. Why should not that case receive the sympathetic consideration of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland? It cannot because the incident did not happen on a premises. The noble Lord is making a narrow proposition and the principle is thoroughly undesirable.</p>

As my noble friend Lord Neill of Bladen said in relation to an earlier amendment, supported by the noble and learned Lord,  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1520"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1520</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Mayhew, and me, this needs the attention of the Law Commission. What depresses me is the fact that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Davidson, did not refer in his full response to why this should not go to the commission. If it is thought necessary to change the law, let that particularly sensible body look at it first, before we consider a series of amendments. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us why he does not think it is even worth referring to the commission.</p>

<a name="08042358000023"></a><a name="80423-0004.htm_spnew16"></a><b><a name="80423-0004.htm_spnew17"></a><a name="08042358001317"></a>Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> My Lords, I sought to make the point that if there is to be a change in the law, it should go to the Law Commission. I should make it clear that I see no need for the existing law to be reinterpreted in statute form. However, changes are being put forward. I do not think that such changes should go through until the Law Commission has  had a proper look at the position. That is what it is there for.</p>

<p><a name="st_91"></a>
<a name="08042358000024"></a><a name="80423-0004.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80423-0004.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08042358001318"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> My Lords, I respectfully agree. Perhaps I may take up the point made so firmly by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford&#151;the distinction made in the amendment with regard to a building and self-defence exercised outside a building. It may well be that there was an intention to provide special protection for a person in his own home, but whereas every home is a building, not every building is a home. One can imagine many circumstances where self-defence is most acutely justified that have nothing to do with being inside a building. A person sitting in his own parked car might have to defend himself in exactly the same way.</p>

<a name="80423-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08042358000025"></a>In 1922, I believe, there was a decision of the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal in the case of Hussey. As I recall, the facts of the case were that a person was the tenant of a flat and agents of the landlord unlawfully broke into the flat. The person got up from his chair and shot one of the agents dead. The Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal held that in those special circumstances, there should be no question of a person&#146;s right to exercise greater force than might be justified in other circumstances. For decades there was some doubt so far as the learned editors of <I>Archbold</I> and other publications were concerned as to whether that represented the law, but I think I am right in saying that in the past 20 or  30 years it has been made clear that Hussey is not good law. I respectfully suggest that drawing any distinction, as this amendment seeks to do with the best of intentions, would be entirely improper.</p>

I shall be brief in setting out once more why the Government cannot support such a change.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1521"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1521</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80423-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08042358000027"></a>First, these amendments would introduce multiple tests for self-defence. Not only would these tests unfairly favour householders over others using force in self-defence, they would also risk further confusing the issue in the eyes of the public and front-line practitioners. However, the main point of contention on which I would like to focus is the resounding conclusion reached by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its 15th report. The committee noted therein that,</p>
<ul><a name="08042358000203"></a>&#147;any amendment to the Bill to the effect that a person using force against a trespasser would only commit an offence if the degree of force used was &#145;grossly disproportionate&#146; would be objectionable in principle on human rights grounds because it would fail to secure adequate protection of those rights by the criminal law&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80423-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08042358000028"></a>It then goes on to say:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27"></a><a name="08042358000204"></a>&#147;If the criminal law were amended to permit the use of disproportionate force in self-defence or to prevent crime, the UK would be in breach of its obligation to ensure that its criminal law provides adequate protection for the right to life in Article 2&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042358000176"></a>of the European Convention&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="08042358000240"></a>&#147;and the right to physical integrity in Article 8&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="08042358000177"></a>of the European Convention.</p>

<a name="80423-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08042358000029"></a>These amendments would be likely to give rise to serious human rights concerns, create further confusion through multiple tests and provide for unequal protection for citizens depending on their physical location, as the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, clearly identified. I cannot see how they are preferable to the provision in the Bill which serves to clarify&#151;not codify&#151;the law.</p>

<a name="80423-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08042358000030"></a>It has been said that, to some extent, the clause fails to follow the current common law, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan. But, with respect, the clause reflects the common law and, to an extent, the Joint Committee on Human Rights concurs in that view. It states in paragraph 1.68 of its 5th report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28"></a><a name="08042358000205"></a>&#147;We are satisfied that the new clause clarifies rather than amends the existing law&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80423-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="08042358000031"></a>Perhaps that is also an answer as to why one is not minded to send this area to the Law Commission. A report by the Law Commission is, of course, extremely helpful where one is considering innovation or alteration. What is not sought here is either innovation or alteration; what is sought is to make clear what the common law is in a statutory form.</p>

Do the judges not understand it? Why does it need to be put down again? It seems to me that all noble and learned Lords have got it in their heads extremely easily and understand it completely, so what is the point of them writing it down again?</p>

The purpose of this is to provide clarification to the public. There have been attempts through the leaflet  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1522"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1522</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provided by the Association of Chief Police Officers, which considers that clarification by this provision would be helpful. So it is not simply the Government&#146;s determination in some way to codify this point, as it is described; rather it is to provide a clarification that operates beyond this Chamber for the benefit of the whole public.</p>

<p><a name="st_95"></a>
<a name="08042358000034"></a><a name="80423-0004.htm_spnew24"></a><b><a name="80423-0004.htm_spnew25"></a><a name="08042358001322"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> My Lords, I hope I may ask the Minister without discourtesy if he could assist me in these two matters. He says that there is no question of changing the common law. Therefore, with the authority of the cases of Gladstone Williams and Beckford, decided in 1984 and 1985 respectively, and the whole chain of cases that followed those decisions, does he accept that that is the current state of the law? Secondly, does he accept that to enjoin a jury to consider whether a person&#146;s sincerely held view is sincerely held as against a template of what is reasonable would, in fact, commit the very error that the learned judge committed in the case of Williams, which was castigated by the Court of Appeal?</p>

<p><a name="st_96"></a>

The clause seeks to reflect the language more in <I>Palmer</I>&#151;the language of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest&#151;and it was immediately identified that certain passages from <I>Palmer</I> were reflected in the provision. I hope that is a sufficient answer to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, the noble Lord, Lord Neill, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. It is for that reason that we do not seek to have the issue remitted for consideration by the Law Commission.</p>

<a name="80423-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="08042358000036"></a>Against this background, I believe that we should take this opportunity to address legitimate concerns around this issue and use Clause 75 as a pragmatic and sensitive way forward. Therefore, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<a name="80423-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="08042358000038"></a>I take up one point that the Minister made about the relationship between disproportionality and the Human Rights Act. The Minister suggests that my amendment would not conform with the Act because of the way in which the European Court of Human Rights has interpreted the concept of proportionality.</p>

<a name="80423-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="08042376000001"></a>I respectfully disagree with him. The test in our law is reasonable in the subjective circumstances in which the defendant saw a matter. It is perfectly possible that behaving reasonably in the subjective circumstances in which a defendant saw a matter could be a disproportionate response that was, nevertheless, within the definition provided by English law. It follows from what the Minister said that, if his proposition is correct, our law itself could be in breach of the convention. That is precisely  why we have used the concept of &#147;grossly disproportionate&#148;&#151;to make it absolutely clear that we do not fall foul of this trap, which I hope that I have just elucidated.</p>

<a name="80423-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08042358000044"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, as I indicated in the debate on the previous amendment, I am in the unusual position of having my criticisms accepted in a government amendment, which vastly improves the clause. Even so, I am seeking to strike it out completely, for all the reasons that I have given. I beg to move.</p>

If he seriously thinks that the general public can read, learn and inwardly digest this clause, he is very much mistaken. It is not to be read by those who sit on the Clapham omnibus, or even by those who sit on the back seat of bankers&#146; chauffeur-driven cars. It is far too obscure. The law is understood by the judges; therefore do not try to double write things just for the sake of sending a message. With respect, it is very sloppy thinking to try to do so.</p>

I shall make four points. If the clause is meant to be a clarification and a teaching clause, it does a pretty bad job. I know that people never like to have their drafting criticised&#151;personally, I hate it. Saying that one has no pride of authorship is not an honest statement.</p>

<a name="80423-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08042358000047"></a>However, why does the clause not say what the defence of common law is in simple terms, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, did in the Martin case? He said in one sentence that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="08042358000207"></a>&#147;A defendant is entitled to use reasonable force to protect himself, others for whom he is responsible and his property&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042358000178"></a>That is a simple statement. What about property? There is no word in the clause that tells you whether you are allowed to protect property as part of the

What about the onus of proof? The man in the street on the Clapham omnibus or whatever vehicle he is in might be interested to know that once any reasonable suggestion is put forward that there may be a case of self-defence, it is then a matter for the prosecution. Again I quote the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, who stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="08042358000208"></a>&#147;When this defence is raised, the prosecution has the burden of satisfying the jury so that they are sure that the defendant was not acting in self-defence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042358000179"></a>That is an elementary statement about the law of self-defence that is nowhere to be found in this so-called teaching clause.</p>

<a name="80423-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08042358000048"></a>Subsection (4) is just playing with words. It is the stuff of <I>Roget&#146;s Thesaurus</I>. It says that what is not reasonable is disproportionate. What is the point of making an amendment like that? I have spoken about subsection (5), which just uses Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest&#146;s rather flavoured special language and puts it into a statute. Then there is the use of self-induced intoxication in a defence. Why are drugs not mentioned? A lot of people are high on drugs all the time. Can one use that in a defence? Why not deal with this matter properly and send it off to the Law Commission?</p>

<p><a name="st_101"></a>

On the whole, I think that Her Majesty&#146;s judges are in a better position than Parliament to expound the whole law. Another point about the clause is rather dangerous; the common law has flexibility that one cannot have in an Act of Parliament. Is this provision supposed to regulate the common law in this area for the foreseeable future? If so, it deprives judges of a very valuable feature of the common law; namely, that unexpected cases can arise that even Parliament had not anticipated in which to apply the current law in the circumstances.</p>

<a name="80423-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08042358000050"></a>If clarification is required, I cannot see why the Law Commission is not the authoritative body to provide it. I think that I heard the noble and learned Lord the Advocate-General say that the Association of Chief Police Officers wanted the law to be clarified. If so, there are very good systems for doing that by getting an opinion from someone who understands the present law and states it with the clarity that has apparently, so far, eluded Her Majesty's judges.</p>

<a name="80423-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08042358000051"></a>The simple result is that confusion is added to the law. I notice that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, mentioned the desirability of having procedures for implementing Law Commission reports. Such a procedure&#151;the Jellicoe procedure&#151;was developed in the 1990s. A considerable number of Law Commission recommendations were put into law and have played an important part in it ever since. I cannot see that it is likely that that procedure will be improved on.</p>

<a name="80423-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08042358000052"></a>As far as I am concerned, this clause is an extremely damaging incursion into an area that belongs to the courts and the common law.</p>

Some of this has been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, but there are other phrases, with which I will not trouble the House, save to say that the Court of Appeal Criminal Division has quite enough to do without having to interpret what the common law has been relatively clear about, which the clause will considerably obscure.</p>

As has been shown in devastating terms this afternoon, it is a mess. To carry it forward into legislation would be to take a posture to an extent that would be both disproportionate and unreasonable and we should not do it.</p>

Service law comes into the discussion on this Bill on a number of occasions, so I was extremely relieved to hear his definition of self-defence. Defending yourself or property, or other people whom it is your duty to defend, is precisely the definition that is given to soldiers when they are on duty. It is clear and it is based on the common law. I would hate anything to be done to make it less clear.</p>

The government amendment states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08042358000209"></a>&#147;If D claims to have held a particular belief as regards the existence of any circumstances&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042358000180"></a>That wording certainly suggests that that is a defence for him to raise rather than a matter for the prosecution to expunge. The fundamental weakness in the original clause is compounded by the amendment. It will do the system and principles of justice no benefit whatever. It is bound to obfuscate the view of a jury on the whole issue of self-defence. On that basis alone, I believe that there is every justification for not proceeding with the clause.</p>

<a name="80423-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08042358000057"></a>I abjure the temptation to consider the origins of the clause; the heady hustingness of October last year may have had more to do with it than anything else. Be that as it may, I am genuinely concerned that the clause makes the situation less clear. As to not changing the law, I have already addressed the point relating to Gladstone Williams and Beckford. I believe that this does change the law, although that may not have been Her Majesty&#146;s Government&#146;s intention.</p>

However, the Government suggest that, if that were done, it would risk undoing much of the good work that has been done in this House to deal with this area thus far. During the passage of the Bill, there has been considerable interest in the debate surrounding self-defence, which demonstrates that there are serious concerns about whether the current position is appropriate or sustainable. That is possibly an answer

<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08042358000059"></a>One has heard fairly extreme legislative proposals, such as the amendments that we have been dealing with on gross disproportionality. Other proposals have sought to refine the government clause in the interests of more accurately reflecting the common law position, which we feel we have now done.

<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08042358000062"></a>It is clear that noble Lords have a number of questions in relation to this area. The noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, raises four points setting out how he considers that there is scope, at least, for alteration and improvement. In answer, I would say that one is not seeking to provide an entire code for every area of the common law of self-defence but, rather, to put in place the principal message on how self-defence should be treated. Again, this may be an answer to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, who said correctly that this is not a complete exposition of the law. It is not intended to be that; it is intended to provide clarification in certain areas. I do not in any way suggest that this is some kind of clarity that has eluded Her Majesty&#146;s judges; rather, it seeks to reflect the clarity that those judges have brought to the law.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08042358000063"></a>It has been suggested before that this may be an area for the Law Commission, and I reiterate the argument that I made then: the Law Commission may be useful for innovation but this is not supposed to be an innovation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08042358000064"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, suggests that we may be creating the wrong impression of the common law. I repeat the observations that I made earlier in relation to that point.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="08042358000065"></a>I submit that it would be at least disappointing were Clause 75 to be lost, given that it has been amended to reflect the learned contributions made during the passage of the Bill. It may be considered that this is the time to address the public&#146;s confusion and that that would reassure front-line practitioners and possibly encourage responsible citizenship.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="08042358000066"></a>Judicial discretion has generally led to sensitive and appropriate rulings when cases are brought to court but the law has a broader role. It needs to be understood and to be more widely accessible than to lawyers alone. This is an area of the law over which sections of the public have strong and continuing concerns that are echoed by some sections of the media. The Government believe that there is genuine confusion about how and when force may be used in self-defence. One should note that senior police representatives accept that this is an issue. In the light of that, the Government believe that this is an opportunity that might be taken to address legitimate concern.  Accordingly, I invite the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I think he stated that this provision does not deal with the whole law of self-defence but just clarifies a part of it.

Here is an attempt to codify the common law and we have an admission by the Minister that he is not going to do it in its entirety. He will codify only a major part of the law of self defence, but will leave other aspects, such as the defence of property, the defence of others and the position of the military, and simply rely on the main thrust. If, before the legislation is passed, the public are confused about the law of defence, how much more confused will they be when it has been passed?

<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08042358000076"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we on these Benches are very glad that the Government did not carry out their threat to remove Clause 76 because of all the pressures they were under. We are relieved to see that it is still in the Bill, and that they have tabled Amendment No. 94C, which answers some of the worries about journalism. That improves the measure substantially as there were some genuine worries about increasing a penalty from a fine, which a newspaper as a corporation can pay, to a threat of imprisonment, which would inevitably land on an individual journalist. That takes the question of the freedom of the press into a different place. The Government have correctly recognised that and have tabled their amendment.</p>

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08042358000077"></a>I am not quite so keen on government Amendment No. 94B, which is the secondary legislation to

Although that secondary legislation will come before Parliament to be debated, we will not be able to amend it. I appreciate that the Government were between a rock and hard place, the rock being the Information Commissioner&#151;who has done a tremendous job; Clause 76 reflects a lot of his work suggesting that there should be higher penalties in cases where people commit data protection offences&#151;and the hard place being the Murdoch press, which wants to defend the right of some of its establishment to commit undesirable practices. When I asked the ministerial team where the pressure to exclude this clause was coming from, it was quite forthcoming that it was from Paul Dacre and Rebekah Wade. The broadsheets have taken an interesting line on this and have expanded the issue fully. We are the better for the debate about where journalists stand on this. I shall be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.  I beg to move.</p>

If I remember correctly, when this was discussed in Committee, the noble Lord said that the Government would remove the clause if we could not reach agreement about some satisfactory compromise.</p>

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08042358000079"></a>I am not sure that we have necessarily reached that compromise, but the Government have at least brought forward an amendment that does something&#151;even if, as the noble Baroness puts it, they are between the proverbial rock and hard place. I do not think that we would want to oppose the Government provision, even if it is not utterly satisfactory, but at this stage we want to hear from the Minister exactly what the provision does and how it does it. In the light of that, I intend to sit down and listen to what he has to say.</p>

It is a huge problem. As the Information Commissioner says, some sections of the press have been concerned that the provision could have a chilling effect, but the interesting thing is that no new criminal offence is being created and there is already a defence for journalists whose activities can be justified as being in the public interest. So why are they so worried? The answer is that the previous penalties did not deter them. Reading the commissioner&#146;s excellent report, <I>What Price Privacy Now</I><I>?</I>, we find that the <I>Daily Mail</I> tops the poll with 952 transactions positively identified, with 58 journalists buying information from databases. That is sensitive information about people that could be used. If the journalists were not actually working for the newspaper or moved, they could be misusing information. We have to tighten up on this. Therefore, although we would have preferred the tighter clause, we welcome what the Government are trying to do here.</p>

<a name="08042358000081"></a><a name="80423-0006.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80423-0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08042358001342"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, in my usual place, between a rock and a hard place, I respond positively to both the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and the noble Lord, Lord Henley, for what I think is a general welcome for the work that has been undertaken since our previous helpful debate in Committee. I will come to the point raised by the noble Earl in a moment, because it is very important and goes back to the reason why the Government brought forward the provisions in the first place.</p>

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08042358000082"></a>As noble Lords will know, Section 60 of the Data Protection Act 1998 currently specifies the penalties for offences committed under Section 55 of that Act&#151;the unlawful obtaining, disclosing, procuring or selling of personal data. It provides for a maximum penalty of &#163;5,000 on summary conviction and an unlimited fine for conviction on indictment. Given the very experience that the noble Earl raised today, Clause 76 sought to increase the maximum penalty for this offence to a custodial sentence of two years following conviction on indictment, in addition to the existing provision for fines, to make the offence really bite in view of the problems that have been brought to light, especially by the Information Commissioner.</p>

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08042358000083"></a>On the other hand&#151;this is where we came to the difficulty&#151;as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, suggested, there are concerns about the chilling effect of this increase in penalty on investigative journalism. Let me make clear, as I did in Committee, that the Government have no wish to curtail legitimate and responsible journalism. That was the basis on which I said that I intended to remove the clause unless we could find a satisfactory solution balancing the need to strengthen the protection of individuals&#146; rights and respect for their privacy on the one hand, and freedom of expression of the press on the other.</p>

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08042358000084"></a>There has been a flurry of debate both within the media and in our discussions. I am glad to say that a satisfactory solution has been found, so we will not now simply remove Clause 76, but replace it by my Amendments Nos. 94B and 94C. The new clauses, and the associated consequential amendments, reflect the result of that extensive discussion. We think that that strikes the right balance. Here we have a strong signal that the lucrative and illegal trade in personal data will not be tolerated and that a stronger deterrent is available if that activity continues.  If it did continue, the Government would bring an order before your Lordships&#146; House and in the  other place.</p>

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="08042358000085"></a>Amendment No. 94B confers on the Secretary of State a power to make an order altering the maximum penalty for an offence under Section 55 of the Data Protection Act. The maximum penalty that could be specified in such an order is two years&#146; imprisonment. Under this new clause, the Secretary of State is required to consult interested parties, including the Information Commissioner and media organisations, before making such an order. Conferring a power to make an order in this way enables the Government to keep under review progress in combating the market in illegally acquired personal data before deciding in

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="08042358000086"></a>In addition, the Government will work with the Information Commissioner, the media and other interested parties on raising awareness of how to avoid committing an offence. This will include training, an education and information campaign and other suitable activities. As part of its current review, the Sentencing Guidelines Council will produce guidelines on this offence in due course, which all courts will need to take into account.</p>

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="08042358000087"></a>Amendment No. 94C provides for an additional defence for Section 55 offences where the offender acted with a view to publishing for journalistic, literary or artistic purposes and in the reasonable belief that their actions were justified in the public interest. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, has sought in some of her amendments to deal with this matter. I hope she will accept that my amendment does that.</p>

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="08042358000088"></a>I take this opportunity to thank all parties who have worked together to reach a solution, and I put on record the Government&#146;s thanks for the tireless and highly respected work of the Information Commissioner, Richard Thomas, and his office, who have made such a compelling case for a serious sanction against people who deliberately or recklessly misuse personal data.</p>

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="08042358000089"></a>An order made under an order-making power is not subject to amendment, but I must say to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that it is subject to the affirmative procedure. Moreover, the Secretary of State must consult the Information Commissioner, and media organisations and other interested parties where he considers this appropriate, which means that there will be considerable discussion before an order is brought before your Lordships&#146; House. I hope that it will not be necessary to do so, because I hope that the very act of making these amendments will send the right signal. The Information Commissioner has made some very important and persuasive points in the past few weeks which, combined with the education programme that I also described, will I hope ensure that this is taken seriously and that we will not have to bring an order. If this does not work and it is clear that invasions of privacy continue, we will not hesitate to take action.</p>

<p><a name="08042358000181"></a>On the face of it that is entirely reasonable, but we know the pressure of legislative time. The amendment is very simple in what it seeks to do and has the benefit of covering data breaches by government officials.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08042358000099"></a>Goodness knows, this is not exactly a new issue. The Government have had time to address it. In 2002 in another place my honourable friend Paul Burstow revealed that a total of 1,354 government-owned computers had gone missing over the previous five years, while much more recently, as noble Lords will be aware, vast amounts of data, whether from Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs or the health sector, have been lost. The issue has been around for a long time, and not only in government sectors. The private sector, as we know, can be negligent, and it can do all

Both the public and private sectors need to be covered by further sanctions, which is the reason for our amendment.</p>

<a name="80423-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08042358000100"></a>The Conservatives have also tabled an amendment in this group, to which I am sure they will speak. It has as many merits as our own when it comes to the public sector, but they have chosen to leave the private sector entirely out of it. The difficulty with that is that if you are a member of the public, it does not matter if it is the public sector or the private sector that has lost your data; the fact is, your data have been lost. The public need to depend on data controllers to be absolutely reliable and to do their utmost to safeguard people&#146;s personal information. For that reason, we should aim to cover both public sector and private sector data controllers. With the increased blurring of the lines between the public and private sectors&#151;I appreciate that this is often covered by contracts; indeed, I think the wording in the Conservative amendment mentions government contracts&#151;it will not always be simple. Surely the public have an absolute right to expect data controllers in charge of any private information to be given immense incentives to be as careful as  possible with it.</p>

As she put it in shorthand, her amendment covers the public and private sectors, whereas ours covers only the public sector and, under subsection (2)(b) of our amendment,</p>
<ul><a name="08042358000241"></a>&#147;a person acting in pursuance of a government contract&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042358000183"></a>So it would cover some others. I can presume from that that the noble Baroness certainly would support our amendment. We have some doubts about whether we would go as far as her slightly wider amendment. I shall have to give this some thought, particularly after I have heard the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08042358000103"></a>The noble Baroness was also right to say that we probably did not have a long enough debate on this matter in Committee and, bearing in mind we want to finish this Bill this evening, we are probably rather short of time for debate on Report. Perhaps the noble Baroness remembers that we felt slightly constrained for time on the previous occasion. We suddenly noticed the House filling up as noble Lords waited to debate the whole question of blasphemy, which, for some reason&#151;I look to the right reverend Prelates&#151;seemed to interest the House far more than the very important issue of data protection.</p>

I prefer the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, because it is hard to decide what is government and what is not, and there is the status in between. Telephone records can be extremely sensitive. For instance, BT is private: it is not government. Many bits of information put together could be extremely damaging to the citizens of this country if they are revealed.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08042358000106"></a>We are very weak on this. Given that, quite rightly, we are putting in the new clause exemptions for journalistic purposes, it would be good to strengthen the awareness of the people who will potentially sell this information that they could get into a lot of hot water if they do so. I would therefore draw it wider. Restricting it purely to government systems is unwise and far too limiting. Therefore, the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would be very useful to send a message and to make people think twice.</p>

<p><a name="st_121"></a>
<a name="08042358000107"></a><a name="80423-0007.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80423-0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08042358001348"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> I do not disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, the noble Lord, Lord Henley, or the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, on the importance of this matter and of the need to improve trust and confidence among the public about the arrangements in place to protect personal data. There is no doubt whatever that there are concerns. There have been examples where data have not been appropriately protected. Clearly, we need to learn those lessons and to make sure that it is put right as much as is possible.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08042358000108"></a>My problem with the amendments is the same as I mentioned in Committee. The Government are involved in a number of reviews on these matters in the light of some of the well publicised incidents that have taken place. Just as noble Lords usually say that the legislation I bring forward is premature and has not had enough consideration, I have to say that that is our position at the moment. The Cabinet Office is due to publish the findings of its review into data handling procedures in government which will describe how the Government have put in place a core set of minimum mandatory measures to protect information that applies across central government. These measures are intended to supplement the material provided to departments in other ways, including the <I>Manual of Protective Security</I>, and compliance will be assessed on an annual basis. It will underpin the summary material in the Statement on Internal Control and be subject to peer review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08042358000109"></a>We are committed in principle to the introduction of new sanctions under the Data Protection Act 1998 for the most serious breaches of its principles. Such proposals will take account of the need not only to provide high levels of data security, but also to ensure that sensible data sharing practices can be conducted  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1539"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1539</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in an environment of legal certainty. We will also have to take a considered view on what measures are necessary to strengthen the protection of personal data in the light of the recommendations made in the various reports and reviews we are embarked on at the moment. I mention, for example, recent Select Committee reports and the Thomas Walport review which was announced by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in October. It is due to report shortly. The principal mandate of that review is to examine the scope of the sharing of personal information protections that apply when personal information is shared in the public and private sectors. It is also considering the operation of the Data Protection Act and options for implementing possible changes, and will include recommendations on the powers and sanctions available to the regulator and the courts in the legislation governing data sharing and data protection. Further, following the HMRC data loss issue, the Thomas Walport review is considering the case for extending the audit and inspection powers of the Information Commissioner to conduct compliance checks on the private and wider public sectors. In addition, we have the PricewaterhouseCoopers review on HMRC procedures. An interim report has already been published, and the full report is due this spring.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08042358000110"></a>The Government recognise the genuine and legitimate concerns expressed by noble Lords both in this debate and in Committee, but a number of imminent reviews and reports will inform both the actions that the Government have to take as a Government and whether legislative changes should be made. That is why we think it would be premature to legislate at this point. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, referred to the pressure of legislative time. Equally, this is an important matter. I cannot stand at the Dispatch Box and declare that on such and such a date we will bring forward legislation, but what I can say is that this is an important matter that we take very seriously. I hope, in that spirit, that noble Lords will not press their amendments because it would be premature to do so.</p>

As I said, citizens do not mind who lost the data; it is irrelevant to them. What is important is that it is their data that have been sold, lost or left on rubbish heaps and it is they who are affected by it.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08042358000114"></a>I hear what the Minister says about the consultations and reviews that are taking place and I have received the helpful House of Commons Library note dated 14 March which listed all of the work that is underway. It is quite right that the Government should look at all of their procedures and decide which ones they should have in place and how they should be followed, and which departments are behind and which ones are ahead. But when all the reviews have taken place, I cannot believe that the Government will say about data controllers who have intentionally or recklessly disclosed information, or who have repeatedly and negligently allowed people&#146;s personal data to be disclosed, &#147;Well that is fine. We would not want that to be an offence&#148;. That is what the amendment is asking for; it seeks that in such cases there should be an offence. There are perfectly adequate defences in subsection (2) but if the Government feel they ought to be strengthened, that can be done before Third Reading.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08042358000115"></a>This is an important point of principle. I respect what the Minister has said about the consultations and so on, but we know that those will take time and that then there will have to be a response to them. Some of these were started last year and still have not reported. Basically the public will have to continue with this lack of protection for at least another year or two, during which time, at the rate of the past 12 months, millions more pieces of data will have gone missing.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="08042358000116"></a>I believe that the amendment is essential. The Minister claimed that the previous clause is essential to sharpen up people&#146;s acts. That should apply also to the Government. For that reason, our amendment is equally important to the Bill and therefore I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08042358000123"></a>Section 2 of the 1860 Act, which we seek to abolish, deals with,</p>
<ul><a name="08042358000242"></a>&#147;riotous, violent or indecent behaviour in any Cathedral Church, Parish or District Church or Chapel of the Church of England ... or in any Chapel of any Religious Denomination or ... in any Place of Religious Worship duly certified under the Registered Places of Worship Act 1855&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08042358000124"></a>This section was last used following the interruption of the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury&#146;s sermon during the Easter Sunday service a couple of years ago, as your Lordships may recall. Two protestors, Mr Cordle and Mr Spotswood from Sheffield, unfurled a banner while interrupting the church service. They invited the most reverend Primate to join a public debate on Sharia law. As has happened with almost every other case that has been brought in modern times under the Act, the charges were dropped when the men appeared in front of magistrates who bound them over under a power of magistrates&#151;it is centuries old&#151;to bind people over to keep the peace. They were bound over for 12 months in the sum of &#163;100. The defendants said that they were protesting against the millions of Christians persecuted under Sharia law in places such as Nigeria and Pakistan. It was not as if they were supporting Sharia law; they were speaking against it.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08042358000125"></a>The question is whether we should still have a law like this dating back to 1860 on the statute book. It mainly reflects Christian places of worship but, unfortunately, synagogues, gurdwaras and mosques are often desecrated. However, unless they have, most unusually, been registered under the Act to which I referred earlier, no offence is committed under Section 2&#151;the section we seek to abolish.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08042358000126"></a>The whole issue was considered by the Select Committee on Religious Offences, which reported recently. It was its combined view that the offence should be repealed without replacement. The committee drew to the attention of the House the fact that, despite considerable effort, it unearthed details of only three convictions in relation to Christian churches, and in two of them the defendants were finally convicted of a different offence. The other person who was convicted was Mr Peter Tatchell and there is no doubt that he could have been convicted under other offences. The amendment would introduce a new clause to abolish what we say is an out-of-date and unnecessary Act and an offence that is limited in scope, both legally and practically. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08042358000128"></a>The 2003 Lords Select Committee on Religious Offences devoted a whole chapter of its report to this subject. The main issue is whether protection for churches and other places of worship should be achieved through the ordinary law, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said, or by additional and specific protection for the ceremonies, sacred places and artefacts of religion. Without going into the substantive arguments, it is not clear to me that specific protection is not required. Indeed, it is possible to think of incidents that are not covered by any other offences, some of which are listed in the Select Committee report.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08042358000129"></a>If protection is to be offered in today&#146;s society, it would have to be worked out on a multi-faith basis, as was agreed by the Church of England as far back as 1989. The Select Committee reviewed all the arguments and found that there had been 60 prosecutions under Section 2 between 1997 and 2002. I do not have more up-to-date figures than that. However, the relatively small number of prosecutions might be due, at least in part, to the lack of awareness that the Act can be invoked by all faiths.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08042358000130"></a>Therefore, the Select Committee concluded that the law ought to be redrafted to reflect modern conditions, citing the view of the Director of Public Prosecutions that it would be a valuable, if infrequently used, offence. There is therefore, it seems to me, a strong argument against proceeding by abolition without replacement, as this amendment does. That is my reservation in saying no to the amendment. It is unarguable that Section 2 needs updating. Therefore, the question is, have we the will to do it and who will work on producing such a replacement? I believe that is an important task given the current state of our society because the replacement of the ECJA in modern form would demonstrate that Parliament recognises the importance of religious beliefs in our society, that worshippers open their doors to all comers and that religious ceremonies are hallowed, are the source of spiritual sustenance and embody community coherence.</p>

<a name="80423-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08042358000131"></a>Given all that has happened in the five years since the Select Committee reported and the increasingly significant impact that religion is having on all our lives, my view is that we should not abolish Section 2 without having a ready-made, modern replacement. If we do that, we shall demonstrate Parliament&#146;s recognition of, and support for, the sincere and profound religious convictions of the many people of many faiths who live together in this country.</p>

His amendment was very well moved by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. We had a rather truncated debate on this amendment when it was debated at the end of a very long debate on blasphemy in Committee, and I certainly will not reiterate what I said then. Clause 77 provides the backdrop to the amendment. I am very grateful for the contribution made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle and for the way in which he presented the argument, which is by and large the argument of the Government.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08042358000134"></a>I indicated in Committee that some religious offences might appear anachronistic and unnecessary, but there is evidence that at least some continue to be of useful application in modern society, and that is particularly the case in respect of the statute that the noble Lord proposes to repeal. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, was right when he listed the occasions on which prosecutions have been brought. It is correct that they are infrequent, but nevertheless this Easter the police made use of Section 2 of the ECJ Act 1860 to charge two individuals who interrupted an address by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury in Canterbury Cathedral. I am aware that the charges were subsequently dropped, but on that evidence it can scarcely be held to be an obsolete provision.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08042358000135"></a>There is some uncertainty about the scope of the legislation in some respects. I agree with the right reverend Prelate that it is worth noting that the 1860 Act does not expressly exclude the protection of non-Christian places of worship, and it is useful in that respect. It is something that we should certainly bear in mind. Although caveats were expressed by the Select Committee in 2003, it also addressed a larger truth&#151;one which we very much agree with in principle&#151;that those of religious faith deserve special protection and the best protection that the law will allow, for the reason that the right reverend Prelate mentioned. Those places are hallowed; they are places of worship and they are special places where we conduct our rites of religious observation. In this connection, the statute that the noble Lord seeks to remove affords a particular remedy for a particular kind of mischief, and it continues to be of practical value to the police and prosecuting authorities.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08042358000136"></a>This is not intended as any means of comfort, but to understand from where the 1860 Act derived its legitimacy, I went back to find that the Act that it replaced was the Brawling Act 1551. The 1860 Act offers a much more liberal interpretation than the Act it replaced. I thought that the House might like to know how the law is by nature progressive. The Brawling Act 1551 provided that anyone drawing a weapon or striking someone with a weapon in a church or churchyard

If he was a habitual offender, with no ears left, he was to be branded on the cheek with a hot iron in the shape of the letter F for fray-maker and fighter. Naturally, he was also excommunicated, which went with the territory. The law has made some progress in this respect.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08042358000137"></a>I say to the right reverend Prelate in particular that the Government will certainly keep the law in this area under review. For the time being, we believe that the legislation should remain on the statute book. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, will be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08042358000139"></a>I very much welcome the speech made by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle. One thing he said that struck a chord with me was that churches open their doors to all comers. That was the case in my youth, but sadly in modern times very many churches remain locked unless some member of the congregation is prepared to be there to receive visitors. It is a reflection of our times that that occurs. I want the right reverend Prelate and other noble Lords to appreciate that I do not come to this with any desire to lessen the protection that there should be to religious property and to religious artefacts. I simply reiterate that current legislation that is much more readily used is available. It is the sort of thing that police officers carrying out their duties would understand very much more than going back to the Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860, which I doubt features very highly in their training schedules when they become police constables.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08042358000140"></a>This is really about a desire to ensure that the law is evenly enforced against people and not to diminish the protection to those concerned. I was pleased to hear the right reverend Prelate say that the Church of England has accepted that this should apply to multi-faith congregations and ministers. No doubt, if we keep on raising this issue, we will encourage the Government or a Government to bring forward legislation that will carry out some sensible and rational amendment of the law along the lines that the Select Committee on Religious Offences thought correct in its report.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08042358000145"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we now come to a new topic in the Bill. Much has been said both on Second Reading and in Committee about the unsatisfactory legal status of VOOs and, in particular, about the confusion between the civil and criminal principles that they engender. I do not propose to reignite that debate at this late stage in the proceedings, so I shall address the reasons for our amendments as briefly as I can.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08042358000146"></a>On the amendment that I am moving, the Government have conceded that there should be some indication in the Bill of what a VOO might comprise. We welcome that concession but think that it does not go far enough. We believe that there should be a clear and detailed, if not wholly exhaustive, list of what receiving a VOO implies, amendable by an affirmative order. A good example of our thinking is given in Section 1(4) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, where there is a list that, if not exhaustive, nevertheless contains specific provisions. That is the kind of thing that we have in mind for the VOO section in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08042358000147"></a>On a separate matter, the Government have their Amendment No. 101A and we are particularly concerned about subsection (2)(d) of the proposed new clause&#151;the limitation on,</p>
<ul><a name="08042358000245"></a>&#147;associating with any specified group or organisation&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042358000186"></a>We disagree with the power to impose a VOO to prevent a person from associating with a specified group or organisation. The freedom to associate is a fundamental right, as the Government know well from their political history. If the Government consider that some groups pose a risk of serious violent harm to public safety, they should take appropriate steps.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08042358000148"></a>Much has been said in your Lordships&#146; House on whether VOOs exceed the limit of civil preventive orders and are punishments. Without a clear indication of what a VOO is or is not, the danger of straying into the area of punishment becomes that much more likely. I beg to move.</p>

I also welcome the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has moved his amendment. In many respects there is a difficult choice, because there certainly is merit in having a list, because circumstances are being addressed to protect the public in the United Kingdom from the risk of serious violent harm. A wide measure of protection is being sought and, in doing that, magistrates to whom an application is made might also be tempted in response to impose restrictions, prohibitions or conditions that could be far-reaching in their application. Indeed, as the noble Lord said in moving his amendment, that could cross the fine line between what constitutes a preventive measure or an additional punishment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08042358000150"></a>At times there is a temptation to say that we should not be too definitive because circumstances may well arise where, if you have a definitive list of conditions that could be attached, something more obvious and appropriate could not be done. But in establishing this type of order, there is merit in making clear and precise what the magistrates may attach as a condition&#151;particularly given that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, allows for the list to be amended by order. Therefore, that problem could be addressed if a glaring omission emerged.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08042358000151"></a>I am concerned also that the government amendment, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, indicated, refers to a prohibition about associating with any specified group or organisation. That could go too far and there may be legitimate reasons for a person to wish to associate&#151;perhaps to go to a trade union meeting and find that for some reason, because of the information presented to a magistrate, he or she was not allowed to. Addressing a specific problem should not be brought in under the guise of a VOO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08042358000152"></a>While we have talked about the generality of restrictive conditions&#151;&#147;You can&#146;t go there&#148;, or &#147;You can&#146;t associate with X&#148;, or &#147;You&#146;ve got to be at home by a particular time&#148;&#151;my understanding of the clause is that the word &#147;condition&#148; could impose a positive obligation. For example, there may be an obligation to undergo a particular course of treatment or inform the police if you were taking up a personal relationship with a particular person. That goes too far by imposing that kind of obligation through a civil procedure. Therefore, we should hem in and make clearer and more precise what magistrates might attach as conditions when we are taking a significant step by establishing these orders in the first place, and we should progress with a degree of caution. My noble friends will be minded to support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, if he should test the opinion of the House.</p>

These violent offender orders are viewed with considerable distaste by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. However, small the VOOs are, they remain a punishment; because if you say to someone that you may not do something, that is a punishment. We also thought that the standard of proof required was not high enough. We will come to that later.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08042358000154"></a>I accept what other noble Lords have said&#151;that the Government have gone a little down the way to help, for which I thank them&#151;but they need encouragement to go a little further.

The Joint Committee noted with some satisfaction that the Government have tabled an amendment that provides an indicative list of provisions, but the committee stated that an exhaustive list would be much better from a human rights perspective, because that would ensure certainty.

The amendments would mean that the court and the magistrates could not impose a condition that was not included within this list. Therefore, the very people who know the local conditions and all the circumstances would not have any flexibility and might not be able to target the risk management&#151;and this is to do with risk management&#151;effectively to the needs of the individual or for the protection of the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08042358000159"></a>As has been said, government Amendments  Nos. 101A and 105A provide an indicative list of  the prohibitions, restrictions or conditions&#151;not punishments&#151;that could be imposed as part of a violent offender order. The amendments will mean that the court has an indication of the types of conditions that could be imposed as part of an order, but the list is not exhaustive and so leaves it with that degree of flexibility.</p>

Because of this, we know that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to risk management. Instead, management and supervision must always be targeted to the specific risk and the specific case&#151;the risky individual, the context in which they are operating and the risk that they present.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08042358000161"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, for what I consider to be a constructive amendment. It made us think about the issue, which is why we came up with our amendment. However, because of the simple fact that there is no single solution to risk management, I do not think that it would be appropriate to introduce an exhaustive list of conditions that could be imposed as part of a violent offender order. Violent offender orders as currently provided for allow the court&#151;I have a lot of respect for our courts and their ability to make these judgments&#151;to exercise their discretion and to impose only those conditions that would directly address the specific risk of serious violent harm that an individual is considered to pose. I am sure that noble Lords will agree that we must not encourage a situation in which a court feels that it has to impose blanket conditions on an individual that do not actually address the problems with that individual or manage the risk that they pose. I do not believe that this would help the individual in respect of whom the order is being made or help the public. The magistrates and the court would have the necessary flexibility to tailor this exactly for the protection of the public and, in a sense, to help the person involved and prevent him from getting into further difficulty; the conditions should be tailored.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08042358000162"></a>I am content to provide an indicative list of conditions that I believe will guide and support the courts to apply fair and appropriate conditions as part of violent offender orders. I found over the years when I was dispensing summary punishment that it was much more useful within a ship or an establishment to have guidance rather than to have specific things laid down; one achieved a better result in the end. Therefore, I am unwilling to introduce an exhaustive list and I beg the noble Lord to acknowledge the reasoning for that.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08042358000163"></a>I will need to think about the question of association. I read the provision to mean that, if Fred Bloggs hates trade unionists and keeps going to trade union meetings and punching people, we could say that we did not want him to go to trade union meetings at such-and-such a town hall on such-and-such an occasion. However, I accept and understand the wider concern, which I will take away and think about.</p>

Is that not better than giving him a civil order? Many of us prefer criminals to be tried and sentenced for what they have done wrong rather than to have prevention orders or VOOs applied against them.</p>

It is always dangerous to give examples, but I see this as applying to someone who has a history of going around punching trade unionists because he hates them. He has been punished for that but has now come out of prison and started being abusive, going to meetings and causing trouble, although not to the extent that the police would be able to take action. We know from his past history that he can be extremely violent; indeed, he was in prison because he did something very violent and damaged someone. The aim of this is to prevent him from being in a position where he will damage and injure someone. There is always a danger in giving examples, but that is how I see this.</p>

<a name="80423-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08042358000166"></a>If someone has done something and one can get all the evidence against him, clearly one takes him to court and punishes him properly. However, this is about risk management; it is about trying to prevent something before it happens. This has occurred in a number of areas. For example, the sexual offences prevention orders have been found to be extremely valuable in preventing offences happening. How much better to do that&#151;it protects the public and in a way looks after the man involved&#151;than to wait for an offence and then to have to punish the man and send him to prison.</p>

Magistrates&#146; courts are no longer concerned with crime and punishment; they are concerned with managing risk. What training do they have to manage risk? He is suggesting an unknown list of conditions that they might impose&#151;a shopping list, which may include polishing the decks for all we know. I respectfully suggest that this is not an appropriate way for courts of law to have to act. Managing risk is not what they are for. The Government do not seem to understand that.</p>

I think that this is an extremely good thing for them to be able to do. How much better it would be if we could stop offences happening because of the skill and expertise of the courts rather than having to put people in prison. I believe that we have too many people in prison and I would rather not send them there. I would rather stop things before they happen, and this is an example of where that can be done. Therefore, I am afraid that I disagree with the noble Lord. I believe that, because of courts&#146; experience in other areas, they are well able to exercise this judgment and I think that they would do it extremely well, as they have in relation to the sexual offences prevention orders. We have had football barring orders for a number of years and those have been extremely valuable. They have stopped people committing crimes and protected members of the public, which surely is what we are trying to do. On that basis, I urge the noble Lord to acknowledge the reasoning behind the government amendments and to withdraw his own amendment.</p>

However, he has not gone as far as I would have wished him to go in relation to this amendment. People who receive a violent offender order have not committed a crime. They are entitled to know exactly what they face if their freedom is to be restricted; otherwise, too much discretion will be furnished to the authorities. The authorities can simply say that they are in a unique position to make a judgment about risk which cannot be questioned in the court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08042358000170"></a>I recall the Minister saying that he is concerned about inhibiting the risk management discretion of the court; but that means that the authorities can call on the magistrates to do anything they want to someone who has not committed a crime. That is simply not consonant with the traditions of justice in this country, whether defined by the civil or the criminal rules. In those circumstances, I should like to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08042358000175"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in some respects, this amendment follows on from those that we have just discussed. In the debate on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, I indicated that one problem that we have with the concept of the violent offender order&#151;quite apart from just being sceptical about the whole nature of it&#151;is its broad reach. The risk of serious violent harm which is intended to be addressed by the order could affect,</p>
<ul><a name="08042358000247"></a>&#147;the public in the United Kingdom, or ... any particular members of the public in the United Kingdom&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042358000188"></a>Just stating those words shows how broad the scope is of the offender order created by Clause 96.</p>

<a name="80423-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08042379000002"></a>One of my concerns was that if you had a broad area of protection, the nature of the order that a magistrates&#146; court might impose could in itself be excessively broad to deal with that. In many respects that has been addressed by the amendment just passed by the House and, therefore, that kind of concern no longer exists, given the definitive restrictions and prohibitions which can now be attached to a violent offender order. I believe that it is important to narrow it down further because it is still very wide in its application, and if we are to create an order of this nature, it is important that we identify more specifically and more directly to whom the risk of violence is directed. We acknowledge that there may well be cases where a single person or a group of identifiable individuals could be considered to be at risk of serious harm from the person against whom this order would be directed. In those circumstances, it might be reasonable to provide them with additional legal protection.</p>

<a name="80423-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08042379000003"></a>As I understand the situation, the non-molestation order is limited in scope and reliant on the person, himself or herself, going to court to seek the protection of such an order, whereas the structure of the violent offender order is that the police would take the initiative if there had been a pattern of behaviour which had triggered that particular concern. Therefore, I commend the amendment to your Lordships' House. I believe that it further defines the nature of the violent offender order in general. I beg to move.</p>

For example,  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1555"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1555</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a person could have a history of starting fights with strangers in parks when drunk or of attacking a certain ethnic group. It would be impossible to specify exactly who that person might attack even though the potential perpetrator was clearly posing a risk. While sympathising with the principle, we have some difficulties with the way in which the principle has worked its way through into the detail of the noble Lord&#146;s draft.</p>

The effect of this amendment would be that violent offender orders could not be used to protect the wider public from the risk of serious violent harm. As the House knows, the purpose of those orders is to provide a means of protecting the public at large from the risk of serious violent harm by a dangerous individual.</p>

<a name="80423-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08042379000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, is correct that this risk will sometimes be targeted at a specific individual or individuals within the public and therefore that the person in need of protection will be easily identifiable. However, as I have made clear before, there will be times when this is not the case. As the noble Lord mentioned, we have powers available to protect named individuals from harm in terms of non-molestation orders. He is correct to say that those have to be asked for by the person involved, or by members of his family, to put them into force.</p>

<a name="80423-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08042379000007"></a>Statistics show that in 2005-06, 46 per cent of victims of violence&#151;about half&#151;did not actually know their attacker. To my mind, this statistic is evidence enough that it will not always be possible to identify a specific individual who is at risk of serious violent harm, a point well made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. Instead, there will be times when this risk is targeted at a wider group of individuals; for example, in a pub or in the case of hate-related crime, and times when it is simply not possible to predict any individual target. We must not close our eyes to the cruel reality of violence that exists on our streets and in our communities. Just because a risk does not exist against one specific named individual, it does not mean that such a risk does not exist at all. </p>

<a name="80423-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08042379000008"></a>I am certain that everyone in the Chamber will be able to think back to at least one violent unpremeditated attack on an innocent member of the public within the past year. There have sadly been a number of such attacks reported by the media. Worse still, following such attacks, the media have often reported&#151;and it is subsequently found to be true&#151;that the attackers were known to pose a risk of serious violence but that nothing could be done or was done to manage that risk. That understandably causes huge public concern.

I believe that the public expect that of us as a Government. I agree that we must be able to protect specific individuals from serious violent harm when we know that such a risk exists. However, we must also be able to protect the wider public. Violent offender orders, as currently provided for, enable us to do this. We have a duty to protect the public and it would be highly damaging to narrow the scope of the violent offender orders. I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

As I indicated in my opening remarks, the amendment which has just been passed by your Lordships&#146; House reduces some of the concerns which motivated the terms of this amendment. It now will not be possible to have very wide-ranging conditions attached which could offend Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

There is real fear in some of our communities. The House is properly exercising its role as a revising Chamber by highlighting its concerns in relation to violent offender orders so that we can together develop the most robust system for tackling violence and protecting our public.</p>

I hope that as a result of these changes and the others that we shall come to shortly, the House will be ready to acknowledge the value of violent offender orders as a whole.

I emphasise that I am proposing 10 years from the expiry of a sentence, not 10 years from conviction. The purpose is to establish a significant period in which the person has had an opportunity to re-establish good character and has not fallen foul of the criminal law.

<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08042379000031"></a>In his letter to my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford, the Minister gave an example of   


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1559"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1559</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>circumstances when, even after a period of time, the order might be legitimately sought. He cited someone who had committed a crime of attempted murder in 1993 following a two-day drinking binge. The sentence was given before the introduction of the public protection sentences&#151;there was no statutory management for ongoing supervision after the completion of a sentence. The letter continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="08042379000108"></a>&#147;In early 2008, the police were receiving various complaints about the individual&#146;s behaviour from his neighbours who had reported that he was often very drunk and had been acting in an extremely threatening way to them. In particular, one neighbour reported to the police that he often banged on people&#146;s doors in the neighbourhood in the middle of the night and shouted threats of violence. The police had also received complaints from the owner of the local pub who said that the individual&#146;s behaviour had dramatically worsened over recent months and he was often ejected from the pub for provoking fights with other drinkers ... Over the last few months, the man&#146;s behaviour had concerned public authorities enough to conclude that he now posed a risk of serious violent harm. We would want a Violent Offender Order to be an available tool to protect the public from the risk of serious violence&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80423-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08042379000032"></a>I acknowledge that it is always difficult when giving examples, but that was given in a letter to justify the circumstances of someone who had had a conviction in the past but had not had one in the intervening 15 years. Prima facie, there appear to be a number of specific crimes in that example, such as acting in a threatening way towards neighbours, banging on people&#146;s doors in the middle of the night, shouting threats of violence and being ejected from a pub for provoking fights with others. That leads to a profound concern. In an earlier debate when the Minister gave an example of someone being punched at a trade union meeting, the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, said that if it is a crime, it is a crime. It should be treated as such and we should not use the back door of civil procedure to try in some way to get round the provisions of the criminal law.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08042379000033"></a>Why would the authorities use the violent offender order rather than go down the route of criminal procedure? They may be concerned that they would not have sufficient evidence. I read the exchanges in Committee on 5 March, when the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72"></a><a name="08042379000109"></a>&#147;Either a crime has been committed or it has not. If it has not been committed, for heaven&#146;s sake what are these orders for?&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/3/08; col. 1173.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042379000097"></a>He was saying the criminal law was the place to deal with this.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08042379000098"></a>In response, the Minister said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73"></a><a name="08042379000110"></a>&#147;We are talking about going into a pub and people saying that a crime has been committed and being prepared to talk about it. However, I am afraid that there are areas in our country where people will not do that. People will not come forward, as they are scared&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 5/3/08; col. 1173.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042379000099"></a>I recognise that that is a legitimate concern, but he is basically saying that there might not be any evidence to prosecute a crime, so the civil procedure will be used which does not necessarily have the requirements of the criminal law to establish that a person should be convicted. Perhaps a later amendment might address that.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1560"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1560</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80423-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08042379000034"></a>The other possibility is that an argument might be made that drunkenness in the middle of the night might not attract the kind of penalty or sentence that could possibly be applied by a restriction attached to a violent offender order. I find that disturbing as well because it would mean that rather than having the appropriate punishment that would follow from conviction for a specific crime, a more restrictive order on behaviour could be imposed. We are going dangerously close to a breach of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights because we are talking about people who have been convicted in the past having an additional punishment added at a later date.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08042379000035"></a>The other fundamental reason why I am concerned about circumstances where someone has led a life that has not attracted a conviction for a lengthy period of time and where no crime has been committed is that it opens the door to broadening this beyond people who have been convicted in the past. In response to the previous debate, the noble Lord, Lord West, referred to the importance of not exposing the public to the risk of violent harm. He did not qualify his response, but a risk under these orders is a risk of violent harm from someone who has already been convicted of a serious criminal offence as set out in the Bill. If a pattern of behaviour by A, who had a conviction 20 years ago, justifies a violent offender order, how long will it be before a Government come back to Parliament and say, &#147;We&#146;ve already got it for someone who committed an offence and was convicted 20 years ago&#151;for the sake of argument&#151;why shouldn&#146;t it also apply to people who have never committed an offence?&#148;? If in two identical patterns of behaviour one can attract a violent offender order and the other cannot, I can imagine a Minister standing up in future to say that that is illogical and therefore violent offender orders should be extended to people who have never had a criminal conviction. At that stage, we would be imposing restrictions on people who have not committed an offence in the past and who have not committed one then. Giving any Government or public authority the power to impose restrictions on people when no offence has been committed is a very worrying development. I do not think it is beyond imagination that at some stage in future someone could make that argument. We should not be putting in place building blocks for a further encroachment on civil liberties in future. On those grounds, I beg to move.</p>

There must be some limit to the time following the serving of a sentence when a VOO can be imposed. If there is no limit, for the rest of someone&#146;s life&#151;it could be 20 or 30 years&#151;there is always the possibility that a penalty might be imposed; not for committing another offence but simply because of an assertion that there is a real risk that he might commit some other offence. That is fundamentally wrong.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08042379000037"></a>We can have an argument about what the limitation period should be. We believe that 10 years is an adequate time. For that reason we are strongly with the noble Lord, Lord Wallace.</p>

That cannot be right. It goes against every single tradition of the liberty of the subject, which for time immemorial we and our ancestors have fought for. It is so precious that we should resist any encroachments on it with all the power that we have. I support what the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said.</p>

We are not going to have magistrates&#146; courts any more; we are going to have magistrates&#146; and risk managers&#146; courts. When you go to the Crown Court, you turn right if it is suggested that you have committed an offence or left to the risk manager. There will be a judge in the court and a risk manager who specialises in this sort of thing. The risk manager will not be concerned with whether you have committed an offence but with whether you might possibly, at some time in future, commit an offence.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08042379000040"></a>The point my noble friend was making was that using this type of civil procedure, which is extraneous to the criminal justice system of this country, means that a policeman can go into the witness box and say, &#147;Three or four people came up to me in this pub and said that X was threatening. They are not prepared to come along and tell you themselves. They are not prepared to face cross-examination, but I am giving you hearsay evidence, which under the civil procedure I am entitled to do, that this person is a risk to society&#148;. That is removing from the picture the complainant who refuses to be identified and replacing him. I suppose we will soon have risk manager&#146;s officers, like coroner&#146;s officers, who will go around the country picking up rumours from here and there and bringing people before the risk managers for them to be subject to this sort of regime.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08042379000041"></a>It is not a light regime: the order can last from two years to five years. Fortunately, as a result of the amendment we have just passed, the restrictions have some limitation placed on them, but not necessarily a great deal. Let us think where we are taking the criminal justice system. My noble friend&#146;s amendment at least removes from that risk people who committed offences 10 years ago, who would be regarded as rehabilitated in every other aspect of the criminal justice system. We are here week after week talking about rehabilitation. That is what we want prisons to do and we hope that they will have some effect. However, under this legislation because of risk management a person&#146;s past can be brought up and orders made when he has not committed an offence. I wholly support my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

He is here to answer questions from Members of the House, not to look pained. He talked about &#147;the man who is a risk&#148;. What is being alleged is that we will include the man who is, on hearsay evidence, thought to be a risk. There is a very major difference between the two.</p>

That is part of the process.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08042379000046"></a>Violent offender orders are intended to protect the public from individuals who are considered to pose a risk of serious violent harm. We know that risk is a highly dynamic and complex concept, presenting itself in different ways, depending on the risky individual and the context in which he or she may be operating. For example, we have already discussed today how the risk of serious violent harm may be targeted at a specific individual or at the wider public. We also know that in some circumstances an individual may commit a violent crime once and never present a risk of serious violent harm again. In other cases, an individual&#146;s risk level may fluctuate over time depending on a variety of influences.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08042379000047"></a>What does all that tell us? Simply that our approach to risk management must be sufficiently flexible to allow for those nuances and complexities. Violent offender orders, as currently provided for, give us exactly that flexibility. They allow the court to target management and supervision to the specific risk of the individual and to the quite proper needs of the public. Let us be very clear that violent offender orders will only ever be made on the basis of an up-to-date risk assessment and only when the risk of an individual in the present day is considered to be sufficiently high to warrant further management or supervision. Whether an individual completed their sentence two years ago or 20 years ago is therefore, arguably, irrelevant. All that matters in this consideration is current risk.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08042379000048"></a>Government Amendment No. 99A, which we discussed earlier, makes that as clear as possible in the Bill. We need to be able to manage any current risk of serious violent harm, regardless of how it presents itself. That is why we remain unwilling to restrict the definition of a qualifying offender to those who have completed their sentence within the past 10 years, as to do that would mean that we would be unable to manage and supervise individuals whom we know are capable of committing a serious violent offence and who continue to or again present such a risk. It would be highly inappropriate knowingly to leave the public exposed to the risk of serious violent harm. It is for those reasons that we continue to resist the amendments. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

As has been said by other contributors to this debate, there is a period beyond which&#151;the very word rehabilitation was used&#151;it might be reasonable to ask that rehabilitation be allowed to take place.</p>

He said that he does not matter whether the conviction was two years ago, 10 years ago or 20 years ago. It is not much of a step from that to say that there never was a conviction but that there is a pattern of behaviour that is giving risk. We are going down a very slippery road and I do not believe that this House should be providing a building block for a future Administration to take us to the foot of the slippery slope. I therefore wish to test the opinion of the House on this matter.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08042379000061"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall also speak to the Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations 2008. Both sets of regulations implement EC directives and are being made under Section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08042379000062"></a>The consumer protection regulations implement the unfair commercial practices directive. The regulations prohibit traders in all sectors from engaging in unfair commercial practices with consumers. Commercial practices are acts or omissions by a trader directly connected to the promotion, sale or supply of products to or from consumers. The regulations will operate flexibly to catch unfair practices. At their heart is a prohibition on the use of unfair commercial practices. A commercial practice is unfair if it amounts to conduct below a level that may be expected towards consumers in accordance with honest market practice or good faith. This is intended to act as safety-net protection for all consumers.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08042379000063"></a>This broad category of unfair commercial practices is supplemented with more specific categories concerning misleading actions and omissions and aggressive practices. The vast majority of practices that would be considered unfair would fall under these provisions. For a practice to be unfair under these rules, it must harm, or be likely to harm, the economic interests of the average consumer&#151;in effect, they make a choice that they would not otherwise have made.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08042379000064"></a>The normal benchmark for determining the likely effect of a practice is the average consumer. However, where a practice is targeted at particular groups of consumers, or is likely to adversely affect the economic behaviour of only a clearly identifiable group of vulnerable consumers in a way that the trader could reasonably foresee, the average member of this group is the one who becomes the benchmark against which the effect of the practice will be assessed.</p>

<a name="80423-0010.htm_para24"></a>

<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80423-0011.htm"/>



<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08042379000065"></a>The regulations also ban 31 specific practices in all circumstances, irrespective of whether they may affect consumers&#146; economic behaviour. These include prize-draw scams, bogus closing-down sales, and preying on elderly people&#146;s fears about their personal security to sell them burglar alarms. The prohibition on the use of unfair commercial practices will be enforceable through the procedure for the enforcement of Community infringements in Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002.  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1566"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1566</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>This enables the Office of Fair Trading, Trading Standards, and designated&#151;mainly sectoral&#151;enforcers such as Ofgem to apply to the courts for enforcement orders to prevent or stop the use of unfair commercial practices.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08042379000066"></a>In addition, with limited exceptions, a breach of the prohibition on unfair commercial practices will be a criminal offence. Most of the offences follow the general approach of strict liability, which requires proof only that a commercial practice is prohibited. However, there will be no offence merely because a commercial practice falls within the broad category of those falling below honest market practice or good faith, unless the trader knowingly or recklessly engages in this conduct. This is because of the wide-ranging nature of this category.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08042379000067"></a>The Office of Fair Trading and Trading Standards will have a duty to enforce the regulations. However, where there are effective systems of self-regulation, such as those administered by the Advertising Standards Authority and PhonepayPlus, we would usually expect complaints to be referred to them in the first place for action, as established means under both these regulations and the business protection regulations. A supplementary objective in transposing the directive was to achieve some regulatory simplification, where that was possible without reducing consumer protection. The consumer protection regulations repeal provisions in a number of laws, including most of the Trade Descriptions  Act 1968 and the provisions on misleading price indications in Part III of the Consumer Protection Act 1987.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08042379000068"></a>The consumer protection regulations represent the biggest change to the UK consumer protection framework for almost 40 years. They will put in place a more comprehensive framework for tackling sharp practices and rogue traders who exploit loopholes in the existing prescriptive legislation. They will also deliver a big part of BERR&#146;s simplification plan. This is a good law for both consumers and honest businesses. Consumers will obtain better protection from unfair practices. Honest businesses will no longer have to face unfair competition from traders who use underhand tactics. The changes will also simplify consumer protection, making it clear which commercial practices are, and are not, allowed.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08042379000069"></a>I turn to the second instrument under discussion today. The business protection regulations implement the 2006 misleading and comparative advertising directive. That directive consolidated the previous 1984 directive on the subject with amendments made to it by other directives, including the UCPD. The previous 1984 directive is currently implemented by the Control of Misleading Advertising Regulations 1988, which will be repealed by the consumer protection regulations.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08042379000070"></a>The business protection regulations prohibit advertising that misleads traders and set out the conditions under which comparative advertising is permitted. Comparative advertising is advertising that identifies a competitor or a competitor&#146;s product. A trader who engages in advertising which misleads traders will be guilty of a criminal offence. The OFT and Trading Standards have a duty to enforce the

Those enforcement authorities are given the power to apply to the courts for injunctions to secure compliance with the regulations. Making misleading advertising a criminal offence, and giving Trading Standards a duty to enforce the regulations, will ensure that there is no reduction in business protection following the repeal of certain laws, such as most of the Trade Descriptions Act, which protects businesses as well as consumers.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08042379000081"></a>We ought to register the concern that a year ago we had the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act, under which these regulations are laid. They are serious regulations that impose criminal offences on people, leading to two years&#146; imprisonment for people who are in breach of both sets of regulations. From these Benches I have long argued, in relation to consumer legislation, that there ought to be a prohibition on unfair commercial practices, and I feel, although this is not a point I often make, that this ought to be dealt with by primary legislation rather than by regulation. After all, we are not in a position to amend these regulations; either we throw them out, which I do not propose to do this evening and I know the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, will not, or we approve them. The imposition of a prohibition on unfair commercial practices, which from these Benches we have long argued for, coupled with significant repeals of Trades Descriptions Act legislation, is an important point, and I fail to understand why the Government, knowing that the directive was going to come out, could not have postponed the legislation on the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act until it had.</p>

That is my point. It seems to me that that would have been better dealt with in primary legislation rather than forcing us into the position where we cannot amend, but only turn down or approve.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08042379000084"></a>My second substantive point is on the difficulty in which I find myself. Noble Lords will have received representations from <I>Which?</I>, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, refers to as, &#147;Oh God&#148;. I have never thought of it in any divine capacity. It has made a sensible point, which should be the subject of debate. If these regulations are passed, which I support, and if an individual or a business has been subjected to an unfair commercial practice, why do the regulations not permit that individual or business to get out of the contract which they have been induced to enter into as a result of that unfair commercial practice?</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08042379000085"></a>It is a perfectly sensible point, which should be subject to debate. We cannot amend the regulations, so those people who might be persuaded that that is a good point have only the option to object to the regulations&#151;which we do not object to. It seems that all the Government can do, if this is a serious point, is monitor the effect of the regulations, see how many cases in practice are uncovered where people ought to be allowed relief from onerous contracts imposed as a result of unfair commercial practices, and then bring back new regulations. Going back to my first point, that seems to be an unsatisfactory way to deal with this issue.</p>

I join this debate primarily as the chairman of the Advertising Standards Authority and, in that role, I give a warm welcome to these two instruments. The Government have succeeded in implementing the European directive skilfully and in aligning business-to-business provisions alongside that. The directive of course primarily deals with business-to-consumer issues. They also have found the right sort of balance between protecting the interests of the consumer and the interests of legitimate business.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08042379000087"></a>The Advertising Standards Authority is the UK&#146;s self-regulatory body for regulating advertisements appearing in all forms of media. For the past 45 years it has been responsible for upholding standards in advertising and for ensuring that consumers are protected from misleading and unfair advertisements. On the whole, it has done a pretty good job, including under the distinguished tenure, as chairman, of my noble friend Lord Borrie, from whom I took over some nine or 10 months ago.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08042379000088"></a>The ASA has been fully engaged with the Government, the Office of Fair Trading and consumer organisations in the discussions around the putting together of these two instruments. We have found the Government&#146;s approach to be inclusive and constructive. We welcome the regulations. Under the existing consumer protection regime, the ASA is  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1570"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1570</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>regarded as the &#147;established means&#148; for enforcing the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988 and, where appropriate, we co-ordinate our work with the Office of Fair Trading to ensure that standards are maintained. Noble Lords may have noticed that in the past week we have had occasion, with some reluctance, to refer one particular airline to the Office of Fair Trading for consistent breaches of the advertising codes.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="08042379000089"></a>The ASA is very pleased to have had its status confirmed in both these sets of regulations as the &#147;established means&#148; for protecting consumers from misleading and unfair advertising. In doing that, the regulations acknowledge the important role that the self-regulatory ASA plays in protecting UK consumers and in maintaining a level playing field for business. The ASA responds to more than 24,000 complaints each year and conducts proactive monitoring and compliance work to ensure that advertisements are compliant with the advertising codes, regardless of whether or not a complaint is received. This generally leads to around 2,500 advertisements being changed or withdrawn each year as a result of ASA action.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08042379000090"></a>The advertising self-regulatory system is an excellent example of better regulation at work. Our work on misleading advertising means that many cases do not have to be dealt with by the courts or by statutory regulators&#151;indeed, trading standards officers currently refer quite a number of cases to us. This is an important point because our work saves the public purse a good deal of money: the advertising self-regulatory system is funded by industry via a levy on advertising space. The ASA is not only an example of better regulation but also a strong supporter of the Government&#146;s better regulation agenda. We are encouraged that this agenda appears to have been followed in constructing these regulations.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08042379000091"></a>However, I have to ask my noble friend one question. The better regulation agenda makes clear that enforcement action should be proportionate to the risk posed, but that is not entirely clear from the regulations, which touches on the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall. In the light of this, will the Government be able to confirm that it is their intention that enforcers of these regulations should follow Hampton principles when enforcing the regulations and so use the most appropriate mechanism to achieve compliance? Specifically, will the Government confirm that enforcers should normally seek to escalate their compliance action from low-level intervention and retain criminal enforcement for only the most serious of cases?</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08042379000092"></a>Certainly, in the case of advertising, this would lead to more frequent use of the ASA. Loath as I am to increase our workload, none the less, we would welcome the role that this would place on us. The reliance on a single regulator will lead to more consistent regulation, thus achieving another Hampton principle. It would also have the added benefit of leaving trading standards officers with more time and resources to pursue serious cases of infringement. The Advertising Standards Authority is very pleased to be recognised in these regulations, welcomes them and would be grateful for the assurance that we have sought from my noble friend.</p>

I should declare an interest as a vice-president of the Institute of Trading Standards because I want to say something about that body of noble men and women up and down the country employed by local authorities to enforce a great many consumer protection measures.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08042379000094"></a>I welcome the comprehensiveness of the regulations before us in prohibiting unfair commercial practices. They are much more all-embracing in terms of dealing with rogue trader activities than was the case in the past. But perhaps I may express some sadness at the passing of older consumer protection measures, especially the Trade Descriptions Act 1968, which has its 40th birthday this year. In the 40 years of its life, trading standards officers throughout the country have been able to prosecute traders for misleading descriptions of goods, services and prices, and during this period it has been a most useful measure. I do not think there should be any condemnation of it just because its time has passed. It is now being absorbed into something larger, and although the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, does not like things to be absorbed into things that are larger, in this case, whatever she says about the National Consumer Council, she has not disagreed with the broad nature of the new regulations.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08042379000095"></a>As the Explanatory Notes state, the unfair consumer practices directive, which underlines these regulations, will strengthen consumer protection considerably and improve cross-border trade by making it a good deal easier for consumers from all parts of the Community to shop all over the Community with the greater confidence that is so desirable. The duty of enforcement on the Office of Fair Trading and trading standards officers and their continuing ability to prosecute in the criminal courts is invaluable. But as the noble Baroness and the noble Lord on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench know very well because they have been taking an active part in the debates on the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill, these powers of prosecution under the criminal law are to be combined with civil sanctions. That is useful because criminal proceedings and the stigma of criminal conviction are often not warranted, so the greater flexibility of the new Bill is highly desirable. I am sure that they, as I do, look forward to the Third Reading of the Bill in this House on Monday next.</p>

<a name="80423-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08042379000096"></a>OFT research shows that the losses suffered by consumers as a result of defective goods, inadequate redress and poor information run to some &#163;8 billion a year, not taking account of the emotional costs and stress that may be suffered. Needless to say, low income consumers are particularly vulnerable. The only question I have for my noble friend the Minister is this: can he ensure that the enforcement offices I have referred to, the Office of Fair Trading and trading standards officers of the local authorities, will be adequately resourced to carry out their more wide-ranging and useful consumer protection and business protection duties in the future?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08042386000007"></a>I declare an interest as chief executive of the Advertising Association, and as such the chief executive of an association which represents all parts of the advertising industry: the advertising agencies; media owners, broadcast and non-broadcast; as well as the advertisers. In fact, it is our members who fund the self-regulatory system, the Advertising Standards Authority, albeit very much at arm&#146;s length.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08042386000008"></a>The Advertising Association has engaged fully over the past couple of years in the process undertaken by the Government of transposing and implementing into UK law the unfair commercial practices directive and reimplementing the misleading and comparative advertising directive in the form of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations and the Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations respectively. They have broad implications for business to consumer and business to business advertising in the UK. Indeed, the Advertising Association, as an interested party, has engaged at various times in the past at the European level in the development of both the directives from which the regulations being debated this evening derive. I thank the Minister for reaffirming in his opening remarks the status of the ASA and PayPhone Plus as &#147;established means&#148; for the purposes of both the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations and the Business Protection from Misleading Marketing Regulations. The ASA has enjoyed &#147;established means&#148; status for many years, and so I am pleased that the noble Lord has stated for the record that the authority will retain this status with the coming into force of these new regulations. The Minister&#146;s statement serves to provide certainty and continuity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08042386000009"></a>I am also grateful for the Minister&#146;s comments about the pursuit of best regulatory practice generally and in the context of these new regulations specifically. It is important that between now and  26 May, businesses both large and small continue to familiarise themselves with the implications for them of the new regulations in both business to consumer and business to business contexts. To assist the process of familiarisation, it is essential that the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and bodies such as the Office of Fair Trading continue their own ongoing programmes of educating

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08042386000010"></a>Finally, I look to the Minister to provide comfort that one longstanding UK marketing practice that is extremely popular with consumers will continue to be acceptable under the new legislative regime that comes into being next month. I speak of the &#147;buy one get one free&#148; offers, or to use what sounds like rather unparliamentary language&#151;forgive me, but I have been looking forward to this&#151;BOGOFs. Such offers are extremely popular with consumers here in the UK; indeed we have all seen them. In my view, it would be a great pity for both marketers and consumers if any interpretation could be placed on the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations whereby such offers and similar marketing practices could be considered in breach of them. I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to provide comfort on this subject when he winds up the debate.</p>

He looks a lot younger to me after an hour of this debate. Following in the steps of the noble Baroness, I need to declare my chairmanship of both the existing and new National Consumer Council.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08042386000012"></a>I welcome these regulations. While on behalf of consumers and others I have had doubts about some aspects of the better regulation agenda&#151;some of which seem directed more at reducing the burden on business than on protecting consumers or the environment&#151;in this case it has managed both to reduce the burden on business and to extend and simplify protection for consumers. That consists of two parts: first, the nature of the directive, in which the UK Government were very involved, has a principled-based objective&#151;it is the kind of thing we like to see come out of Brussels&#151;and, secondly, the transposition has removed a great deal of detailed regulation from the statute book. Consumers should benefit from this good example of better regulatory practice.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08042386000013"></a>I had two reservations. The one in relation to the effectiveness of the resourcing of the TSOs has been covered already by my noble friend Lord Borrie. My second point, however, is that this is all very well&#151;it provides simplification for consumers and should give them more power and more ability to enforce their rights&#151;but none of it is very good if they do not know about it. It must be incumbent on the Government to ensure that there is effective consumer education and information in this area. Some information is beginning to go to business and I understand that consumer education is coming, but it will have to be on a fairly wide basis. After all, a lot of people vaguely know about the Trade Descriptions Act, but I doubt whether there is one in a thousand consumers out there who knows about these regulations. We need to turn that round within a matter of months and I would welcome some assurance that the Minister&#146;s department has this in hand. Otherwise I very much welcome these regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08042386000015"></a>Let me start with the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, particularly on the issue of international uniformity. This is a problem which we face in many areas but this minimum or maximum directive has to be written across international legislation&#151;it cannot be embellished&#151;and this gives it a better chance of a uniform introduction across the Community. The European Court of Justice will have a responsibility for ensuring a consistent approach and the Commission is chairing a series of working groups on transposition and consistent enforcement which, it is to be hoped, will ensure the kind of uniformity the noble Baroness seeks. Certainly the Government have the same aspiration.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08042386000016"></a>On small and medium enterprises, we agree they are important and share the concern that the publicity and guidance should be on a particularly grand scale in order to reach such enterprises, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty said. However, the regulations are intrinsically simpler than all the laws they replace, which is very important. It was a mighty task to incorporate in these regulations a comprehensive knowledge of the predecessor laws and we commend the people who did it. Now we have a single concept of fairness and specific examples of regulations which can be seen on one or two pages. I hope that business will find these regulations easier to understand and easier to comply with.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08042386000017"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the regulator, the OFT, and the local regulators, trading standards, will have sufficient resource. In both cases we believe that their current resource will be sufficient because of the change from many laws to a simple law. The Government are not convinced that the implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive will create new burdens on either the OFT or local authorities. It will replace many existing legislative provisions which trading standards authorities had the duty to enforce. We accept that the regulations also contain new protections which will need to be enforced but, beyond the need for training on these new rules, which the Government are funding, we do not believe they should inevitably lead to additional enforcement costs. Rather they will provide local authorities with a greater flexibility to prioritise their enforcement work and to tackle areas causing maximum consumer detriment and will provide more effective and flexible sets of enforcement options.</p>

<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1575"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1575</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but there is a burden on us in these circumstances to have extremely comprehensive consultation leading up to the publication of regulations. We believe that that has happened in this case. Noble Lords referred to some of those consultations and how the regulations have been improved as a result of it. This has led to a recognition that enforcement must be proportional. While it is quite true that these regulations make the criminal law more capable of being involved in their enforcement, the Government&#146;s whole theme is a proportional approach.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08042386000020"></a>On the issue of individual rights of redress, consumers already have extensive private law rights in contract and in tort. Nevertheless, the Government accept that providing a private right of redress in relation to the regulations could clarify existing consumer rights. It would enhance consumer rights in areas where the regulations provide new or improved protection&#151;for instance, in relation to aggressive commercial practices&#151;and should stimulate traders to greater compliance with the law.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08042386000021"></a>However, we are concerned that adopting a private right of action for the regulations might have unintended and adverse consequences by potentially providing consumers with an undesirable attitude to sue traders and by impacting on the law of misrepresentation. The Government have therefore asked the Law Commission to undertake a project to consider how far a private right of redress for unfair commercial practices would simplify and extend consumer law.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08042386000022"></a>On the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Smith, on the Advertising Standards Authority, I can confirm that the Government would expect enforcers to secure compliance with the regulations in accordance with Hampton principles of targeted and proportionate enforcement in line with the regulator&#146;s compliance code. The investigative powers in the regulations do not distinguish between criminal and civil outcomes so as to not predetermine how the breach will be tackled. This will enable enforcers to choose the remedies appropriate to the particular case. There will be clearly a case for criminal prosecutions in the most serious breaches, but the Government would encourage enforcers to use the full range of remedies, including advice and information, established means such as the Advertising Standards Authority and civil remedies. We strongly believe that where good practice has been established, particularly by the Advertising Standards Authority, these regulations should use and build on that good practice.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08042386000023"></a>It is absolutely the point that the regulations in general are all-embracing&#151;and I thank my noble friend Lord Borrie for bringing it out. They start from a general concept and then move to specifics for certainty in clear cases. That is their strength. These are great regulations. In some ways, I could not have had better regulations to start on, because they are so centrally valuable, representing the most important change in nearly 40 years in this area. But this is not a statement that former bodies have failed; they have done great service over many years. It is saying that basically, because of the European regulations, we have had to look at our own scope. So we can take the  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1576"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1576</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>best practice, put it in these regulations, build on it and get a unified approach. We thank the former bodies for their contributions so far; as we have said, some of them will be used in the proportionate approach.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08042386000024"></a>I touched on the point about ensuring resources. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, that it will be important for businesses both large and small to continue to familiarise themselves with the implications of the new regulations. To assist this process of familiarisation, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is working with the Office of Fair Trading to educate businesses, consumers and enforcers in the run-up to, and in the months following, the coming into force of the two sets of regulations being debated this evening. This will include the distribution of pamphlets to more than 700,000 businesses, making them aware of their responsibilities under the new regulations.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08042386000025"></a>In addition, the department has produced a communications toolkit for all business stakeholders, alerting them to the introduction of the new regulations and explaining how to publicise them to their members. A major public relations campaign designed to raise long-term awareness in consumers will be aimed at national and regional press and broadcasters as well as the many consumer titles in the marketplace. I am sure that that will bring out the differences. The predecessor legislation was aimed at the world being fair and the regulations are aimed at the world being fair. I hope that businesses will see this as an evolving thing rather than just asking them to scrap their mindset and start again.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08042386000026"></a>It is so tempting to use the acronym. On the matter of &#147;buy one get one free&#148; offers and free gifts with purchases, I agree these are well established marketing practices in the UK and not in themselves misleading. We do not believe that the specific prohibited practice relating to the use of the description &#147;free&#148; will prevent the use of the word &#147;free&#148; in these cases. This is because the unavoidable cost of responding to the commercial practice is the cost of buying the product&#151;the one item in the case of &#147;buy one get one free&#148; or, say, the magazine with which the free gift comes. The area in which there may be some intrusion is with bundling situations, when part of the bundle is described as free when in practice there is an expense in acquiring the larger bundle.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="08042386000027"></a>I thank noble Lords for being so kind in letting me present these regulations. The consumer protection regulations make an excellent new law that will protect millions of people in outlawing a host of misleading and intimidating sales practices that are all too often used to back consumers into a corner. The new protections will make life a lot tougher for rogues and make it easier for legitimate businesses to operate. Simplifying the consumer framework will make it easier for businesses, enforcers and consumers to understand. The business protection regulations will ensure that this does not lead to any reduction in business protection. I commend the regulations to the House.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08042386000039"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, government Amendment No. 99F relates to the process that the courts must follow when making a violent offender order, and to the rights of the individual in respect of whom an application for a violent offender order is being made. The effect of the amendment is that the individual in respect of whom an application is being made has the right to be heard at the point of an application being considered, not just at the point of renewal or variation of an order as currently provided for.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08042386000040"></a>Amendment No. 101 also relates to the process that the courts must follow when making a violent offender order. This amendment would require that violent offender orders are not made without a full  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1578"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1578</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>adversarial hearing. The effect of this amendment would be that some of the criminal fairness guarantees in Article 6 would be applied to violent offender orders, particularly in relation to the cross-examination of witnesses.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08042386000041"></a>I understand that through his amendment the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, seeks to address two issues. The first is to ensure that all individuals in respect of whom an application for a violent offender order is made are treated fairly&#151;quite rightly so&#151;and appropriately throughout the application process. I assure the House that we fully support that proposition. The second issue is to follow the recommendation of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and apply the fairness guarantees for criminal matters set out in Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights to violent offender orders. This would suggest that violent offender orders are criminal rather than civil in nature. I understand that that has been part of the debate we have had over the past few weeks on the issue. In particular, the amendment seeks to ensure that a violent offender order is not made without a full adversarial hearing, including the opportunity for the individual in respect of whom the application has been made to appear before the court and to cross-examine witnesses.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08042386000042"></a>Before outlining my practical concerns with the amendment, I should make clear that violent offender orders are not criminal measures&#151;I am sure the House is aware of that&#151;they are civil, and as such do not have to comply with the criminal fairness guarantees in Article 6.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08042386000043"></a>That said, I am very sympathetic to the noble Earl&#146;s wish for an individual in respect of whom an application is being made to have the opportunity to appear before the court at the point of application, and not just at the point of variation or renewal&#151;I reinforce that point. The government amendment achieves that. By giving the individual the opportunity to appear before the court, the amendment also ensures that he or she would be able to cross-examine any witnesses present.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08042386000044"></a>My main concern with the noble Earl&#146;s amendment is in relation to the issue of which witnesses would be required to be present at the hearing, the evidence that could be used, and, in particular, the use of hearsay evidence. As this amendment would provide some of the criminal fairness guarantees set out in Article 6 of the ECHR, my concern is that it would suggest that violent offender orders are criminal rather than civil in nature. It is essential that violent offender orders are treated as civil in nature, in part so that hearsay evidence can be used. I know that that view is not universally shared but there is a very good reason for it. Violent offender orders are intended to apply only to the most dangerous offenders. Before a violent offender order can be made, public protection agencies must consider an individual to pose a current risk of serious violent harm. We need and want hearsay evidence to be available for use in an application for a violent offender order. This is because there will be times when witnesses will be unwilling or even emotionally unable to be cross-examined. We need to ensure that  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1579"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1579</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>evidence from persons who may feel intimidated from giving evidence directly can still be considered indirectly by the court.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08042386000045"></a>I am keen to reassure the House that we expect hearsay evidence to be used in rare circumstances. In recognition of the seriousness of violent offender orders, and in sympathy with the aims of the amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, we intend to make clear in guidance that hearsay evidence should be used only where necessary and must always be relevant to the matters to be proved. Where an applicant intends to rely on hearsay evidence in court, written notice must always be given in advance of the hearing. Further, it will always be for the magistrate to decide what weight they attach to hearsay evidence.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08042386000046"></a>We also intend to stress in guidance that in practice we want witnesses to attend the court hearing in person, and therefore be cross-examined, wherever possible. The House will be aware that the Government have invested considerable resource into supporting witnesses, and the introduction of witness protection measures such as screens and voice distortion technology supports this. The Government have also committed to strengthen arrangements for victims further as part of their new action plan to tackle violence, which was published on 18 February this year.</p>

<a name="80423-0012.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08042386000047"></a>I agree that we need to make the application process for violent offender orders as fair as possible for the individuals in respect of whom an application has been made. However, we also have a duty to make the process as accessible as possible for witnesses who may feel at risk of serious violent harm from those individuals. I hope that the House will understand the difficult position that this leaves us in and see the changes that we have offered as a fair compromise. Having heard those arguments, I hope that the noble Earl will support the government amendment in lieu of his own. We have gone some way towards his position but there is a serious and proper constraint on how far we can move in that direction. I beg to move.</p>

He cannot cross-examine the witnesses and he can be restricted. If that is not a punishment, I do not know what is. The Government may call it a civil procedure but it is not. It is a civil procedure used to impose punishment. There is no way around this; any restriction on liberty is punishment. If someone says that you cannot go from A to B, or that you have to stay in your house, that is a punishment. It is just the same punishment as saying to a child that they have

It has gone back through Act of Parliament after Act of Parliament over the past 10 years. Of course I will not press my Amendment No. 101, even though I think that it is much, much better. I am pleased that the Government have gone some way to what I am asking for, and I do not want to appear ungracious over it.

I have said in the House before that when I served on the Joint Committee on Human Rights I almost always found myself sitting next to the noble Earl. I was glad to do so, because I came to respect his passionate commitment to the liberty of the individual and its deep roots in the struggle for the social and legal evolution of our nation that has made it what it is. I have listened with some dismay to earlier debates this evening, and certainly on the last amendment I could not bring myself to vote. Having said that, I emphasise that there is a real anxiety that whatever the intentions of the Government, we are seeing the erosion&#151;almost an incremental dismantling&#151;of the very principles on which our system of justice has always been based.</p>

We used to criticise other countries for having adopted systems of administrative law, and we held our system up as the model for the world.

Like him, I am glad that they have felt able to do so. But he is absolutely right that it does not deal with the underlying strategic issue that confronts us. The other point is that in this rush&#151;it is becoming a rush&#151;for the dismantling of law as we have always understood it, we are beginning to make a complete muddle for the lay man as to what is criminal and what is civil. What happens to the whole concept of civil law if we are to say that violence can, when it is convenient, be treated as civil law as distinct from criminal law? The rational, common-sense differences are just being brushed aside.</p>

I am really concerned that history will come to see the processes in which we are currently involved as a major selling of the pass in all that we have understood to be justice in this country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="08042386000061"></a>There is an important debate about Article 6 in relation to VOOs, and it is a live and crucial issue, but it is not germane to Amendment No. 101. That amendment raises the issue of cross-examination, which is fundamental to any trial, whether criminal or civil. Cross-examination is vital to any legal proceeding, because it tests the probative value of the evidence. It is perfectly true that in a civil hearing there is wider scope for hearsay evidence; but hearsay evidence can be subject to cross-examination. So with great respect to the Minister, the issue of hearsay evidence is beside the point. We all accept that if we proceed with VOO hearings on the basis that they are civil proceedings, hearsay evidence will play a bigger part than it would otherwise. But that should not in any way be a constraint to cross-examination for the individual who is likely to be subject to a VOO, in so far as it is capable of being exercised within the limits of hearsay evidence.</p>

<a name="80423-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08042386000062"></a>I do not understand the logic of the Government&#146;s position here. Surely if we accept that hearsay evidence will play a part in VOOs, I see absolutely no problem for the Government in accepting the principle of cross-examination.</p>

Earlier I raised a question as to whether one of the motivations for a VOO was that the default position was no longer the criminal law in circumstances where for generations it would have been the obvious line to go down, and whether the purpose of VOOs was to circumvent the criminal law because, for one reason or another, it is not possible to bring a criminal case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08042386000064"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, made an important point about the heritage and the history of the law. Very often the argument is made: &#147;Well, we are living in different times and are facing different challenges&#148;. But any cursory reading of the novels of Dickens would suggest that London was not exactly a safe place in Victorian times and that violent crime was not unknown in the capital city. Yet those who sat on these Benches 150 years ago would have been appalled at the thought that we were putting to one side the criminal law and bringing in much lesser tests for bringing people to justice for behaviour that society found unacceptable.</p>

<a name="80423-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08042386000065"></a>You do not set aside that heritage and tradition that has been built up for perfectly good and sound reasons as simply as we are being invited to do in our debates this evening. Although the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, does not propose to seek the opinion of the House, he has raised important points. It would be interesting if the Minister could indicate whether the Government believe that the default position should be the use of the criminal law, rather than the use of some civil procedure to get round it. It is a dangerous road that we are travelling down if the criminal law is to be set aside simply because it is not convenient.</p>

My noble friend has gone back to Dickens&#146;s time. I can go back even further, to 1794, when this country was at war with revolutionary France. There was great concern among the ruling classes of this country that revolution would break out in England, and that there might be a threat to the throne and to parliamentary government as it was then known. There was unrest in Ireland and a threat of Ireland being invaded, as indeed happened in 1798. What was the reaction of the Prime Minister, Mr Pitt, to that? First, he suspended habeas corpus. The Duke of Leeds said on that occasion, &#147;We have to suspend habeas corpus because, if we don&#146;t, we won&#146;t have habeas corpus to suspend in the future&#148;. That is one of the more brilliant observations from this Chamber that I can think of. Pitt also passed an Act to suspend the rights of people to meet in numbers of more than 50. In another Act, criticism of the Government became a criminal offence. From our history, you can see how these things happen. Of course Pitt was opposed by Charles Fox and the Radicals. Indeed, the ancestor of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, was a great Whig in his day.</p>

It was exactly the same, except that the threat to this country was far greater then than it is today. There was the threat of invasion and revolution. Pitt&#146;s Government were attacking in particular the corresponding societies, which had outposts in Manchester, Sheffield and elsewhere and were meeting to discuss such terrible things as universal suffrage. That was the situation in which that Government decided to bring in measures of this sort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08042386000069"></a>Today, risk management is central to this Government&#146;s position. I have gone on about it on a previous amendment and I need not repeat what I said. When it comes to legislation to avoid risk, we are in a serious situation. There is risk, but there always is risk of one sort or another in any society. What is it that today demands us, for example, to lock people up for 42 days without trial or to introduce these violent offender orders, which do not go through the ordinary criminal processes? What is so crucial about this point in British history that we throw away all the safeguards that were gradually built into our system, which is exactly what this Government are doing?</p>

<a name="80423-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08042386000070"></a>Historically, the same thing happened, but we got away from it and reintroduced concepts of freedom and liberty, of which we have been proud. The Americans have gone against that tradition by risk managing in Guantanamo Bay. There is also an awful lot of risk managing going on in Mr Mugabe&#146;s regime. I hope by using these examples that the Government will see the direction in which they are going. It is an authoritarian approach to lock people up for fear of what they might do and not for what they actually have done. We on these Benches will continue to fight that for as long as we have breath.</p>

I moved a modest amendment, which helps to address a central concern of noble Lords opposite and in particular an issue raised by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow. Then we have been subjected to a discourse on two centuries of political history in the United Kingdom, all over a matter relating to the way in which violent offender orders might be considered in a civil court and in front of a magistrate. We have been regaled with how authoritarian and draconian these measures are.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08042386000072"></a>I think that noble Lords opposite miss an essential point. It is true that over the past decade or so we have adopted a rather different approach in dealing with social nuisance, anti-social behaviour and episodes of low-level unpleasantness in our communities. Our Government have adopted a consistent programme and approach but at almost every step the Liberal Democrats have been consistent in opposing it. They do not like our use of civil procedures in trying to affect and influence the behaviour of individuals who, even they would probably agree, have been dysfunctional and unpleasant in a community setting and in trying to deal with particular individuals within a community. I am entirely at one with noble Lords opposite in their determination to see that we properly protect civil

<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08042386000073"></a>I wish to make a further point regarding one of the damaging aspects of the argumentation that is sometimes, although not always, used against the Government&#146;s position. By raising the threshold of the argumentation in the way in which some noble Lords do, they devalue the greater argument. That is a very real and current danger, and it is not a good way in which to argue a case that has some merit.</p>

<a name="80423-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08042386000074"></a>We are not trying to get round the criminal law or the use of the criminal law&#151;far from it. We are trying to prevent the commission of criminal acts by individuals who, for one reason or another, exhibit behaviour which I think we all agree is unacceptable. We are not trying to undermine civil liberties and civil rights in so doing. We have absolutely protected the right for there to be a contest of evidence in the civil arena. It is right and proper that we seek to protect that, and of course it is right that evidence will be subject to cross-examination. There will be the opportunity for an adversarial and interactive process of discussion about evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08042386000075"></a>There is an element of risk management here but I think that it is risk management of the right sort. It is to prevent the unpleasant crimes that can happen in our communities and protect individuals. That is the merit of violent offender orders, and that is why we cannot accept the amendment in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Onslow. However, we have moved some way to bring in protections and I am grateful to noble Lords who have at least given the Government credit for doing that.</p>

Amendment No. 102 requires that interim orders must be made only on the basis of prima facie evidence. The effect of the amendment would be that the court could not make an interim order unless satisfied that there was clear evidence to support the application for the main violent offender order. We are content with this proposal and have provided for this in Amendment No. 101D. Amendment No. 101E seeks to ensure that interim orders are not made without hearing the individual in respect of whom the application has been made or at least giving that individual the opportunity to be heard.</p>

It is my understanding that the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, seeks through his amendment to ensure that interim violent offender orders are not made without a clear and justifiable case for such immediate management of an individual considered to pose a risk of serious violent harm. The noble Earl can rest assured that I completely support the intention of that amendment. We feel that it is crucial that the court is able to provide for the immediate risk management of a risky individual to protect the public from serious violent harm, even if the outcome of the main application has not yet been determined. However, we would never expect the court to make an interim order in respect of an individual without evidence that would support the main order and this is what government Amendment No. 101D seeks to achieve. On that basis, I hope that the noble Earl will support the government amendment in lieu of his own.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08042386000098"></a>My commitment today is to bring forward an amendment at Third Reading which requires that an interim order can be made in the absence of the individual in respect of whom the order has been applied for only if the court is satisfied that the individual has been notified of the court hearing date. This would mean that the individual could attend the hearing or make representations on the day if he or she chose so to do. However, as I have already

I am therefore unwilling to require that the court cannot make an interim order without hearing the individual in respect of whom the application has been made, as this could introduce significant delays to the proceedings. Such delays could ultimately leave the public and particular individuals exposed to a risk of serious violence.</p>

I understand that the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, by his amendments, seeks to ensure that interim violent offender orders are not used as a substitute for full violent offender orders, and nor would they be operable indefinitely.</p>

<a name="80423-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08042386000109"></a>We have had a lot of discussion about the purpose of an interim order, which is to provide short-term and immediate protection for the public while the decision on the main application is being made. I shall set out exactly why it is important to provide immediate protection and why the period for which an interim order can be imposed should not be overly restricted.</p>
<a name="time_29"></a>
<a name="80423-0014.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08042386000270"></a>9.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80423-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08042386000110"></a>There will inevitably be occasions when there is a delay to a decision being taken on the main violent offender order. Her Majesty&#146;s Courts Service has indicated that such a delay will typically be at the request of the individual in respect of whom the application has been made in order to secure sufficient time to consider the application fully or to enable attendance at the hearing. This could result in the postponement of a hearing by weeks, or even months, and therefore a possible gap in public protection for the same period. The length of adjournment will obviously vary on a case-by-case basis. The Courts Service has indicated that in the majority of cases it is likely to be in excess of two weeks. However, it has also advised that the court will know the exact time period for which an interim order should apply according to the length of adjournment granted.</p>

<a name="80423-0014.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08042386000111"></a>On this basis, government Amendment No. 102A requires that interim violent offender orders be made for a fixed period of time as specified in each individual order, or until a decision on the main order has been taken, if that is sooner. It also removes the provision to renew interim orders. This will ensure that interim violent offender orders are not used as a substitute for full violent offender orders and that they cannot be applied indefinitely. Other government amendments we have considered today will ensure that an interim order will be made only when the court is satisfied that the application for the main order is likely to be successful. I hope that that explanation will satisfy the House and that the noble Earl will feel that we have made a considerable move in his direction and will be able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

They will be based on much less evidence, as far as I understand them, otherwise they would not be interim. Again, there is no point in dividing the House on this. I wish that the Government had gone further. From what the noble Lord said just now, he and the Government still do not understand the general and persistent assault on the liberties of the subject that they have done and are slowly and gradually beginning to wake up to it.

As I understand it, the Government&#146;s amendment changes interim VOOs from being limited to four weeks but renewable to being unrenewable, but without a specified time limit. The time limit will be set at the time of the making of the order and is intended to be tied to the date the court expects to be able to impose the full VOO. That is the Government&#146;s position as I understand it.</p>

<a name="80423-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08042386000115"></a>Is this really practical? We all know that there are problems about the timing of court hearings and that garnering evidence in the circumstances of assessing a future risk is an extremely complex matter. How can the Government be sure at the time that the time limit is set that it will be adequate for the authorities to assemble all the evidence they will need to make their case at the full hearing? If they are unable to assemble their case at the full hearing, what will they do? They cannot renew the interim order.</p>

<a name="80423-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08042386000116"></a>I hope that the Government will take this observation as being entirely practical, not coming from any particular direction of the political compass.

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08042386000155"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, if I remember rightly, Amendment No. 107 would ensure that children and adults are not suddenly made homeless by the closing of premises. If they are, that will just make the social situation worse. These orders are on the whole made against the more deprived sections of society in the poorer areas where the social problems are much worse than in more prosperous places. We all know about some of these sink estates and the unattractive surroundings, but the damage done to children and girlfriends, wives and partners&#151;whatever they are called now&#151;by their being made homeless must be protected against. This is what the amendment is designed to do. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Earl&#146;s amendment deals with some valid worries. Since Committee, the Government have tabled their amendment, which promises some guidance on this issue. Both the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, have served as councillors in their time, and they will be aware of the sorts of pressures that problem families can bring to bear. Our worry on

We feel that in the cases where they are being used for anti-social behaviour reasons, the very minimum safeguard that there should be is to say that the order should not be a disproportionate response to the disorder or nuisance caused.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08042386000157"></a>The reason why I come back to the experience of noble Lords as local councillors is that they will probably have shared my experience as a councillor of the extreme difficulty caused by neighbour disputes. However excellent the council and however much it can put mediation services in place, those disputes are probably one of the hardest things to deal with as a councillor. The same issues would apply to registered social landlords; the buck would stop with councillors. The pressure to just get rid of the family, to get rid of the problem, is immense. That is why there need to be more safeguards.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08042386000158"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, raised the issue of the children, but we also have to think about the whole family. They may be problem families; they may come back late and be loud and difficult. There again, they may not be incredibly difficult but their neighbours, if they are very quiet, may find them so. Perhaps there is one very noisy family in a cul-de-sac of very quiet families, so they will be seen as very anti-social. That is the reason why we say in Amendment No. 107ZA that appropriate steps must,</p>
<ul><a name="08042386000264"></a>&#147;have previously been taken to address the disorder or nuisance without success&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042386000216"></a>This is a situation where a closure order could become almost the first option that authorities take. As I have said, excellent authorities with all the services in place are unlikely to do that, but the Minister will admit that there are still some very poor authorities. Some are in the categories of poor or failing. We would not want to think that they would abuse this legislation and make a closure order the first step.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08042386000159"></a>The reason for our second amendment is that a closure order also needs to have been through the magistrates&#146; court for it to have a look at whether any appropriate arrangements are in place. We are grateful that, since Committee, the Government have put down their Amendment No. 107A about guidance, but the fact is that although it is a good first attempt&#151;if I might use that slightly school essay phraseology&#151;it needs to be fleshed out a bit. I should be grateful if the Minister could look at expanding the section on guidance at least to include some of the points that we have put in our amendments. This situation is different from where closure orders are used for drug issues; they could start to be used because of pressures in the neighbourhood simply to get rid of the family, which is seen as much the easiest option.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08042386000160"></a>I speak from years of experience. I can remember, as a councillor, being driven to looking to purchase houses in isolated situations and all sorts of things. If this measure had been available as an option, there would have been immense pressure to use it instead of solving some of the deep-seated problems of problem

Where there are not unitary authorities, the problem is doubled because social services are at county level and housing is at district level. I should be immensely grateful if the Minister could think about fleshing out the guidance in the Bill so that we can take a little more comfort from it.</p>

This power would make people homeless, some of whom will have had nothing to do with whatever was going on that led to the closure, which is not a very good outcome, and, as the JCHR has said, would interfere with certain human rights, respect for family and home life, and peaceful enjoyment of property.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="08042386000162"></a>The Government have said that they intend to produce guidance, which Amendment No. 107A suggests. But, in the view of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, guidance is not good enough. These matters can be so serious for vulnerable people that they should have the protection of the law, which should be in the Bill. These amendments seek to do that and I therefore support them.</p>

There is, no doubt, already some experience of what happens as a result of the compulsory closing of a drug-dealing house or premises. That is a fairly limited category, whereas the powers conferred by this Bill go much wider. As the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, pointed out, they are very likely to affect children, who may be in no way responsible for the unacceptable conduct of their parents or other relatives. It is incumbent on the Government to respond on the issue of safeguards.</p>

<a name="08042386000164"></a><a name="80423-0015.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80423-0015.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08042386000332"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, for tabling Amendments Nos. 107, 107ZA and 107ZB, and for the passionate comments from other Members of the House. This brings us back to the issue of ensuring that the process for making premises closure orders gives proper consideration to the needs of children and vulnerable adults. I accept and I share many of the concerns, as do the Government, which is why I have tabled a government amendment, the details of which I shall come to shortly.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08042386000165"></a>In Committee, I listened to the concerns expressed by noble Lords and I recognise that they want to ensure that a premises closure order would be a proportionate response to the disorder, which would be made after all other options had been tried and had failed. The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, touched on that issue. The Committee was also concerned about the implications for homelessness, especially for the vulnerable occupants of the premises. The Government have never disputed that these are important matters for agencies to consider when making an application for an order, but we considered that they would best be addressed in non-statutory guidance.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1595"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1595</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80423-0015.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08042386000166"></a>Following the debate, we have reconsidered our position. Amendment No. 107A would make the proposed guidance statutory, which I hope will address the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Stern. That is the position as it exists in Scotland. Furthermore, there will be a duty on anyone using the power to have regard to the guidance.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="08042386000167"></a>In Committee, I also undertook to consider what material I could provide to the House to give an idea of what the guidance would consist of. I am sure noble Lords will appreciate that I cannot provide a complete draft of the guidance now. It will need to be carefully drawn up by officials in consultation with the agencies which will be responsible for exercising the new power. This issue was raised by Members of this House and, therefore, we will address that point.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="08042386000168"></a>However, we would anticipate basing it on the Scottish model. It is likely to cover, among other things&#151;as I have said, it has to be refined and carefully drawn up by officials in consultation with agencies&#151;the purpose and intent of the legislation; the definitions of terms&#151;for example, anti-social behaviour, significant and persistent disorder, persistent serious nuisance; the serving of notice; the making of the case in court; the enforcement of the order; the appeal mechanism; the assessment of and support for vulnerable adults and children&#151;very important areas that have been mentioned; the issue of homelessness; and examples of circumstances where the power should be used and where it should not be used.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08042386000169"></a>Noble Lords were particularly concerned about what type of behaviour might constitute a serious persistent nuisance or disorder. I can well understand that, and again the Scottish guidance, which will have to be refined, gives examples that may include persistent, intimidating and threatening behaviour towards residents and members of the public; the presence or discharge of a firearm in an adjacent premises; significant problems of sexual acts being committed within the premises; consistent evidence of discarded drugs paraphernalia and other dangerous items; serious disorder associated with alcohol abuse, for example in and around drinking dens; high numbers of people entering and leaving the premises at all times of the day or night and disruption caused to residents; and constant and intrusive noise, or excessive noise at all hours associated with visitors to the property. I expect that the guidance for England and Wales will be drawn up along similar lines, but it has to be refined.</p>

This is not a frivolous point, but some of what he has listed sounds like what takes place in a normal student house. For the residents in a street of 50 properties of which four are student houses, many of the things he has mentioned might occur. Lots of people may be coming and going; students drink and are noisy, and I expect that they have sex quite often. Can he assure me and put on the record that this is not aimed at student behaviour, for example?</p>

Moreover, I believe that people generally tend to apply things with common sense, and all this will be refined in the drafting to make sure that it is clear.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08042386000172"></a>However, if a series of activities were to take place, particularly if people were shooting firearms and having sex close to the windows so that everyone could see them, there comes a time where even if they were students, others might say that something should be done. We cannot give them complete licence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08042386000173"></a>These examples are indicative, but given that the guidance will cover the concerns that have been raised by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and other speakers, I hope that they will feel able not to press their amendments and that the House is willing to agree to government Amendment No. 107A.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08042386000182"></a>The clause is important as it provides for action prior to an assault happening. It is, in effect, designed to prevent assault if at all possible. The Assembly has had an extensive consultation on violence in the workplace and has its task force on the issue, so it is quite appropriate that it should be able to trigger the commencement of this when it decides that it should. I hope the ability of the Assembly to use the clause will serve it well in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08042386000183"></a>It was important to rectify the anomaly, as criminal justice is outside the competencies of the Government of Wales Act and the Ministry of Justice retains England and Wales responsibilities. I will be pleased to withdraw my amendment in anticipation of one to be tabled by the Minister. I invite him to confirm the e-mail for the record. I beg to move.</p>

This is a very appropriate way of dealing with it. I express my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, for all her work on the issue, and to the Ministers that she has consulted, who have come up with what seems a satisfactory solution.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08042386000186"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, the clauses make it an offence to cause nuisance or disturbance to NHS staff on hospital premises. Tied to the offence is a power for constables or authorised NHS staff to remove persons causing nuisance or disturbance from hospital premises. It is important to understand those points because that is how this will work.</p>

<a name="80423-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08042386000187"></a>These provisions are primarily concerned with the management of National Health Service premises, which is a devolved responsibility in Wales. We naturally consulted the Welsh Assembly Government prior to the introduction of the Bill last summer, so it is not quite right to say, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, did, that this was an oversight in our approach. It is worth putting on the record that at that point the Welsh Assembly Government were undertaking their own review of how best to eradicate the behaviour to which the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, referred, and to ensure that staff working in the NHS in Wales were fully protected. So, in those circumstances, the Welsh Assembly Government decided that they did not wish to apply these provisions to NHS premises in Wales. Accordingly, as currently drafted, the provisions apply only to nuisance and disturbance on English NHS hospital premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08042386000188"></a>In recent weeks we have taken a fresh look at this matter. We are extraordinarily grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, for raising the issue both in Committee and again today and I confirm that, following discussions between my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh First Minister, the Welsh Assembly Government have agreed that these provisions should now be extended to Wales. In these circumstances, I can accept the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments in principle. Unfortunately, I cannot invite the House to agree to the amendments here and now, as they are incomplete in a number of respects. In particular, we need to ensure that the definition of a relevant NHS body in Clause 118(4) properly reflects the organisation of the NHS in Wales where there are NHS trusts and local health boards established under the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 rather than, as in England, NHS trusts, primary care trusts and NHS foundation trusts established under the National Health Service Act 2006. In addition, we need to adapt the references to a &#147;relevant English NHS body&#148; in subsections (5) of Clauses 119 and 120, and amend Clause 150 to provide for bespoke commencement arrangements in Wales.</p>

She mentioned a specific example of a hospice situated in the grounds of the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital being covered by the Bill, while an identical hospice in another town, which just so happens to be situated outside the boundaries of the hospital grounds, will not be covered.

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08042386000195"></a>I speak as someone who has worked in hospices for much of my working life. For the most part, they are quiet, tranquil places. However, it is not all that uncommon for family members or acquaintances of staff, fuelled by alcohol, to become aggressive or abusive towards staff. The other problem is that hospices by their nature have controlled drugs on the premises. There are, fortunately, remarkably few attempts by addicts to access those drugs, but that may change in future. Hospices have security staff at

<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08042386000196"></a>In Committee, the Minister told noble Lords:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_118"></a><a name="08042386000263"></a>&#147;It is worth the Government reflecting further on hospices and where they fall in the definition. I am not sure that we can necessarily help, but I will certainly have a closer look at that&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 10/3/08; col. 1322.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042386000218"></a>I appreciate the work that the Minister has undertaken, his detailed letter and for having met me earlier. I am disappointed that the Government have indicated that they will not extend the clause to all hospices, nor to any premises, as in the very neatly drafted amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, where NHS services are provided. I fear that this is going to leave general practitioners and other services vulnerable, as it will leave hospices vulnerable. These are places where aggression is not only from patients who are ill but from relatives, friends and hangers-on and even stray members of the public. Extension through the amendment would not cost any money but would signal a clear commitment to non-tolerance of violent behaviour towards all healthcare workers in the course of performing their NHS duties, particularly as we move towards having more and more services provided out in the community.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08042386000197"></a>It is with the background that I have tabled my amendment&#151;and I fully endorse the amendment grouped with mine, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_236"></a>
<a name="08042386000198"></a><a name="80423-0016.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80423-0016.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08042386000342"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to my amendment. The purpose of this clause is to deal with low-level nuisance and disturbance. Obviously, if a person commits a criminal offence such as threatening behaviour or assault on hospital premises, they can be dealt with there as they can anywhere else. The police can be called, or the security staff can remove them. The key aim of the Government&#146;s legislation is to prevent assaults occurring in the first place by tackling non-physical nuisance and disturbance behaviour before it escalates into greater violence.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08042386000199"></a>The clause is limited to hospital premises, as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has just pointed out. That is not the only place where violence against NHS professionals takes place. In 2003, a survey was carried out by the British Medical Association. It surveyed a large number of UK doctors and found that more than a third of those who responded had received some degree of violence or abuse from patients. So the NHS Security Management Service&#151;SMS&#151;was set up in 2003 to address the management of security within the NHS.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="08042386000200"></a>Various measures were introduced, but when the British Medical Association carried out another survey of nearly 600 doctors in October and November of last year it discovered that a third had experienced some form of violence, including threats and verbal abuse; one in ten had been physically attacked, including being stabbed, kicked, punched, bitten and spat at; and, of those, one in three received  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1600"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1600</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>minor injuries and one in 20 was seriously injured. Most doctors&#151;and I am talking about GP surgeries&#151;did not report the attacks, so there is an underreporting element as well.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08042386000201"></a>I have to say that such a problem did not exist. One would never have thought in the past that doctors, whether in surgery or in hospital, or nursing staff would ever be attacked, not simply by the patients but by the relatives who were with them, which is of course who the Bill is aimed at. Unfortunately, it seems today that that has become prevalent.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_343"></a><a name="08042386000202"></a>The British Medical Association, while firmly supporting the government measures in the Bill, say&#151;quite rightly in our opinion&#151;that they do not go far enough. What it seeks and what we seek is to extend that protection, as the amendment says, to,</p>
<ul><a name="08042386000265"></a>&#147;any premises in which medical, surgical or paramedical treatment is provided under arrangements made under the National Health Service Act 2006&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042386000219"></a>The argument that was put against this proposal in Committee, and which will no doubt be advanced today, is that hospitals carry security staff, and that they can be summoned to deal with disturbances of this sort. There is a ready made body of people trained who can deal with disruptive relatives and friends of patients. It would be a protection to GPs in their surgeries and to other medical professionals who are working in NHS premises to have at least the shield of the law around them so that they could require people to, as the Bill says, cease the nuisance so that they can be removed, and, if necessary, so that the police can be called to remove them if they refuse to go in a situation where the intimidation or the nuisance had not escalated into an actual criminal offence where the police could be called any way.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_344"></a><a name="08042386000203"></a>It may be that GP surgeries and other primary care settings do not have the same security services as hospitals. But the fact that there is no security service does not mean that problems do not arise. As I said in Committee, a notice on the wall, to which a disruptive and intimidating relative&#146;s attention could be drawn, is the beginning at least of calming down a difficult situation. We are familiar with notices that say, &#147;If you do this, you are committing a criminal offence&#148;. Why should there not be a similar notice in a doctor&#146;s surgery which would help doctors to point out to people who are causing problems the course to which their conduct will lead? That is the purpose of the amendment. We think that under-reporting would cease and that doctors would be more willing to report nuisance and disturbance if they had the protection of the law. We also think that it would be a framework within which a partnership could be built between surgeries, the people working in them and local police so that the latter could readily be called for assistance.</p>

I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, for his contributions. We are agreed that there is a problem with nuisance and disturbance on NHS premises but we are not agreed about how best to deal with it in different settings and circumstances and what is practicable in those different circumstances.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_345"></a><a name="08042386000206"></a>These provisions are limited to NHS hospital premises. Amendment No. 110 seeks to extend the definition of &#147;NHS premises&#148; in Clause 118 to cover registered hospices and specialist palliative care units. Amendment No. 110A seeks to extend the definition of &#147;NHS premises&#148; to the wider National Health Service in general.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="08042386000207"></a>As I said, we acknowledge that there is a problem of physical violence against NHS staff who work in healthcare settings outside hospitals, including in hospices. I also acknowledge the need for the Government to work even harder to deal with these problems. However, I owe it to the House to explain how and why we designed these provisions specifically for hospitals to deal with the unique problems that they face. Given that these proposals are designed for the hospital setting, I am not convinced that simply extending the provision to other National Health Service premises, including hospices, palliative care units and general practitioner premises, would meet the protection needs of the staff involved.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_347"></a><a name="08042386000208"></a>In Committee, I and others referred to research undertaken by the Department of Health in 2006 which indicated that the problem of nuisance or disturbance behaviour, which does not include physical violence, was a particular problem in hospital premises and was largely caused by friends, family members or relatives of patients rather than patients themselves. We have all experienced this in one form or another, particularly in A&amp;E units on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_348"></a><a name="08042386000209"></a>These provisions have been designed to tackle the problem on NHS hospital premises identified in that 2006 research and will do so in two crucial ways. First, the offence cannot be committed by patients or those seeking medical advice, treatment or care, but rather people who are present on NHS hospital premises and are not seeking treatment, but who cause a nuisance and disturbance. Secondly, the provisions include a power in Clause 119 to remove people reasonably suspected of committing, or having committed, an offence under Clause 118. It is crucial that trained security staff should be able to remove people causing a nuisance before the behaviour escalates towards violence. NHS hospital staff have faced problems in the past when they have had to wait for police to arrive before action can be taken. For that reason, numbers of trained security staff have been increased over recent years.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1602"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1602</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80423-0016.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="08042386000210"></a>Exercising the power to remove a person reasonably suspected of committing or having committed an offence under Clause 118 will require the support of fully trained security staff, which hospitals generally have available on a 24-hour basis. Without the assistance of security officers, NHS staff could place themselves at serious risk by seeking to exercise the power to remove. I do not think that anyone in the House wants to see that happen.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08042386000211"></a>In Committee, I brought to the attention of noble Lords evidence presented in 2008 by the British Medical Association, to which I think the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred this evening, that 94 per cent of GPs had reported experiencing violence committed by patients. That indicates that the problem of nuisance and disturbance behaviour outside the hospital environment is different and may need separate solutions to meet the very real need of NHS workers for a safe working environment in healthcare settings in the community. The BMA report defined violence as physical and non-physical acts against doctors, so further research needs to be conducted to examine whether the problem is one of mainly physical violence, or of the type of non-physical, anti-social behaviour covered by these provisions.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="08042386000212"></a>I assure the House that the NHS Security Management Service is working to identify the nature and scale of the problem of nuisance and disturbance behaviour against NHS staff outside hospital premises, and it will take a leading role in developing solutions that are appropriate to the needs of our ever-evolving health service. While I do not believe that extending these provisions to all NHS premises including hospices&#151;where I recognise that there could be a problem&#151;and specialist palliative care units is appropriate, I can offer some limited reassurance to the House about the effect of the existing provisions.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="08042386000213"></a>In Committee, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, rightly alluded to the fact that hospices could be covered by these provisions if they are located within the grounds of an NHS hospital. This also applies to any building or vehicle associated with the hospital and it would include specialist palliative care units, so there is some breadth to the provision. Using hospices as an example, if an NHS or privately owned or funded hospice was located within the physical boundaries of an NHS hospital, then NHS staff attending such buildings or departments in connection with their work would be covered by these provisions.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="08042386000214"></a>The reasoning behind that lies again in the power that we are giving to NHS staff to remove those reasonably suspected of committing or having committed the new offence. As I have suggested, exercising the power to remove safely will require the support of fully trained security staff, which hospitals generally have available on the 24-hour basis that I referred to earlier. Hospices located within the grounds of the hospital may be able to draw on those resources to deal with a person suspected of committing an offence. However, there is no guarantee that such resources would be widely available to deal with a person committing  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1603"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1603</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a nuisance or disturbance in a hospice, specialist palliative care unit or any other NHS body located in the community.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="08042386000215"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, pointed out in Committee that some hospices employ security staff on-site at night. The noble Baroness reminded me of that earlier today. From my personal understanding of these issues, I would support that point. However, in these cases, that could mean that incidents of nuisance or disturbance behaviour could not be dealt with under these provisions at any other time of the day. I am not satisfied that the provision of security staff in hospices, specialist palliative care units or any other NHS body providing healthcare in the community is widespread. Therefore it would be inappropriate to extend these clauses, which are tailored to the needs of hospitals, to healthcare facilities that could not use them as they are intended to be used.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="0804246000001"></a>I hope that my commitment that further work will be undertaken to deal with the problems of violence and anti-social behaviour faced by NHS staff outside the hospital setting will be appreciated and that we can work together to secure a solution over time. I am grateful to noble Lords who have again brought this matter to the fore, because we accept that it is an issue. I hope that, having heard my explanation, noble Lords will withdraw their amendments.</p>

<a name="80423-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="0804246000002"></a>I shall respond to a couple interesting issues that emerged. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, accepts here that prevention is important, but perhaps he does not accept it regarding other aspects of the way in which we seek to use, for instance, violent offender orders. His acceptance of prevention here but not there is an important point. I thought that his point about notices being displayed being tied to the amendment was not as well thought through as it might have been. In my experience&#151;and, I am sure, that of the noble Lord&#146;s&#151;most GPs&#146; surgeries make it clear that unacceptable behaviour of a violent or abusive nature will not be tolerated and that people should not behave in a disorderly way. That is absolutely right. My experience, and probably that of other noble Lords, is that staff in surgeries will seek to rely on the help and support of the police service in calling its attention to any difficulties that they experience.

<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="0804246000003"></a>I accept that there is an issue. We think that further work is required.

I have a concern also that when staff move from one setting to another, they may be confused as to which powers they have or do not have. NHS trusts are providing violence-and-aggression training and are often opening that up to hospice staff as well. It is generally good training and very helpful for staff.

<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="0804246000023"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment takes us back to a matter that this House has discussed and debated many times with the Government: whether people under 18 should be subject to reporting restrictions when anti-social behaviour orders are imposed on them. As the Minister knows, if a young person commits a criminal offence, there are reporting restrictions. Some 10 years ago, when the Government brought in this different system for anti-social behaviour orders, they gave us a large list of reasons why they should be reported on because it was felt that naming and shaming would work. The fact is that it has not worked.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="0804246000024"></a>What evidence does the Minister have that naming and shaming has reduced the number of young people who have been subject to anti-social behaviour orders? Can he further tell me all of the difficult effects that that creates for a young person in their community? Does it help with their rehabilitation? I remind him that the Government said that they would like to rural-proof all their policies. For young people from rural areas and small towns where everybody knows them, reporting the matter in the local paper has an extremely negative effect on exactly the sort of rehabilitation and positive aspects of any order that the Government might have envisaged. There are much greater experts on these issues in the form of my noble friends Lady Linklater and Lady Walmsley, who I hope will both speak to the amendment, so I shall not take up more of the House&#146;s time. I beg  to move.</p>

I do not propose to be very long but I must say that I remember well the debates that we had on the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill in 2003&#151;five years ago&#151;when we were trying to amend the Crime and Disorder Act.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="0804246000026"></a>Now we know a bit more of the results of what was then under debate&#151;the presumption of reporting restrictions being in place and the change from the presumption that they would not be in place, so that there was an open day for local newspapers and others to report on the affairs and events of children coming before the court charged with anti-social behaviour offences.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="0804246000027"></a>I remind the House that we are talking about children and low-level behaviour that simply constitutes a civil offence and has nothing to do with criminal behaviour&#151;not, at least, until an ASBO has been breached. What we know about anti-social behaviour orders being reported is not good. Back in 1933 it was understood how damaging the effects of publicity can be on children. It was argued then, and remained so until the Crime and Disorder Act, that it should be left to the court to decide whether it was appropriate for reporting to take place, and that was based on the evidence on whether it would be in the interests of the child so to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="0804246000028"></a>I am grateful to see the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, in his place.

That was when naming and shaming came into its own&#151;the humiliation of children. It takes no one in the Chamber, let alone those outside, to know that you do not teach a child anything through humiliation. If anything you do more damage. That is the evidence.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="0804246000029"></a>The characteristics of the child&#146;s behaviour, their background and needs, and the information available to the court are necessarily to be taken into account or relevant when a local paper writes its story. In fact, it usually leads to complete disregard of the circumstances of the child and his offence, let alone his needs.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="0804246000030"></a>Anyone in this Chamber who has worked with children who end up in court will know that we are almost invariably dealing with children who are already troubled. They are moving from being troubled children to being children in trouble. We know that they are more likely than not to have learning difficulties, perhaps to have disorders such as autism or mental health issues or to suffer from deprivation of one kind or another. We humiliate them by putting them on the front page or the inner pages of newspapers. In the past five years or so, we have seen plenty of evidence of what appears in the newspapers about such children, which is deeply distasteful and, in the long run, deeply damaging. It is also likely, although it has not been tested fully in the courts, that several articles of the UNCRC and possibly the European Convention on Human Rights will be breached in this process. However, we know that when such publicity occurs it is likely to cause great distress, not only to the child who is being humiliated, but to his family. Even worse, it is possible that if the damage is not distressing to the child, the damage is of a different sort; namely, it becomes a sort of badge of honour for the child who is in trouble. There is evidence of that. What good are we doing him, let alone our communities? Children in trouble need help to stop the behaviour&#151;it is, I remind the House, at this stage still low-level&#151;so it does not lead to a breach of the ASBO, which then turns into criminal behaviour and into the process in which we criminalise children.</p>

<ul><a name="0804246000074"></a>&#147;but is there to let the community know that action has been taken and to engage local people in helping to monitor the conditions that have been set out in the ASBO&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee D, 23/3/06; col. 230.]</ul>
<p><a name="0804246000061"></a>I have never known such an example of self-deception in my life. I do not think that even Hazel Blears can have really believed what she was saying.</p>

I simply have one question for my noble friends, which I hope they will address. They have repeatedly said that the Government are committed to the rehabilitation of offenders. How are we going to tackle the rehabilitation of the young if they either acquire a badge of honour, and therefore begin to go down the road of institutionalised crime because they have won acknowledgement and standing in society as an offender, or are alienated and hurt in all kinds of deep psychological ways by the process to which they have been subjected? Of course the noble Baroness is right: a very high proportion of those children have been through hell in their own lives.

Seeing the amendment on the Marshalled List reminds me of the film, &#147;Groundhog Day&#148;. When I hear the Minister's response, that feeling may well be intensified. He must accept that we keep coming back to this issue because we know how wrong it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="0804246000035"></a>I very much believe in doing what works. If we want to stop young children behaving in an antisocial way, we must do what works. All the evidence and all the research shows that you stop children behaving in that way not by humiliating them but by building up their self-confidence and self-worth, because it is the destruction of their self-worth by their experiences that has led to their behaviour.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="0804246000036"></a>Unfortunately, &#147;shock, horror&#148; stories about 10 year-olds behaving in an appalling way is the sort of thing that the media love. I would love to see on the front page of a newspaper one of these days a wonderful, positive story about how a young person's life has been turned around by being treated in the proper way, with proper understanding, family support, analysis of the background that led to that behaviour and the support and help that they need to help them to return to the sort of behaviour that we would like and to have a fulfilling and useful life.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="0804246000037"></a>I do not see that happening in the near future, but we need a lead from the Government. We have seen so many good things from the Government in helping children and supporting families, but they seem to have a blind spot about this issue. I promise the Government that those of us who have spoken, and many who are resisting speaking because of the late hour, will keep coming back to this matter until they take notice of all the powerful research that shows how very wrong and ineffective this policy is.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="0804246000039"></a>I ought also to welcome this debate again. I am not quite sure how many of these I have done so far, but this has the feel of a serial issue. I know that it is a serial issue for noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches, and I am sure that they believe every word they say on the subject. I am not trying to patronise the debate, because it is important&#151;too important to make light of. As I have felt all the way through these debates&#151;we have been having them for eight or nine years&#151;I think that the noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches are wrong on this issue. I think that they are profoundly wrong and profoundly misunderstand the intent and the objective of  our policy.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="0804246000040"></a>It is quite clear what is intended by the amendment: it would repeal sections of the 1998 Act that remove the imposition of reporting restrictions on proceedings against juveniles for breaching their ASBOs, or which relate to the making of ASBOs against juveniles on conviction of criminal offences.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="0804246000041"></a>All those who spoke from the Liberal Democrat Benches went over the issues that we have heard before about the orders being badges of honour&#151;a term that my noble friend Lord Judd also used. That term came into currency after a very limited piece of research done a couple of years ago. We find in the practice of the use of ASBOs that that is not the case. They are not badges of honour; people do not brandish their ASBO. Most people take these orders extremely seriously, and quite rightly so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="0804246000042"></a>We have heard the argument about the need for an emphasis on rehabilitation. We are putting a massive effort into rehabilitation, which has always been part of our strategy and approach. Indeed, the ASBO process itself in part encourages that very approach. I agree with the general observation that children who are often caught up in the ASBO process need help. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, would see the commission of some of these acts of anti-social behaviour as a cry or a plea for help. That may well be the case, but that does not detract from the fact that that anti-social behaviour is a nuisance and has a profound and damaging impact on the lives of those who are subjected to it and on communities and individuals in particular. We must take that issue seriously. I have heard good Liberal Democrats say that anti-social behaviour needs to be confronted and dealt with effectively in a non-criminal context. That, in essence, seems to be the Liberal Democrats&#146; argument.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="0804246000043"></a>Publicising proceedings is a very important part of the local agencies&#146; attempts and efforts to deal with anti-social behaviour. I cannot agree with the observations that were passed on the remarks made my right honourable friend Hazel Blears. She was absolutely right to make that point, which I am sure is based on her practical experiences in her constituency.</p>

Is it also his view that the whole community should be the policeman? What does he think the effect of that is on a young person of 14, 15 or 16?</p>

<p><a name="st_253"></a>
<a name="0804246000045"></a><a name="80423-0017.htm_spnew12"></a><b><a name="80423-0017.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="0804246000265"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My Lords, the noble Lord is falling into the trap into which he fell in the last debate. I will not be provoked here, but I make one important point in response to what he says. It is not about vigilantism; it is about people being aware of those who have been challenged over the effects of their behaviour through the ASBO process. That challenge is very important. I believe, and I know that my colleagues believe, that we need to demonstrate to young people what unacceptable behaviour is. We need to draw a line. People need to understand exactly when behaviour is acceptable and when it is unacceptable. It is in the absence of those clear messages&#151;those clear dividing lines&#151;that young people get into the habit of the abusing behaviour that can have such a profound and damaging impact in our communities. So, yes, I do agree that publicity surrounding proceedings is an important part of the process. It is not about naming and shaming. I do not accept that tag, or title, at all.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="0804246000046"></a>ASBOs are made in open court, and unless the court imposes restrictions, I believe, and so do the Government, that the media are quite entitled to report them, and that in doing so, they fulfil a sensible and practical purpose. Noble Lords often omit to consider simply this; it is open to the court to decide whether to impose reporting restrictions. My experience of my local newspaper suggests that local newspapers behave entirely responsibly. I certainly remember cases in our locality where it was said that those who are subject to the ASBO process had a behavioural problem such as Asperger&#146;s or an attention deficit syndrome of one form or another. It seemed to me that the local newspaper respected that fact and understood the importance of using its power to publicise responsibly. In some ways, it challenges the newspapers to behave responsibly. Nevertheless, they do a good public service.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="0804246000047"></a>When we had this debate the last time around, I recall that I reminded the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat MP for the Lewes constituency, was one of those who complained in concert with David Lepper, one of our local MPs, that the newspaper in the locality had been prevented from giving quite right publicity to the effect of an ASBO that had been passed on some young offenders in our area. He was right to do so. He made the argument that publicity was an essential part of the process. It is clear to me that not all Liberal Democrats have buried their heads in the sand on this issue; some of them recognise the importance and value that publicity can bring to these cases.</p>

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="0804246000048"></a>Publicity is not to punish or shame the individual. It is to ensure that people are aware of what has been undertaken in their name so that the community can be reassured that firm action is being taken to counter anti-social behaviour. I would also argue that in

<a name="80423-0017.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_388"></a><a name="0804246000049"></a>The fact is that courts, in their wisdom, can impose restrictions on reporting if they wish. It is right that they exercise that discretion; they are closer to the details of the case. They have to take into account the welfare of the child or young person they are dealing with. I think the local courts are best placed to do that. The existing legal framework works well and we have not been regaled with abuses of the system. We think that ASBOs have a lasting and tremendous potential benefit in communities dealing with the sorts of low-level disorder and nuisance that too many of us are familiar with. We cannot accept the amendment, and I am afraid I profoundly disagree with the arguments and the approach that noble Lords on the Benches opposite have adopted on this. The system is working well and we should support it. We should make better use of ASBOs.</p>

The Minister implied that Liberal Democrats do not recognise that anti-social behaviour is a nuisance. Of course we recognise that. The amendment is not about whether anti-social behaviour is a nuisance, but he was implying that our line was that there was no problem with it. That is absolute rubbish. We accept absolutely that anti-social behaviour has to be confronted. Our question is: what evidence does the Minister have for continuing to allow the reporting of children under the age of 18?</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, has spoken on this issue in the past&#151;she wished me to mention the fact that she strongly supported the amendment today, although unfortunately due to the hour she has had to leave&#151;so it is supported on the Cross Benches. Basically, it is supported by all Members of your Lordships&#146; House who have a lot to do with young people, on every Bench other than the government Front Bench. It is with particular regret that I understand that the Minister has simply dug his heels in and repeated the same old argument rather than moving it on.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"></a><a name="0804246000052"></a>In discussing this amendment with various colleagues at local government level, I have found that, as the Minister will know, counsellors for children in care&#151;many of which children end up in the anti-social behaviour order category&#151;as corporate parents are often appalled at the fact that this can be reported on, because they can see that it simply adds to the cycle of the difficulties those children already face. After the Minister&#146;s reply, we on these Benches shall certainly be encouraging all those corporate parents, all the counsellors with responsibility for those children in their care, to challenge the Government&#146;s stance under those children&#146;s rights because the Government are failing them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="0804248000009"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in bringing forward the amendment I again declare an interest as the president of the Association of Police Authorities and former chairman of both that organisation and the Lancashire Police Authority. I am sure that everyone will be pleased that I shall be as brief as I possibly can be at this hour of the night.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="0804248000010"></a>I thank the noble Lord for his letter to me and our subsequent meeting, which clarified the Government&#146;s position on this issue. I am sure that we are united in wishing to see an effective inspection regime put in place for police authorities, and I am very pleased that he welcomes the involvement of the Association of Police Authorities in developing inspection protocols. However, I remain unconvinced that the clause represents the right way to go in how police authorities will be inspected for the following reasons.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="0804248000011"></a>Nowhere in primary legislation is the phrase &#147;joint inspection&#148; used about the future proposals for inspecting police authorities, although I know that this is what is intended. Joint inspection can merely be inferred by looking at a number of different Acts relating to local authority and police inspections. As I have noted before, interpretation is ambiguous and, despite the noble Lord&#146;s assurance on this point in his letter to me, this remains arguable in the absence of clear wording.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="0804248000012"></a>I also have grave and serious doubts about the principle of hanging these inspection provisions on best value legislation, which is otherwise known as the Local Government Act 1999. This is another aspect of the legislation which is ambiguous because it is not clear whether the Audit Commission, HMIC or both have this function under current arrangements. Again the meaning is at least arguable and not beyond doubt. In addition, many provisions of the Act have subsequently been repealed or replaced. Why formulate new proposals around legislation which is being phased out in practice?</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="0804248000013"></a>My amendment would overcome these objections because, first, it acknowledges the problem with best value legislation by removing police authorities from its scope altogether. It acknowledges that there will be some consequences to this and suggests ways of overcoming these&#151;for instance, by including a  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1616"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1616</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>specific responsibility on police authorities to ensure economy, which will compensate for the parallel provisions in the Local Government Act 1999. Then it sets out clear alternative proposals about joint police authority inspection between HMIC and the Audit Commission and explains, most importantly, that it will involve some police authority input on a peer review basis.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="0804248000014"></a>I stated in Committee why I thought this was a crucial provision and, while I am very pleased that the Government agree that all this should happen in practice, I remain puzzled about their reluctance to place this in legislation.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="0804248000015"></a>I am a strong supporter of the principle of inspecting police authorities, but they deserve considered legislation which is clear about what is intended and sets this out in one place so that it can be easily understood. I am asking whether it is possible for the Government to agree to that. The most important reason this matters is that it is difficult to see how authorities can be made more accountable to communities if the legislation about how they are inspected is so complex and scattered that it is unreasonable to expect those communities to understand it. Surely it is right that local communities should understand one of the key ways in which the state ensures that authorities are doing their job properly. It is in this spirit of endorsing local accountability and making it as transparent as possible that I beg to move.</p>

I also declare an interest as a vice-president of the Association of Police Authorities, a former deputy chair of that organisation and a former chair of North Yorkshire Police Authority.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="0804248000017"></a>The clause looks fairly innocuous, but we have been here before&#151;and on many an occasion I have spoken about the best value legislation, because I have felt that police authorities should not be subject to it. But there we are.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="0804248000018"></a>I am not clear why the Government think that this amendment would change the statutory functions of the APA. Most of the provisions in the amendment suggest that it be consulted about inspection proposals&#151;but the APA is already a statutory consultee, so what is new? I do not see that the provision about the APA nominating peer reviewers to contribute to inspections confers functions of a different nature on the APA. It certainly does not confer inspection powers; it merely says that the APA will organise which peer reviewers will contribute to inspections. I also have difficulty imagining what type of inspection might preclude some police authority input, or on what occasion inspectors might understand better the business of police authorities than people drawn from police authorities.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="0804248000019"></a>I am also concerned about how these inspections are to be funded. I understand that discussions have taken place in the Home Office about how to pay the Audit Commission for doing the inspections&#151;because, believe me, it will charge. I also wonder how the Government propose that a peer review might be funded. Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether any progress has been made on those discussions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="0804248000020"></a>I support the inspection of police authorities. It is the question of how they are inspected and by whom on which the public needs clarity. There is no clarity at present and the Government&#146;s proposals in no way help that process. I hope that the Minister will carefully consider the amendment, which is eminently sensible and really ought to be accepted.</p>

I thought that it was positive and helped to highlight the points which will need to be addressed as part of the inspection protocol or framework which will underpin the new inspection arrangements for police authorities.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="0804248000022"></a>A joint approach to police authority inspections will bring together Her Majesty&#146;s Inspectorate of Constabulary&#146;s professional knowledge and understanding of operational policing and the Audit Commission&#146;s wider cross-sector understanding of local government, local partnerships and the role of police authorities as distinct from that of chief constables and forces. This mix of knowledge is crucial in assessing the effectiveness of policing and community safety delivery by a range of local services.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="0804248000023"></a>I fully support my noble friend&#146;s view that we need to articulate the overall vision for the joint inspection of police authority functions as clearly as possible so that the intention of the legislative provisions on which this approach will rely is understood. This will be set out in the inspection protocol and methodology that I have referred to before and which will be developed and agreed jointly by the Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Audit Commission with the Association of Police Authorities and the support of the Home Office.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="0804248000024"></a>The inspectorate&#146;s powers relate to police forces and authorities, while those of the Audit Commission apply more widely to all best value authorities. It is therefore inevitable that these powers are in two separate legislative regimes. Seeking to combine them as proposed is neither desirable nor necessary. I would expect the inspection protocol to set out the statutory basis for the inspection of police authorities so they will be able to look to this one document for the necessary clarity.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="0804249000001"></a>The inspectorate and the commission have agreed that inspections will be conducted on a joint and fully co-ordinated basis. They will effectively act as one to produce a holistic assessment of police authority performance which is proportionate and does not duplicate other work. They recognise the importance of including a police authority peer officer or member to ensure the right skills mix and that the existing self-assessment framework will play a part in the process. As the gatekeeper for police inspections, the inspectorate will have the ability to prevent any inappropriate inspection activity.</p>

I expect it to be based on the responsibilities and standards expected of police authorities in holding the police service to account and delivering outcomes for local people, and to define the high level aims and focus of a joint inspection regime. As I have already indicated, I would also expect the protocol to set out the legislative landscape and describe the roles and responsibilities of those involved, including police authorities. It would support the process for consulting on the priorities for an annual inspection programme and broad timescales and objectives for this work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"></a><a name="0804249000009"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, when these clauses were discussed in Committee, the Minister acknowledged that the special immigration status they create was cooked up primarily to reverse the decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal in relation to a few desperate people who escaped from almost certain torture and death in Afghanistan while it was ruled by the Taliban, by hijacking an Ariana Airlines plane and compelling the pilot to fly with all 156 people and crew on board to Stansted. Originally 11 of the people on board were charged with offences connected with that operation, but one was found unfit to plead. After a first trial at which the jury failed to agree, the remaining 10 were retried. One was acquitted. Although he cannot be designated as a foreign criminal, he still has not had a decision on his asylum claim after eight years. I invite the Minister to explain how this delay has occurred.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="0804249000010"></a>The remaining nine were convicted at their second trial and given light sentences because of mitigating circumstances. The accused were members of the young intellectual organisation, which had been penetrated by the Taliban. Four of their fellow members had been arrested and tortured and had disclosed the names of 35 people who had met in Kabul to discuss extending their activities to Herat and Kandahar. Those 35 included the people on this plane.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1619"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1619</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80423-0018.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="0804249000011"></a>The nine appealed, and in June 2003 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences on the grounds that the jury had been misdirected on the defence of duress. By that time the application for asylum that they had lodged had already been refused by the panel of adjudicators, as the noble Lord, Lord West, told me in his letter of 20 March, on the grounds that they had committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of their origin and were therefore excluded from the protection of the refugee convention under Article 1F</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="0804249000012"></a>The nine then succeeded in their application for judicial review of the refusal in the Administration Court and again in the Court of Appeal. They were granted limited leave to remain in May 2006, which expired in November of that year, but when they applied for extensions, the Secretary of State simply failed to respond from that day to this, keeping them in limbo. What had been decided was to put these clauses together so that these persons, and the very small number in a similar situation, could be deprived of the rights they had successfully asserted in the courts.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="0804249000013"></a>In Committee, the Minister said that the issue was what status should be accorded to a person whose actions were such as to warrant his deportation, but who cannot be removed because to do so would be contrary to our ECHR obligations. The simple answer is that his limited leave to remain should be renewed six months at a time until it either becomes safe for him to return, or it is perverse to keep him and his family in limbo. Personally, I think that after eight years there is no good reason of public policy for saying that we ought to keep these particular families in a state of suspended animation, nor was there any attempt by the Minister to make out such a case in our previous debate. But I accept that there might be circumstances in which an even longer period would be needed to decide whether it was safe for a person to return, and that is already covered by the provision that limited leave to remain could be renewed indefinitely, although with a 10-year review.</p>

<a name="80423-0018.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="0804249000014"></a>When it comes to the families of these people, the Minister says that it is normal for family members to be granted leave in line, and that it would be illogical for someone whose application for leave to remain rides on the coat-tails of another&#151;as he put it&#151;to end up in a better position than someone wearing the coat. I accept that, in the normal case where the end result is either refusal or acceptance, but at the point where the principal applicant is consigned to special immigration status, I believe that dependants, who have done none of the acts specified in Article 1F or to warrant this pariah treatment, should be given the normal six months leave to remain. In the case of children, perhaps the Minister can say whether he has considered whether this policy is compatible with the draft code of practice under Section 21 of the UK Borders Act, now coming to the end of the consultation period, to say nothing of our obligations under the CRC.</p>

Unfortunately, the treatment of the wives and children has not been in accordance with our normal standards of human rights and justice. This is another example of the Government&#146;s habit of changing the law when they do not like the decisions of the courts. The effect of their policy, as set out in Part 10 of the Bill, is to destroy the prospects of a small group of people who had already suffered appalling human rights violations at the hands of a vicious gang of bigoted religious fanatics whom our Government took military action to remove. The clauses in Part 10 fulfil an undertaking given by Jack Straw when they first arrived here expecting to live in peace and freedom. They have been severely disappointed but if we remove these clauses we can give them some future life. I beg to move.</p>

He is not convicted and never has been. He did not have to rely on appeal. His case was that he was going with his wife to a wedding in Mosul and found himself caught up in these events.

The fundamental point that we are considering is this. Where a foreign national has a conviction of a particular kind, or where, because of his conduct, he comes within the terms of Article 1F of the Refugee Convention, but he cannot be deported due to a human rights barrier, should the Government be compelled to grant that person leave under the immigration Acts, with all the advantages that flow from having such leave? Or should there be the option of a new immigration status as an alternative to immigration leave as provided for by Part 10 of the Bill?</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_427"></a><a name="0804249000018"></a>From the fact that the noble Lord seeks to delete Part 10 in its entirety, I take it that he is opposed in principle to the idea of a status that is an alternative to immigration leave and considers that, no matter what the person concerned may have done, if he cannot be deported for human rights reasons, he must be given immigration leave. That is one way of approaching the issue, but it is not one that the Government believe is appropriate. The Government take the view that immigration leave is something valuable and something worth having. Immigration leave should be given to people who qualify for it, and, by the same token, it should not be awarded to people whose only claim to leave is that they cannot be deported because of our obligations under the ECHR. That is the point of principle at stake.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="0804249000019"></a>In our view, people who meet the criteria for designation should not be entitled to the advantages that flow from immigration leave, such as access to mainstream benefits and the right to work. In

<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="0804249000020"></a>As I said in Committee, we could discuss where to draw the line and what the threshold for the new status should be. However, that is not what this group of amendments seeks to do. The amendments seek to erase the line completely and to perpetuate the current anomalous position whereby, apart from the duration of the leave, there is no distinction between the immigration leave granted to individuals who have committed even the most serious crimes and any other foreign national who requires leave to enter or remain. In practical terms, there is no distinction at all at present.</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_430"></a><a name="0804249000021"></a>Let me remind the House to whom the new status would apply. It would not apply to British citizens or persons with the right of abode in the United Kingdom. It would not apply to recognised refugees, and it would not apply to people exercising rights under the Community treaties. However, it would apply to anyone else who had been convicted of an offence and had received a custodial sentence of two years or longer, or to an offence listed in the order made under Section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 who had received a custodial sentence of any length. It would apply to anyone who would be excluded from refugee status under the terms of Article 1F of the Refugee Convention; that is to say,</p>
<ul><a name="0804249000027"></a>&#147;any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that: ... he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity ... he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee ... he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0804249000024"></a>In addition to those three groups, it would also be possible to designate the spouses and minor dependent children of such people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"></a><a name="0804249000022"></a>As the Government have previously made clear, the power to designate family members would be used only where they have applied to be dealt with in line with a principal applicant who falls to be designated. There is nothing to prevent the family members applying for and, provided they qualify, being granted leave in their own right.</p>

I regret in particular that the application by Mrs Y was associated with the case of her husband, when they had married only some time after their arrival in the United Kingdom, and that she was then incorrectly told that she was being granted exceptional leave &#147;outside the Immigration Rules&#148; rather than under the rules.

I accept that it is taking a long time to reach a decision, but there are complex issues involved and, in such circumstances, it is not unprecedented for such delays to occur. The principle remains, however. Family members who are given special immigration status because they are family members will be able to apply for leave in their own right and, if they qualify for leave&#151;I stress &#147;if&#148;&#151;then it will be granted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"></a><a name="08042411000001"></a>However, I do not wish to concentrate exclusively on the Afghan hijackers, although I will say more about them. Contrary to what has been asserted, this provision is not entirely about the Afghans. In fact, it is not even mainly about them. As I have said, it will be possible to designate someone who has been sentenced to imprisonment for two years or longer for any offence, or someone who has received a custodial sentence of any length for certain specified offences.</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_434"></a><a name="08042411000002"></a>Let me give two concrete examples drawn from people who have not been convicted of any offence and who would qualify because they come within the terms of Article 1F. In doing so, I must make it clear that I am not saying that the individuals concerned will be designated. Any decision would need to be taken in the light of the circumstances at the time, but they are examples of the type of case where we believe it is desirable to have the option of an alternative to immigration leave.</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="08042411000003"></a>Let us take the case of Mr A&#151;not his real name or even his real initial. Mr A is a senior member of a body called the Justice and Equality Movement in the Sudan, which, despite its name, has been found by the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur to be complicit in war crimes. Because of his standing in the Justice and Equality Movement, Mr A has been excluded from the protection of the Refugee Convention by virtue of Article 1F. However, he cannot be removed from this country for human rights reasons. At present there is no alternative but to grant him discretionary leave. Under the provisions in this Bill, Mr A would fall to be given special immigration status. Is the noble Lord really insisting that he should continue to be given immigration leave?</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_436"></a><a name="08042411000004"></a>Then there is the case of Mr B, a South African citizen. He is a former member of the Afrikaner Widerstand&#146;s Beweging (AWB) and of the South African secret service in the apartheid era. He admits to having undertaken a number of operations in what is now Namibia, including an attack on the UN. Mr B&#146;s application for asylum was refused, but his appeal was allowed on human rights grounds. It is nevertheless clear that he falls within the terms of Article 1F and that it applies to him, which in turn means that he could be given SIS. We believe that it would be appropriate to be able to deny leave under the Immigration Acts to someone who has done the sort of things Mr B admits to, and we believe it should be possible for us to do it.</p>

<ul><a name="08042411000052"></a>&#147;serious reasons for considering that [they had] committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to [their] admission&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_438"></a><a name="08042411000006"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Thomas of Gresford, said that the hijackers were escaping from the Taliban. That is correct, but the reason that they were excluded from the convention was not the fact that they were escaping, but the manner of their escape. This issue was considered in detail by the panel of adjudicators which heard the appeal. The reasoning on this specific point runs to 18 pages out of the determination&#146;s total of 118 pages.</p>

The adjudicators took into account the guidance in the UNHCR&#146;s handbook&#151;in particular, paragraph 158, which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_146"></a><a name="08042411000049"></a>&#147;Whilst for the purposes of the present exclusion ... it may be possible to overlook the fact that a refugee, not finding any other means of escape, may have evaded the border in a stolen car, decision will be more difficult when he has hijacked an aircraft ... forced its crew, under threat of arms or with actual violence, to change destination in order to bring him to a country of refuge&#148;. </p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08042411000011"></a>The handbook goes on to state that,</p>
<ul><a name="08042411000053"></a>&#147;the question of exclusion under Article 1F(b) of an applicant who has committed an unlawful seizure of an aircraft will also have to be carefully examined in each individual case&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042411000012"></a>The adjudicators had regard to a background note issued in 2003, which suggested that among the issues requiring consideration in such circumstances was,</p>
<ul><a name="08042411000054"></a>&#147;whether the hijacking was a last and unavoidable recourse to flee from the danger at hand, that is, whether there were other viable and less harmful means of escape&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80423-0019.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_439"></a><a name="08042411000013"></a>In addressing these issues, the adjudicators concluded that hijacking an aircraft is, of its nature, a serious crime. I do not suppose that any of us would dissent from that.</p>




<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1624"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1624</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80423-0019.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_440"></a><a name="08042411000014"></a>Following the formulation established by the Judicial Committee, the adjudicators were also satisfied that this particular hijacking was not a political crime. This is relevant because the article is limited to non-political crimes.</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_441"></a><a name="08042411000015"></a>Finally, while acknowledging that there were,</p>
<ul><a name="08042411000055"></a>&#147;some mitigating circumstances leading to the decision to hijack the aircraft&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08042411000047"></a>the adjudicators came to the view that there were,</p>
<ul><a name="08042411000056"></a>&#147;no serious grounds for concluding that the appellants were placed in such a position that they were compelled to carry out the hijacking nor were they under such pressure as to justify the hijacking&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08042411000048"></a>There was no immediate danger of arrest and there were alternative routes by which they could have left the country.</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_442"></a><a name="08042411000016"></a>The adjudicators also concluded that, having chosen to escape from Afghanistan in this way, the appellants had no need to prolong the hijack. The aircraft landed first in Tashkent and then in Moscow before arriving in the UK. Those responsible for the hijacking could easily have claimed asylum in either country. There was no necessity to extend or repeat the offence by forcing the pilot to take off again and fly to a second and then a third destination.</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_443"></a><a name="08042411000017"></a>That, in brief, is why the adjudicators ruled as they did. It had nothing to do with the statutory interpretation of Article 1F, which had not been enacted at the time and which in any event relates to a different subsection. Nor did it have anything to do with the definition of a serious crime for the purposes of Article 33.</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_444"></a><a name="08042411000018"></a>I believe that the adjudicators were right to conclude that the Afghan hijackers were excluded by Article 1F of the refugee convention. They may have been fleeing from a terrible regime of which they did not approve, but there was no necessity to choose the manner of escape that they did or to threaten the lives and safety of the crew and the other passengers. Also, although this did not form part of the adjudicators&#146; reasoning, there was no justification for keeping the crew and the other passengers cooped up in the aircraft for another four days once they had landed in the United Kingdom. The noble Lord may regard the hijackers as victims but, in my view, the decision to exclude them from the convention was absolutely right.</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_445"></a><a name="08042411000019"></a>In the examples that I have given, we are not talking about a large number of people. The estimate is about 50. However, the examples that I have described, including the ones relating to South Africa and Darfur, illustrate the type of case where, in the Government&#146;s view, the conduct of the person concerned means that they should not be put on a par with other foreign nationals in terms of their immigration status. If it were possible, we would want to remove them from the United Kingdom altogether. However, where that is not possible for human rights reasons, we say that, in certain limited circumstances, we should at the very least be able to deny them immigration leave and the benefits that flow from having such leave. On that basis, I ask the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment.</p>

I remind him that the defence of duress was accepted by the jury. Indeed, the Court of Appeal ultimately decided that the judge had wrongly directed the jury in respect of the others on duress. The judgment that he has read out shows that the panel was under the impression that duress did not apply. That was not the case. No further prosecution was brought against them.</p>

I accept that the circumstances of the Afghans are totally different from those of the other people whom he cited, such as Mr B, the South African. However, I should like the noble Lord to reflect on the purpose of keeping even Mr B in indefinite suspended animation. He is not allowed to work, so he is not contributing anything to the economy. He is simply wasting away his life in this country because it is considered unsafe to return him. Although I had not heard about this before tonight, I question whether the Government are right in thinking that it would be unsafe to return him to South Africa&#151;a democratic country ruled by people who respect human rights&#151;in spite of the offences that he committed under the apartheid regime. Many other people committed equally horrible offences in the days of the white racist Government and are now living freely and peacefully in South Africa. In that case, I do not accept that it would necessarily be unsafe for us to return Mr B.</p>

<a name="80423-0019.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_446"></a><a name="08042411000023"></a>However, as I said, if necessary, people can be kept on six months&#146; leave to remain at a time until either it becomes safe to return them or they can be given indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. That has always been the position in the law in the past, and it was only when these Afghanis arrived in the United Kingdom that the Government suddenly changed their mind and said that a special immigration status had to be created to satisfy the knee-jerk reaction of Mr Jack Straw at that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_447"></a><a name="08042411000024"></a>The noble Lord kindly went into some detail on the reasons why the special adjudicators panel reached the decision that it did but, as I pointed out to him and as he ignored in running through the argument, its reasoning was arrived at prior to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, to which my noble friend has rightly just drawn attention. The Court of Appeal quashed the convictions on the ground that the defence of duress had not been properly directed by the trial judge. That fact was not before the panel of adjudicators when it said that Article 1F applied. It could have reached a completely different decision had it had that information, and there was no review of the decision by the adjudicators panel. The Court of Appeal having made its decision, these people were then granted asylum, and it was to prevent the effect of that decision that the Government introduced these clauses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="08042411000025"></a>The existing immigration law is adequate and we have never had a provision of this kind in our law in the past. The noble Lord&#146;s decision confines a group of people who are victims of an oppressive regime to an indefinite limbo where neither they nor their wives or children can resume a normal life. As I should have liked to demonstrate if there had been time, it is totally incorrect to say that there is nothing to prevent these families applying for asylum in their own right and being granted it if they qualify.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="08042411000026"></a>An indefinite delay in considering the applications did not just occur in the cases that I quoted on the previous occasion; the 10th person, to whom my noble friend drew attention, was acquitted by the trial and is still awaiting a decision on his application.  Mrs S has had to apply for a judicial review of the eight-year delay in responding to her application and is still awaiting a hearing on that JR application. She has four children, three of them born in this country. This is not the way to treat the victims of a vicious regime and, if it had not been so late, I should definitely have asked for the opinion of the House to be tested. As it is, I shall seek an opportunity to return to this matter at a later date but, in the meanwhile, and with great reluctance, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

As it is employment law, it is appropriate to determine the scope of the provisions in Westminster rather than in the devolved legislatures. However, the running of Scottish prisons is the responsibility of Scottish Ministers, and the Government are tabling this amendment following consultation with, and full agreement from, Scottish Ministers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"></a><a name="08042412000001"></a>The statutory ban on industrial action in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 has always remained in place in Northern Ireland and in private sector prisons. In public sector prisons in England, Wales and Scotland, the statutory restrictions were disapplied in 2005 in favour of binding voluntary agreements by the POA not to take industrial action. While the POA has chosen to withdraw from the joint industrial relations procedural agreement in England and Wales from 8 May 2008, the equivalent voluntary agreement in Scotland remains in place. The provisions are, therefore, not immediately needed in Scotland, and the Government have tabled Amendment No. 118, to ensure that in Scotland the statutory restrictions in these clauses would come into force only by order, rather than on Royal Assent. Any such order would be subject to affirmative resolution in Parliament. The Government have also given assurances to Scottish Ministers that no such order would be made without an explicit request in the event of a failure of the current voluntary agreement. It is the Government&#146;s hope that the generally positive employee relations situation in Scotland will continue and that these circumstances will not arise. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"></a><a name="08042412000003"></a>What jumps out from this is that any order would be made by the United Kingdom Secretary of State. I fully understand that, as employment law is reserved under Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act, whereas the running of the prisons is a responsibility of Scottish Ministers&#151;it was my personal responsibility from 1999 to 2003. I ask the Minister to confirm that this is done with the full agreement of Scottish Ministers and that there will not be a Minister from the current Administration who cries &#147;Foul&#148; at a future stage. Given that it is possible to transfer specific functions and albeit that the generality of functions are

It could be done very narrowly and would not upset the generality of the reservation on employment law.</p>

<a name="80423-0020.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_471"></a><a name="08042412000004"></a>Another point I raise for clarification is that the following clause, Clause 138, has a power to suspend the operation of Section 127. Is there any reason why there is not a separate Scottish provision on that, should at some future stage an order be made to activate Section 127? Is there a reason why we would not have a separate Scottish power to deactivate it or suspend it, as would appear to be the case under Clause 138 for the rest of the United Kingdom?</p>

On the specific questions raised by the noble Lord, the structure that is brought forward here is based on the fact, as I have already said, that the provisions arising from employment matters relate to UK law and therefore it is appropriate that it is the UK Parliament that deals with the matter. I understand that the approach we are taking has the support of Scottish Ministers, and that they have no objection to how we are taking this forward. Clearly, the general issues raised by the noble Lord will be considered in the current discussions on devolution. He will know of the commission that has been established in the light of the resolution by the pro-union parties within the Scottish Parliament. No doubt some general issues will need to be discovered, but as far as I am aware there is no concern about the approach that we are taking. It is very much a matter for Scottish Ministers to come to the Government in this Parliament if they wish to do so. I echo the noble Lord&#146;s point that we hope that that will not need to happen. It is essentially a preventive measure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_475"></a><a name="08042412000011"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, for taking the time with his extensive Bill team to see me regarding this clause, meeting my concerns and elaborating further through providing examples of why the Government feel that the clauses are extremely important.</p>

<a name="80423-0020.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_476"></a><a name="08042412000012"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that, when a responsible authority makes a disclosure about a child or young person under the age of 18, safeguards are built into it. I shall now try to work out how disclosure will apply in these cases. I understand that the Government have met the relevant charities involved with children and have tried to reassure them, but there are one or two areas of ambiguity and I would like the Minister to clarify where we stand.</p>

<a name="80423-0020.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_477"></a><a name="08042412000013"></a>First, we understand that the Government are proposing that each local area be evaluated or assessed in relation to whether it is safe to manage the disclosure of information about children. Will the Minister accept that that must include independent scrutiny involving the respective charities that deal with the children? Secondly, when considering how to extend the scheme to those under 18, will the Government consult other stakeholders about the safeguards? Thirdly, will the regulations include a requirement for MAPPAs to consult the local safeguarding children boards before making any disclosure about someone aged under 18?</p>

<a name="80423-0020.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_478"></a><a name="08042412000014"></a>The Minister has reassured me in writing and he recognises the need to ensure that factors associated with young offenders, particularly those demonstrating sexually harmful behaviour, are taken into consideration. He said that the Government were amending statutory guidance to ensure that those issues are taken into account by the relevant local MAPPA boards.</p>

<a name="80423-0020.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_479"></a><a name="08042412000015"></a>This is an extremely important issue. We know that local safeguarding children boards are an important aspect under the new children&#146;s service arrangements, and this is a positive move. It is important that children and young people who exhibit sexually harmful behaviour do not suffer from the consequences of adult-focused legislation and rules around disclosure which treat them as if they were adult sex offenders. They are not. The circumstances of their offending are very different. In terms of rehabilitation, there are far more positive ways that such offending can be dealt with if safeguards are met and disclosure rules are dealt with carefully, taking into account the people involved in those areas. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_276"></a>
<a name="08042415000002"></a><a name="80423-0020.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80423-0020.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08042415000109"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> My Lords, Amendment No. 115AC highlights the need to take into account factors particularly associated with young offenders. The noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, is right that we had a very useful meeting in which we discussed this and went through some of the details because we all recognise the concerns of the noble Baroness and that this is an important area we need to resolve.</p>

<a name="80423-0020.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_480"></a><a name="08042415000003"></a>However, we do not believe that establishing a statutory role for local safeguarding children boards within the process of disclosure is necessary or appropriate. Local safeguarding children boards have primarily a co-ordinating function in relation to the  


<notus-date day="23" month="4" year="2008" textMonth="Apr"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1630"></a><b>23 Apr 2008 : Column 1630</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bodies or persons represented rather than a responsibility for the operational management of particular cases. We believe that involving them might, on occasion, slow things down and make them not as efficient as they should be.</p>

<a name="80423-0020.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a><a name="08042415000004"></a>A MAPPA responsible authority&#151;this answers some of the noble Baroness&#146;s worries&#151;must act in co-operation with various organisations, including social services, the local education authority and youth offending teams, under Section 325 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The chief officer of police, the local probation board and youth offending teams are also all on the local safeguarding children board and in discharging their functions they must make arrangements to ensure that they have regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. All those bodies are pulled in and utilised when decisions are being made. Any young person who becomes the subject of a disclosure would have been referred to MAPPA by the youth offending team, which would be responsible for the management of the case and would be involved in the decision and the ongoing risk management plan for that youngster who, we recognise, could have particular difficulties and problems.</p>

<a name="80423-0020.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a><a name="08042415000005"></a>We acknowledge the importance of involving those bodies in any decision to disclose information about a young offender. Accordingly, we have revised the statutory guidance for MAPPA responsible authorities, which will be published in June. It has been developed in consultation with the NSPCC and Barnardo&#146;s, among other bodies with an interest in children, and they are content with moving ahead on this basis. The guidance will state that when decisions about disclosure are being made about an offender under 18, representatives from children&#146;s services and youth offending services must be at that MAPPA meeting. If they are not present, the disclosure decision should not be made. I hope that reassures the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80423-0020.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a><a name="08042415000006"></a>However, we cannot accept the amendment. The decision to disclose information under this duty must be a considered decision involving all the relevant agencies. This clause will help to ensure that that is the case. By introducing into the process of disclosure another multi-agency body which meets only quarterly, Amendment No. 115ACrisks delaying and unnecessarily complicating a process that is intended to protect children from a risk of serious harm. We believe that the existing process and the revisions we will make to the new guidance are the most effective way of ensuring that the needs of young offenders are balanced against the need to protect the children who they may put at risk. I hope the noble Baroness is persuaded of that and is reassured that her concerns have been considered to the extent that she feels able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08042352000009"></a><a name="80423-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80423-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08042352000028"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (Baroness Vadera):</b> The following Statement provides information on the Informal Competitiveness Council in Brdo, Slovenia on 16 April 2008, at which I represented the UK. The meeting was chaired by Andrej Vizjak, Slovenian Economics Minister.</p>

<a name="80423-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08042352000010"></a>The theme of the morning session was &#147;From SME Policy to High-growth Innovative Enterprise Policy&#148;, with a discussion on the key challenges SMEs face in their growth phase. This session provided an opportunity for competitiveness Ministers to give their views on the forthcoming EU &#147;Small Business Act&#148; before the Commission's proposal expected in July. The council agreed that the growth potential and flexibility of small and medium-sized enterprises are key forces driving economic growth, productivity and improving competitiveness. There was also a large degree of consensus on the importance of tackling regulatory burdens on small business. I intervened to outline the UK response to the Commission consultation, and our priority areas:</p>
an ambitious package of better regulation measures to bring about a step change in how the EU develops policy and legislation to better address the needs of SMEs, including through specific measures such as exemptions or simplifications in the &#147;think small first&#148; policy, and other specific measures;increasing access to finance for SMEs through action to address supply and demand-side market failures, underpinned by commercial solutions, focusing on removing barriers to cross-border investment in venture capital and developing a common EU regime for private placement of investment funds;action to make it easier for SMEs to trade in the single market and beyond; and the importance of innovation and having a single speedy and low-cost EU patent system.
<a name="80423-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08042352000011"></a>In the afternoon session, there was a discussion on &#147;The Business of Climate Change&#151;Sustainable Industrial Policy and the Commercial Opportunities of Climate Change Mitigation&#148;. The European Commission intends to publish a communication on this subject in May 2008, including a number of directives related to environmental performance of products. I intervened to encourage a market-based approach, emphasise the opportunities for industry of a shift to a low-carbon economy, and to stress the crucial role of the emissions trading scheme in internalising the price of carbon in the market and the importance of openness to international trade.</p>

<a name="80423-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08042352000016"></a>The Legal Services Act received Royal Assent on 30 October 2007. Two of the key elements of the Act are the provision of a Legal Services Board (LSB) and the establishment of an Office for Legal Complaints (OLC). The LSB will be an over-arching regulator and the OLC will deal with all complaints about regulated legal service providers.</p>

<a name="80423-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08042352000017"></a>I am pleased to announce that, in consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, I have appointed David Edmonds to the position of chair of the LSB.

<a name="08042352000024"></a><a name="80423-wms0001.htm_spmin6"></a><b><a name="80423-wms0001.htm_spmin7"></a><a name="08042352000033"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (Baroness Morgan of Drefelin):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills (John Denham) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement:</p>

<a name="80423-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08042352000025"></a>I have decided on the next steps for the implementation and development of the research excellence framework. We will move towards a single unified funding and assessment framework for all subject areas as originally planned, but within this, the balance of metric indicators, including bibliometrics, and light-touch expert review will vary according to the subject. In order to allow sufficient time to develop this more flexible approach, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) will now build an additional 12 months into the timetable for designing the new framework.</p>

<a name="80423-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08042352000026"></a>The extra time allowed for testing and piloting will give maximum assurance that the new arrangements are workable, without compromising our overall objective of having them fully operational in time for the beginning of academic year 2014-15.</p>

<a name="80423-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08042352000027"></a>HEFCE has reported to me the outcome of the recent UK-wide consultation exercise on the assessment and funding of higher education research post 2008. The consultation responses indicated broad support for the proposals but highlighted some concerns about the timetable for developing and piloting the proposals as well as about the demarcation between the sciences and all other subjects.</p>

<a name="08042372000086"></a><a name="80423w0002.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80423w0002.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08042372000185"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> For a polygamous marriage to be considered valid in the UK, the parties must be domiciled in a country where polygamous marriage is permitted, and must have entered into the marriage in that country. Provided the parties follow the necessary requirements under the law of the country in question, the marriage would be recognised in England and Wales. The law is drafted thus because the Government have no desire forcibly to sever relationships that have been lawfully contracted in other jurisdictions. This should not, however, be construed as government approval of polygamous marriage. The Government do not support polygamous marriage and support the law that prohibits parties from contracting polygamous marriages in this jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_24"></a><a name="08042372000090"></a>Staffing requirements for all ports, including Heathrow, are calculated using a workforce planning methodology which takes into account information provided by port operators on scheduling, predicted passenger loads and nationalities, and estimates of transaction times. Staff are also re-deployed according to where the risk is highest.</p>

<a name="80423w0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_25"></a><a name="08042372000091"></a>We have carried out a critical review of how our resources are deployed in order to achieve better value for money and identify efficiencies. This has ensured that warranted staff are deployed only on operational work and that non operational work is undertaken by non-warranted officers.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_26"></a><a name="08042372000092"></a>Since March 2005 we have significantly increased the number of operational grades deployed nationally&#151;by 35 per cent, in fact. This comprises inspectors, chief immigration officers, immigration officers and assistant immigration officers. The number of staff employed at specific ports will vary from day to day. Likewise, there are seasonal variations in line with passenger pressures and peak holiday periods.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_27"></a><a name="08042372000093"></a>BIA is committed to increasing the use of automated technology to facilitate passengers through arrivals controls without compromising border security. An example is the IRIS immigration recognition system (IRIS). IRIS enrolment stations and gates are available at all four Heathrow terminals and to both Gatwick terminals. Two gates will be available at the new Heathrow terminal 5. As at 7 March, 181,460 people had enrolled on IRIS and 909,028 crossings had taken place.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_28"></a><a name="08042372000094"></a>A snapshot of operational grades at Heathrow on  1 January 2006 and 16 October 2007 shows figures of 849 and 829 immigration officers respectively. Recruitment is ongoing to further increase this number, with a total of 385 additional operational staff being recruited across Border Control.</p>

The equivalent figure for car drivers of all ages was three fatalities per billion vehicle kilometres. The fatality rate for young drivers is therefore around seven times higher than for drivers of all ages. Information is not available for single years.</p>
