However, I am sure she is aware of a Mencap survey published last week that revealed that fewer than one in 10 schools has a disability equality scheme in place, despite now having a legal duty now to do so. What are the Government&#146;s intentions here, not least because eight out of 10 children with a learning disability are still being bullied at school? What further action do the Government intend to take to inform and support school heads and governors with regard to their disability equality responsibilities and to ensure that all teachers receive sufficient training and retraining to support the full range of children with special needs in our schools?</p>

We believe that schools are working towards achieving that and doing better year on year, but there is still a long way to go. Much needs to be done to support head teachers and governors, whose roles are key, to promote further and better teacher training. The Government are using all channels available to us to promote this important development.</p>

Many of them are unable even to think of equality because of the way in which they are dealt with by bullies in schools. Can we have a more vigorous implementation of the Act by the Government and more pressure on head teachers to ensure that children have a degree of equality?</p>

Disabled children experience far too high a level of bullying in schools. Last week was National Anti-Bullying Week and we issued new guidance on the bullying of children with special educational needs and disabilities. We also issued a DVD to raise awareness of the effects of bullying in schools because that is where children, ultimately, have a real opportunity to change attitudes.</p>

Many people with disabilities are perfectly capable of holding down such a very challenging job as teaching and they would, of course, provide tremendous role models within schools for children with disabilities, teaching them that they can do anything.</p>

That is why an accessibility plan is very important for children and for adults. The new teacher-training units which we are developing are about creating awareness of schools&#146; responsibilities in the widest possible sense with regard to disability discrimination and the role of the Act in promoting an inclusive school community.</p>

We know from Ofsted that 75 per cent of schools feel confident that they are complying fully with their duties. However, that is not good enough and we aspire to see a much higher number, Ofsted being in a position, in the future, to report a much higher and more successful achievement of compliance in our schools.</p>

The noble Lord is correct that the decision to set a date by which it would withdraw will create a future gap. At the moment, President-elect Obama has made it clear both that there will be a major surge deployment into Afghanistan, and that he will expect more from his NATO allies.

In pursuit of this absurd and masochistic policy for this country, has the Minister&#146;s department made an estimate, as it should have done, of how big an increase in energy prices for business, industry and the consumer will be required to achieve this objective?</p>

The amendment which we put forward when the House last considered this matter proposed that the discussion on the DNA database should be put on a statutory basis.

The DNA database cost this country &#163;2.5 million in 2008. We have simply proposed that anyone who thinks they may be on the database should be able to write to the person holding the

If their name came off the database it would reduce the cost of the database. I cannot see that it would cost the country much more to answer those questions than the amount currently being spent. It would also minimise the problem of holding people&#146;s information on a database.</p>

<a name="81124-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="0811247000086"></a>The problem here, which the legislation increases, is the holding of people&#146;s DNA information. As we discussed last time, why should the Government hold virtually in perpetuity the details of what makes up innocent people who are guilty of no crime and who have been found not to be guilty of any crime? How this amendment could meet the general tenor required of a privilege amendment simply defeats me. I very much hope that the Minister will go further in his reply to this debate than he did when he rejected our amendment and tell us what the major problem is. People should not be on this database. It seems completely fatuous to say that the problem with the amendment is cost. Finding out why the information is being held will cost about the same as a first-class stamp and require just a brief examination. That is a very poor reason for the Commons not to accept this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="0811247000087"></a>In reconstructing the amendment we have tried to meet one of the problems raised when we previously considered the proposal&#151;that it should be possible to maintain information for security purposes and there should be no obligation to reply to questions relating to it. Our amendment now appropriately addresses that problem and leaves the matter in the Government&#146;s hands.</p>

<a name="81124-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0811247000088"></a>We are seeking to ensure that there is a proper debate as soon as possible on the current state and future direction of the DNA database. That is what our amendment amounts to. We want consistent and transparent guidelines to be established to govern the retention of DNA; increased public awareness; and an opportunity for the recommendations of various governmental and non-governmental bodies to be considered and implemented. The Minister has echoed those aims. He has never said that there should not be such a debate. In fact, although he put down his marker by saying he does not think there should be statutory guidelines, I think he has said that he would welcome such a debate. He certainly agreed in Committee that there was a need for a wider debate given the number of organisations campaigning for one.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0811247000089"></a>It is extremely difficult to believe that anyone thinks there should not be a proper discussion. I very much doubt that anyone in this country who has had contact with the police and had their DNA taken would understand why they were on a database. A number of people have written to me since the previous debate to say, as I have said before, that they had no idea that their DNA would not be destroyed after its retention and their incorporation in the database were found unnecessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0811247000090"></a>The Human Genetics Commission, a body explicitly set up to advise the Government on matters such as this, said that it feels,</p>
<ul><a name="0811247000254"></a>&#147;strongly that the forensic use of DNA and genetic information has not yet been subject to significant public debate&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="0811247000222"></a>Those views are echoed by other non-government organisations. Many bodies have already established the many areas that need to be covered by such a debate. Questions about whose DNA should be taken, how long it should be kept for, how it should be used and who it should be shared with, all need to be properly answered.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="0811247000091"></a>The database has increased incrementally and the Government give all sorts of reasons, including counter-terrorism reasons, why the liberty of individuals should be compromised. However, they seem at variance even with themselves about the answer to the questions we have posed. As I highlighted in Committee, the National DNA Database Ethics Group, the Government&#146;s own body set up to oversee the database, has in all its recommendations drawn attention to the fact that what is happening is not what anybody would have expected. It considers that the current guidelines on retention are not proportionate and do not mesh with data protection and human rights legislation.</p>

<a name="81124-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="0811247000092"></a>There is similarly agreement between all the advisory bodies, and other bodies, that there must be more transparency and public awareness of the situation. The police DNA database is currently subject to data protection rules, as the Information Commissioner&#146;s website makes clear. Individuals can ask to see the information about them held on computer and in some paper records. If an individual wants to exercise their subject access right they should write to the person or organisation which they believe is processing the data, not to the Information Commissioner.</p>

<a name="81124-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="0811247000093"></a>As the Minister said in Committee, the guidelines are on the ACPO website. However, the information is clearly not reaching people. The guidelines are buried in appendix 2 of a document that is almost impossible to find unless you know exactly where to look. There are frequent examples of people attempting to remove their information from the database and being appalled to discover the exceptional circumstances that they must prove before that is possible. In Committee I cited the only example given on the ACPO website outlining how someone could get off the database: if they were suspected of murder but it was eventually found that no crime had been committed. As things stand, that is the only way in which one can be removed.</p>

<a name="81124-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="0811247000094"></a>All these concerns are neatly summed up in a recommendation of the Home Affairs Select Committee. In its fifth report this year, it said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="0811247000236"></a>&#147;In order to facilitate a full debate and an appropriate level of Parliamentary scrutiny we recommend that ... the Government introduce primary legislation&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="0811247000237"></a>I underline primary&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0811247000255"></a>&#147;to replace the current regulatory framework for the National DNA Database. We recommend that this legislation&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="0811247000095"></a>I note legislation&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0811247000256"></a>&#147;provide for a more accessible mechanism by which individuals can challenge the decision to retain their records on the Database&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811247000223"></a>It went on:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="0811247000238"></a>&#147;The Government should reconsider the ways in which National DNA database information is collected, handled, stored and transferred. In particular we recommend that in order to minimise the data held, the Home Office and the police should review the identifiers used for samples and the policy of retaining samples&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="0811247000096"></a>Statutory guidelines, which are what the amendment asks for, would ensure that the Government&#146;s policy on DNA receives the attention it deserves and also ensure consistency. The current situation means that there is a postcode lottery in whether innocent people can have their information removed from the database or even obtain information about whether their information is on it. Given the ongoing debates on whether the database is already too large, that is unacceptable. The legislation increases the possibility of that happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="0811247000097"></a>The Minister did not quite make clear the effect of the Commons&#146; response. They have decided that our amendment constitutes potentially significant spending commitments, but I find it hard to understand where all this money will be spent. I hope that the Minister will take this last opportunity to clarify the Government&#146;s intentions in this area. Will they implement any of their advisory bodies&#146; recommendations, and when can we expect the next review of the guidelines? A wealth of information and opinion is available from governmental and non-governmental bodies, and the same conclusion has been reached: there need to be proper debate and proper statutory guidelines relating to the information held on innocent citizens of this country. We need to open up that debate again. We opened it during the passage of this legislation because of the expectation that there will be an increase in the amount of such information. I hope very much that the Minister will be able to give us a more satisfactory reply than appears to have come from the other place.</p>

First, can the noble Lord give us an idea of the cost of implementing the amendment? I find it hard to conceive of almost any amendment passed by this House to criminal legislation or matters of that kind that does not involve some form of trivial expense.</p>

<a name="81124-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0811247000099"></a>Secondly, have the Government really given thought to where this course will take them? In the Constitution Committee, we have learnt that citizens of this country are 15 times more likely to be on the national DNA database than are citizens in America. In this country, more than 7 per cent of the population is on it, compared with 0.5 per cent of the population in America.</p>

<a name="81124-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0811247000100"></a>If we are really to be told that the Government should not be required to spend a pittance in considering whether people should be taken off the database, the simple and only answer&#151;I suspect that it is also the best answer&#151;is that anyone who has not been committed of a criminal offence should be automatically removed. That would save money and then the other place would have to give thought to the effect of its point, rather than take this rather remarkable monetary line.</p>

As I understand it, the point is contained in the Parliament Act 1911 and relates to the House of Commons certifying something as a matter of privilege, which it becomes if it involves actual expenditure or possible expenditure. Therefore, the issue is not whether the House of Commons is correct in that matter but whether the Speaker of the House of Commons has certified to that effect. If that has happened, it seems to me that, for all its merits, eloquence and, indeed, sincerity, this discussion is irrelevant.</p>

It seems to create a dangerous precedent. The Government have not chosen to advance any arguments against the amendment; they have simply used this financial privilege mechanism, even though the amount of money that is being talked about is very small. If this House rolls over and accepts the situation, we could be laying ourselves open to dozens of amendments coming back with this reason. I do not feel that that would treat your Lordships&#146; House with sufficient regard. I hope that the Minister will explain exactly what the costs will be, why they are so high and why this is such a consideration when all the arguments advanced by the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, are important ones, which the Government should answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0811247000107"></a>It seems strange that this unelected House should be more concerned about individual freedom and the information that is held on the private subject than the elected House of Commons is. I would expect the House of Commons to express great concern, as the Select Committee has. I would expect that it would want to ensure that information held by the police and the security services is essential and that information should not be held in respect of people who are completely innocent of any crime. That is what concerns me about the attitude of the Commons.</p>

I hope that the Minister will tell us that the Government are concerned about this. I hope that their failure to accept the amendment is only a holding operation and that they are as concerned about individual freedom and the protection of the citizen as we are. I hope that they intend to examine the matter in depth and, in due course, to bring forward legislation to protect the citizen from having unnecessary information held by the police, the security services and, perhaps, a whole range of other organisations.</p>

In this country, there is a wide range of views. Some people think that anybody who has not been convicted of a crime should not be on the database, whereas a large number of people think that 100 per cent of the population should be on it. This answers the point of the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe. There needs to be a debate about this, because all those points of view are valid. I have talked to government colleagues about this and I am not quite clear exactly how it will be done, although I certainly do not think that it will be done in this context.</p>

However, as far as I understand it&#151;I know that I am new to this House&#151;it is an established convention not to challenge the reasons why the other place has disagreed to an amendment when it does so on the ground of financial privilege.

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0811247000126"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, the Minister has summed up the issue. This amendment addresses the rights of families and society that an inquest be held within a reasonable time. The UK has been proud to fulfil that right since long before the Human Rights Act existed. As the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, reminded us on Report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11"></a><a name="0811247000247"></a>&#147;The obligation under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights to have a prompt inquiry into a death at the hands of an agent of the state is a heavy one. It is a vital part of the state&#146;s accountability to its citizens&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/11/08; col. 600.]</p>
</ul>
<a name="81124-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0811247000127"></a>I remind the House of the urgent need for this amendment. It has been highlighted by two cases in particular, one of which has been outstanding for three and a half years, apparently due to the fact that the coroner might be faced with sensitive intercept material. We also heard about the work programme dealing with the outcome of the Chilcot review and it seems that any comprehensive solution to the use of intercept material evidence is some way off. In the mean time, these inquests must be held or we will simply not be Article 2 compliant, nor doing right by the families of these people and society as a whole. The amendment is the solution.</p>

<a name="81124-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0811247000128"></a>Since we last debated this issue in your Lordships&#146; House, it has been the subject of an especially well informed and interesting debate in another place. Richard Shepherd MP there said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0811247000258"></a>&#147;there is a wider public interest, which is that everyone should be assured that the processes are above board and clear. We all have an interest in an examination of the facts surrounding the death. In arguing the case for national security, the Minister is effectively saying that he is unable to give us any understanding or take us into any confidence as to how conclusions in such cases are reached or whether they are justifiable. That is the dilemma that we all face in this society. Our uncertainties about those who make judgments on these issues make some of us extremely cautious about permitting secrecy of that nature&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/11/08; col. 276.]</ul>
<p><a name="0811247000224"></a>That sums up the dilemma very well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0811247000129"></a>Those honourable and right honourable Members who contributed to the debate in the other place made some very helpful points which I have today incorporated into my original amendment. In particular, the contribution of the right honourable Mr Douglas Hogg MP was very valuable. He has had the experience of being responsible for GCHQ for a number of years. He said that the amendment, which he strongly supported, would be further improved if it was amended to the effect that the disclosure would not be injurious to the national interest, a point supported by my friend David Heath, who felt that further refinement is required. That is what we have done.</p>

<a name="81124-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="0811247000130"></a>Indeed, the Minister himself, the noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, said on Report that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12"></a><a name="0811247000248"></a>&#147;Disclosure of intercept capabilities would have a real and damaging impact on our ability to gather the intelligence that is vital to our national security&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/11/08; col. 602.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811247000225"></a>In response to this, we have added proposed new paragraph (d)(ii)(a), (b) and (c), which is a graded disclosure menu from which the judge sitting as a coroner can choose. The Government no longer rely on the reason for rejecting this&#151;that there is no mechanism to appoint a judge as a coroner&#151;which the Minister originally claimed in this House. We corrected the record here but it was repeated in the other place by the Minister, Vernon Coaker. I therefore put on record again that under Section 14 of the Coroners Act 1988 coroners can apply for the jurisdiction of an inquest to go to a circuit or High Court judge. I remind the House that a judge is sitting on the ongoing inquest into the Jean Charles de Menezes case. We can dispose of that government objection and it then comes down to the national security issue. We accept that there are strong reasons for dealing with the issue of national security and our amendment now meets those concerns.</p>

<a name="81124-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="0811247000131"></a>In the interests of speeding up these inquests, which the Government will have to do, they will not need to invent a whole new mechanism. I hope that they will listen to the wise words of so many in the other place, which were summed up by Mr Edward Garnier when he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="0811247000249"></a>&#147;There are practical solutions that enable us to comply as best we can with article 2 and to allow the bereaved to have the necessary information to understand why their loved ones were killed or died. There is sufficient goodwill across this House and between the two Chambers of Parliament to enable us to arrive at a sensible solution&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/11/08; col. 289.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811247000226"></a>That is what I am asking for today.</p>

<a name="81124-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0811247000132"></a>The Government must trust the judges. If they accept the amendment, that is what they will be doing. If they fail to accept the amendment, they are saying that they do not trust the judges, and that is a very serious state of affairs. If they feel that the amendment could be further improved&#151;that it has technical flaws or is grammatically imperfect&#151;they have time to address that when they take it back to another place. What cannot continue is a situation where inquests such as those now outstanding run for more than three years.</p>

If, as the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, said, there were deficiencies in the previous amendment as regards the national security interest, it seems to these Benches that they have now been corrected with the detailed and specific amendment that replaces the original one. It does not seem that there is any risk of national security being prejudiced by the acceptance of the new amendments. In our view, Amendment No. 106B accommodates the concerns expressed in the other place.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0811247000136"></a>There is widespread support for this measure across your Lordships&#146; House and in another place. It will address an anomaly in RIPA and ensure that all inquests comply with Article 2 of the ECHR. The point is not simply that inquests should be institutionally independent, but that they should be prompt. Part of the problem here is that we are delaying justice in several cases, which is not good for the reputation of British justice.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0811247000137"></a>The Minister, and the Minister of State for Policing, Crime and Security in the other place, said that the Government will bring forward proposals to address these issues in the coroners Bill in the next Session. However, in outlining the proposals, the Minister of State said that the proposed power of the Secretary of State to issue a certificate requiring an inquest to be held without a jury will not necessarily allow intercept evidence to be admitted. It does not seem that we can rely on forthcoming legislation to accomplish what the amendment seeks to do. The Government have withheld their assent to the proposition that, in this legislation, the point will be accommodated.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0811247000138"></a>We cannot wait for&#151;or rely on&#151;the Government to act. From these Benches, I say that now that the Government&#146;s objections to the previous amendment have been met, it will be very disappointing&#151;I hope it will not be the case&#151;if the Government find themselves unable to accept an amendment that accommodates their previous objections. It is unacceptable that a number of inquests have been delayed and cannot take place because of a continuing anomaly in the law. We support the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0811247000140"></a>I can see the argument that we should wait for the coroners Bill to come to us, and the argument, perhaps even more relevant, that we should wait for the final report of the privy counsellors who are dealing with the question of intercept evidence. On the other hand, strong arguments have been put forward to deal with this particular case now. The reason given by the House of Commons for disagreeing with the Lords amendment is not altogether satisfactory; it is simply that,</p>
<ul><a name="0811247000259"></a>&#147;sensitive material should not be disclosed to members of the public&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811247000227"></a>But the coroner, when he is a High Court judge, is hardly to be regarded for that purpose as a member of the public&#151;nor, indeed, is counsel to the coroner.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0811247000141"></a>The only problem remains the reference in the amendment to &#147;other interested persons&#148;. That might well be said to go too wide, but it is dealt with in the final sub-paragraph of the amendment, which says that if the High Court judge has doubts about such a person, the material should be released to him in a redacted form, which would save the sensitivity of the information, and if it cannot be released to him in a redacted form it will not be released to him at all. For those reasons the amendment deserves our support.</p>

That is the crunch. These look like safe recommendations to protect national security&#151;what the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, described as a sort of tiering of protection&#151;but if the High Court judge says that the release of the material would prejudice national security and it is so severely redacted as to be of little use to the conduct of the coroners court, I am not clear what then happens.</p>

I admit that at Third Reading I voted against it because I am particularly keen to see a coroners Bill that is all-embracing and sweeps up a large number of other issues that I hope will be in it, such as matters affecting the Armed Forces and matters affecting those in custody, the families of whom have to wait far too long for a bereavement to be closed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0811247000144"></a>In the debate in the other place, however, I was very taken with the clarity of the arguments that were put forward and which have been quoted by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. Since then I have spoken to the solicitors involved in this case, who have been quoted both in this House and in the other place, who told me of the promises that have been made to them by the Government, stretching back to November 2007, that the case on which the many arguments have been based would be brought to a speedy solution. Nothing has happened. We have delays on the movement of government promises quite apart from the procedures in the Bill. I am satisfied in my own mind, if that does not sound arrogant, that the changes made to the amendment since it was last brought before us have advanced the issue a great deal further. I therefore hope that this time the Government will agree to the

I declare a not very relevant interest: I am an adviser to Cable &amp; Wireless plc, which is the second largest telecoms provider in this country. On a number of occasions, we have debated the use of intercept material and the implications for national security, especially for the sources of sensitive information on which we rely in this country and on whose reliance we have found the solution to a number of major threats. The problem is that this enters a very big back door.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0811247000146"></a>As a result of previous debates in this House and in the other place, the Chilcot committee was established. It is a committee of privy counsellors, appointed by the Prime Minister to look into the issues and concerns surrounding the use of intercept material. When it was appointed, it was the subject of widespread agreement. The Privy Counsellors from the three major parties and Sir John Chilcot considered the matter and established, in the final report, nine principles which the committee believed had to be addressed before intercept material could be used in our courts. The committee is now studying further those nine principles. The Home Office is engaged in a major inquiry to see how those matters can be addressed. I, and I dare say a number of other noble Lords, have been involved in that detailed consultation and there is an absolute determination to find solutions where solutions can be found.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0811247000147"></a>It would be entirely wrong for this House today to take a position which in many ways would pre-empt the work of the Chilcot committee and the outcome of the issues that it is considering. I do not intend, although I could, to argue the case here about the nature of the sensitive information we are talking about and the sources which might well be closed off if this principle were to be moved forward on the basis of pre-Chilcot sensitivities because I do not think that is particularly relevant. There are those who are interested in coroners courts and a coroners Bill has been promised, but the whole issue of intercept was genuinely agreed between all the parties to be a matter for the Chilcot committee and the work that was to be done after Chilcot&#146;s nine principles were established.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0811247000148"></a>To go down this road today, with whatever safeguards are thought of at this time to be sufficient, is to pre-empt the outcome of that very important matter. Knowing what I know, I believe that we enter into very dangerous territory, from this country's point of view, if we walk down this road without carefully examining all the implications. Therefore, I believe it is premature for us to vote in favour of this amendment today.</p>

I think we all acknowledge that the law surrounding coroners courts needs a great deal of updating and I am sure that the debates in this House and in the other place on the implications of that will be extremely interesting. We also have the work of the Chilcot committee. The report that we have already seen on the consideration of a committee of privy counsellors&#151;drawn together to look at how this matter might be taken forward&#151;identified a number of complicated issues that had to be addressed before we could be sure that national security was not being endangered by the admission of intercept evidence in a court.</p>

We should wait to see whether the Chilcot committee comes forward with proposals addressing the nine principles outlined in its earlier report. If I were being cynical, I would say that this amendment is intended to be the nose of the camel under the tent: if we accepted it, before we knew it we would have the rest of the camel inside the tent, and intercept evidence accepted in every area. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, does not intend that, but it is the case that we would be pre-empting the twin processes that are already in track&#151;the more important of those being the work of the Chilcot committee.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0811247000152"></a>It is a serious matter, and I believe that the technical issues that the Chilcot committee must address are complicated and very important to national security. I understand that when the congressional 9/11 Commission published its report, a reference to some particular intercept material was buried away 200 or 300 pages in. The fact that it was possible to carry out intercepts under those specific conditions had not previously been made public. I do not know whether the 9/11 Commission intended to make public the fact that such intercepts were possible, but the fact is that it did. I have been told that, to those who watch these things, the consequence of that was immediately noticeable. Certain types of conversation stopped happening and could no longer be intercepted&#151;and I notice the noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, nodding. The lesson is that we should be wary of the consequences of allowing these things to drift into the public domain by accident.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para13"></a>

One is: might the content of the intercept itself prejudice national security? The other is: would the fact of the intercept prejudice national security? It seems to me that however it is played, we are in danger of releasing

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0811247000154"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, asked an extremely important question: what then? We would then be faced with an inquest, and there would be certain material that would be known to exist but would not be released. That situation seems unsatisfactory to me. We have to find a way to address all these issues together, but this amendment is premature and unhelpful given all the other work being done, in particular by the Chilcot committee.</p>

I fail to see the distinction: he is the same person, carrying the same responsibilities whether sitting as a coroner or in the High Court. Therefore, it seems right to me that he should have the power to disclose it if he thinks that it will not prejudice the national interest and is the proper way to determine the cause of death.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0811247000156"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, asked what would happen if the judge made such an order of disclosure. The order could be challenged by way of judicial review in the High Court and beyond, so it would not necessarily be simply his final decision. There are so many points about inquests that require to be discussed. It is not helpful to say that there will be a Coroners Bill in so many months&#146; time. These inquests have been outstanding for a very long time.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0811247000157"></a>I am also concerned to hear, only this afternoon, for example, that the Ministry of Defence is refusing to support the legal costs of a family in an inquest next week.</p>

If the judge decides that the material is prejudicial to national security and accepts that redactions are significant, the material may be unusable in the court and we would have the same problem about the process of the inquest. That is all that I am saying. I am not saying that the judge would be wrong in his judgments.</p>

If, through redaction or whatever, he decides that the information is not of any use to a jury or to himself, he will not rely on it in any way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0811247000160"></a>I heard only today that the Ministry of Defence was unwilling to support the costs of the family of a sergeant who was killed in a collision between helicopters last year, in an inquest that is to take place a week next Tuesday. We have to look broadly at inquests and at how families are to be properly supported in making representations before them. The proposal in the amendment is something that we can do now to ensure that delayed inquests can be heard and that the families can have some satisfaction.</p>

<a name="0811247000161"></a><a name="81124-0004.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="81124-0004.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="0811247000641"></a>Lord West of Spithead:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, for the amendments. They are a valiant attempt to address the knotty problem of ensuring that coroners&#146; inquests can progress while protecting sensitive material from public disclosure. There has been considerable debate in this House and in the other place about the broad issues.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0811247000162"></a>Unfortunately, for reasons that I shall go into, Amendment No. 106B does not provide a solution to this most difficult of problems. It would enable a High Court judge sitting as a coroner to require disclosure of sensitive material where he is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist that make disclosure essential to enable matters that are required to be ascertained by an inquest to be ascertained. Where this material is central to ascertaining the cause of death but there are national security concerns over its disclosure, he could not disclose it to the jury.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0811247000163"></a>However, it is the jury, not the coroner, who are the finders of fact in these coroners&#146; inquests; and as the noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, pointed out, the jury already has material in redacted form. So the amendment would still not enable inquests to be completed or provide any further material to the jury and interested parties that cannot already be made available to them, and indeed already is available to them. That redacted information, without the material about which there is a security concern, is provided to them.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0811247000164"></a>In view of the ongoing Chilcot review and the work we intend to do in the Coroners Bill, the points on pre-emption made by my noble friends Lord Robertson and Lord Harris are valid as well. However, in view of the point about redacted material and the question of what will be gained, this amendment would not achieve the right result&#151;much as I wish that it did, as it would be very good to resolve the issue. The amendment tries to resolve it but does not. For those reasons, I ask the noble Baroness not to press her Amendments Nos. 106B and 133B.</p>

<p><a name="st_89"></a>
<a name="0811247000165"></a><a name="81124-0004.htm_spnew20"></a><b><a name="81124-0004.htm_spnew21"></a><a name="0811247000642"></a>Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</b> My Lords, I thank noble Lords who spoke in this interesting debate. This amendment is the best possible solution before the Coroners Bill arrives. Apparently that Bill will be in the next Queen&#146;s Speech and could receive Royal Assent next year; or it could be one of the 10 or 12 Bills that it is rumoured will now be dropped. I absolutely understand the points about the Chilcot review. When it is complete and is taken together with the Coroners Bill, a better solution might be found. In the mean time, however, there will still be outstanding inquests that cannot be held. Is it really acceptable that these inquests should drag on year after year while this House and another place search for the perfect solution? I hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, said, but, with all due respect, it dealt with a hypothetical situation. We are not there yet. In one of the two outstanding cases, the IPCC itself said that it could proceed to inquest. If a body like that did not see problems with it, it suggests that it thought that an inquest could reasonably be held.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0811247000166"></a>The noble Lord, Lord West, says this is a valiant attempt, which I think is damning with faint praise. I do not mind that at all. However, I cannot accept that  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1304"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1304</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>our tradition of holding prompt inquests into the deaths of citizens at the hands of the state should be set aside. The Minister can always quote matters of national security. I fully accept how important those are, and I have given as much room as I can for the judgment of the judge to deal with them. Ultimately, however, it comes down to whether the Government think that the judge can take that amount of responsibility, which he can; and whether he is to be trusted, which the Government must say they do.</p>

<a name="81124-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0811247000167"></a>If the system does not work for the inquests that are stacking up at the moment we will have lost time and they will not be valuable, as the noble Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, pointed out. On the other hand, the likelihood is that they will proceed. Some answers, even if redacted, will be found, and those inquests will have been held. I would therefore invite the House to agree with me.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="0811247000173"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this debate is very timely and will be welcomed by Members on all sides of the House. Recently, we have been paying tribute, as we always do at this time of year, to those who have been killed or injured in action. This year, our time of remembrance was especially poignant as we marked the 90th anniversary of the Armistice and remembered the sacrifices made in conflicts from 1914 to the present day. It is not an exaggeration to say that the freedoms that we enjoy were bought at a very high price. It is right that as a nation we reflect on what our predecessors achieved for our sake. It is also important to reflect on the sacrifices that the brave men and women of our Armed Forces continue to make in order to defend our vital national interests. Some have paid the ultimate price, even very recently. We owe them all a huge debt of gratitude and offer our deepest condolences to their families.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0811247000174"></a>There can be no doubt that the British Armed Forces are working extremely hard. Ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan mean that they are operating at a high tempo. On a daily basis they demonstrate their courage, dedication and professionalism. They are stretched but, as the chiefs have said, the situation is manageable. In such times, the nation and the Government have a duty to offer more than just warm words. The demands that we impose on our Armed Forces are unique and we must ensure that they receive the support and recognition that they deserve.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0811247000175"></a>The national recognition study, which the Government commissioned and which reported earlier this year, highlighted ways in which the country could do more to show its appreciation. I am glad that it has caught the imagination of the public. Since its publication, we  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1307"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1307</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have seen the nation doing more to celebrate and honour our Armed Forces. Only last week, large crowds lined the streets of Colchester to welcome back 16 Air Assault Brigade. That is not a unique occurrence, but it is one that I hope will continue. It is an appropriate form of recognition, which I would like to see in more towns and cities around the country.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0811247000176"></a>While recognition is important, we must ensure that our service men and women, their families and those who have left the services get the support that they need and merit. That is why this Government launched the service personnel Command Paper in July this year. This set out for the first time ever the nation&#146;s commitment to the Armed Forces constituency, which numbers around 10 million people. Cross-government, some 40 initiatives are being taken forward and are starting to deliver. For example, we expect the first payments doubling the compensation lump sum to be made before the end of this year and we have already extended eligibility for the affordable housing programme in England for a further 12 months post-discharge. These and other initiatives will ensure that those who serve their country are not disadvantaged by virtue of what they do or the circumstances of their work and that, where necessary, they are given special treatment.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0811247000177"></a>This is not all jam tomorrow. We have already done much across the board to improve the lot of our service personnel. Pay has been going up above inflation for the past two years. In February, we accepted the Armed Forces Pay Review Body&#146;s recommendation of a 2.6 per cent pay rise for all service men and women&#151;among the best in the public sector. This award builds on last year&#146;s increase of 3.3 per cent&#151;also the highest in the public sector. The 2007 award included a 9.4 per cent pay increase for some 13,000 of the most junior trained service personnel. It should be remembered that this is just basic pay; it does not include the free medical care, subsidised accommodation, food and a range of allowances on top of the basic salary. We have also introduced a wide-ranging operational welfare package. It includes more free calls for those on the front line so that they can stay in touch with people at home, free internet access, free post and council tax rebates, to name just a few.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0811247000178"></a>We recognise that accommodation is a key concern for personnel. Decades of underinvestment have left some service accommodation in poor condition, but that is something that we are putting right. In the next 10 years, we will be spending &#163;8.4 billion in that area alone. Over the past seven years, the MoD has upgraded around 13,000 family homes to the top standard. I am pleased to say that by the end of this year there will no longer be any service families living in accommodation at the lowest tier of standards. We are also improving single living accommodation. Some 30,000 new or improved bed spaces have already been delivered. A further investment of &#163;1.7 billion will be made in the next decade.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0811247000179"></a>Recently opened improvements at Catterick demonstrate the level of accommodation that we are putting in place. In Catterick&#151;the Army&#146;s largest garrison&#151;1,800 of the soldiers from 4 Mechanised Brigade now have their own en suite rooms. Since 2002, some 2,800 new bedrooms have been completed  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1308"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1308</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as part of the &#163;330 million programme to develop the super-garrison. The MoD is also building a physiotherapy centre, dining facilities, a sport and leisure centre and swimming pool, as well as redeveloping Catterick town centre under a major private finance initiative contract.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0811247000180"></a>I will take this opportunity to give noble Lords an update on Wellington Barracks, an issue that has been raised with me on the Floor of the House. I have acknowledged that the barracks are in need of improvement, but plans are being developed to do everything possible to bring such improvements about. Work is already in hand to improve the standard of the accommodation, with showers being refurbished, junior ranks&#146; communal areas being redecorated and site-wide heating repairs and upgrades. Additionally, a band rehearsal block is being built to replace facilities that were lost with the disposal of Chelsea Barracks. In total, it is anticipated that over &#163;10 million will be spent on making improvements at Wellington Barracks over the next two years.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0811247000181"></a>However, we do not only focus on the accommodation that the MoD provides. We are also improving access to the property ladder for service personnel and those leaving the forces. Next year, we expect to launch a &#163;20 million pilot scheme to promote home ownership. These are some of the things that we are doing in that area.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0811247000182"></a>Those who put themselves in harm&#146;s way on our behalf must be assured that if they need medical attention it is of the best quality possible, both on operations and here in the UK. In Afghanistan, our forces have access to world-standard care provided at Camp Bastion&#151;some colleagues will have seen that facility. There is a deployed hospital with all the associated support elements, including emergency medicine, primary surgery, an intensive care unit, medium and low-dependency nursing care beds and diagnostic support, including a CT scanner. The skills that medical professionals pick up in that field hospital are proving extremely beneficial; medical staff return to work in the UK with valuable experience. As well as that centre, additional facilities are deployed at local and unit levels to provide front-line medical support as well as an airborne evacuation in-theatre capability.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0811247000183"></a>Here in the UK, the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine at the University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust is now recognised as one of the best in the world for military medical attention. The military ward within the Birmingham New Hospital will ensure that service casualties continue to receive the same excellent level of care but in the greater privacy of single-bedded and four-bedded rooms, which all patients in that hospital will enjoy.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0811247000184"></a>The inspirational recoveries made by our injured personnel show the incredible spirit and determination of those individuals and what can be achieved with the right support. That is why we are now investing a further &#163;24 million to maintain and enhance the first-class facilities that we have at Headley Court and why we are also working to improve regional and primary care rehabilitation facilities across the UK. However, it is obvious that our most urgent responsibility is to those on the front line in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is why we are spending billions of pounds on new and improved equipment, both for the short and the long terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0811247000185"></a>Of course, money alone does not give the full picture, but in the past three years we have delivered more than &#163;10 billion-worth of equipment to the Armed Forces, &#163;4.5 billion of it in the past financial year. I think that these figures demonstrate how seriously we take equipping those on the front line. As a result, our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are now better equipped than ever before, both for their own protection and for carrying out their missions. Commanders on the ground have told me first-hand that they have never had so much good-quality kit. However, if you asked any commander if he would like more, he would probably say yes, just as any Minister would always want more for their department. None the less, that does not mean that commanders are short of what they need to achieve their objectives.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0811247000186"></a>When things go wrong&#151;as they will in an operational situations&#151;questions are asked. Obviously, the Snatch Land Rover has come under a lot of scrutiny, so I want to say a few words about this vehicle. The nub of the issue is that commanders need a wide variety of vehicles. Sometimes, for certain tasks, a light, manoeuvrable and/or low-profile vehicle may be the most suitable. What is most important is that commanders on the ground have access to a range of vehicles. It is their prerogative, not ours, to choose the most appropriate vehicle for any given task; we cannot second-guess what they should be doing. We have done a great deal to ensure that commanders have a variety of vehicles at their disposal&#151;vehicles that provide varying degrees of protection, mobility and firepower. Although we have invested heavily in personal protection vehicles, there will still be situations when commanders use Snatch as part of their mixed force. The Chief of the General Staff said recently:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="0811247000250"></a>&#147;There has always been and there remains a requirement for a small, agile vehicle to get to some of the places both in Iraq and Afghanistan, that the larger and protected vehicles, like Warrior, Bulldog and Mastiff, can&#146;t get to ... If there was a better vehicle, a smaller vehicle, out there that we could get our hands on quickly, or could have got our hands on quickly, we would do so or would have done so&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811247000229"></a>That is a very clear statement of the need for that vehicle in some circumstances.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0811247000187"></a>We are spending more than &#163;30 million to upgrade all our Snatch vehicles on operations to the Snatch Vixen, which provides the same level of manoeuvrability with increased protection. These modifications, developed in response to operational pressures, will give the Snatch Vixen the highest levels of protection for its size and weight class compared with other vehicles out there on the market. However, we realise that the new generation of heavily armoured vehicles is also proving very useful and, indeed, vital. Therefore, last month we announced an extra 700 vehicles to further improve the safety of our people in theatre.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0811247000188"></a>Although we are investing billions of pounds in equipment for both the short and the long terms, there are those who still argue that we are not providing the right kit. Sadly, there have been casualties and each death is a huge loss. Obviously, it is right that independent authorities look into every death in an endeavour to avoid such events in the future. If bad practice or policy is apparent, we will change it. I hope that the

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0811247000189"></a>I am not suggesting&#151;and nobody in the Ministry of Defence would suggest&#151;that there is no more work to be done. We always want to improve our kit, our vehicles and the overall service that we provide. We are, at the moment, in the process of finding more helicopters from our allies and getting them to the front line as quickly as possible. The UK-French helicopter initiative, launched in May, has already brought several countries to the table to secure funds and to increase our helicopter capability. So far, Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Norway are all helping in this respect and the fund currently stands at &#8364;20 million. In response to the initiative, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Ukraine have offered helicopters for Afghanistan, provided that they can secure funding for essential refurbishment, the equipment that is needed and the training that would allow those helicopters to be deployed.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="0811247000190"></a>I hope that noble Lords will accept that the Ministry of Defence is committed to providing the best possible support for the Armed Forces, whether at home or on operations overseas. We owe them a debt of gratitude for the work that they do on a daily basis, because that work is to maintain our security. Our men and women on current military operations are showing exactly the same kind of steel and resolve that their forebears had, so it is right that, this month, when we honour the memory of those who protected us in the past, we should also honour and acknowledge those who protect us today. Part of what we are doing is committing ourselves to ensuring that service personnel, their families and veterans get the recognition and support that they deserve. The recognition study and the Command Paper have been significant steps forward in clarifying that relationship and in enhancing the entitlement of those in the Armed Forces. I therefore believe that real progress is being made and hope that we can continue to improve the lot of those to whom we owe so much. I beg to move.</p>

I also join the Minister in paying tribute to those who have given their lives for this country in earlier wars and campaigns. I thank the Minister for facilitating this long-awaited debate, which is, I am sure, welcomed by all sides of the House.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="0811247000194"></a>In opening this debate, the Minister commended to the House the White Paper, <I>The Nation&#146;s Commitment: Cross-</I><I>G</I><I>overnment Support to </I><I>o</I><I>ur Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans</I>. This side of the House welcomed much of the White Paper, in particular the admission that the bureaucratic process, as a whole, operates to the frustration of service families, and of where that  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1311"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>process can be adjusted. However, real enthusiasm escapes me for three main reasons. First, parliamentary debate about the Armed Forces needs to go much deeper and wider than the matters addressed in the White Paper. My second ground for concern is scepticism, borne of experience, over the extent to which, and how soon, the Government will succeed in bringing about their promised changes in the working of the bureaucratic machine. My third reservation relates to the general tone of the document. While it explicitly recognises, at several points, the human dimension of the sacrifices which our soldiers, sailors and airmen are expected to make in the course of their duties, it seems to regard what needs to be done as largely mechanical matters of process, and not matters of people talking to, listening to and helping others.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="0811247000195"></a>I found no real acknowledgement of the key role that voluntary organisations such as The Royal British Legion, SAFA, the Army Families Federation and the War Widows' Association can and do make in supporting veterans and families. The only recognition that they receive is acknowledgement in the list of consultees at the end. It is likewise for the old comrades&#146; associations, to use a generic term, which do so much to help with welfare issues.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="0811247000196"></a>A further curiosity of the wording of the White Paper is that, as far as I can see, it does not refer at any point to the military covenant, yet, in ordinary conversation and debate, that phrase encapsulates the subject matter of the White Paper. I was therefore very pleased to hear the Secretary of State, giving evidence recently to the Defence Committee in the other place, use precisely the phrase &#147;the military covenant&#148; in answering a question on the matter from my honourable friend Bernard Jenkin. The commitment that the Minister then gave was that the military covenant is a vital part of the whole deal. That is how it is rightly perceived by my right honourable friend David Cameron, and that is why he appointed a commission to advise him on precisely that brief. I commend that commission for its work and its interim report entitled, <I>Restoring the Covenant</I>.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="0811247000197"></a>There must be an acceptance by government of a duty of care and support for those willing to die and be injured, often with life-changing injuries, on behalf of their country. That was recognised three centuries ago by the Duke of Marlborough. He told this House after his victory at Blenheim that the best way to celebrate was to do right by the soldiers who fought so bravely with him.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="0811247000198"></a>With that in mind, I shall concentrate on three points that are very relevant to the military covenant and morale. First, for the past few years, I have been raising in this House the totally unsatisfactory position of the air bridge to Iraq and Afghanistan. Each time, Ministers gave me assurances that something would be done, but when I speak to troops, which I do quite often, I am told that that is not the case. The air bridge problems are a continuing cause of real resentment for those service men and women travelling to and from Iraq and Afghanistan. I make no apology for returning to that again today, as it is having a serious effect on morale.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1312"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1312</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81124-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0811247000199"></a>New figures show that so far this year, only 56 per cent of flights returning from Afghanistan have been on time or delayed by less than an hour. Moreover, the number of flights delayed by six hours or more has increased to 17 per cent. Given that new figures from the Military Covenant Commission show that only 47 per cent of the fleet is fit for purpose, perhaps flight delays are not surprising. The Royal Air Force&#146;s fleet is, on the whole, very old, so delays are not always its fault.</p>

<a name="81124-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0811247000200"></a>In America, leave starts at one minute past midnight the day after service personnel have arrived at their destination. In this country, however, leave starts when waiting for the flight home. Here, as the Chief of the General Staff&#146;s briefing team reports, plane delays, sometimes as long as 24 hours, mean that loss of leave is still widespread. Service personnel get only two weeks&#146; leave during their six months in theatre, so that precious time with their family and friends must be protected as a very high priority. It is astonishing, therefore, that this seems impossible to achieve. What plans do the Government have at this time to improve the air bridge and what is the latest news on the A400M?</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81124-0006.htm"/>


<a name="81124-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0811247000201"></a>The sending of unsolicited parcels to service personnel from well-meaning members of the public should be an occasion for good cheer. They are signs of gratitude and a mark that those in Afghanistan and Iraq are not only in the minds of their family but also of those members of the general public who acknowledge their debt to the Armed Forces. However, because of the strain these parcels put on the air bridge, the Ministry of Defence has decided that this practice must cease. Do the Government understand what a damaging impact this will have on morale?</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0811247000202"></a>The second grievance that is fully justified is the sub-standard housing for service men and women and their families. Real resentment at the incompetence and lack of motivation of MHS, the company responsible for service accommodation, is apparent at many units I have visited. The strength of feeling is considerable. There is little confidence in the approach of MHS or in its service. In his recent report, the CGS said that he was,</p>
<ul><a name="0811247000261"></a>&#147;hugely irritated by the initial contract delivery standards of MHS&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811247000230"></a>He went on to acknowledge that efforts are being made to improve these standards. Can the Minister assure us that MHS is now focusing sustained attention on improving its performance and customer satisfaction?</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0811247000203"></a>A few weeks ago the Lords Defence Group visited Wellington Barracks. To say that we were all shocked by what we saw is an understatement. It is quite wrong that service men and women are forced to accept these very sub-standard living conditions. I was grateful to hear the Minister&#146;s assurance in her opening speech that there are going to be considerable improvements to Wellington Barracks. Admiral Timothy Laurence, Chief Executive of Defence Estates, recently spoke to the Lords Defence Group. I was heartened by his address and I am confident that he will get a grip on the problems of service accommodation. Will the Minister assure us that further instalments of payments  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1313"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1313</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for Chelsea Barracks are secure and have been ring-fenced, as we were told they would be, for defence accommodation?</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0811247000204"></a>Thirdly, I am concerned at the premature voluntary retirement of too many service men and women in all three services, particularly middle-ranking officers and NCOs who we can ill afford to lose. One area for downward adjustment of spending lies in programmes for the future provision of technologically advanced kit. I will not venture into that today but of one thing I am certain: our most important resource, our most valuable capability, is our people and the Government must stop short-changing them. It is well recognised today that through-life capability management is a key objective where kit is concerned. The same should and must apply to the capability that is our people. The White Paper and the interim report of our covenant commission are the necessary first steps to that end.</p>

My party, like the others, has done considerable work and published on the military covenant and support for our Armed Forces, and there is a great deal of common ground in this White Paper with which we can all agree&#151;provided that it is fully implemented.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0811247000206"></a>We are all concerned about the degree of overstretch from which our Armed Forces have been suffering through heavy commitments over the past few years&#151;&#147;running hot&#148;, as Nick Harvey, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman in the other place, wrote in an early paper, <I>Our Nation&#146;s Duty</I>, published in December last year. The strains on our forces, on their families, on reserves called up far more frequently than anticipated and on our equipment&#151;and thus on the military covenant as such&#151;have been acute. After the cuts which the Conservative Government made after 1990, thinking that we could cut back on our Armed Forces post the end of the Cold War, when I heard a Minister say in answer to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that cuts in the probation services were going to affect not the front line but merely the tail, I was reminded of the problems we got into with <I>Front Line First</I>, which cut Defence Medical Services most sharply, from which we have been suffering since.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0811247000207"></a>We have had wars of choice for the past 10 years&#151;what John Kampfner unkindly called &#147;Blair&#146;s Wars&#148; and what the White Paper refers to as using our forces for good&#151;in Kosovo, where there was a major operation in which we were prepared to commit almost half our effective army; in Sierra Leone, where a small commitment did a world of good; in Afghanistan, a necessary commitment though badly delayed with all that time lost between 2000 and 2006 which has made the reconstruction of the economy, society and state so much more difficult; and, of course, in Iraq, which my party strongly opposed and which thankfully we will complete, we hope, within the next six months. Perhaps the Minister will tell us a little about the prospects for completing the status of forces agreement in Iraq and how that will affect the remaining months that our forces will stay in Basra. I have not yet read that the  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1314"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1314</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>status of forces agreement has been completed. As a result, we have had no spare capacity to contribute to multilateral forces in central Africa, in the Congo, in the Great Lakes region, in Sudan and Chad, or to do as much as we would have liked to train and provide logistical support for troops from African states in that very damaged continent.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0811247000208"></a>A range of wider issues follow from this: where should we commit to conflicts, under what circumstances, with whom and with what equipment? We should be addressing what we think are the likeliest sorts of conflicts, whether high-level conflicts between states of the kind which led to the intervention in Iraq or&#151;I dread the thought&#151;potential operations against Iran, or the Petersburg tasks of separation of combatants, peace enforcement, restoration of order, nation-building and reconstruction. We need different kinds of equipment and training for these actions. For interstate war we need aircraft carriers, highly capable piloted aircraft and perhaps even a new nuclear deterrent. For state-building and peace enforcement we need good armoured vehicles, personal armour, helicopters and pilotless drones.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0811247000209"></a>In all these we pursue closer co-operation with the armed forces of other states, which we need to pursue more actively and, I suggest, discuss more openly with Parliament. Do we pursue primarily continuing partnership with the United States, with its much larger armed forces with a rather different set of military doctrines, or more the French, the Dutch, the Danish and the Canadians, with whom we find ourselves operating in Helmand and elsewhere? I welcome the report of the UK-French helicopter initiative. That seems very much the kind of thing that we should be doing.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0811247000210"></a>Even peace enforcement now is increasingly hard fought. We are up against asymmetrical warfare with improvised explosive devices, grenade launchers and the like and, as in Afghanistan, we take heavy casualties. Welcome improvements in medical care and in evacuating the wounded mean that fewer die, but more return to the United Kingdom severely injured and often permanently disabled. The White Paper notes that, since 2001, 350 personnel have been killed, but more than 2,000 have been seriously injured or wounded, creating a new generation of long-term disabled ex-service men and women. We welcome the proposals for the Armed Forces compensation scheme. We welcome the extension of Selly Oak to house a separate military ward, and the further investment in Headley Court. We very much welcome what the White Paper says about mental health services for returning servicemen, veterans and Reserve Forces after active service. We look forward to hearing that these measures have been put in place.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0811247000211"></a>I was glad to see the comment in the White Paper that the number of ex-servicemen who are rough sleepers has declined. I was talking some months ago in Bradford to soup-run organisers, who told me that there is still a higher proportion of ex-servicemen there and in some other northern cities than there is in London. There is still a lot to be done in looking after ex-servicemen who find that the adjustment to civilian life after active service is very difficult.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0811247000212"></a>A lot of extra work is being done by service charities. I was at a concert in Bradford the weekend before last for the benefit of Help for Heroes, the excellent new charity that has raised a lot of money, particularly for Headley Court and for the badly wounded. However, as the White Paper remarks, the central responsibility lies with government&#151;not just for the wounded, but for the families of servicemen, for their houses and for the educational needs of their children. It is good to hear about what is under way at Catterick. Last weekend I was in Richmond, talking to Liberal Democrat councillors who represent that area. They tell me that things are, without question, improving.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0811247000213"></a>I have one question about paragraph 2.22, in which we are told that the provision of new housing for service-leavers is very important, and that the Government will give &#163;400,000 for it. It seems a very small sum for a very large objective.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0811247000214"></a>I note also the remarks about the 12,000 foreign and Commonwealth personnel in the UK Armed Forces&#151;the Gurkhas, 3,000 Fijians, a substantial number from the Caribbean and so on. The question of earned citizenship, and of the earned citizenship of their partners and families, is being addressed in a much more satisfactory way. I recognise that the extent now to which we depend on people from Fiji and elsewhere reflects the difficulties we have in recruiting in our own cities from those pockets of deep, often second and third-generation unemployment. A period in the services would help to break the cycle of deprivation and underachievement there.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0811247000215"></a>In terms of joined-up government, I find contradictions between the continuing emphasis on long-term service for all and the increasing dependence on partly trained Reserve Forces; and between the emphasis on the armed services providing education and training for people who have missed out elsewhere and the suggestion that a smaller proportion of people will pass through the services, each serving for a very long period. We are told that 40 per cent of other ranks now serve for 10 years or more, often acquiring growing family commitments and risking losing touch with civilian life.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="0811247000216"></a>The Americans have an exemplary record of using their services to provide education and training for the disadvantaged, including apprenticeships in practical skills, from computing to mechanical engineering. We support the remission of tuition fees after six years&#146; service; perhaps it should be a little less. We should perhaps encourage shorter term service to help citizenship engagement, which is dear to the Prime Minister&#146;s heart but not mentioned in this White Paper. That would give a larger throughput of young volunteers with experience of military service for their country. The citizenship agenda ought to be more explicitly addressed in this White Paper. We have a reference to veterans&#146; day. Some of us feel that Remembrance Day is the closest thing we have to a national day and that it is time to rethink and reshape it. I was sorry that, for example, no recently returned active servicemen marched past the Cenotaph on 9 November and that cadet forces, the future of our services, were at the back of the march, not the front.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0811247000217"></a>I would like to see much more said about the role of the Reserve Forces, down now to fewer than 40,000 when we are told that 20,000 have served in operations in the past 10 years. It is time for a much wider debate on the future of our Reserve Forces since they have become so much more actively used in that time, with their role not only in supporting operations abroad but in assistance to civil powers at home&#151;flooding, foot and mouth, BSE or a potential pandemic&#151;and the wider role of the cadet forces in providing a sense of personal worth and self-respect to young teenage males in our cities. Reserve Forces have a particular value in likely operations in Africa and other areas where weak or failing states require assistance in state-building. Civil military skills are then particularly useful, and I note that almost all the armed services&#146; civil military units in the States are drawn from its National Guard, for similar reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="0811247000218"></a>My much lamented colleague Lord Garden used to say that we needed to take some hard decisions regarding British defence that we were ducking. It is now 10 years since the 1998 strategic review under the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, from whom I look forward to hearing. It was an excellent White Paper, even though it left out the multilateral European dimension, which the Prime Minister launched at St Malo a few months later. Lord Garden would also say that no Government would be likely to invest sufficient additional spending in defence to provide the full range of equipment and specialist units needed to meet all contingencies. We therefore have to choose. We have seen the emergence of a huge overhang in future defence procurement in which the future commitments clearly cannot be met within the existing budget, with delays in the future FRES and cutbacks and delays in helicopter orders, while reinforcing the joint combat aircraft and nuclear deterrent investment.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="0811247000219"></a>My party produced a security paper last year that came to the conclusion that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="0811247000251"></a>&#147;The defence budget crunch, combined with doubts over when and how Britain should play a role in expeditionary deployments, is ample evidence&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811247000231"></a>that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="0811247000252"></a>&#147;Britain must take a long hard look at whether we can continue ... to design our armed forces as an almost miniature version of the American military with a wide variety of military platforms&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="0811247000220"></a>Sir Menzies Campbell, in a paper published two months ago, said that we need a debate nationally about our political objectives. He suggested that we cannot carry on regardless, trying to maintain all our military objectives and commitments, but that we lack the possibility, particularly now that we are in a recession, of doing properly everything we are committed to do because of the immense additional funding that that would require. He suggests that we may need to focus rather more on the wars of today and to prioritise expeditionary and peacekeeping missions over state-on-state or full spectrum war-fighting capabilities, which would see,</p>
<ul><a name="0811247000262"></a>&#147;prioritisation of armoured vehicles, helicopters, strategic lift&#148;&#151;</ul>

<a name="08112412000003"></a><a name="81124-0006.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81124-0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08112412000112"></a>Lord Craig of Radley:</b> My Lords, I welcome the opportunity that this debate gives us to discuss a number of very important issues and I congratulate the Minister on securing it.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08112412000004"></a>It is to the Government's credit that at long last, in Command Paper 7424, they have taken more seriously than heretofore the importance of giving special consideration to members and former members of the Armed Forces and their families. I hope that all this is not just inspired by the serious and extensive nature of the operations on which this Government have embarked in wars of choice. I say extensive because, as noble Lords will recognise, our Armed Forces have been involved continuously in demanding operations for some years, longer than the years of conflict in the two World Wars. Those two wars were not &#147;wars of choice&#148;, rather they were &#147;wars of national survival&#148;. Moreover, in both wars, after much trial and tribulations, a successful end was in view before hostilities ended. Would that the same could be said with equal confidence about Afghanistan; and it has taken us too long time to reach the endgame in Iraq, which I sincerely hope that we have. All three services face a demanding future of operations.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08112412000005"></a>So let us all welcome the renewed government concern and the emphasis, in the Minister's own words, on providing unashamedly special treatment for servicemen and women who have endured most in the course of duty, perhaps suffering terrible physical and mental injuries. But I hope we shall not find ourselves back in the world of Rudyard Kipling, who wrote of Tommy Atkins:</p>
&#147;For it&#146;s Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' &#145;Chuck him out, the brute!&#146;But it's &#145;Saviour of 'is country&#146; when the guns begin to shoot&#148;.
<a name="81124-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08112412000006"></a>The number of promises and undertakings by government in Command Paper 7424 is most striking. It is extremely comprehensive. It covers a wide field of interest for serving and retired personnel and their families. It involves not only other government departments but the devolved Administrations as well. I welcome this attempt to deal with service issues on a nationwide basis. But noble Lords will be aware that this is no longer the &#147;default&#148; position when dealing with matters affecting the Armed Forces and veterans. Only after a considerable battle with the Ministry of Justice, and praying Command Paper 7424 in aid, was the Ministry of Justice prepared to set up a dedicated war pensions and Armed Forces compensation chamber in the new first-tier tribunal to take on the work of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal, in England and Wales, when that was abolished. Meanwhile, pensions appeal tribunals in Scotland and Northern Ireland, being devolved matters, have not been abolished.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08112412000007"></a>Devolution, whatever its benefits, should not place the Armed Forces and dependants in such a confusing no man's land of responsibility for looking after their interests. Similar problems have arisen with regard to  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1318"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1318</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the management and oversight of the services' non-public funds, funds that have enjoyed a charitable status since the days of Henry VIII, because charity matters are now another devolved issue. Only after much persuasion were the Government prepared to add,</p>
<ul><a name="08112412000098"></a>&#147;the promotion of the efficiency of the armed forces of the Crown&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08112412000084"></a>to the Charities Act 2006. But in the Scottish equivalent charities legislation, the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005, there is no mention of the Armed Forces at all. I believe that the Government and the devolved Administrations should pay greater attention to avoiding anomalies in the treatment of the Armed Forces. Wherever possible they should agree that the support they provide for the forces and dependants should be equal and where possible provided nationally. After all, the Armed Forces fight for the whole country and not separate regions within it. We must at all costs avoid some form of postcode lottery when dealing with the Armed Forces, veterans and their dependants. As Command Paper 7424 repeatedly emphasises, they must be treated fairly.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08112412000008"></a>One of the most striking things when reading through the White Paper is the number of undertakings to do this or that to help and support individuals and families. Chapter 2 is headed &#147;What We Will Do&#148;, and this promise is repeated paragraph after paragraph throughout that chapter. Maybe it should be characterised as &#147;Yes we can&#148;. Chapter 3 covers, in the words of the chapter heading,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="08112412000093"></a>&#147;What We Have Already Done&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08112412000085"></a>However, a number of ongoing promises have yet to be delivered in full or made more widely known to the potential beneficiaries. I take the view that it is not done until it is done. So these issues need to be considered along with all the other promises of delivery.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08112412000009"></a>Wherever there is a will, however, there needs to be an assured way of demonstrating that it has been achieved, and how. So I was pleased to note that there are to be arrangements to make sure of delivery. These say that the Cabinet Office will provide the chair and secretariat and that there will be wide representation on the so-called external reference group. This group will be required to report annually to the Prime Minister and to the Defence Secretary and its report will be published. While that is in many ways a sound intention, I think that it would be even better if the chair was departmentally independent. I invite the Government to consider the advantages that this would bring in giving greater confidence that the actions are properly recorded and that there is no fudging or spins put in the annual reports.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08112412000010"></a>I am also concerned that there appear to be no types of sanction that might be imposed if delivery is not achieved or falls behind. There needs to be a method of keeping action rolling forward and not allowing promised improvements to wither because &#147;funds were not available&#148; or &#147;other more pressing matters unfortunately intervened&#148;. When setting up the Armed Forces chamber in the new first-tier tribunal, the Ministry of Justice did agree to set up a steering group with an independent chair. This example should be followed for the Command Paper 7424 oversight.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1319"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1319</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81124-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08112412000011"></a>Long experience shows&#151;without wishing to bring a too-discordant note to this debate&#151;that promises of government action have a habit of successfully grabbing the initiating headlines but then running out of steam and, in all too short a time, disappearing from sight. Perhaps I may remind the House of just a couple such instances in the past decade or so. Research into Gulf War illness arising from the exposure of service personnel to organophosphate spray and the use of NAPS tablets to protect them from chemical attack was, after drifting in the 1990s, given top priority by the incoming Government in 1997. Yet now, almost another 11 years on, they have failed to reach a long overdue satisfactory conclusion and closure to this issue. Improvements to service accommodation have repeatedly been promised but, as we heard this afternoon, delivery has at times been far too slow and often unsatisfactory. PFIs have also had mixed success, to the disappointment and disadvantage of service personnel.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08112412000012"></a>So I again urge the Government to underwrite their commitments in the White Paper by strengthening their intentions of ensuring &#147;delivery&#148;. They should appoint a chair independent of government&#151;a senior retired officer. That would give the services confidence that their interests are being taken seriously. Whoever is to chair, they must be given sufficient clout to help ensure that government departments keep up to the mark.</p>

<a name="81124-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08112412000013"></a>Finally, as no doubt there will be occasions when parliamentarians and others wish to question the Government on progress, or lack of progress, on Command Paper 7424&#146;s promises, how do the Government see those questions being answered? Will it be for the department concerned, for example on a health question; or will it be for the Cabinet Office Minister to handle all such questions? Clarity now on how these matters are to be dealt with would help to ensure that questions are not batted from one department to another with no sign of a satisfactory response. The confidence&#151;or otherwise&#151;that Armed Forces personnel, veterans and dependants have in this important government initiative will rest heavily on delivery and on how the Government deal with questions of substance about progress.</p>

With our troops engaged in armed conflict in two major theatres, it is absolutely right that we regularly look at all the issues concerning them. This applies not only to their physical and equipment needs, which are mightily important, but to the political and military background to what is happening and how we can get our Armed Forces back to their regular rhythm. That is the way in which I should like to shape my few remarks today.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08112412000015"></a>With other noble Lords, I pay tribute to those engaged in the present conflict. There are thousands of members of our forces, and the civilians who support them, now engaged in perilous activity in Afghanistan and in Iraq. Many more are still engaged in other military activity at home and abroad, and they, too, should not be forgotten as we thank those who lay their lives and limbs on the line for our freedom. We

They have a uniquely British spirit and tenacity, as well as genuine and admirable courage and professionalism, which should and does make us all deeply proud of them.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08112412000016"></a>As honorary colonel of the London Scottish, a component part of the London Regiment and closely connected to the Scots Guards, I have met many of the ordinary, yet extraordinary, members of the Territorial Army who have served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. We are now using our Reserve Forces much more than ever in the past. The reroling of the Territorial Army following the Strategic Defence Review has been one of the great successes. My admiration of those with whom I have come into contact and of their carrying out with great success what we expect them to do knows no bounds. We owe all who serve in the Armed Forces a great deal, and we have a responsibility to ensure that they are well looked after, have the right equipment to do the job, and stay as safe as they can be in a war zone.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08112412000017"></a>In many fields, huge improvements have been made to the conditions of those who serve us. My noble friend Lady Taylor has this evening outlined many of the improvements that have taken place. I pay tribute to her work during the period in which she has been in the Ministry of Defence. I am glad that the Prime Minister kept her there, because her expertise and experience will be of great use in the future. I know that all John Hutton&#146;s predecessors as Secretary of State&#151;Geoff Hoon, John Reid and Des Browne&#151;have felt deeply and personally about the sacrifices that we regularly ask for, and have been intent on doing the right thing by our troops. I pay tribute to their decisions and the changes that have been made. I know that John Hutton, who has been a friend and long-time colleague, will be an outstanding holder of the office.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08112412000018"></a>I am impressed by the command document and the way in which it focuses on improving so many areas of welfare. Having been a Secretary of State for Defence and struggled with the Treasury and other government departments on some of these very same issues a decade ago, I recognise that we have made serious progress. I notice that my former deputy, the noble Lord, Lord Gilbert, is with us in the Chamber. He will remember our fights with certain people across the road, who have now changed their mind substantially, I am glad to say.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08112412000019"></a>The top-level tariffs in the Armed Forces compensation scheme have been doubled. Compensation is much more generous than it has been, although it in no way compensates for the terrible tragedies that have befallen some people. Access to adapted social housing is provided for more seriously injured people. Priority access is given to other social housing. Free additional education up to first-degree level is offered to service leavers after six years of service, which follows on an idea in the Strategic Defence Review which we were never able to deliver at the time. In terms of the National Health Service, childcare provision, the disadvantage in accessing school places and the improvements in Defence Medical Services, the Government have a lot to be proud of, even if some issues will continue to need attention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08112412000020"></a>As other noble Lords have done, I also pay tribute to the service charities because they do a huge amount of work. SSAFA, the British Legion and others are actively engaged in the detailed work so often required to deal with the many people who have been in active service and who are just leaving. I am a trustee of the British Forces Foundation, an organisation founded by Mr Jim Davidson, the comedian and Conservative&#151;these are mutually exclusive at times. Over the years he has delivered entertainment by himself and by his friends in show business. It has been hugely successful. The entertainment provided to our troops, especially in-theatre, is very valuable indeed for building morale. For this reason I am pleased to assist the British Forces Foundation.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08112412000021"></a>All of us who have served in the greatest office of state in the Ministry of Defence know those daily life-and-death decisions which devolve down to the ordinary soldier, sailor, airman and airwoman. No Defence Minister I have ever met has been immune from the heavy, ever present burden carried for ensuring that as much as possible is done, as often as possible and in as many circumstances as possible, to ensure that our people are both effective and safe. As in any war, there will be mistakes, shortages and missing equipment. There will also be coroners who will generalise on the particular, often well after the event and usually long after the lessons have been learned.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08112412000022"></a>The pace of conflict today is so swift that urgent operational requirements are now driving the whole equipment budget. That is because requirements are often only seen on the battlefield and as circumstances alter and become evident. The old military saying that no plan survives the first engagement with the enemy is as true today as it was in the past. That is why urgent operational requirements have amounted to &#163;3.6 billion since the beginning of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. These come from outside the stated defence budget. Of these, 85 per cent are related to force protection. The Government are doing the right thing in making sure that our forces are protected.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08112412000023"></a>Every injury caused by the wrong kit is a singular tragedy but they often arise in more complex situations than the black and white world of 20/20 vision. Three hundred and one members of our Armed Forces have been killed in Afghanistan and Iraq since hostilities began. Anyone who saw the BBC television programme two weeks ago called &#147;The Fallen&#148;, which itemised every single one of those of our troops who has perished and the impact that it has had on their close families and friends, will understand just how tragic each one of these casualties is. We mourn each and every one of them. We also remember the many others who have come home with injuries, both physical and mental. Their welfare must continue to be a priority.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08112412000024"></a>I spoke earlier about the political and diplomatic backdrop to the fighting in both theatres. There will be no safe return of our troops until this has been addressed and a political outcome obtained and settled. As Secretary-General of NATO, I had a lot to do with the decision that the alliance take on responsibility for that co-operative effort in post-Taliban Afghanistan called ISAF&#151;the International Security  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1322"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1322</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and Assistance Force. I may have moved on from that post but my responsibility and my passion has in no way diminished.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08112412000025"></a>What we are doing in Afghanistan today is defending this country. That is what it is about&#151;defending our country, our liberties and our way of life. That fact is all too often ignored, misunderstood, even dismissed, but it is true none the less. Threats to our country no longer lie at our national frontiers; they germinate in failed and weak states such as Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and, as we are now seeing every day, Somalia. They grow deadly tentacles which spread out from these failed states into our own streets, with the 7/7 bombings on the London Underground, the attacks on the twin towers or on the trains in Madrid or to the US embassy in Nairobi, to Istanbul, to Bali and even to Glasgow Airport and London&#146;s Haymarket. So if the Taliban were to beat NATO, or the nations of NATO were to allow it to be defeated, then the forces of darkness&#151;al-Qaeda and its like&#151;would stop for only a very brief moment to congratulate themselves on defeating the greatest defence alliance that the world has known, and then they will be back in our midst.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="08112412000026"></a>That is why our troops fight in Helmand province; it is why so many have died and been injured, why so many others take the risks with us&#151;the Canadians most notably&#151;and why their sacrifices matter to every citizen of this country. As the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said, we are facing a financial crisis, not just in this but in every country. Inevitably, that means that there will not be extra money for defence or, indeed, for pretty well any other public services. We can therefore no longer talk in terms of notional expenditure that we want to see spent on our Armed Forces and on defence; we have to make better decisions about the money that we already spend. That will mean tough decisions for those who have responsibility for making the recommendations. No party in this country will be able to outbid another in terms of the money it would spend on defence because it simply will not be believed. So each party has to make its recommendations within the envelope that exists at the moment or even one that might conceivably shrink in the future.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="08112412000027"></a>There is much more that I would say about the dilemmas facing the NATO nations in Afghanistan if there were more time. Some of that will be contained in the interim report of the IPPR&#146;s Commission on National Security in the 21st Century, which will be published on Thursday morning. The noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, and I have co-&#145;chaired this commission, which includes a wide range of distinguished experts and will give a number of pointers as to what needs to be done.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="08112412000028"></a>Let me give one example from our report. We believe that there should be a more regional approach to a solution in Afghanistan, which should and must include involving Iran in discussions. There must also be closer co-ordination, even control, of all the external assistance to the Government of Afghanistan. It was a great pity, bordering on a tragedy, that President Karzai vetoed the appointment of the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, as the overseer of external assistance to Afghanistan. I hope that a search will continue for somebody of his calibre, experience and

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="08112412000029"></a>Let me add to this list regarding Afghanistan the view of a senior Army officer, a veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan, whom I met at Edinburgh Airport last Thursday evening. He said that unless the issues of corruption and narcotics in Afghanistan are not gripped decisively and soon, we will not find a long-term solution to the encroaching influence of the Taliban.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08112412000030"></a>Our troops are giving their all. More nations need to provide more troops and use them as fighting troops and not as beat policemen. Afghanistan needs the promised development cash as well, which it has been regularly promised but which has rarely been delivered. I remind the House that our troops, and all the troops serving outside Kabul, are part of provincial reconstruction teams. They were to provide security to those providing the reconstruction in schools, hospitals, industry and all the substitute activities for the growing of the poppy. The soldiers try, often at the expense of their own lives and limbs, to provide the security&#151;but where is the reconstruction? Our fine fighting forces and those who support them, both in theatre and at home, are doing with magnificence what we demand of them. How much more important it is that we do what we, the leaders of the nations of the ordered world, have to do to let them come home with honour, with the job well done. That is our part of a solemn bargain.</p>

Secondly, as noble Lords will see, I am a bit down the batting list. However, after the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, I shall be brief and restrict my remarks to what I have been able to see in this country as the secretary of the all-party House of Lords Defence Group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08112412000032"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for all that she said about Wellington Barracks. In this folder, which I managed to dig out in the dark of Angus as I left at half-past six this morning, I have the kind note that she sent me after our visit, dated 20 October. She mentioned the figure of &#163;10 million to be spent on Wellington Barracks. She made one or two other comments in the note, which I shall spare her this evening, but I am sure that she and the Ministry are looking into the repairs. We are grateful for what is being carried out at Wellington Barracks. I am sure that the battalion there&#151;I think that it is the Grenadier Guards&#151;will be very pleased indeed.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08112412000033"></a>I was delighted to hear what the Minister had to say about the Catterick Garrison and 4 Mechanised Brigade. She may know that my regiment and that of my noble and gallant father, the Scots Guards, will also be using Catterick as its home. It will be part of an armoured, mechanised battalion. I thank her for all the information that she gave on the improvements at Catterick, particularly as far as ongoing health is concerned&#151;things like physiotherapy and conditioning for the young soldiers, not just the young recruits who are being trained there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08112412000034"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, and my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew may remember a visit that we paid to Selly Oak Hospital in Birmingham in March last year. My two colleagues and I were particularly impressed by the efforts being made at Selly Oak. We were also impressed by one or two small points, such as the refurbishment of accommodation for families who might wish to visit their sons or daughters, casualties at Selly Oak or in the Birmingham area, as well as single accommodation for young soldiers under treatment or consideration at Selly Oak. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, and I, together with others from the House of Lords Defence Group, visited the University of Central England in Birmingham, which does enormous amounts of training for the military medics. We were grateful for what it is doing and for what the Minister said today about its work.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08112412000035"></a>In June this year, the House of Lords Defence Group was lucky to visit Headley Court. All your Lordships would want to pay particular tribute to everything that was being done there, above all to the unbelievable spirit and outlook of the young servicemen, as well as some of the older ones. In particular, the younger ones thought, in the words of the late Group Captain Douglas Bader, &#147;Think of what you can do tomorrow, not what happened yesterday&#148;. They and everybody else at Headley Court are doing just that.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08112412000036"></a>As far as operations far and away are concerned, I have been able to study and read only what I find in the media or the newspapers. The noble Baroness referred to vehicle upgrading and to the Apache helicopter, about which I have recently been reading some mainly favourable reports. Will she and her department please take action and keep vigilant &#147;this day&#148;, to cite two words used by the great Admiral Lord Nelson?</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08112412000037"></a>Also, will she please keep up to date and check every item of kit and weaponry to be used overseas that comes across her desk in the department each and every day? Will she be kind enough to confirm two small items to me, on which she may have written to me before? The GR7 and GR9 Harriers were at 800 and 801 Squadron at RNAS Yeovilton. I think that they now roost or are based at RAF Cottesmore. I understand that they are carrying out particularly intensive operations in theatre. I hope that she can confirm that the training, the equipment and the support that they get are up to date.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="08112412000038"></a>Will the noble Baroness also write to me and confirm that the budget will still be in place for the new version of the Joint Strike Fighter, which I think is called the F-35? The F-35A, the conventional version, is being well developed. The F-35B, which will be the successor to the Harrier vertical or short take-off and landing, is the first prototype that has flown and will soon be in the air, perhaps early next year. Can she confirm that to me? I understand that the F-35C, which will be the conventional carrier version, is still a year or two down the road. Will she write to me on that? I have a rather complicated query on an item of kit, but I will not disturb the noble Baroness about it this evening; I will let her department have my query on it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08112412000039"></a>I conclude by sending the thoughts of each and every one of us to the men and women who, as soldiers and young recruits&#151;rather like my noble

It is they whom we shall be supporting in future debates. I will take the gentle luxury of giving the support of all of us to what I call my commando&#151;45 Commando&#151;which is based in Angus. We are particularly proud of Colonel Morris and each and every one of them. We hope that they will come back safe and sound, having done a wonderful tour of duty.

He is, I believe, a member of the Armoured Support Group and was in the Royal Gallery the other day at the reception for serving members of the Armed Forces. He lost his legs as a result of an improvised explosive device. Such devices are a continuing and major hazard in Afghanistan. Another member of the crew of the vehicle was Marine Dale Gostick, who tragically lost his life.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08112412000041"></a>There have been many unsung heroes in the Afghanistan conflict, but none more heroic and none more courageous than the members of the Royal Marines Armoured Support Group. They have had very little respite over the years of this conflict. They have been deployed with all the leading fighting formations. Their job is hazardous in the extreme and they have brought a new and effective dimension to our capability in this theatre of operations. I am sure that I speak for the whole House in expressing profound gratitude and admiration to all the members of this unit.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08112412000042"></a>I welcome the Command Paper, out of which arise a number of questions. First, will the Minister say what steps the Government are taking to ensure that there are opportunities for personnel severely wounded and disabled on active service to remain with their corps, regiments or units in administrative or clerical roles, if they wish to do so? Secondly, I emphasise the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, that the delays and inadequacies of the air bridge to Afghanistan and Iraq are causing major morale problems for service personnel and their families. It is imperative that this is sorted out without delay.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08112412000043"></a>I was interested to read early in the paper that, as the Minister said, the Armed Forces constituency in total is in excess of 10 million people. It is reassuring, therefore, that no Government can afford to neglect the needs and requirements of those who serve our country with such courage and commitment. This paper is correct to state in paragraph 2.2:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="08112412000094"></a>&#147;Service personnel and their families make a vital contribution to the whole of the United Kingdom&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08112412000044"></a>As to the Armed Forces compensation scheme, I welcome the recent doubling of the lump sum payment. Are there proposals to increase the guaranteed income payment? Will the Minister confirm that the guaranteed

Will she also let me have by letter details of the categories of severity of injury and wounds relating to the lump sum payment and the index-linked annual payments?</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08112412000045"></a>The paper goes on to discuss education and training for service leavers. These provisions are welcome. I know that the Minister and noble Lords will agree that retiring sailors, Royal Marines, soldiers and airmen have great skills and qualities to offer the outside world. These personnel continue to be in much demand and I was delighted to read the statistic in paragraph 3.18 of the paper.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08112412000046"></a>As to the commitment bonus or re-engagement premium, to whom do these payments apply? This includes their length of service and rank. Which units of the Armed Forces have the benefit of being able to take up the offer? I hear that the system is extremely complex and confusing. People do not understand the terms, which could be made simpler. How many people have taken up the commitment bonus so far and for how much longer will it last? Will the Minister also elaborate on the tax and national insurance status of these payments? It would be interesting to hear from her exactly what the conditions are for the longer separation allowance and how much is payable.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08112412000047"></a>Right at the start&#151;at paragraph 1.1&#151;the Command Paper demonstrates the breadth of the operations in which our Armed Forces have been involved for over 20 years. It is a formidable list of challenges, all of which have been overcome. Most of those engagements have been dependent on our amphibious capability. Without that capability, we would lose much of our global influence. The key to a successful future defence strategy for the country must be not only the nuclear submarine deterrent but our ability to project force and engage in humanitarian operations through our amphibious fleet and our expeditionary expertise. That calls for a strong Navy well equipped with the right ships.</p>

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08112412000048"></a>It is interesting to note that, even with the huge commitment in Afghanistan, the Royal Navy and Royal Marines manage to fit in amphibious exercises, practising skills honed over many decades. Amphibious or expeditionary operations require considerable know-how, expertise and practice. That expertise must be preserved, notwithstanding the fact that 40 Commando Royal Marines returned from Afghanistan earlier this year and that 3 Commando Brigade, with 42 and 45 Commando, are currently spearheading our efforts in Afghanistan. That is how it should be: they are the elite fighting troops and represent the significant Royal Naval contribution to operations. Nevertheless, it is important to bear in mind the vital importance of preserving our expeditionary capability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08112412000049"></a>HMS &#147;Ocean&#148;, the landing platform helicopter ship&#151;I always call them commando ships, which is the old-fashioned expression&#151;was launched over 10 years ago and built to a civilian specification. We fortunately now have two assault ships&#151;landing platform docks&#151;the &#147;Bulwark&#148; and the &#147;Albion&#148;, but we only have one helicopter carrier. I very much welcome the placing of orders for the two aircraft carriers and I hope that the Government will soon order aircraft to fly from

<a name="81124-0007.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08112412000050"></a>I congratulate our Armed Forces on their exemplary and courageous commitment and their loyalty to this country. They always exceed the high expectations that we have of them.</p>

I was in Osnabruck on 11 November and shared in a service with the personnel there. They had just returned from Afghanistan and some had lost their comrades. Indeed, it was a very poignant time. Most of them will be moving to Catterick, which I have also visited recently, and I agree with the comments about the improvements already made there and those that are ongoing.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08112412000052"></a>I declare an interest because I am a director of the trust and a trustee of the Order of St John and the British Red Cross Defence Medical Welfare Service. Many noble Lords will recognise that the service has a long history and was formerly known as the Service Hospital Welfare Service. It dates back to the First World War when the organisation was grant-funded by the War Committee. Voluntary-aid-society status was granted both to the Order of St John and the British Red Cross in war and peace by Geneva, which it still holds today.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08112412000053"></a>In 2001, the grant aid ceased and the Defence Medical Welfare Service was established under contract with the Ministry of Defence. The service is only a small organisation but it is the only civilian charity to serve a three-month front-line tour. Two welfare officers are in Iraq and two are in Afghanistan, serving a three-month tour having received combat training beforehand.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08112412000054"></a>Other welfare officers are posted in seven units in the UK, including the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine in Birmingham, the provider hospitals in Germany, a unit in Northern Ireland and one in Cyprus. It is the only organisation providing a 24-hour welfare service and its remit is solely medical welfare, which involves visiting each hospitalised service personnel or dependent relative to ensure that their immediate needs are met. This may be just clothing for someone who is admitted after severe injury, or it may involve contacting relatives or arranging accommodation for relatives of the dangerously ill. A daily visit is made and recorded, and the whole organisation is subject to performance management, which is monitored quarterly by the Ministry of Defence. The service provided is confidential and outside the line of command, which enables the service personnel to share any personal concerns and worries without them being passed up the chain of command.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08112412000055"></a>Dealing with relatives plays a large part of welfare officers&#146; work, as does, especially on deployment, counselling medical team staff following a tremendous influx of severely injured or killed personnel. One important task is to ensure that the friends of the deceased, who are often injured themselves, are allowed

Many patients are cared for over a lengthy period and the welfare officers provide DVDs, CDs and jigsaws&#151;simple welfare. Some are very lonely as their relatives are far away, and the welfare officers try to give them more time and help them to make contact with their families.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08112412000056"></a>The Command Paper does not include mention of the work done by the Defence Medical Welfare Service but patient surveys, commanding officers and medical teams recognise the valuable service that this small group of welfare officers give at what are often the most vulnerable times in the experience of a serviceman and his relatives. Both the Order of St John and the British Red Cross have high regard for the work carried out by the Defence Medical Welfare Service and are anxious that the voluntary-aid-society status bestowed on them in World War I is continued. This is very relevant at the moment for both organisations, as the Civil Contingencies Act is being reviewed. It is hoped that this status will be retained and I ask the Minister whether this can be looked at.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08112412000057"></a>I hope that the Minister will also take note of the small but very valuable contribution made by the Defence Medical Welfare Service.

I have two questions for the Minister, both relating to matters of severe welfare concern to two categories of members of the Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08112412000059"></a>I am sure that the noble Baroness will be aware of the workings of the Crown Proceedings (Armed Forces) Act 1987, which set out to repeal Section 10 of the corresponding 1947 Act. On the face of it, this should have been very good news for members of the armed services because it opened up the way to make claims for compensation for disabilities caused by unforeseen circumstances during their service. In particular, it should have been of great encouragement to members of the Royal Navy who had served on ships which had been equipped and cladded out with significant amounts of asbestos to protect them from fire and damage during action but who, in the natural course of things, had unfortunately been exposed to asbestos contamination to the point where asbestosis became a progressive and severe risk for them over their advancing years.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08112412000060"></a>Unfortunately, the 1987 Act did nothing of the sort. It was not retrospective, applying only to anybody who could be proven to have contracted the disease after the Act had been passed, which was, of course, a complete contradiction in terms. After it is first contracted, this disease takes some 40 years to mature. When the symptoms first appear, you can therefore say quite clearly that you caught it 30 years ago. However, you would not qualify for a claim under the 1987 Act because you would be making the claim after the Act had been passed and could not make a retrospective claim. That is a total injustice which has never been corrected. What processes does the MoD apply today to monitor the victims of this disease who contracted  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1329"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>it during their service? How many such cases are there? What, if anything, is the MoD doing to assist these people with care and support and, particularly, to support the families who have the terrible burden of looking after them?</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08112412000061"></a>The MoD will have a full list of the ships that were principally afflicted, but HMS &#147;Furious&#148; is one in particular. Most notably and most severely hit have been the crews of the Royal Yacht &#147;Britannia&#148;, which ought to be a cause of significant concern to the MoD. A number of its crew, including one commanding officer who has since died because he insisted on supervising too personally the renovation of the engine room, should be given careful attention to see how they are being looked after today and what their fate is. That is one particular concern.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08112412000062"></a>My other concern relates to something much more up-to-date. It relates to the RAF and arises from the recent coroners court proceedings about the Hercules aircraft crash in January 2005. We have heard press comment to the effect that putting in the explosive-suppressant foam&#151;the missing factor that was said possibly to have contributed to that mishap&#151;required a capital investment in equipment of &#163;270,000 and a &#163;50,000 cost for each aircraft thereafter. I understand that there are, at the moment, 16 of the old J-type Hercules aircraft and 24 of the later K-type Hercules. I believe that the Js are about to be reduced from 16 to five, making a total fleet of 29.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08112412000063"></a>I have received information from a senior Civil Service source that the total cost of meeting the anticipated ruling of the coroners court&#151;that the explosive-suppressant foam should be applied to the whole fleet&#151;was considered to be such that it required the abandonment of the entire upgrade, renovation and maintenance programme for the whole of the Hercules fleet. This included the list of all other known things that had to be upgraded. If that is the case, it is an absolutely disgraceful economy to make in these circumstances. It is also a complete reversal of the common-sense principle that if you know you have a problem in one area, you should put all other problems right as well. Will the Minister assure us that the money which has been diverted for the foam replacement will be made good to enable the immediate resumption and completion of the entire maintenance programme? This had previously been set for the vital work of our forces at this time. My two questions, one about the Navy and one about the RAF, relate to groups of people who are dedicated, give loyal and committed service, and earn and deserve a little of the same in return.</p>

It is difficult to argue that the world has learnt the lessons of the futility of war, or has become more civilised. We find ourselves engaged in military action in Afghanistan and Iraq, and have troops in the Balkans. The situation in the Middle East seems as intractable as ever. Brutal and oppressive regimes dominate in Burma, North

Piracy prevails off Somalia; we have serious instability in Pakistan; and the uncertainty over Iran&#146;s nuclear ambitions continues. Meanwhile, many countries are significantly increasing their military spend. China is moving towards developing its first aircraft carrier; India, Japan and Russia are all spending considerably more.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08112412000065"></a>By contrast, we have seen a steady reduction in the percentage of gross national product spent on defence&#151;now 2.3 per cent, the lowest point since 1933. We have also seen a steady downgrading of the importance of the Ministry of Defence in the Government, culminating in the part-time appointment of the previous Secretary of State and changed only at the most recent reshuffle. I make no criticism of him, but that is an example of the downgrading of the MoD as an institution.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08112412000066"></a>I do not criticise the commitment or integrity of the present defence ministerial team; the blame lies with the former Prime Minister and the current Prime Minister during all his years as Chancellor of the Exchequer. They jointly took little interest in the size, equipment or capability of our Armed Forces, yet had no compunction in ordering them into action in the Balkans, in Sierra Leone, in Iraq and, more recently, in Afghanistan. Some disastrous procurement decisions were taken, such as the one in 2004 to take &#163;1.4 billion out of the helicopter budget. Although it may be necessary, it is rather embarrassing to hear from the Minister this evening that we are scouring the world for helicopters adequately to provide for our forces in Afghanistan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08112412000067"></a>Since the Government came to power in 1997, our regular force numbers have fallen by 12 per cent from 211,000 to 185,000. TA numbers have fallen by 42 per cent from just under 52,000 in 1997 to slightly over 30,000 in 2008. The inadequacy of our Reserve Forces was mentioned by my noble friend Lord Wallace and the noble Lord, Lord Robertson. All aircraft fleets&#151;transport, combat, reconnaissance and air tanker&#151;have already been halved since the end of the Cold War. The 1998 Strategic Defence Review indicated a requirement for 32 escorts, including 12 new Type 45 destroyers. Today, we have only 22 escorts. In the early and mid-1980s, when I was a junior defence Minister, I was criticised when I referred to our force of about 50 frigates and destroyers at sea, rather than a definite 50.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08112412000068"></a>I give credit to the Government for significantly improving equipment for our forces in Afghanistan after a poor start, for their recent announcement on the procurement of better protected vehicles and for tackling the backlog of housing maintenance that has developed over the years, but much remains to be done. We on these Benches welcome the decisions on pay, the operational welfare package, the improvements to Wellington Barracks&#151;I look forward to hearing more in future on the &#163;20 million pilot scheme to support home ownership&#151;and, especially, the increases in compensation referred to by my noble friend Lord Burnett.</p>

A recent editorial in the <I>New York Times</I> parallels our situation. Talking about the overstretch of the US army as a result of Iraq, it states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="08112412000095"></a>&#147;The long-term cost in morale, recruit quality and readiness will persist for years. Nearly one-fifth of the troops&#151;some 300,000 men and women&#151;have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan reporting post-traumatic stress disorders&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="81124-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08112412000070"></a>It was said earlier that the Government are faced with a major funding shortfall of up to &#163;2 billion in the procurement budget, and something clearly has to give. The Government need to take major decisions on the third phase of Typhoon; on whether we go ahead with joint-strike aircraft for our new carriers&#151;and I take the point about the importance of the humanitarian role of our amphibious vessels made by my noble friend Lord Burnett; on the future Lynx&#151;a decision urgently awaited by Westland; and on FRES.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08112412000071"></a>The situation in Afghanistan is enormously complex. It is a long haul and, as the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, said, we cannot allow the forces of darkness to prevail. Can the Minister say whether the Americans have requested additional UK forces to support them in any possible surge operation? It seems to me we have to regain the military initiative and get on top of the situation there for there to be serious, long-term dialogue with the Taliban.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08112412000072"></a>My view is that the public would be willing to accept an increase in defence expenditure, probably for the first time in many years. We all know the difficult economic situation we are in at present. Nevertheless, we need to look again at the defence spend. I believe we need to look to building up our Army from the current 103,000 service men and women towards the 120,000 mark. At the moment, our military cannot complete all the tasks asked of it. Given that we are so stretched, it is extremely difficult for us to consider participating in any peacekeeping operations that may come about in the short term. The Congo was referred to by my noble friend Lord Wallace and we may be called upon to help in the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe. We also need to work much more closely with France and respond in a more positive way to the overtures of President Sarkozy. We have moved a long way from the absurd posturing of the De Gaulle era and I hope the Government will give a real example of working with the French. Perhaps the Minister could refer to that when she winds up.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08112412000073"></a>At the last major defence debate in this House on 22 November 2007, the Government was flayed by our former Chiefs of the Defence Staff in an unprecedented way. Since then, the media and general public have come out strongly in support of our Armed Forces, which probably command a greater respect now than ever before. The Command Paper discusses a range of welcome improvements but we can and must do more. We just cannot continue to undertake all the tasks with the resources currently available to our Armed Forces.</p>

We welcome the White Paper and I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Taylor, for initiating such a crucial debate at this time.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08112412000075"></a>The military covenant states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="08112412000096"></a>&#147;Soldiers will be called upon to make personal sacrifices&#151;including the ultimate sacrifice&#151;in the service of the Nation. In putting the needs of the Nation and&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08112412000086"></a>the armed services,</p>
<ul><a name="08112412000099"></a>&#147;before their own, they forgo some of the rights enjoyed by those outside the Armed Forces&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08112412000087"></a>In return there must be an,</p>
<ul><a name="08112412000100"></a>&#147;unbreakable common bond of identity, loyalty and responsibility&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08112412000088"></a>between the,</p>
<ul><a name="08112412000101"></a>&#147;nation, the Army and each individual soldier&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08112412000089"></a>sailor and airman to compensate and reward those brave service personnel who risk their lives to protect our nation.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08112412000076"></a>A recent report by Demos, however, said that the military covenant had been &#147;damaged almost beyond repair&#148; and a new compact must be established between civil and military. At a time when our forces are being asked to fight in two wars, and in light of the fact that the British military death toll in Iraq and Afghanistan recently reached 300, this is a disgraceful situation to be in and must be rectified.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08112412000077"></a>Are the basic standards of the Armed Forces degenerating because of the pressures of current commitments, and because of the lack of time to carry out anything more than essential short-term training? Sir Richard Dannatt, Chief of the General Staff, recently said that when,</p>
<ul><a name="08112412000102"></a>&#147;you are committing young people to battle, they have to be given the best&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08112412000090"></a>We must acknowledge that our troops do not always have the best. By 15 November this year, 36 of our military personnel had been killed in the lightly armoured Snatch Land Rovers. Can we be assured that they will be used only inside defended military compounds and bases from now on? I do not believe that commanders in the field have as much choice of vehicles as they should and are, with their troops, therefore in greater danger than is absolutely necessary. It is therefore reassuring that the Minister seems to have taken this on board. Let us hope her colleagues will follow her lead. The Oxfordshire coroner, Andrew Walker, has said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08112412000103"></a>&#147;to send soldiers into a combat zone without basic equipment is unforgivable, inexcusable and a breach of trust between soldiers and those who govern them&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08112412000091"></a>The vulnerable Snatch vehicles make up a part of this and it is vital that more should be done.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08112412000078"></a>The problem is further exacerbated by a persistent shortage of battlefield helicopters, which could also be used as an alternative to the more susceptible Snatch vehicles. I am glad that special arrangements with the French will be carried through. However, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence has recently reported that the Government have no plans to accelerate the Future Lynx helicopter programme despite the fact that the:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="08112412000097"></a>&#147;Future Lynx helicopter could be ready to enter service by 2011&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08112412000092"></a>Now it appears that it will be 2014 and 2015, with the full complement not in service until after 2017. Perhaps the Government can explain the reasoning behind this seemingly relaxed approach for providing essential and long overdue new equipment.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08112412000079"></a>After six months&#146; service, soldiers are given a period of time to adjust between life on the front line and what life will be like on leave. Those who have served will know exactly how necessary this decompression time is. As the Overseas Territories Minister stated in another place, Foreign Office staff are also required to take decompression breaks after their time in Afghanistan or Iraq. This is very sensible and perfectly right. However, I wonder why the Foreign Office staff are given decompression breaks of 10 to 14 days when those serving on the front line in the Armed Forces are given, on average, only 24 hours. Can the Government account for the reason why?</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08112412000080"></a>The last Strategic Defence Review was conducted over a decade ago. Do the Government feel it is right that we are basing our requirements on an assessment that was conducted before the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had even begun? Do they not feel that it might be appropriate to carry out another review now, and perhaps adopt the American system of conducting a defence review every four years, so that our assessments about the requirements of our troops are kept up to date and accurate? Would the Government not accept that this would be sensible? When we get back into power, we will initiate an immediate Strategic Defence Review.</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08112412000081"></a>Sir Kevin O&#146;Donoghue stated that the crackdown on military spending will not affect the two &#163;4 billion aircraft carriers&#151;all well and good. However, in view of the fact that these aircraft carriers are useless without the new Joint Strike Fighter, will the Government give us the latest news on the availability of the JSF? My noble friend Lord Lyell asked pertinent questions about this. I presume that the Navy will be able to find properly trained sailors to man the carriers as they come online. Can the Minister assure us that there will be early deliveries of sufficient JSFs to provide training facilities for air crew in advance of the main deliveries, so that there will be at least one carrier and enough fighters and pilots arriving at the same time?</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08112412000082"></a>The debate has thrown open many interesting issues, and there have been several good speeches. I draw attention to my noble friend Lord James, who made a most thoughtful speech, particularly on the subject of the air bridge. My noble friend Lord Lyell mentioned the work in hand at Wellington barracks, announced by the Minister. We are all pleased about this; it really was a mess when we visited it. The noble Lord, Lord Burnett, made some pertinent, interesting and wise remarks, with which we would like to be associated, concerning the Royal Marines. My noble friend Lord James was concerned about asbestosis on the Royal Yacht. Are the sailors who crewed her being properly monitored to see whether they have been affected? He also mentioned the Hercules fleet. Can the Minister answer his concerns on that?</p>

<a name="81124-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08112412000083"></a>We are grateful for the Command Paper, but, as my noble friend said, it does not go far enough, and many more issues need urgent answers. I hope that the

It is also clear that we all want to do as much as possible and that we all have a clear commitment to working to realise the White Paper&#146;s ambitions and themes in terms of making life easier for, and rewarding the contributions of, those who serve this country.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08112418000005"></a>The fact that we are discussing this issue in the context of the military covenant and the nation&#146;s commitment is something that is relatively new. When I first came to the department and asked about the military covenant and its history I was somewhat surprised to learn that it is not something that had been written down many years ago but that it is relatively recent. As I said earlier, this White Paper is the first time that any Government have tried to put into writing their commitment to those in our armed services, their families and our veterans. We are taking a significant step forward. While we may all want to move more quickly on a range of issues, it is significant that we are having this debate. We should start by acknowledging that this issue has come to the fore partly because we now have people on operations whose contribution is, quite rightly, much more in people&#146;s minds than perhaps used to be the case.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08112418000006"></a>I will try to cover as many of the points raised as possible, but if there are any significant ones that I do not cover I will write to noble Lords later. The noble Lord, Lord Astor, welcomed the White Paper but commented that some of it seems to provide bureaucratic solutions. Although individual people are at the heart of what we are trying to do, many of their concerns arise because of bureaucratic systems that have sometimes acted to the detriment of those working in the Armed Forces. We do not want to see a situation where regulations about hospital waiting lists or access to local schools stand in the way of those in the Armed Forces or disadvantage them. So it is only natural that many of the solutions we are putting forward are about the process and making sure that people get what they are entitled to. It is important that we get that situation into perspective.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08112418000007"></a>The noble Lord asked several specific questions and other noble Lords referred to some of the same issues. I will try to cover those, starting with the air bridge, which is extremely important and is under pressure because we are engaged in operations a long way away. We have to be careful in how we access these countries in such difficult and dangerous circumstances. As for the fact that 56 per cent of flights bringing people home are on time, I am not sure what the commercial airlines&#146; figures are but, given that we are talking about war zones, our figures are not an absolute disaster.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1335"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81124-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08112418000008"></a>It is important that people should get back to their families and have some relief as quickly as possible, but, as the noble Lord said, 17 per cent of flights were significantly delayed. We have to put safety first. We can fly into certain places only if we have aircraft with the defensive aid suites that are necessary to provide protection. That means that those aircraft work extremely hard and we have to keep the maintenance up. We cannot afford to take risks in those circumstances. Safety has to be our priority. It is right that we should look for new ways of getting people back&#151;having a stopover in Cyprus has proved valuable and been appreciated&#151;but we cannot afford to take any risks and fly aircraft that do not have defensive aid suites.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08112418000009"></a>The noble Lord and others mentioned the A400M. We have put considerable investment into the A400M, as have other countries. The delay is concerning us and we are talking to the companies involved about that delay. We are doing so along with other countries, because this is not a single-country project. The partner nations are concerned by the announcements that have been made by EADS and Airbus Military regarding those delays, and we have had several discussions about them. It is important that we have a common approach from all the countries because a number of them are looking forward to that aircraft coming into operation. The company acknowledges the problems.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08112418000010"></a>The noble Lord also mentioned the issue of unsolicited parcels and the fact that this year we are asking people not to send unnamed parcels to people because of the extra stress it puts on the air bridge. I think that that is a reasonable position to take. Obviously, it is nice for people to receive parcels at Christmas, but parcels from anonymous sources or schools often frustrate our troops. Although these parcels are welcome, they take up capacity on the aircraft while other parcels from home&#151;from their wives, mothers or families&#151;cannot get through. We want to concentrate on ensuring that parcels from family members and friends, which are properly addressed to individual members of the Armed Forces, get through. That has to be our priority.</p>

There is a system in operation to get non-addressed parcels out to as many people as possible, but those are from a recognised charity. Last December I went to Brize Norton and saw the boxes for myself. Many of them contained unsuitable items such as aerosols or liquids that had to be screened before they could be put on an aircraft, and that caused extra difficulties. If a deluge of such parcels means that parcels from wives, husbands, mothers or fathers cannot get through, that can cause difficulty. There is scope for considering whether arrangements can be made for these parcels to go elsewhere&#151;to the families of servicemen or something of that kind&#151;but we cannot afford to have the same backlog build up. We get inundated with unmarked parcels which sometimes contain items that cause difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08112418000013"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Astor, mentioned Chelsea Barracks. The department has made a commitment to use the proceeds from the barracks for accommodation. However, those are specific points and I shall come on to housing later. Nevertheless, the noble Lord, Lord Astor, complained rather strongly about the company responsible for what he called substandard housing. Although I do not want to bring too much politics into this, I should point out that it was the previous Conservative Government who were responsible for the sale of much of the MoD housing stock. We are often bound by these very long-term commitments, which sometimes tie the hands of the department.</p>

He said that we entered into wars of choice. I am not sure that they have always been wars of choice, as the consequences of not acting might well have been very severe. I think that everyone in Europe felt that action had to be taken on Kosovo. Although I know that the noble Lord has strong views on Iraq, I would remind him of the words of my noble friend Lord Robertson today on Afghanistan. He has clearly explained that we are there to defend this country. I think that I can recall my noble friend saying at the time that if we did not go to the Taliban, the Taliban would come to us. That is exactly the same situation, although now we might use the words &#147;al-Qaeda&#148; rather than just &#147;Taliban&#148;. It is of course a complex situation.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08112418000015"></a>It is true that we have a range of commitments and there is a limit to what we can do by ourselves, which is why we work in alliances and why we have to look carefully at where we can work with others. We work with others on equipment such as the A400M, as I mentioned. I was asked earlier about co-operation with the French. Regardless of whether it is France or any other country or group of countries, we can work collaboratively with others on equipment projects only if all of us have the same requirements, work to the same timescales and have the same financial ability to take on board the contracts. It is not necessarily an easy commitment but, because of the complexity of many items of modern equipment, it is often the only way forward to get the kind of equipment that we need these days.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08112418000016"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, asked about paragraph 2.22, which is on housing. I think that that part applies to homelessness, on which we are trying to do some quite novel and ambitious things. A project in Aldershot is aimed at homelessness among former members of the armed services and it is proposed that we have such projects in other, similar garrison towns. The project can be considered to be a pilot and we are working with both the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly to see what we can do on this. People can often have problems in transition, which is why we have placed so much emphasis on education and on providing opportunities for people once they leave the services.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08112418000017"></a>I am afraid that the questions from the noble Lord about helicopter orders, FRES and other items will have to wait until we are ready to announce such things, although the noble Lord, Lord Astor, has a  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1337"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column 1337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Question on Wednesday and, before too long, it might be possible to say more on a whole range of those issues. I welcome what the noble Lord said on many issues&#151;about recruitment, about the potential for breaking the cycle of deprivation and about the role of the cadet, which we all see as valuable.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08112418000018"></a>The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, made a number of valuable points, as usual, drawing on his experience and, indeed, on his contacts. He is always extremely well informed on these matters. He said that we have been in Iraq too long and hoped that we would be out soon. I think that we are all pleased at the progress that has been made there. We are discussing the SOFA. We will not allow our troops to stay there without clarity, but we feel that we are making progress.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08112418000019"></a>We are making progress on the compensation scheme, which has been welcomed&#151;indeed, everyone should welcome it, because we should not forget that our scheme is another relatively new invention. Previously, there was simply the war pensions scheme, which did not have the lump sums. The doubling of those sums is significant, as is the fact that they should be paid to some people before the year&#146;s end. That is a big step forward, as is the tax-free monthly income that goes with it for the more severely injured. It shows that some things have been delivered, which, again, we should welcome.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08112418000020"></a>The external reference group was mentioned, as was the fact that the chair of the committee is from the Cabinet Office. The Cabinet Office is there to hold other government departments to account. As the initiatives in the White Paper range across government, from education to health, to work and pensions and a whole range of issues, it is appropriate that we should have someone from the Cabinet Office chairing the group and keeping all those departments on their toes. The external reference group is a significant group of people, involving representatives of the Royal British Legion, SSAFA, the Army, Navy and RAF family federations, the war widows and so on. That significant group of people would not be likely to let the Government off the hook on these things. The noble and gallant Lord&#146;s motto, &#147;Yes we can&#148;, when it comes to delivery on these issues, is one to which we will be held by those who are in that group. They will take it as their responsibility to make sure that we keep up to the mark.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08112418000021"></a>My noble friend Lord Robertson used his experience as a former Secretary of State and Secretary-General of NATO to give a wide perspective. I have mentioned what he said about Afghanistan. He is right. We have to remind people time and again that we are in Afghanistan for our own national interest, as well as to improve the lot of that country. Only by improving the lot of that country can we establish there stability, good governance and the rule of law, and tackle corruption, which has been mentioned as well. If we can get that country into a position where it does not provide that threat, it will be a significant step forward.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08112418000022"></a>I appreciated the noble Lord&#146;s remarks about the Treasury and the struggles that all departments have with it from time to time. I can say only that the Treasury has been extremely good at finding the

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08112418000023"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lyell, mentioned the House of Lords Defence Group, which seems to visit a good number of places to get an insight. We try to keep in touch on that. He asked about the JSF budget. Other noble Lords asked whether the JSF will be on the carriers at the appropriate time. The timetable for JSF has never directly coincided with the timetables for the carriers; that has always been the case. So far, we have invested the appropriate amount in JSF. We do not have to make any more investment decisions until next year. The stowable version has flown. We are keeping in very close touch on that. So far, things are going to plan.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08112418000024"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Burnett, mentioned personnel. He also mentioned education and training. It is important that we emphasise that people who come into our Armed Forces often receive very good education and training that will stand them in good stead when they leave. He raised some specific points and asked for some figures. I shall have to write to him about those, because I cannot give all the answers off the top of my head.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08112418000025"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, mentioned the work of the Defence Medical Welfare Service. I know that she has met my right honourable friend Bob Ainsworth about it. We are happy to work alongside it in delivering the Command Paper commitments and recognise the good work that has been done. We are happy to continue to work with the noble Baroness and to hear her concerns so that we can be kept up to date.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08112418000026"></a>The noble Lord, Lord James, mentioned two points. The first was case of the RAF Hercules, which is still the subject of an inquest in a coroner&#146;s court. On that basis, I do not think it appropriate to comment. I shall provide him with as much information as possible at the appropriate stage, but I am not sure when that will be.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08112418000027"></a>The noble Lord also mentioned asbestosis, which is a significant problem for those who are affected by it and has affected many people in many industries. The MoD is sympathetic to claims made in relation to exposure to asbestos. There is an automatic presumption that Royal Navy personnel who served between 1939 and 1973 would have been exposed to asbestos, so any claim for a war pension can be fast-tracked. Anyone serving later than that would be reviewed as individual cases. We recognise asbestosis as an important issue on which we have to keep a watch.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="08112418000028"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lee, mentioned the importance of the MoD in government going down because my right honourable friend Des Browne doubled up as Secretary of State for Scotland. I was stopped in this House the other day by a noble Lord who asked why we now had five Ministers in the MoD. If you are judging it on numbers, there is a bit of divergence of opinion. I do not know whether it was personal or on behalf of the party of the noble Lord, Lord Lee, but I take note of the commitment that the Liberals would spend more on defence. He mentioned the issue of reservists and so did&#151;</p>

I am sorry, it was my noble friend Lord Gilbert, who has sneaked round from the other side of the Chamber and is now in his more usual place. He has long advocated that a lot more money be spent on defence.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="08112418000031"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lee, mentioned the reserves and suggested that the noble Lords, Lord Wallace and Lord Robertson, had talked about the inadequacy of the reservists. That is unfair, as I do not think that is what they were saying. We are having a strategic review, however. This began in April and the aim is to try to ensure that we have Reserve Forces that meet defence needs now and well into the future. We see the Reserve Forces as an increasingly integral part of defence capabilities. That is what we have been consulting on and I hope we will be in a position to report on this soon.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="08112418000032"></a>Although we acknowledge that our Armed Forces are stretched, we are told that they are able to work well at the moment and that is what we believe to be the case. We have recently taken on the headquarters for the piracy operation under the ESDP. I hope the noble Lord will welcome this and I believe it is something we can make a contribution to.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="08112418000033"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Luke, summarised many of the points that others have been making and he came back to the Snatch-vehicle issue as one which I acknowledged in my opening remarks had caused some concern. He asked me to say that Snatch vehicles

I think Ministers should not make decisions about what is appropriate for any particular operation. We have to leave that to commanders in the field because we cannot run a war from Whitehall; nor would we want to. Although I understand his concerns, I hope he will also understand our concerns that we have to try to ensure that we provide the wide range of vehicles that commanders want. The House will appreciate the extra investment and the work that is going on.</p>

<a name="81124-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="08112418000034"></a>In summary, there are individual points that we want to emphasise or ask questions on, and no one would ever say the situation were perfect, particularly when you are on operations. As my noble friend Lord Robertson said, when you are on operations, difficulties, mistakes and challenges always arise. It is always a changing and challenging situation but the MoD and the country as a whole have to do everything to provide the members of our Armed Forces with the equipment and the resources that they need and to look after them and their families once they have left the service. We can all agree on that point.</p>

<h5><a name="0811248000103"></a>3.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0811248000006"></a><a name="81124-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0811248000110"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill</b> rose to move that this House takes note of the Report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, <I>Monitoring the Government&#146;s Response to Human Rights Judgments: Annual Report 2008</I> (31st Report, HL Paper 173).</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000007"></a>The noble Lord said: I am a member of the committee, as are the noble Lords, Lord Dubs and Lord Bowness, who I am delighted to say will be contributing to the debate. The report was published on 7 October, although many of its recommendations were made much earlier. We welcome the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Bach, will reply to the debate, and we hope that he will be able to be more positive in his response than ministerial colleagues in his department have been hitherto. We are greatly indebted to our highly skilled and overworked staff, parliamentary clerks, legal advisers and other staff for their outstanding support. Without their skill, judgment and dedication, the committee could not publish well informed and timely reports, often at short notice.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000008"></a>The subject matter of the report is not theoretical, esoteric or arcane. It concerns the practical and effective protection of the fundamental human rights and freedoms of everyone within this jurisdiction by Parliament, the Executive and the judiciary. The UK, like every other state party to the convention, is bound by Article 1 to secure the convention rights to everyone within its jurisdiction. The UK is bound by Article 13 to provide effective British remedies for breaches of the convention rights. The UK, like every other state party, is also bound by Article 46 to abide by judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in cases where the UK is a party. Where the Strasbourg court gives judgments against other countries on issues of general importance and relevance to all state parties, which in legal Latin is erga omnes, it is also essential for third-party states to give effect to them, even though they are not parties to the particular case. That is why, for example, Cyprus and Ireland promptly gave legislative effect to the Strasbourg court&#146;s judgment in the prisoners&#146; voting rights case against the UK.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000009"></a>The convention system is based on the three linked pillars of human rights, the rule of law and democracy. It requires a working partnership between European and national institutions and adherence to the governing principle of subsidiarity, which means that European supervision comes into play only where national systems are unable to provide effective protection and redress. The convention institutions&#151;the court, the parliamentary assembly and the Committee of Ministers&#151;depend  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC124"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC124</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on the legislative, executive and judicial authorities in each of the 47 member states of the Council of Europe to give prompt and full effect to the Strasbourg court&#146;s judgments, in the interests of the citizens of Europe and of the European rule of law.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000010"></a>The British judiciary has responded well to the pressing need to give domestic legal effect to convention rights. It did its best even before the Human Rights Act required it to interpret and apply domestic law compatibly with the convention rights. The case law under the Human Rights Act is highly influential and persuasive in the Strasbourg court. The problem of implementation arises not with our courts but with the political branches of government.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000011"></a>At the European level, the Strasbourg court is overwhelmed with more and more cases. According to the court&#146;s annual report for 2007, in 2007 the number of pending cases increased by about 15 per cent in a single year, from 90,000 to 103,000. While the Russian Federation refuses, alone among the 47 contracting states, to ratify Protocol 14 to the convention, the court is seriously hampered in its efforts to tackle the problem.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000012"></a>The Committee of Ministers supervises the execution of the judgments of the Strasbourg court to ensure that appropriate and necessary individual and general measures are put in place. Great stress is placed on the monitoring system by the exponential increase in the number of application lodged with the European Court. At the end of last year, some 6,248 cases were pending before the Committee of Ministers in its supervisory capacity.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000013"></a>Last June, a colloquy was organised in Stockholm entitled, &#147;Towards stronger implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights at national level&#148;. The noble Earl, Lord Onslow, attended, representing the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The chair of the Committee of Experts for the Improvement of Procedures for the Protection of Human Rights, Mr Schorm, noted that very few parliamentary mechanisms exist with a specific mandate to verify compliance with ECHR requirements, but he singled out the work done by the JCHR as,</p>
<ul><a name="0811248000100"></a>&#147;a rare example of the existence of a special parliamentary body with a specific mandate to verify and monitor the compatibility of national law and practice with the JCHR&#148;.</ul>
<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000014"></a>As the report notes in paragraph 6, we have made a number of recommendations designed to improve the UK&#146;s domestic mechanisms for the implementation of judgments finding breaches of human rights. We called on the Ministry of Justice to adopt a central, co-ordinating role in government to ensure the effective and efficient implementation of adverse human rights judgments. We recommended that the Ministry of Justice create a database on the implementation of outstanding ECHR judgments against the UK that is similar to its database on domestic declarations of incompatibility. We recommended that information notes provided to the Committee of Ministers should routinely be copied to us. The Government, we believe, should adopt a much clearer policy on systematically responding to declarations of incompatibility made by our domestic courts, including adopting a timetable for responding to those judgments.   


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC125"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC125</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>They should make greater use of remedial orders and ensure that any proposed legislative solution makes the necessary provision for a remedy for those applicants already adversely affected by the incompatible provisions. We urged the ministry to produce clear guidance on declarations of incompatibility and remedial orders, and to monitor the impact of incompatible statutory provisions. We recommended that the ministry should provide the committee with copies of Strasbourg court judgments against the UK within a month and a declaration of incompatibility within 14 days, and inform us of the results of any appeal or hearing by the Grand Chamber. Once a judgment has become final, we asked the ministry to write to us explaining any measures that the Government consider necessary to comply with the judgment, and whether the Government intend to use the remedial process. And we made other recommendations about timetabling.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000015"></a>In August 2007, the Minister for Human Rights, Michael Wills MP, provided the committee with the Government&#146;s response to our recommendations on the issues considered in our previous monitoring report. We have published that response with this report and consider it in chapters 4 and 5. In the letter, the Minister explained that the Government would respond separately to our broader recommendations about the way in which the Government implement judgments once he had considered the matter further.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000016"></a>We point out in paragraph 8 that, over 12 months since the publication of our last report, we have received no further substantive response to our systemic recommendations. We criticise this delay, which then stood at five months, in our annual report. We understand that an informed response requires co-ordination across government and input from several departments, but a delay of more than one year in replying to these recommendations is unacceptable. We have requested the Government to provide us with a substantive response as soon as possible and certainly before the end of the current parliamentary Session. We hope that the Minister will provide that response today.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000017"></a>We welcome the co-operation of government officials, but we are disappointed by the Government's further failure to respond to our request for a memorandum on their progress over the past 12 months in dealing with adverse judgments. In paragraph 14, we call on the Minister with responsibility for human rights and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to provide us with that report, following the model adopted in the Netherlands. Again, we hope that the Minister will be positive in his reply today.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000018"></a>We are encouraged&#151;see paragraph 26&#151;that the statistics prepared by the Committee of Ministers show that the UK takes a relatively positive approach to its convention obligation to implement the Strasbourg court's judgments. However, we note in paragraph 28 that delays of five years in resolving the most significant breaches of the convention are unacceptable unless extremely convincing justification for the delay can be provided. We call on the Government to publish their response to the annual report of the Committee of Ministers, and ask them to explain the reasons for any delay in relation to the introduction of general measures   


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC126"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC126</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in each of the cases that have been the subject of supervision by the Committee of Ministers for longer than five years. Once more, we hope that the Minister will respond positively today.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000019"></a>The report highlights other issues of particular concern. I shall briefly refer to some of them and no doubt other noble Lords will wish to say more. First, prisoners' voting rights are dealt with in paragraphs 47 to 63. In October 2005, in the case of Hirst v UK, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights held that the blanket ban on voting by prisoners in the UK is incompatible with the right to participate in free and fair elections as guaranteed by Article 3 of Protocol 1 to the convention. Apart from a consultation in 2006-07, the responses to which the Government have refused to publish, the Government have failed to take steps to comply with this judgment. In contrast, Ireland and Cyprus, who were not party to the case, have implemented the judgment.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000020"></a>In this country, we have a large prison population living in hugely overcrowded conditions. As the court said in the Hirst judgment, prisoners generally continue to enjoy all the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed under the convention, except for the right to liberty&#151;see paragraph 57 of our report. Individuals' fundamental human rights, including the right to vote, are not contingent on their continuing to be good citizens. The Hirst judgment does not require that all prisoners be allowed to vote, but does say that a blanket ban is not proportionate. The Government have now had over three years to consider where the balance lies. This failure to respond is deplorable. The judgment must be implemented before the next election. Is that the Government's intention; if not, why not?</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000021"></a>We deal with other delays in implementation in paragraphs 64 to 80. In the series of cases involving the use of force by security services in Northern Ireland, the Government have yet to comply with their obligation to provide an investigation into these deaths that complies with the requirements of Article 2. Will the Minister provide an indication of the timetable for compliance with the court's judgments in these cases?</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000022"></a>There is also the issue of declarations of incompatibility as an effective remedy. Both this and the previous report by our committee discussed the view of the Strasbourg court that the inconsistency of the Government in responding to declarations of incompatibility means that they are not an effective remedy for the purposes of the convention&#151;see paragraph 83. The Government's failure to ensure that there is a consistent and speedy legislative response to declarations of incompatibility risks undermining the object and purpose of the Human Rights Act; namely, to provide an effective remedy at the domestic level.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000023"></a>A clear example of this problem arises&#151;see paragraph 96&#151;in relation to the declarations of incompatibility made in respect of the Government's certificate of approval scheme for marriages involving a person subject to immigration control. The provisions are incompatible with the right to marry without discrimination, in so far as they provide an exemption for marriages that take place within the Church of England. The Government accept that the discriminatory

Can the Minister say when that is likely to happen?</p>

<p><a name="0811248000025"></a>Fifteen years ago&#151;on 23 November 1993&#151;I suggested in my maiden speech that a human rights scrutiny committee might be established in this House. The Joint Committee on Human Rights was set up eight years later in January 2001 as a committee of both Houses, and is all the better for that. It has grown from strength to strength as a public watchdog, and through its legal advisers has become the legal adviser to Parliament in this area. Quoting the words of a poet, and in regard to the painting of Moses and the 10 commandments in this Room, the convention is,</p>
<ul><a name="0811248000101"></a>&#147;a moon for mutable lampless men&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="0811248000096"></a>and women. The Government&#146;s response to the report will be a real measure of the extent of their commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law. I look forward to the contributions to this debate. I beg to move.</p>

<h5><a name="0811248000104"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

I can do no better than quote from paragraph 13 of the report&#146;s recommendations, which seems to sum up many of our criticisms. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="0811248000099"></a>&#147;In our previous reports, we have drawn attention to a number of cases where significant delay in implementation has tarnished the otherwise good record of the United Kingdom in responding to the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="0811248000097"></a>There you have it in a nutshell&#151;we have a good record and yet we are very slow in responding. Throughout the report, and that of the previous year, the question of delay, slow response or no response at all over a period, seems to sum up our main criticism.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000028"></a>I appreciate the difficulties and that some of these issues are complicated and cut across several government departments, and therefore that the Government have to provide a co-ordinated approach. Of course, that is not as easy as a single department providing a response. However, I should have thought that we could have had a bit more action, and a faster reaction, than we have had up to now.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000029"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights seems to me the only area in the whole British Parliament where there is proper scrutiny of the European Court of Human Rights. There may be other scrutiny in the Council of Europe and elsewhere, but in terms of the British Parliament this is the only committee that can provide such scrutiny. Therefore, I am delighted that we have now published two successive reports that indicate our concerns about the process.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC128"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC128</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000030"></a>This morning I had a chat with one of the Law Lords. I mentioned this debate and said it was a pity that the Law Lords were not contributing to it. He told me that it was not appropriate for Law Lords to take part in these debates&#151;or words to that effect&#151;much as he wished that he could. I was not aware of that, and it is a pity. If ever there was a debate to which the Law Lords could contribute very handsomely, it is this one, given that they would speak from enormous experience. Something in our procedures and conventions seems to hold them back from doing so, which I regret.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000031"></a>Prisoners&#146; voting rights are dear to my heart. When I was in the House of Commons I introduced, under the 10-minute-rule Bill procedure, a Bill to give rights to prisoners, which included the right to vote. That initiative made no progress, but I am delighted that it is now higher up the agenda. I only regret that the Government have not yet seen fit to do anything about it. My next point concerns not the report but the rights of Members of this House to vote. We do not have the right to vote. I have always felt indignant that, for reasons which have always escaped me, we do not have a right to vote to influence the Government. I regard that as a breach of democracy, but, I hasten to add, not as important an issue as giving prisoners the right to vote. As it says in our report, under European human rights arrangements people do not have to have an impeccable record as individuals in order to be entitled to the right to vote. In other words, being a prisoner is not in itself, and should not be, a way of debarring someone from taking part in our electoral proceedings.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000032"></a>I turn now to some of the Irish cases, particularly the Finucane case, which I know is difficult. My understanding&#151;I think that the noble Lord, Lord Lester, also referred to it&#151;is that we are talking about the possibility of collusion. The issue has been whether the Finucane case, and one or two others, should be heard under the Inquiries Act 2005. Last year&#146;s report states that,</p>
<ul><a name="0811248000102"></a>&#147;the Inquiries Act 2005 is incapable of providing Article 2 compliant investigations into deaths in which collusion was a factor&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0811248000098"></a>Collusion by implication must have been a factor. I know that the Finucane family have been very concerned that the inquiry into Pat Finucane&#146;s murder should be held under earlier legislation, which the Government have resisted. The family want that because the Executive would not so easily be in a position to prevent certain evidence being put forward&#151;I think that that refers mainly to the security services. Carrying out the inquiry under the 2005 legislation might negate the purpose of having such an inquiry. It is a matter of regret that that is not the case.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000033"></a>There are some clear conclusions and recommendations in the report. The committee has looked into the work of the European Court of Human Rights and at the conclusions. We have seen instances where the British Government have not been in compliance. I urge the Government to look at the report in some detail to see what they can do to speed up dealing with some of these very difficult but important cases, which represent the attempt by the European Court to say something positive about the rights of individuals in this country.</p>

<p><a name="0811248000034"></a><a name="81124-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="0811248000112"></a>Lord Bowness:</b> I, too, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Lester, on securing this debate. I shall speak briefly as a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights to support what the noble Lord has said today and to emphasise that members of the committee of all parties and of no party believe that the issues which he has raised are of concern and should be addressed by the Government as soon as possible.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000035"></a>There are concerns not just about the issues but also about the delay on the part of the Government in responding to clear recommendations which have now been set out in two reports of the Joint Committee, one of which was published more than a year ago. We have asked again that after that year, and after the publication of yet another report, the report to answer these detailed recommendations should be published by the end of this parliamentary Session. Clearly, time is running out for the Minister to meet that request. I do not think that this short debate is the place to repeat all the questions and the recommendations in the two reports. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, has given a masterly synopsis of all the recommendations and the points of concern.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000036"></a>Last year&#146;s report made suggestions very clearly set out in paragraph 6 of this year&#146;s report on how the UK&#146;s domestic mechanisms for the implementation of judgments could be improved. It has already been pointed out that in 2007 the Minister then responsible said that the Government would respond after further consideration. To date, no substantive response has been received. It would be very helpful if, referring back to paragraph 6, the Minister could advise us on what progress has been made under every heading.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000037"></a>Like the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, I, too, shall refer to the case of Hirst v UK in which the European Court of Human Rights found that a blanket ban on all prisoners having rights is incompatible with the right to participate in free and fair elections. In August 2007, the Government advised that they were considering responses to the first stage of consultation before deciding how to take the matter forward.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000038"></a>One of our recommendations in this and in last year's report was that the Joint Committee on Human Rights should be kept advised about what is going on. The Minister will perhaps understand that, when the committee&#146;s officers read on the Council of Europe website that the Government had submitted a revised action plan to the Council of Ministers which indicated that the Government were undecided about whether a further consultative exercise or a legislative solution were necessary, we were somewhat surprised that we had not been advised in correspondence by Ministers, especially since the matter was an ongoing topic. That prompted a further letter to the Minister and our requests on that particular issue are set out in full on page 25 of the current report. Therefore, will the Minister please address the questions raised? What is the current position on that issue? I emphasise that the Joint Committee on Human Rights is not promoting a particular solution. It only wants to know from the Government how they propose to address the issue in the light of the judgment.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000039"></a>There are other important issues, including investigations into cases involving the use of lethal force by security forces in Northern Ireland, security of tenure for Gypsies and Travellers and other matters. Those are the merely illustrative of the cases and reasons for concern of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The delays in responding to the committee and bringing forward proposals to remedy the situation mean that the UK has been found in breach of convention rights, and the lack of information given to the committee about progress and the steps that the Government are taking cause concern. That is why I hope that this debate will give the Minister the opportunity to give the Grand Committee assurances and answers to points raised in the report.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000040"></a>I do not believe in drawing invidious comparisons with our partners either in the European Union or the Council of Europe. However, given that we drafted the European Convention on Human Rights and were one of the first signatories, it is unusual that together with Italy and Turkey we have the largest number of outstanding cases where there is a delay of more than five years.</p>
<h5><a name="0811248000106"></a>3.57 pm</h5>

I also want to use the occasion to pay a personal tribute to him. On both the Joint Committee on Human Rights and outside he has played a sterling role in making sure that human rights remain central to the national attention.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81124-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000042"></a>This is a fine and balanced report and it is a great tribute to the Labour Government that they introduced the Act and have done quite a lot in order to embed it in our legal system. While congratulating and thanking the Labour Government for doing all that, I hope to be forgiven for expressing some disappointment with a couple of things. First, I was disappointed to hear that the Government have been slow to respond to some of the important systemic recommendations of the Joint Committee. In some cases, I am told that the delay has been as long as one year. That is unfortunate.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000043"></a>My second area of concern is that there has been a delay of as long as five years in resolving some of the most important and significant breaches of the European convention. It is sad that the UK is rated among the top 10 states in that regard and only Turkey and Italy have a worse record. The Joint Committee rightly recommends that the Government publish their response to the annual report of the Committee of Ministers and explain why the delay is occurring and how it will be shortened. In this context, as the report rightly says, the Ministry of Justice should take a co-ordinating role. This complies with the Committee of Ministers&#146; recommendation that there should be an effective, domestic mechanism for implementing European court judgments.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000044"></a>Two substantive issues interest me, partly because I was on the Joint Committee for the first two years of its existence and partly because I happen to teach subjects that are related to these two areas. The first has to do with the prisoner&#146;s right to vote. The question  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC131"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC131</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>whether prisoners have a right to vote is not easy, and, ever since the debate began on who should have a right to vote, there has always been a dispute about whether this is a human right or whether it is subject to good behaviour. By and large, the debate was resolved, so far as I can see, in the following way. It is a human right in that the prisoner has a right to vote, even if he is in prison, unless he is imprisoned either for showing explicit hostility to the state&#151;in other words, if he is guilty of treason&#151;or for having been involved in armed rebellion. Short of this, an individual&#146;s good conduct as a citizen has no bearing on his right to vote. In going against this view and denying prisoners the right to vote, we are out of step with many European countries and countries outside Europe. As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, rightly pointed out in response to the European court&#146;s judgment, Ireland and Cyprus passed legislation in 1986 in giving prisoners the right to vote. There is an interesting paradox here; if prisoners do not have a right to vote, it is difficult to explain why they should regain the right to vote when they are released from prison.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000045"></a>The second issue relates to artificial insemination and serving prisoners, as raised by Dickson v the United Kingdom. I know that the Government are preparing to move in the direction of the judgment of the European court, but they insist on five considerations being met before prisoners can have a right to artificial insemination. These five considerations virtually emasculate the right to artificial insemination. Denying the prisoner the right to artificial insemination punishes not only him or her but the spouse, which cannot be justified in law or in ethics. Some of these considerations, which the Government intend to impose or invoke, do not apply to ordinary citizens and artificial insemination and therefore seem to subject prisoners to an extra set of constraints for which there is no justification.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000046"></a>I end with one general point, which may not directly relate to what the report says and largely concerns the function that the Joint Committee on Human Rights can perform in the public life of this country. Rightly or wrongly, the Human Rights Act, and particularly the judgments that other courts have delivered, have been subjected to all kinds of criticism, leading in some cases to pressure to abolish the Human Rights Act. We know that many of these criticisms are unfortunate, wrong or muddled, but they need to be identified and refuted. Moreover, like all new traditions&#151;we are moving from a culture of liberty to a culture of human rights in our country&#151;the problem is simply that as human rights become embedded, courts deliver judgments, some of which are acceptable and some of which leave something to be desired. There are also larger questions about what to do when human rights conflict with other worthwhile national goals.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000047"></a>There is something to be learnt from criticism. Although muddled criticism should be refuted, intelligent criticism has some important lessons for us. I should have thought, therefore, that the Joint Committee on Human Rights could periodically produce reports not only to identify what the Government have or have not done but to identify and deal with the criticisms that are made of the Human Rights Act, analysing the court&#146;s judgments and determining whether there are  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC132"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC132</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>any lessons that we can learn. If they were to do this, these reports would make a substantial contribution to the public life of this country and would help to build up an appropriate legal tradition of interpretation. Such an intervention in public life by the Joint Committee at this early stage when human rights are being embedded would be most salutary.</p>
<h5><a name="0811248000107"></a>4.05 pm</h5>

<p><a name="0811248000048"></a><a name="81124-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0811248000114"></a>Lord Goodhart:</b> I welcome very warmly the action of my noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill in bringing this report before the Grand Committee. Many lawyers like myself and indeed those working beyond the legal world believe that my noble friend is the leading expert on human rights in this country, and has been so for many years. I should say that in so far as the Moses Room has such a thing as a Front Bench, owing to the unavailability of my noble friends who are appropriate speakers in such debates, I have lent myself to do so, but it is merely a temporary aberration.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000049"></a>The Government are required by the European Convention on Human Rights to comply with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. This country played a central part in drafting the convention in 1950 and 1951, and we rightly pride ourselves on our legal system and observance of the rule of law. I believe it follows that we must set an example to other member states of the Council of Europe, some of which have lower standards of observance of the rule of law and obedience to the decisions of the courts than we do. We must help to bring those states up to our standards, not lower our standards to theirs. That is why compliance with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, and indeed with the final decisions of domestic courts if the case does not go to Strasbourg, is absolutely necessary.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000050"></a>Under the Human Rights Act, the judiciary has power to declare primary legislation incompatible with the Act, but that does not invalidate that legislation. The duty of compliance therefore falls on the Government. This report plays an important part in ensuring that the Government do in fact comply with their duties. This year the report contains some good news and perhaps rather more in the way of bad news. One item I would include in the good news for the past year is that no final decisions declaring that any UK legislation is incompatible with the convention have been reached in the courts. That probably shows that over recent years, those responsible for the drafting of primary legislation have a better understanding of convention rights and that the main conflicts created by older legislation have worked themselves through the process.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000051"></a>The bad news, as has already been pointed out, is the delay on the part of the Government in dealing with the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights made in earlier years. A particularly bad example of that arises from the decision in the Hirst case about the rights of prisoners to vote at elections and, like all other noble Lords who have spoken in the debate, I want to raise this point. The Hirst case was decided more than three years ago. Since then, the Government have taken no effective action to implement it. Although  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC133"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC133</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the report does not say it in so many words, the inference I draw from reading it is that the Government may well be correct in their belief that the necessary legislation would be unpopular and want to avoid taking any action before the next general election. The opposition to giving at least some prisoners the right to vote, however, ignores the principle expressed by the great prison reformer, Sir Alec Paterson, which is that criminals should be sent to prison as a punishment and not for punishment: the punishment is the loss of liberty, and thus prisoners should be treated humanely and not be deprived of any rights unless those rights are incompatible with their imprisonment. There is nothing inherently incompatible with imprisonment in allowing prisoners to have a postal ballot. Hirst recognises that prisoners can be denied the vote where the crime for which they have been sentenced is one that seeks to undermine democracy, the rule of law or human rights. I would go a little further than the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, in indicating some of the crimes that might justify deprivation of the right to vote. They include terrorism, involvement in organised crime, racist violence, electoral fraud and corruption involving holders of public office. However, the difficulty in deciding what crimes should remove the right to vote is no justification for the length of the delay in the Hirst case or the other cases referred to in this report.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000052"></a>Before I sit down, I shall add a short coda on an entirely different subject. I was delighted to find in paragraph 121 that the Carson case is to go to Strasbourg. That problem has concerned me ever since I was my party&#146;s spokesman in the House of Lords on pensions. Mrs Carson is one of approximately 500,000 people entitled to a United Kingdom state pension because of the contributions they made when resident and working in this country who are now resident abroad. People in this category do not receive the annual inflation pension increase given to all pensioners resident in the United Kingdom, the European Union and some other countries. This means that the pensions of Mrs Carson and the hundreds of thousands of other people in that position diminish in real terms every year. That is weird, unjustifiable and unfair discrimination, which was introduced by the Wilson Government in the 1960s. It has never been revoked, no doubt because most of the pensioners affected by this rule have no vote. Mrs Carson failed in the courts of this country, including in the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords, but I hope that the European Court of Human Rights will give a good bashing to whichever Government are in power when the case comes before it. I hope that whichever Government are in power will move as quickly as possible to apply the inflation update to all pensioners.</p>

My party has said this before, and I say it again simply so that noble Lords know where we stand. However, the point that we are debating today and to which I urge the Government to respond is quite separate. I have indicated that we on these Benches may take a different view on whether our approach to the application of the Human Rights Act is the right one, but we are where we are and the Government introduced their human rights legislation, so that is the system under which the courts make their rulings. It is also the system that Parliament must scrutinise.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000059"></a>Parliament, through the tireless work of many, including noble Lords present, does indeed play its part. What I find deplorable is the Government&#146;s response, which has been quite dismal. It is one thing to disagree with the Government&#146;s response to an issue; it is quite another for the Government simply to fail to respond at all&#151;a point which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and my noble friend Lord Bowness made strongly.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000060"></a>Last year, the JCHR recommended that the Government make a series of systemic reforms that would facilitate enhanced and more efficient implementation of human rights judgments. It is extremely disappointing that, almost 18 months later, the Government have yet to respond substantively to that report. Although some delay in assessing the feasibility of the committee&#146;s proposals is understandable, surely 18 months is ample time to formulate a response. The delay is especially surprising given that there are obviously some serious procedural and systemic problems with the Government&#146;s current approach, exemplified by the fact that only Italy and Turkey have a higher number of leading cases outstanding for longer than five years&#151;a point which several noble Lords have made. I join other noble Lords in calling on the Minister to respond to last year&#146;s report as soon as possible and to explain the reason for the delay.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000061"></a>I understand that, earlier this year, the committee wrote to Ministers in the Ministry of Justice and in the Foreign Office to request a report detailing cases in which adverse judgments have been made against the UK and examining their implications for domestic law. This would be a valuable innovation not only because it would make for a more transparent process but because it may also encourage the Government to be more proactive in monitoring and implementing   


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC135"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC135</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Strasbourg case law&#151;a point which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, made in his admirable summary of paragraph 5 at the beginning of this debate.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000062"></a>It would be particularly interesting to know what steps, if any, the Government have taken to meet the recommendation of the Committee of Ministers on efficient domestic capacity for rapid execution on judgments of the ECHR. Perhaps such a report could also include judgments made against other state parties that may have implications for our own domestic law. Again, in this context, it is disappointing that the Government have not even responded to the committee&#146;s request, let alone provided the information that was requested.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000063"></a>The JCHR is clearly concerned that, in a number of areas, the Government either have not responded to judgments adequately and thus run the risk of further adverse judgment or are simply dragging their feet on implementation. Two cases have already been covered in this debate in some detail. First, the Government have said that no legislative response is necessary to the case of Dickson v the United Kingdom. The committee appears to doubt this, arguing that the Government&#146;s public-interest approach leaves the door open to further findings of incompatibility. It would be interesting to hear the Government&#146;s view on this. Once again, I hope that the committee will get a timely response to its questions. Secondly, there is the issue of prisoner-voting, which has been well covered in this debate and is yet another instance of government inaction and delay.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000064"></a>In March this year, the JCHR asked whether the Government intended to produce a further second-stage consultation and asked for an explanation of the Government&#146;s view that the incompatibility identified by the Grand Chamber in Hirst v the United Kingdom could be removed without legislative reform. It also asked for an up-to-date timetable for draft legislation and whether the Government intended these reforms to be in place in time for the next general election. I am always ready to receive intermediate briefings in the course of this debate, and the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has reminded me that the Irish Government ratified this if not overnight then the next best thing. My noble friend Lord Bowness has made a plea for the committee to be kept informed, and I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, on giving such a valuable background to this subject.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000065"></a>I am concerned that the Government have not responded to these questions and appear to be attempting to kick the issue into the long grass. I urge them to rethink their approach and to provide a proper timetable for their response. I hope that the Minister will be in a position today to set out the Government&#146;s approach on this matter clearly and without the delay and indecision that seem from this report to be all too common.</p>

He has a life-long history of being involved in human rights cases and legislation and in trying to bring human rights legislation to the fore.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000067"></a>My opening comment will undoubtedly be preaching to the converted, but I want to emphasise none the less how strongly the Government feel that human rights standards are respected. I am proud to be a member of the Government who introduced the Human Rights Act, which received Royal Assent just over 10 years ago, almost to the day. We did not just talk about it; we brought the Act into force. With that Act, we &#147;brought rights home&#148;&#151;the rights under the European Convention on Human Rights to which the United Kingdom is party along with all the other members of the Council of Europe. This is not a party political debate, but it is important and fair that I ask the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, who spoke for the Official Opposition today, to ponder this question, although I do not expecting to get to his feet to answer it. If and when they come to power, is it the policy of the Conservative Party&#151;the Official Opposition&#151;to abolish the Human Rights Act? That question will have to be answered in due course and is as basic as any question that we are dealing with in this debate.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000068"></a>I now turn to the debate and to the report. By way of context, we have in this debate focused on a limited number of cases&#151;those that have raised particularly difficult issues of principle or otherwise. Thanks to the Human Rights Act, convention rights are routinely considered by courts and tribunals throughout the United Kingdom every day. Their judgments have two important features to which I want to draw attention. First, they are made by judges familiar with our legal system, and the way that our public services are delivered. Secondly, they apply directly to the parties before the court without people having to wait to go to Strasbourg.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000069"></a>Nevertheless, some of the most difficult questions are still considered by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. When it decides against the United Kingdom, we have an obligation to implement its judgment&#151;an obligation that we take seriously. As a Government, we are of course answerable primarily to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe for our implementation of Strasbourg judgments. Therefore, while we are of course grateful to the Joint Committee for this report and its excellent work and recommendations, which we are considering, I know that it will acknowledge that the final say on these matters lies elsewhere.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000070"></a>The mechanism of declarations of incompatibility in the Human Rights Act was another part of &#147;bringing rights home&#148;. That mechanism strikes an important balance: it allows higher courts to identify primary legislation that they consider incompatible, but does not allow them to strike it down. We argue that that compromise respects the supremacy of Parliament, and has worked very well over the eight years that the Act has been in force.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000071"></a>It is of course true that there is no legal obligation on the Government or Parliament to take remedial action in response to a declaration of incompatibility.  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC137"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC137</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>However, the Government have always committed to present remedial measures to Parliament following a declaration of incompatibility. We were particularly pleased that in April this year, the Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg Court opened the door to a possible future finding that declarations of incompatibility might constitute an effective remedy; that is, a remedy that has to be sought before a case is taken to Strasbourg. We know that we have a way to go to demonstrate the consistent practice that the court demands, but this is already a significant step forward in the court&#146;s jurisprudence.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000072"></a>I turn now to the specific cases and issues raised by noble Lords in their powerful contributions. On artificial insemination, we have to say bluntly that the Joint Committee&#146;s views on the case of Dickson are very disappointing. We have remedied the violation in Dickson by amending the policy, under which the Secretary of State will continue to make decisions based on the individual merits of each case. The judgment does not require primary legislation to be changed. We simply disagree with the Joint Committee on that point. The judgment was about the way in which requests for artificial insemination are considered and we believe the steps that we have taken have fully addressed these points.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000073"></a>What steps have we taken to implement this judgment? The fact that the policy has been amended, and that the Secretary of State is taking a flexible approach in applying it, means that legislation is not required. We have removed the presumption against granting requests, taking account of the partner circumstances. We no longer say that permission will be granted only in exceptional circumstances. There is a non-exhaustive list of policy considerations, including the impact on the prisoner&#146;s partner. Applicants are asked to provide information on these or anything else that supports their case. No one factor takes precedence over the others and each case is decided on its merits, against those equally weighted considerations. On the basis of what I have said, we hope that the Committee of Ministers will soon agree to close the case.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000074"></a>The case about which most noble Lords have spoken is prisoners&#146; voting rights. I hope that it will be generally accepted that this is a sensitive and complex issue, as has been demonstrated when the issue has been considered before in your Lordships&#146; House. The Hirst judgment requires the Government to reconsider their policy of a blanket ban on the voting rights of convicted prisoners. There have been those elsewhere who have used this judgment as an opportunity to criticise the Human Rights Act. I do not need to tell your Lordships that this was a judgment of European Court of Human Rights under the convention itself, and we would be obliged to implement this judgment whether there was a human rights Act in force in the United Kingdom or not. Repealing the Human Rights Act would make no difference to this judgment or to any other judgment of the Strasbourg court.</p>

<p><a name="0811248000075"></a>As your Lordships know, we have conducted the first stage of consultation on implementing this judgment. We remain committed to carrying out a second consultation, examining in more detail how voting rights might be granted to serving prisoners and how  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC138"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC138</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>far those rights should extend. We need to take account of the wide spectrum of opinion in the country, as well as the practical implications for the courts, the prison authorities and the conduct of elections. The solution that we reach must respect the court&#146;s judgment and the traditions and context of the United Kingdom. We will continue to keep the Committee of Ministers updated on our progress on this case, as we have done so far. We remain committed to carrying out a second, more detailed public consultation on how voting rights might be granted to serving prisoners and how far those rights should go. As far as the results of the first stage are concerned, we concluded the first stage in March last year, and we intend to publish the results at the same time as we launch the second stage of consultation.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000076"></a>Most noble Lords want to know when the judgment is likely to be implemented in the United Kingdom. I cannot give a date. I repeat our view that this is a very sensitive and complex issue, and we will be looking carefully at what the right approach will be and how it will be implemented.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000079"></a>On getting the revised action plan on prisoners&#146; voting rights to the JCHR, which the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, mentioned, we are sorry that did not happen. It is our clear intention to keep the committee updated with action plans. Frankly, this was an oversight, and I am told that officials have been reminded of the need to copy action plans to the committee. I apologise for that.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000080"></a>The Northern Ireland cases have been spoken to by a number of noble Lords. They presented particular challenges during their implementation. We have put together a very detailed package of measures to implement the judgments, and many steps have already been taken. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has made clear in its public assessments that the United Kingdom has now met many of the requirements of the judgments, but nevertheless we need to work to resolve the outstanding measures. In particular, we are awaiting the outcome of either inquest proceedings or review by the Historical Enquiries Team in respect of four of the cases. We have put together a detailed package of measures to implement the judgments, and the Committee of Ministers has made clear in its assessments that many of the requirements of the judgments have been met. Four of the six cases are subject to ongoing inquest proceedings and investigation by the Historical Enquiries Team, and those proceedings must run their course. We will continue to work with the Committee of Ministers to resolve the remaining measures.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000081"></a>My noble friend Lord Dubs mentioned the Finucane case and suggested that the Finucane family should be allowed an inquiry that is not an inquiry under the Inquiries Act. The Government do not consider an inquiry under the Inquiries Act to form part of the  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC139"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC139</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>measures required to implement the judgment. We consider that the very extensive investigation by the noble Lord, Lord Stevens, together with subsequent decisions on prosecutions, meet the requirement of the judgment. The commitment to an inquiry was a separate commitment made many years ago as part of the political process. Let me reassure my noble friend that the Inquiries Act does not enable the Executive to withhold any information from an inquiry. It is the only statutory framework that now exists for statutory inquiries of this nature. Discussions are ongoing between the Government and the Finucane family.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000082"></a>On the Baiai v Home Secretary sham marriages case, the noble Lord, Lord Lester, asked when the Government will implement that judgment. We are committed to remedying the declared incompatibility with Article 14. We were awaiting the outcome of the House of Lords appeal. As the noble Lord will know, that judgment was handed down just as we went into Recess on 30 July. As we speak, the UK Border Agency is liaising with relevant stakeholders, and we are still considering the most appropriate way to remedy the incompatibility.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000083"></a>Criticism is made in the report and has been echoed in the debate about the fact that the committee has not had a response to all of its inquiries made of the Government and to every recommendation made in its last report on the subject. I stress that my right honourable friend the Minister for Human Rights did respond to all the points raised by the Joint Committee in relation to specific cases in its previous report. We continue to consider the points made by the Joint Committee about the general system for the implementation of judgments, which it repeats in the report that we are debating today.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000084"></a>Improvements can always be made to any system, but the committee has acknowledged that we currently respond very well in general to judgments finding breaches of human rights. Any changes to the system for overseeing implementation will therefore not be seismic, but we will conclude our consideration in time for our response to this report. Our response, I believe, is due within two months. When we respond to the second report, we will wrap up any outstanding matters relating to specific cases. The Government understand why the Joint Committee feels frustrated that we have not been able to address all their detailed questions about particular cases. However, the evidence appended to the report shows that the Government have certainly been forthcoming with information in the past year, and I know that many other questions have been answered in correspondence between government officials and the Joint Committee&#146;s advisers. As I say, we intend to respond within the usual two months to the current report.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, talked about the UK&#146;s record on implementation. We are pleased that our record on implementation is recognised as being good. Although the Joint Committee&#146;s report majors on a small number of outstanding cases, as one can understand it will, many UK cases have been discharged from scrutiny in the past two years. This shows that measures have been taken which the Committee of Ministers considers effective to remedy the breaches. The noble Lord also asked why the United Kingdom  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC140"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC140</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has the highest proportion of leading cases that have been waiting for more than five years for a remedy. At the end of 2007, the UK had 15 leading cases outstanding, of which eight have been subject to the supervision of the Committee of Ministers for more than five years. Of those eight cases, however, six are Northern Ireland cases on the use of lethal force that have given rise to specific implementation issues. That figure has heavily skewed the statistics, which do not otherwise indicate for us a systemic problem.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000086"></a>I was asked whether we should publish an annual report by the Government on the European Court of Human rights. We believe that such an annual report would duplicate information that is available elsewhere, which frankly would not be a good use of resources. In particular, we know that the Joint Committee already receives regular updates about judgments against the United Kingdom. The example of the Netherlands Government is cited as an argument for an annual report to Parliament. The information that would be included in such a report is already widely available, and there would be no additional benefit in producing yet another report on the subject.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000087"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, and my noble friend Lord Parekh asked about the Ministry of Justice adopting a stronger co-ordinating role. In the past few years, the Ministry of Justice and its predecessor, the Department for Constitutional Affairs, has taken more of a central role in implementing judgments. However, the lead responsibility for implementing a judgment properly lies with the department in charge of the policy area in question. They also asked why there is no central database of judgments against the United Kingdom. All judgments against the United Kingdom can be accessed through the website of the European Court of Human Rights. At this time, we have found there to be no significant value in producing a separate database of cases and their implementation, which would be a resource-intense task. We have also been asked to commit ourselves to specific time limits for implementing cases, but the length of time that each judgment takes to implement depends first on what needs to be done and, secondly, on whether it requires primary legislation. To set a blanket time limit for all cases, therefore, would not be appropriate. It is the responsibility of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to ensure that implementation is carried out in a timely manner.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000088"></a>We are not, of course, required to respond to the Committee of Ministers&#146; annual report on implementation of judgments. It is published by the committee for information. As for the Carson case, which the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, mentioned, apparently there was a judgment only two weeks ago. I am sorry in the circumstances to have to tell the noble Lord that it went against the side that he was clearly supporting.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC141"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC141</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>some more specific points. In his opening remarks, the noble Lord, Lord Lester, talked about the court being overwhelmed with cases. We share the noble Lord's concern about the need to reform the Strasbourg court. We continue to engage with our colleagues in the Council of Europe to press for Protocol 14 to be fully ratified. We are also exploring what other measures can be taken to keep the court functioning with or without that protocol.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000091"></a>We also agree with the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that the Government should make greater use of remedial orders. They are an excellent tool for addressing the incompatibility of primary legislation and it is disappointing that they have been used only three times since the Act came into force. One problem is that remedial orders cannot be amended in Parliament, so they are not entirely suited to complex remedial measures, which may explain their limited use on recent cases. However, we are pressing&#151;my department particularly is pressing&#151;for them to be used more when appropriate.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000092"></a>My noble friend Lord Parekh said that the JCHR should bust myths concerning human rights. As a Government, we do our best already and work hard to correct myths and misunderstandings about human rights. It is not always the easiest thing to do, particularly as some of the media concentrate on the Human Rights Act and concerns around it.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000093"></a>Many myths have grown up about the Human Rights Act&#151;that it somehow favours criminals, gives criminals the right to privacy, to obtain pornography and to give rights to rooftop protesters. Frankly, a lot of those myths are just not true. Nothing in the Human Rights Act could enable any of those things to happen or prevent the prosecution of those who are a danger to the public. On the contrary, the Act explicitly allows limitations on rights in the interests of public safety or for the prevention of crime. We believe&#151;and I hope that the Committee does too&#151;that the Act secures a fair balance between the interests of society and the protection of the rights of the individual. It is a protection to all of us, and particularly important to the most vulnerable in our society&#151;those in the healthcare system and adults who have learning disabilities.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000094"></a>I have done my best to answer some of the questions that have been raised in this important debate. We are proud that, overall, our record on the implementation of judgments is recognised as good both by the Committee of Ministers and by the Joint Committee. We will of course respond to the committee in the usual way. More importantly, we will continue to work to implement judgments and to respond to declarations of incompatibility. I hope that the Joint Committee&#146;s next annual report can reflect even more positive progress in that area.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="0811248000095"></a>I shall finish by mentioning two matters. First, no mention has been made so far of the Aslef case and the way in which Her Majesty&#146;s Government have dealt with what was an undoubtedly tricky issue in regard to the best possible way of doing so. I should like to put on the record the fact that the report commends the Government on the attitude they took. Secondly, the real measure of this Government&#146;s support

I end by thanking once again all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate.</p>
<h5><a name="08112410000048"></a>4.55 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08112410000002"></a><a name="81124-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08112410000051"></a>Lord Lester of Herne Hill:</b> I thank everyone who has taken part in this important debate, including of course the Minister for his full but in some respects somewhat bleak reply. I am sure that these proceedings will be read not only in this country, but beyond it. In fact, the Committee of Ministers is to meet in Strasbourg from Tuesday to Thursday of next week and will be monitoring, among other things, UK compliance. I am sure that the committee will be interested in what has been said on all sides in this debate. I should say also that I have an unusual role in the Committee of Ministers of representing Cyprus against Turkey. The committee meets in the form of representatives from 47 different countries sitting in large concentric circles, and when I listen to the UK in the dock&#151;often in debates that can take hours on a single case&#151;I feel sorry for the excellent diplomatic representatives speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom because they have to put forward the best case they can on the basis of domestic departments which, I am sorry to say, let them down in certain important ways. Sometimes, therefore, they have to make bricks without straw. This imposes unacceptable burdens on the Committee of Ministers when 6,000-plus cases have to be supervised. That even a single British case should take as long as it does imposes an additional burden, and it is one of the reasons why what we are debating is of great practical importance.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000003"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, asked why the Law Lords have not taken part in this debate, and the answer is because of the separation of powers that is required by the convention. I commend the Government on having separated the judicial power so that we have a new Supreme Court. That may sound like a purist view, but I am sure in the end it is right constitutionally.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000004"></a>Reference was made to combating unfair attacks on judges and on the Human Rights Act, and I agree with what the Minister said about that. I deeply regret that ever since the Human Rights Bill was introduced, some sections of the media have sought an absolute immunity for the press from any liability for invasions of personal privacy. I was myself lobbied by a large newspaper organisation at the time, and I am glad the Government stood against that lobby. However, it has meant that day after day, unfair attacks are made by self-interested press barons who seek to earn profits out of sometimes gross intrusions on personal privacy. What I particularly deplore is that I and others have used the convention in the interests of the press to get free speech more strongly recognised in our legal system, but the media will not accept a fair balance between free speech on the one hand and honour, reputation and personal privacy on the other. That, I think, is unacceptable both under the convention and to ordinary men and women.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000005"></a>The Aslef case has been mentioned. I did not raise it because I was embarrassed to do so in view of the fact that I played a role in it, but I agree entirely with the finding of the committee that it is a conspicuously good example of a fair and wise implementation. Neither I nor committee is suggesting that the Government have an overall bad record in terms of implementation of the judgments of Strasbourg. That is not the case.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000006"></a>The burden of our report, in so far as it deals with systemic problems and not individual cases, is that the committee system cannot work properly without a variety of measures being introduced in partnership with the Government. We are hugely overloaded. Week after week, we scrutinise almost every government Bill. We have thematic inquiries. We also take on this unique role, which no other member state&#146;s Parliament does, of monitoring compliance with the European Court&#146;s judgments.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000007"></a>I listened very carefully to the Minister, who said that we will hear in two months&#146; time the Government&#146;s official response to our report. Unless it changes, we heard it today. The only positive thing he was able to say about the systemic recommendations we have made is that we will get action reports, which is good news. But I did not hear him say anything positive about any of the other systemic recommendations. I am sure that he still has an open mind and has not completely rejected them. If he has, it will hamper the role of the committee, which would be a misfortune.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000008"></a>It is fair to say that the experts are looking at the role of the Joint Committee on Human Rights as a model which can be applied in other countries across Europe. That is why we were singled out for special mention at the Stockholm conference. It is the role of the Government in helping the committee to work properly which is still lacking. I appreciate that the Minister was not able to tell us, even a year after our recommendations were made, what the Government&#146;s response will be, but I hope that in two months&#146; time, he will have convinced his colleagues to do better in responding to those recommendations than he has done.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000009"></a>The Minister referred to the Human Rights Act, about which I shall say a couple of things. Whatever the position of the Official Opposition will be towards the Human Rights Act if and when it wins power, certain things have got to remain. There has to be effective remedies in this country for violations of the convention. Otherwise, we get back to the bad old days when lawyers like me would go to Strasbourg for want of domestic remedies. Therefore, politicians may talk about tearing up the Human Rights Act, but whether we have a human rights Act or a British Bill of rights or a British Bill of rights and responsibilities, we are bound on the international and European plain and we cannot dilute those rights or obligations.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000010"></a>The Minister said that the final say lies elsewhere, meaning that it does not lie with the committee, and referred to the supremacy of Parliament. Parliament is controlled by the Executive largely. If the Government have the will, they will be able to give effect to many of our reports.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000011"></a>I will not add to what has been said on prisoners&#146; voting rights, except to deplore the fact that we cannot be told even now when the next consultation will begin. The Minister talks about practical problems: the Irish have solved them at a stroke by simply saying, &#147;Give them postal votes&#148;. Subject to exceptions, that could be done overnight and well before the next general election.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000012"></a>To conclude, we are very grateful for this debate, and for the Minister being called to account. His response is disappointing on systemic reforms. We hope, as he does, that next year we can be much more positive in our annual report, but that will depend on his colleagues being much more positive in their response.</p>

<h5><a name="08112410000049"></a>5.05 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08112410000014"></a><a name="81124-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08112410000052"></a>Lord Sutherland of Houndwood</b> rose to move that this House takes note of the Report of the Science and Technology Committee, <I>Air Travel and Health: </I><I>A</I><I>n Update</I> (First Report, HL Paper 7).</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000015"></a>The noble Lord said: In my bleaker moments, which often occur at 35,000 feet, I think that we need a contemporary Swift to hold up to us a picture of what we do, what we claim to find interesting and enjoyable and how we spend perhaps too much of our time. One example of that is climbing into a metal tube and flying at 500 miles an hour 35,000 feet above the earth. Dispassionately considered, it is a strange way to pass the time. Some do it out of sheer necessity because their work requires it; some do it as they hope it is the gateway to the heaven of a delightful holiday; some undoubtedly do it just to escape the hell of airports; but there are those who do it, depending on where they sit in the aeroplane, as some sort of status symbol or declaration of wealth, which often go together. None the less, for a significant number of people, it has turned out to be a source of trouble that may induce ill-health, and many people believe that that could happen.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000016"></a>In 2000, the Science and Technology Select Committee of the House published a report that brought together for the first time the wide spectrum of health issues associated with air travel. I am happy to say that the report stimulated research into aircrew and passenger health, not only in the United Kingdom, but well beyond it, so our understanding of major health issues connected with air travel is much improved since then. However, there are still some crucial gaps in our knowledge, to which noble Lords more learned than I am in these matters will, no doubt, point fingers at in due course.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000017"></a>The Government changed the law in 2006 to give the Secretary of State,</p>
<ul><a name="08112410000046"></a>&#147;the general duty of organising, carrying out and encouraging measures for safeguarding the health of persons on board aircraft&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08112410000041"></a>The Civil Aviation Act 2006 gave the CAA responsibility for the health of all persons aboard aircraft. Much has changed for the better since our original report in 2000, but to members of the committee there were

<a name="81124-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000018"></a>I thank the Government for their response to our report. It is like the proverbial curate&#146;s egg. Noble Lords will not be surprised that the committee thinks the good bits are where the Government accept its recommendations and the bad bits are otherwise. However, there are good bits as well as bits on which several members of the committee might wish to comment.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81124-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000019"></a>In the course of preparing our report, we received a great deal of written evidence and oral evidence to back it up from distinguished scientists. As a result of that report, we can applaud the Government for having taken the steps necessary to make aviation health a priority. Granted the almost inevitable increase that seems to go on, notwithstanding other matters that bear on this, it is a matter that should have high priority. The aviation health group that was set up has been well received by the industry, the unions, the regulatory authorities and passenger representatives. That is to be commended because we need to have confidence in such a group. The Aviation Health Unit was set up in 2003 within the CAA to act as a focal point for aviation health in the United Kingdom. We think that having such a focal point is a big step forward. However, we believe that there is a risk that this good initiative and other positive initiatives from the Government and elsewhere in the UK may come under threat with the impending transfer of responsibilities from the CAA to the European Aviation Safety Agency. I have to say that I scrutinised the Government&#146;s responses on this matter very carefully, and the wording was good:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08112410000045"></a>&#147;The Government supports the development of a comprehensive European regulatory system&#148;&#151;</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08112410000042"></a>of course; aviation health and regulation is more than a national matter. They welcome that,</p>
<ul><a name="08112410000047"></a>&#147;as part of its commitment to establish and maintain a high, uniform level of aviation safety across Europe&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08112410000043"></a>The regulation to extend EASA&#146;s competence to air operations is expected to be adopted in the next few weeks. I wonder how far that has gone and whether the competence of EASA to take on these positive responses from the Government has yet been established. Perhaps the Minister can give us further reassurance and an update on this matter.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000020"></a>We are concerned that the CAA has failed to follow up the recommendations of its own research and increase the regulatory minimum seat pitch to above 28 inches. I note what the government response has to say on that. For example, and I do not think that this is addressed in the government response, in the event of an emergency the current minimum of 26 inches would not allow many passengers to adopt the recommended brace position. That seems to me to be a minimum condition of the health and safety of those on board. Most airlines currently operate with a 28-inch seat pitch, but the committee believes that should be guaranteed rather than a matter for good practice. The fact that many airlines already provide that suggests that a regulatory requirement would not

Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether the Government have in hand further discussion of these matters.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000021"></a>Our 2000 report raised the specific issue of the introduction of premium economy services, which allow passengers more leg room. It seemed to us that it dealt with some of the issues very well indeed, particularly on long haul flights, but we were disappointed at the tax regime that was introduced at that time, whereby premium economy was taxed at the same level as first-class seating. We know that things have moved on, and I believe that the Government are consulting on the possibility of replacing seating tax with a whole plane tax, but we would be interested to know how those discussions are going and how the consultation is progressing, so that we can take a view on whether we need further response to this matter. In the best of all possible worlds, on a day when taxes are apparently being cut, this might have been an opportunity, had the old regime remained in place&#151;but it appears that we have moved on.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000022"></a>A matter that always concerns the Science and Technology Select Committee is research. We believe that informed opinion is the most effective route towards effective policy. A great deal of activity has been stimulated by our original report. For example, the WRIGHT project, carried out under the auspices of the WHO, published its report as we were initially taking evidence. The project set out to find whether the risk of venous thromboembolism was increased by air travel, to determine the magnitude of the risk and to consider other factors. The study came up with some very interesting findings. The WRIGHT project plans to continue and would wish to investigate specific flight-related factors and introduce or recommend effective preventive measures. Perhaps the Minister can update us on that.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000023"></a>Much to their credit, the Government financially supported phase 1 of the project, but they did not think it appropriate that there should be direct government funding for phase 2. That is fine, provided international authorities take on the responsibility, because as the Government accepted in funding phase 1, these are important matters on which detailed knowledge is essential. I would have thought that the business of funding phase 2 is partly a matter of protecting one&#146;s investment in phase 1.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000024"></a>There has been a lot of discussion about the role of aspirin and whether it is a good thing or a bad thing. I emphasise that opinions on this are divided, which is all the more reason to continue with research to produce clear outcomes on whether the use of aspirin increases or minimises the risk of DVT across the population, or has some other unacceptable consequence.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000025"></a>We welcome the Government&#146;s response. However, has the matter been raised at the AHWG, as the Government implied might be the case? It would be interesting to know whether that was the case. My noble friend Lord Patel will speak in greater detail about the risk of inflation&#151;or, rather, infection, although the two may go hand in hand. However, one of the chief responses was that wipes are provided on aircraft, and that the right way to proceed is to have a good hand wipe with something impregnated with alcohol.  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC147"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Other noble Lords may have better experience of wipes than I do. Some of the ones that have come my way were more like dry sandpaper than what I call a wipe. This is a minimalist response to a significant danger of infection, not least because, especially on long-haul flights, the preparation and consumption of food, and everything that goes with that in terms of bodily functions, is a very significant element in the environment in the aircraft.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000026"></a>I draw attention to our comments on the evidence we received from pilots and unions highlighting fatigue as a new health concern. We remain concerned that tight rostering systems may well provide the number of flying hours required by the rules, but that if they continue for several days the risk of cumulative fatigue rises. We welcome the Government&#146;s acceptance that this is a serious matter and their willingness to commission, or even perhaps participate in, research in this area. We would appreciate being given further information on that.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000027"></a>We are pleased that work is being commissioned through Cranfield. We received a very helpful letter from the Minister in June 2008, informing us that this had moved a step forward. We would like to know what stage the commissioning of the research has reached, and when there might be outcomes.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000028"></a>The Government responded positively to our recommendations as regards the public&#146;s and general practitioners&#146; understanding of the dangers of air travel. Although there may be a good supply of information on the world wide web, not all air travellers use that with the efficiency prevalent among Members of the Committee. Therefore, they need other sources of information and general practitioners are the obvious starting point. The Government rightly commend the involvement of the royal colleges and have consulted the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists on this and related matters. We would be interested to know the outcome of that consultation.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000029"></a>As I say, a range of matters still concern us, and I have no doubt that my colleagues will discuss them in detail. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08112410000031"></a><a name="81124-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08112410000053"></a>Lord Patel:</b> I thank the noble Lords, Lord Broers and Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, for their exemplary chairmanship of our committee. I enjoyed for the second time being a member of the committee, which has produced this report on air travel and health.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000032"></a>Everyone knows that the airline industry has a great record in making flying safer and that, over the years, the industry has put into place a methodology for identifying and learning from air-safety incidents that has made commercial flying safer than any other mode of transport. However, the same cannot be said about the industry and regulators addressing the air cabin environment and passenger comfort for the vast majority of passengers. Doing so could make the flying experience safer and more comfortable, particularly when it comes to health. Much work has been done, as the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, mentioned, but  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC148"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC148</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more needs to be done, particularly to identify areas in which there could be a reduction in the transmission of infection and the possibility of developing medical complications, particularly on long-haul flights. The industry does not have the same focus on the health of their customers as they do on the safety of their equipment.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000033"></a>Our report made three recommendations that are all based on the evidence that was presented to us and which the Government&#146;s response did not fully address. The general perception among the public that infectious disease can be transmitted via the air cabin environment has not gone away, despite the evidence against this view. Having said that, the role of air travel as a vector in the spread of disease is clear, as more than 2 billion people travel by air and more and more new pathogens are discovered. There are currently more than 50 new pathogens, along with the better known ones such as influenza, tuberculosis and SARS. SARS infected 8,000 people in 29 countries in a very short time and created a major global health emergency. Pandemic influenza poses an even greater threat than SARS. Apart from the number of people who are travelling, we now have bigger aircraft, which carry up to 800 passengers and fly longer distances, frequently for 12 to 18 hours. The potential for the spread of infection must be greater, so what measures can be taken to slow down the spread of infection or to stop it in the event of a global pandemic, and why? Slowing the spread of the influenza virus during a pandemic will reduce the chance of a number of people dying. Importantly, it might also allow anti-virals to be delivered and vaccines to be developed.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000034"></a>We found very little evidence of the airline industry, regulators or the Government having any contingency plans to control the spread of disease in such an event. We were told that there is planning, but no details were given, which led us to conclude that there may have been talks but no plans. There can be several ways in which to try to limit or to slow down the spread of infection during a pandemic. Will the Minister put that right today and tell us who is co-ordinating plans to control influenza pandemics?</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000035"></a>Aeroplanes with a large number of passengers flying long distances to and from countries where infective organisms are transmitted by water, food or skin contact risk spreading diseases. There is clear evidence that disinfecting possibly contaminated surfaces using appropriate hand hygiene and alcohol wipes, which the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, mentioned, can reduce the risk of transmitting such infections.</p>

<p><a name="08112410000044"></a>While, following our report, the airlines have begun to give good advice on issues such as the need to take exercise and maintain movement, to control hydration and so on, I wonder why they have not adopted the guidance related to reducing the risk of transmitting infection when many of the actions that can be taken incur no cost. Perhaps the Minister can comment on why is there such a reluctance to implement these recommendations.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000036"></a>The WHO report also states that the transmission of infection becomes widespread when the air cabin ventilation supply is turned off for longer than 30 minutes, yet no guidance is given by the regulator to airlines to  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC149"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>limit the time spent without ventilation to less than 30 minutes when passengers are on board. Again, the Government response did not support any insistence on this. I hope that the Minister will comment on these issues and agree that the recommendations made in our report are sensible and will help to reduce the risk of the transmission of infection.</p>

<p><a name="08112410000037"></a>The first Science and Technology Committee report on this issue highlighted the wide gap in research into cabin environment and health. However, as has been referred to, while the Government and other agencies have supported much of the research undertaken since then, as yet no conclusions have been reached. Moreover, as my noble friend Lord Sutherland mentioned, no research is planned for part 2 of the WRIGHT project, the WHO Research into the Global Hazards of Travel, which is not funded. Can the Minister confirm whether that funding will be provided or are the Government discussing it? Many of the results of EU research schemes are not published, and surely that is not satisfactory. The Government need to do more to support and encourage appropriate research and ensure that the results are published.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000038"></a>The airline industry and the regulatory authorities need to demonstrate a more responsible attitude towards making sure that the risks to customers&#146; health, be it from the transmission of disease onboard, developing medical conditions such as DVT or existing medical conditions becoming worse during long-haul flights, are reduced. They must be seen to be continuously addressing these issues and should not be relying on reports like ours to push them into taking action; they need to be more proactive. A safe aircraft is one that is not only well maintained and safe to travel in, but also provides a healthier and more comfortable environment, particularly on long-distance flights.</p>

<p><a name="08112410000039"></a><a name="81124-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08112410000054"></a>Lord Broers:</b> My Lords, I do not have a lot to say as the Government have supported many of the committee&#146;s recommendations in this follow-up report. In general, following the Select Committee&#146;s original report published in 2000, the airlines have acted responsibly on most issues related to air travel health&#151;with the exception of some, as mentioned by my noble friend Lord Patel&#151;and on the whole the public have a better, if not complete, understanding of what they have to do to minimise the dangers posed by air travel. The one issue that has needed attention is that of contamination of the air in cabins and cockpits, so-called &#147;fume events&#148;, which are rare but none the less important. I join my noble friend Lord Sutherland in asking what progress has been made to ensure that they do not occur in the future.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08112410000040"></a>I feel that further effort will be worthwhile in respect of two other issues, and make the point that continual monitoring is essential. The first is in regard to cabin space, especially seating pitch and width, and aisle width. As my noble friends Lord Patel and Lord Sutherland both pointed out, the seat pitch is often so small that it is often not possible for tall people to adopt the brace position. That is clearly unsatisfactory. Further, in my experience, on transatlantic flights the seats in some aircraft are so narrow that it is almost  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>impossible for many people to avoid lateral pressure on the lower body, which must surely interfere with blood circulation.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000002"></a>Passengers are correctly told to exercise to the extent that they can in their seats to reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis, but that becomes almost impossible in a very narrow seat, and the opportunity to walk around, which is also recommended, is easier said than done. During most flights, the aisles are frequently blocked by catering trolleys and those carrying duty-free goods, and in any case, if more than about 20 per cent of the passengers were to get out of their seats at one time, the aisles would be blocked. Because of all those factors, any further reductions in space per passenger must be avoided, and the authorities must remain vigilant in checking that airlines do not break the already only marginally adequate regulations.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000003"></a>The second issue is cabin pressure. Although that has been considered at length by the authorities and a minimum cabin pressure equivalent to a height of 2,400 metres or 8,000 feet has been established, and in general is adhered to by the airlines, its consequences are not appreciated by the average traveller. People often comment that they are unable to sleep on long flights and think that that is a problem related to themselves as individuals rather than being due to low pressure in the cabin, which is only 75 per cent of the pressure at sea level. Such pressures are encountered at the highest mountain resorts&#151;most hotels and chalets at Alpine ski resorts are in fact considerably lower than 8,000 feet&#151;but in general it is realised by most who visit these resorts that it will take a couple of days before they become fully acclimatised to the lower pressure.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000004"></a>The reduced pressure is normally not a serious problem as people do not exercise at altitude in aircraft, but it can be serious if the passenger suffers from heart or lung disease. Airlines point that out to those who take the trouble to search the information provided by them, but it is not usually made obvious to those who do not feel that they need to inquire. Most doctors are familiar with the dangers and if consulted will provide accurate advice and, for example, may suggest that the passenger be tested in a respiratory clinic, but there are many cases when such advice is not sought. I remember Alistair Cooke in a &#147;Letter from America&#148; explaining how he had had a bad turn on a flight crossing the USA and had been given oxygen in order to recover. In his inimitable style, he went on to explain the reason, admitting that he had not been aware when he flew in an aircraft that he was in effect visiting a very high mountain resort.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000005"></a>I have been unable to find anyone who can explain the economies of maintaining a given cabin pressure. I do know, however, that it is one of the selling points of the luxury executive jets, such as those used by the heads of the Detroit automobile companies to travel to Washington to ask for money. They are pressurised at about 1,200 metres rather than 2,400 metres, thereby making them less stressful to travel in. I suggest that the commercial airlines are asked why they cannot do the same. If it is a safety issue, because commercial aircraft are not designed for the higher pressure difference across the fuselage skin, why do planes often fly at

I frequently travel with an altimeter and take an interest in monitoring what the captain is doing with the cabin environment. The conditions inside commercial aircraft should be continually monitored to ensure the health and well-being of passengers, and it should be clear that those who do the monitoring are truly independent of the airlines and the aircraft manufacturers, and that the atmosphere and general conditions are optimised for the comfort and well-being of the passengers.</p>
<h5><a name="08112411000102"></a>5.33 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08112411000006"></a><a name="81124-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08112411000108"></a>Lord Haskel:</b><b><a name="81124-gc0004.htm_spnew6"></a></b>One of the pleasures of being on your Lordships' Science and Technology Committee is that every inquiry is a voyage of discovery. Early on in this inquiry, I discovered that air travel is political. It is political with a small &#147;p&#148;&#151;not party-political, but people political. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, told us that the reason is that air travel is blamed for all sorts of health problems, such as being poisoned by the cabin air or crippled by the seats. It is blamed for causing blood clots through inactivity, and for carrying viruses from one continent to another, as well as causing fatigue and a risk of infections, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, explained. It is no wonder that we thought it important to update the inquiry that we carried out in 2000 to see what progress had been made in researching these concerns&#151;or unbelief in the public mind, as the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, put it. There has been a lot of public and media interest, and I suppose that, too, stimulated our return to this topic.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000007"></a>Looking at the progress that has been made, I think that the Government deserve some credit. In our 2000 report, we listed a number of research needs and I think, as the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, said, that the Government have responded to them. They have set up alone or jointly with the research organisations and the EU a number of research projects in response to our list. The research involves many departments of the Government&#151;transport, health, science, business, health and safety and the Treasury because of the tax on the seat&#151;and, of course, the airlines themselves.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000008"></a>This diversity may be necessary, but there are two problems with it that caused us concern. First, it needs co-ordination and, yes, the Aviation Health Unit is doing that, as the government response says, but people need to know that this work is going on. As I said, health and air travel is &#147;people political&#148;. People need to know that their concerns are being investigated and dealt with, and the best way of reassuring them is to tell them more about the Aviation Health Unit. When we proposed that, what we had in mind was that the Aviation Health Unit should become some sort of trusted brand. However, in their response, the Government said that they want people to deal with the airlines and other sources of information: the National Health Service, the BMA and the World Health Organisation. That may be logical and sensible administratively, but it does not deal with people's concerns. Airlines are certainly learning a lot about health and flying, but they make varying claims, as competitors do. Government entities are limited by boundaries. We envisaged the Aviation Health Unit having a profile above all that.  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC152"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC152</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Indeed, the Aviation Health Unit makes special mention of this in its note about our report on its website, and it says it is happening, so I was disappointed to learn that the chairmanship is going to remain with the Department for Transport and that the profile is going to be kept low.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000009"></a>The need for this high degree of trust is demonstrated by the incident report attached to the Minister's letter of 19 June, which the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, spoke about. The report relates to an incident in September 2007 when, shortly after take off, the commander of a BAe 146 noticed an unusual smell and soon began to feel dizzy. The noble Lord, Lord Broers, spoke about how during our inquiry, we were told of numerous occasions of people feeling ill due to unfiltered air coming into the cabins from the engines of BAe 146 aircraft, and all the Jeremiahs will have said that this is just one more example of that problem. However, the investigation concluded that the smell and the dizziness were caused by the chemicals used for cleaning the toilets. After all the accounts which we heard from air crew and passengers who believed that their health had suffered because of air contamination from the engines, it is going to require a very trusted voice for people to believe that, on this occasion at least, it was the cleaning chemical. This is what happens when matters become political in this way.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000010"></a>The same applies to thrombosis. People believe that it is caused by the inactivity and the pitch of the seats in aircraft, but the Wright report found that the same thrombosis was caused by inactivity alone, and that the pitch of the seat is hardly relevant. That applies to any mode of transport or none. Thrombosis can, and does, happen in hospital. Again, we need a trusted voice to explain this.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000011"></a>Away from the politics, the Government are to be congratulated on continuing the research and commissioning new research. Airlines are making a welcome effort to provide better information to passengers about how they can reduce the risk of ill health when flying. Much of that advice comes from the Aviation Health Unit website, which carries some authority. That website also publishes a guide for doctors on assessing people's fitness to fly. This authoritative advice can only increase the trust in the AHU, which we are keen to see enhanced. The frequently asked questions on its website are wide-ranging and the answers are detailed, but they do not deal with infection, which the noble Lord, Lord Patel, spoke about.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000012"></a>What of the future? Molecular biology may have found a way of resetting our body clock so that we are less disturbed by jet lag, and perhaps that will reduce the effect of flying on our health. Incorporating air travel into the carbon trading system has stimulated a search for more fuel efficiency and less aircraft weight and, presumably, the AHU will be alert to the risk of that affecting air quality or seating space or of carrying viruses and other matters relating to health.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000013"></a>Passenger air travel is forecast to grow, and so are our concerns about our quality of life. Therefore, the public's interest in health and air travel will not go away. It will remain political with a small &#147;p&#148;, so I hope that the Government will continue with research and will tell people about it by raising the profile of

In closing, I thank my colleagues, our chairman and the Clerks for their leadership and hard work. It has been a pleasure to work with them.</p>
<h5><a name="08112411000103"></a>5.42 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08112411000014"></a><a name="81124-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08112411000109"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> I am delighted to take part in this debate and to see that the noble Countess, Lady Mar, is here in attendance on the committee, although I know that she does not feel able to participate as she has been having trouble with her voice. If I say anything that she agrees with, I am obviously right; if I say anything on my own behalf, I take full responsibility and blame for it. The committee is to be congratulated, and I am particularly delighted by the contributions that the chairman and its members have made this afternoon to an important issue that has been increasingly accepted by Ministers.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000015"></a>I have been campaigning on air contamination and fume events in aircraft cabins and flight decks for almost 10 years, but before I come to that specific problem, I want to touch on one or two of the other recommendations made by the committee and on the Government&#146;s response. First, I shall deal with recommendation 5.1. As the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, said, the Government dismissed the committee's concerns that the airlines should not be fully responsible for handling queries and complaints on health issues. It should surely be the AHU, which is answerable to the CAA and through it to Ministers. The public will always be suspicious that the industry will be commercially biased. It is extremely important that that issue is accountable through Ministers. The committee concludes:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08112411000092"></a>&#147;This is a lost opportunity&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08112411000082"></a>We should agree.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000016"></a>In relation to recommendations 5.4 and 5.7, the Government dismiss evidence from the committee that not enough relevant research is commissioned or funded. The committee asked Ministers to think again, and I am sure we agree. On recommendation 5.13, Ministers rejected the advice that passengers should never remain on an aircraft for more than 30 minutes when the ventilation systems are not operational. That has also been referred to by members of the committee. However, it is not just passengers who are affected; the pilot and cabin crew may well suffer a cumulative effect rather than just the occasional incident experienced by the passenger. At the very least the committee is right to insist that a new reporting procedure should be put in place to record whenever 30 minutes is exceeded.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000017"></a>I turn now to recommendation 5.17, with which I am principally concerned and which has been referred to by both the chairman of the committee and the noble Lord, Lord Broers. This addresses the issue of what happens when there is an air contamination incident. The committee&#146;s report, which was published in May this year, referred only briefly to the Government&#146;s response. It did not give it in full and to be frank is unduly complacent. The full recommendation is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08112411000093"></a>&#147;We recommend that the AHWG-sponsored research to identify the substances produced during a fume event be completed urgently. It should be followed up by an epidemiological study on  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC154"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC154</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>pilots to ascertain the incidence and prevalence of ill health in air crews and any association there might be with the exposure to chemicals identified in the AHWG-sponsored study, paying particular attention to the synergistic effect of these chemicals&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08112411000083"></a>It is an extremely important recommendation that has not been dealt with adequately either in the resum&#233; or, indeed, in the Government&#146;s response. The committee is entitled to a full explanation of why Ministers have been dragging their feet. These issues have raised questions in the past, and the noble Countess, Lady Mar, and I have been given vague answers about the viability of research proposals in this regard. Even when we met the Aviation Minister, Mr Jim Fitzpatrick, on 22 October, he could not give us a satisfactory explanation.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000018"></a>It is true that the Government have come a long way on the issue. I recall way back on 28 July 2000 raising this issue during an adjournment debate. The Minister responding did not even think that it was worth referring to in his wind-up. In an Answer given in February 2004, the Government were still insisting that they were,</p>
<ul><a name="08112411000096"></a>&#147;not aware of any adverse long-term health effects in flight crew that can be traced back to the cabin environment&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 9/2/04; col. 1234W.]</ul>
<p><a name="08112411000084"></a>That was said despite the fact that the committee heard extraordinary evidence that in 2000 the CAA actually suspended the medical certificate of a BAe 146 pilot. Yet four years later, the Government were trying to pretend that there was no problem. Even after the Contaminated Air Protection Conference held in April 2005 at Imperial College, at which I was a keynote speaker, the Aviation Health Working Group stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08112411000094"></a>&#147;Representatives of the Department for Transport and the Department of Health attended the recent international conference on contaminated air, but no new evidence on the presence or effect of low levels of organophosphates in aircraft cabins was presented&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08112411000085"></a>I think that the group should look again at the record of that conference.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000019"></a>However, the commissioning of the Cranfield University research is most welcome, and the fact that it is making some progress is good. But there are still doubts about the method and extent of that research. Chris Winder, a senior professor of applied toxicology at the School of Safety Science at the University of New South Wales, suggested in 2006 that,</p>
<ul><a name="08112411000097"></a>&#147;mists and aerosol particulates will settle under the force of gravity, and where they coalesce or adhere to the walls of their container, the concentration of the mist in the air would drop dramatically, leaving only a low vapour residual&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08112411000086"></a>Thus, he goes on to conclude, there could be a false-negative analysis. Can the Minister tell us what remedial steps the researchers at Cranfield will be taking to ensure that their analysis is not undermined in this way?</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000020"></a>The report rightly recommends that a proper epidemiological study of the pilots and cabin crew affected should be undertaken. Surely the Minister accepts that this is now urgent, and the committee must insist that the evidence from Dr Sarah Mackenzie-Ross&#151;both her written submission of 7 June 2007  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC155"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC155</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and her subsequent oral presentation on 10 July 2007&#151;must be followed up immediately, before the trail goes cold.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000021"></a>Members of the Committee will recall the Independent Pilots Association&#146;s findings, based on research by the Global Cabin Air Quality Executive, that 86 per cent of 242 pilots&#151;past and present&#151;who had been responsible for BAe 146 flights had experienced contaminated air events, 57 per cent reported various adverse effects, 25 per cent reported medium or long-term health effects, and 8.5 per cent appear to have been medically retired or had their medical certificate withdrawn by the CAA. This is quite common; it is not really such a tiny situation as Ministers have suggested in the past.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000022"></a>I emphasise again that ill health among occasional air passengers is serious, but how much more serious is acute or chronic illness among those who are regularly and consistently responsible for the safety of our aircraft? The airlines and aircraft manufacturers have shown that they insufficiently protect the safety of crews and passengers. Only Ministers, not the industry, are accountable to the public. If anything went seriously wrong, they would be blamed, and rightly so.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000023"></a>While this problem still exists in some aircraft, some of the worst offenders&#151;notably some of the BAe 146 aircraft&#151;have been withdrawn from service, and more responsible carriers such as Flybe, which is based at Exeter, have disposed of them, partly on account of their deleterious effects on the air quality outside. However, their engines&#146; impact on air quality inside could be even more serious. Incidentally, I wonder what has happened to the Department for Transport&#146;s own comments on the committee&#146;s recommendation that the JAA should reconsider,</p>
<ul><a name="08112411000098"></a>&#147;its requirement for ventilation of the flight deck with only fresh air&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08112411000087"></a>This seems to have disappeared.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000024"></a>How far has the Government&#146;s Aviation Health Working Group or the AHU got with advice for those dealing with victims of serious air contamination events? I understand that Dr Robert Harrison of the Division of Occupational and Environmental Medicine at the University of California published only in August 2008 a document entitled <I>Management of Exposure to Aircraft Bleed-Air Contaminants Among Airline Workers&#151;A Guide for Health Care Providers</I>. Surely the very least that our Ministers should do is to read that carefully and see whether it applies to our situation, too.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000025"></a>People&#146;s lives and livelihoods have been very seriously affected by these problems. I am sure that I do not need to remind either Members of the Grand Committee or members of the Select Committee that there have been near disasters as a result of these contamination incidents elsewhere in Europe, notably in Sweden, with pilots and co-pilots incapacitated. Too many experienced flight officers have been forced into early retirement by consequent ill health. Simply phasing out specific aircraft or specific ventilation systems is not enough.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000026"></a>In the mean time, what of those who have been so adversely affected? We have seen in research into the illness suffered by veterans of the first Gulf War what  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC156"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC156</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>delays can do to undermine the quality of research. Should not the Government establish fully what the toxic effects of tricresyl phosphate are and how toxic it is compared with other chemicals? Ministers have drawn a blank on this issue in Written Answers to me in this House. The GCAQE, led by Captain Susan Michaelis and Tristan Lorraine, submitted substantial evidence on the toxicity of these chemicals and their various isomers. It is unclear why the committee was unpersuaded by their expert submissions.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000027"></a>Dr Sarah Mackenzie-Ross, whose excellent research at UCL is well known, has referred to the possibility of a synergistic effect occurring when chemicals such as tricresyl phosphate are mixed. There may also be a serious risk from the processes of disinfection, when cabin crews have to carry it out in advance of landings in and from tropical climates. Each of the individual chemicals is said to be safe, but very little work has been done on analysing the effects of what for some proves to be a lethal mix of different chemicals. The regulatory approach so far seems to be equivalent to proclaiming that electricity and water are safe on their own, without bothering to point out the grave dangers that can arise if both are used in the same environment.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000028"></a>Fume events of various kinds that threaten not only the long-term health of airline staff but the immediate safety of all on board a given aircraft are currently not reported adequately. There are clear signals from within the industry that the consequences for pilots of reporting such events can be dire. Licences can be lost and careers ended. If these issues, many of which are complex, are ever to be resolved, we must address that fundamental issue.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000029"></a>In his response, I hope that the Minister will be able to answer some key questions. When will the Cranfield research be published? What steps are being taken to ensure that it commands the confidence of campaigners on this issue? For example, has the GCAQE been consulted on the methods and scope of the research? Will the Minister now, on the basis of this report, refute the conclusions of the Committee on Toxicity that an epidemiological study is unnecessary? It is manifestly necessary, and has been for some 10 years, which has been reinforced by our own committee.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000030"></a>What action is the Aviation Health Working Group taking to investigate the effects of mixing chemicals in a cabin air environment? How sure is the Minister that benign individual chemical ingredients do not together amount to a toxic recipe? Finally, what steps will the Government now take to ensure that every fume event is reported? Is legislation now required to compel airlines to manage this process effectively? The pilots, cabin crew and passengers affected by contaminated air events suffer in the long term.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000031"></a>The Government have at last begun to recognise the problem, and the recent court ruling in relation to Georgina Downs&#146;s separate case on pesticides, including organophosphates, being used near people&#146;s homes is also a welcome development. But failure to act on a problem that Ministers now recognise is almost a more callous betrayal of passenger and staff interests than the total blindness that preceded it. This is a very serious issue. I am delighted that our committee it has

<h5><a name="08112411000104"></a>5.56 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08112411000032"></a><a name="81124-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08112411000110"></a>Earl Attlee:</b> I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, and his committee. This is a useful and timely report, and I found it very informative reading over the weekend. His introduction was as witty and clear as any that I have heard.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000033"></a>The 2000 Select Committee report to your Lordships&#146; House had a significant effect. Much has happened since and most of it is good. The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, asked about the competence of EASA. When does the Minister think that it will be competent? I hope that he can give an update on the progress, and I would be surprised if he were not well prepared on that point.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, made an interesting point about the control of infectious diseases, as did the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response about contingency plans for pandemics. Your Lordships are very good at differentiating between hope and a proper plan.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000035"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, made important points about hand hygiene, food and bodily functions. He is right. My humble military experience in the Middle East, demonstrated how important that is. Where we had good hand-washing hygiene, we had low rates of infection, but of course the converse was true. The noble Lord, Lord Broers, talked about what I would call &#147;fit-to-fly&#148; issues. I share the committee&#146;s concern about the availability of fit-to-fly information. Information is available on the internet, but there are two problems. First, some people hate the internet and others have no access to it, particularly the old, who are flying in increasing numbers. Secondly, there is a problem with accuracy and reliability. I read in the report that even the BBC travel health section gave completely wrong advice, which the report charitably described as nonsense.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000036"></a>I was surprised what did and did not contraindicate flying. For example, I was surprised that a 10 day-old baby could fly. It is clear that some work needs to be done on disseminating medical advice and, as ever, that is a cross-departmental issue. The Minister needs to push that.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000037"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, talked about the Aviation Health Unit, the AHU. The committee is right to suggest that the AHU handles passenger complaints, and I am concerned that the airlines&#146; complaint machinery will fall into the trap of minimising and mitigating complaints. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, gave an example of how that might occur. No matter how passenger-focused the airline is, if the airline receives one or two complaints of a similar but obscure nature, the temptation must be to bat it off. But if the AHU received eight complaints of a similar nature but about the same aircraft, this would be significant and it would surely take action.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000038"></a>The committee expressed concern regarding insufficient research, and many noble Lords talked about this. The government response to the report lists three projects, but their relevance was a little tenuous and fortuitous.  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC158"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC158</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Is the Minister convinced that sufficient research is being undertaken? What research is being conducted overseas? Have we got visibility of that? I know that we would not start a research project without checking whether the research had already been undertaken overseas, but are we examining what is being done overseas?</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000039"></a>Many noble Lords talked about what I would call the 30-minute rule. I am not yet convinced that the committee has got the correct answer. The committee slightly gave the game away when it said in the report:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08112411000095"></a>&#147;The issue of spread of disease by contact with infectious passengers is high in the public&#146;s mind&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08112411000088"></a>That statement is absolutely right, but it does not mean that regulation is the right answer. Indeed, the Government do not accept the recommendation in their response. On the whole, I do not like giving power without discretion. The proposed 30-minute rule is predicated on the increased risk after a period of 30 minutes without air conditioning. However, there may be risks associated with disembarking the passengers. They could include logistical problems at the airport or a known risk of crime or terrorism at the airport, or there could be a greater risk of infection from the airport rather than staying in the aircraft. Finally, not being ready to taxi to take-off could result in a lost slot opportunity, and that would have knock-on effects and could mean that the passengers do not get to fly that day at all.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000040"></a>It is a matter of judgment for the aircraft captain, who needs to balance the risks. It is absolutely vital that all members of the crew of the aircraft, from the captain downwards, recognise the risk of being on the ground in excess of 30 minutes without the air conditioning working. The committee suggests an alternative of making a delay of more than 30 minutes reportable,</p>
<ul><a name="08112411000099"></a>&#147;in order to put pressure on the airlines&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08112411000089"></a>to which I would add, &#147;and the captain&#148;. I suggest that we need to give further thought to this matter and not rush into it.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000041"></a>I enjoyed dipping into this subject by reading the report and listening to noble Lords&#146; comments. Following on from the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, on the attractiveness of the Science and Technology Committee, perhaps when I get out of my short trousers I might be honoured with a place on the committee. I look forward to listening to the Minister&#146;s comments.</p>
<h5><a name="08112411000105"></a>6.03 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08112411000042"></a><a name="81124-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08112411000111"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> The noble Earl came to a conclusion rather more rapidly than I had anticipated; please forgive me.</p>

<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC159"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC159</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>airline pilot to a BALPA shop steward to a senior executive at British Airways and chief executive of a small airline. First, let me say how pleased I am to be here and to be able to participate in this debate. I should particularly like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, for bringing this report to the House. In 2000, the committee&#146;s report was a milestone in raising the profile of aviation health. However, shortly after came the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Centre and passenger security became the top priority for Ministers and the aviation industry.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000045"></a>Nevertheless, looking back, I can say confidently that the Government, the Civil Aviation Authority as the UK&#146;s aviation regulator, and airlines have responded actively to the committee&#146;s recommendations. The extent of progress was recognised in the committee&#146;s report, <I>Air Travel and Health: An Update</I>, published in December 2007. In February 2008, the Government responded and, in May, the committee published that response.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000046"></a>I wanted to put those milestones on the record for two reasons: first, it sets out where we are as background to this debate; and, secondly, the UK has a very good story to tell in aviation health. As the committee observed,</p>
<ul><a name="08112411000100"></a>&#147;the Government have responded positively to our recommendations&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08112411000090"></a>Noble Lords know that the UK has a commercial aviation safety record which is second to none. It is a hard won reputation and we will do nothing to jeopardise it. We are also, as far as we know, the only country with a specific duty to safeguard health on board aircraft. The Civil Aviation Act 2006 charges the Secretary of State with,</p>
<ul><a name="08112411000101"></a>&#147;the general duty of organising, carrying out and encouraging measures for safeguarding the health of persons on board aircraft&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08112411000091"></a>The functions of the CAA were amended to include the health of persons on board aircraft. This change is a world first as far as we know and was welcomed in Parliament.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000047"></a>In direct response to the report&#146;s recommendations, we set up the Aviation Health Working Group, which has brought industry, trade unions and government agencies closer together, not just through meetings but by embedding day-to-day contact as part of the working culture. The AHWG has adopted an approach based on information gathering to underpin policy. This has found wide favour among stakeholders. As the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, noted, in December 2003, we established the Aviation Health Unit in the CAA to act as a focal point for aviation health issues. I mention these important structural changes to show the permanent place created in government for aviation health issues.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000048"></a>I also want to touch on some of the initiatives the UK is engaged on in this field, but, first, I am sure your Lordships will understand when I stress that government departments do not have infinite budgets for all the things that they or others would like to see done. Every use of resources has to be proportionate to the problem it seeks to address.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000049"></a>Let me illustrate that by mentioning briefly three important initiatives which the Government have taken. We funded major work on deep vein thrombosis, which was co-ordinated by the World Health Organisation. We have begun innovative research work to investigate concerns about potential contaminants in cabin air,  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC160"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC160</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which, again, is a world first. The Aviation Health Unit has made substantial progress on improving information for passengers and GPs on air travel and health, in accordance with the committee&#146;s recommendation.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/81124-gc0006.htm"/>


<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000050"></a>The UK was instrumental in setting up the large, international research project known as the WRIGHT project to investigate travel-related DVT. We contributed substantially. The Department for Transport and the Department of Health made &#8364;1.8million available. The rest was funded by the World Health Organisation and the European Commission. We were the only individual nation to back it, although the knowledge gleaned is of global application. The WRIGHT project was carried out by a consortium of medical research experts.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000051"></a>Publication of the final report by the World Health Organisation took place in June 2007, although the Department for Transport had already published summary results to provide earlier help to the travelling public.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000052"></a>The most important finding&#151;and one that is now widely recognised&#151;is that one&#146;s personal risk of DVT, which varies with medical history and age, is increased three or fourfold on any journey over four hours, not just air travel. So the risk appears to be predominantly the result of prolonged immobility rather than anything specific to air travel. Indeed, in terms of numbers, such blood clots are, of course, found among patients in hospitals. Nevertheless, the absolute risk was found to be low, about one case in every 6,000 flights.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000053"></a>As regards cabin air, the committee recommended in the 2007 update report that the research to identify the substances produced during a fume event should be completed urgently. I am pleased to report that this work is actively in hand and is progressing well. The Department for Transport has secured the interest of five airlines to participate in this groundbreaking research, and other countries are watching it closely. I express my warm thanks to those airlines that have made their aircraft and their pilot and management time available to the research effort. It is no exaggeration to say that without this help this work could not have progressed, as sadly was the case in the USA. However, I assure the Committee that the research is entirely independent of industry and is Government funded.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000054"></a>Cranfield University, the project manager, is actively engaged in the cabin air sampling programme, and about 40 of the planned 100 flights have now been tested by a scientist on board. Samples are being taken by named individuals who have received special briefing by Cranfield to ensure a consistent methodology and secure chain of custody for delivering the samples to the laboratories for analysis. It is likely that this phase of the research will last until the spring. The logistics are complex and it cannot be done sooner. The findings will then be peer reviewed before being published as a whole. I hope that this will prove possible as soon as practicable.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000055"></a>The House will understand that we are filling a gap in knowledge. Fume events are unpredictable and can last less than a minute. There are no published studies of air sampling during fume events. There has been alarmist talk from some quarters about cabin air. I want to assure everyone that it is not a proven fact that  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC161"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC161</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cabin air harms health. The Committee on Toxicity, an expert committee of toxicologists, said that it was not possible to prove or disprove a connection between pilot ill health and cabin air on the evidence available.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000056"></a>The only way we can resolve this matter is through top quality science of a standard which will, if necessary, influence aviation regulators around the world to take action. I am confident that Cranfield University will give us the best scientific picture of what is in a fume event. Any regulatory action on aircraft types would have to be taken by the European Aviation Safety Agency, and there is no prospect of this happening without robust and convincing scientific research, preferably done by one or more member states of the EU.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000057"></a>My third example is in the field of passenger information. Those who have specific medical conditions should, and do, take advice from their GPs or from specialists who can advise them on travelling. We can help by providing the public and doctors with information. That is why I am encouraged by the excellent progress the Aviation Health Unit has made on improving information about air travel and health. Only last month the CAA published an excellent booklet, <I>Travelling Safely</I>, which gives updated health information.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000058"></a>The Aviation Health Unit works closely with airlines and other key stakeholders to do this. Part of its website, targeted at a GP audience, has a section with professional medical information which can be downloaded. This website, with its &#147;Frequently Asked Questions&#148; and recent guidance to GPs on assessing fitness to fly has been very well received and is generating lots of hits and inquiries to the Aviation Health Unit. It is already proving to be a useful tool to help GPs disseminate appropriate information to those of their patients who may be intending to fly.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000059"></a>Since 2001, the internet has developed as the main way of getting advice to travellers, but older methods work well, too. Those without access to the internet can request information by telephone and relevant documents can be printed and posted. I hope this gives noble Lords an idea of the work that we are doing in this important field, and how seriously we take the duty conferred on us.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000060"></a>I turn briefly to one or two of the questions that were raised in the debate, addressing first those put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland. The European Aviation Safety Agency&#146;s competence with respect to air operations and flight-crew licensing took place in February 2008 in Regulation 216/2008. We are confident that the organisation is competent to take over those responsibilities. He also asked about the whole issue of air-passenger duty. As noble Lords know, this has been out for consultation. The consultation has now closed and the matter is now one for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Noble Lords may find out more, if I can put it that way.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000061"></a>Aspirin has been discussed with the working group as a measure to mitigate or ameliorate the incidence of DVT. Research shows that taking aspirin does not help as much as exercise, and of course there are risks attached to taking aspirin. On pilot fatigue, which takes me back because I helped to implement the first  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC162"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC162</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Bader recommendations, I should say first that the airline industry is a competitive environment and because of that, companies seek to maximise the utilisation of their crews. Nevertheless, I can state with confidence that safety in aviation is a top priority in the UK. We have one of the best records in the world and we intend to keep it. The law requires all operators of public transport flights to limit the hours that pilots work through adherence to the flight time limitations scheme approved by the CAA. The authority works closely with airlines, including the low-cost sector, and has already identified a number of initiatives such as monitoring the outcome of rostering and training measures to counter fatigue. The CAA will continue to keep this important area under review.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000062"></a>I was asked whether we spend enough on research. As I said earlier, we have spent &#8364;1.8 million on DVT. On cabin air quality, we have spent &#8364;200,000 so far and will probably spend a similar sum over the coming year. We have to recognise proportionality, because many demands are being made on a limited budget. For example, one of the Department for Transport&#146;s key targets to achieve by 2010 is to reduce the number of children killed or seriously injured in road accidents by 50 per cent compared with the period 1994-98. That is clearly another call on resources. The privilege and burden of being in government is always to balance priorities.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000063"></a>On the points made about passenger information, as I said, we have produced a new booklet. The established airlines&#151;a high proportion of flying is with such airlines&#151;particularly the long-haul operators, have good facilities for advising passengers. However, on top of that the website of the Health Protection Agency has some useful links, as does the CAA website. In the final analysis, the Aviation Health Unit is supporting GPs to become more competent in this area, and we think that that is happening at the appropriate rate.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000064"></a>Turning to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, about our preparedness for a pandemic, we believe that some of the new developments in aeroplanes, particularly the high-efficiency filters that are now fitted, have a considerable contribution to make to infection within an aircraft. We believe that the position we are at is about right. We think that wipes are a matter for the airlines, but the point is noted.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000065"></a>On preparedness for an outbreak, the head of the Aviation Health Unit attended a number of meetings of the Co-operative Arrangement for Preventing the Spread of Communicable Diseases through Air Travel, most recently in Bangkok in 2008. As a result of this approach, which is co-ordinated by ICAO, the international rulemaking body, a number of positive outcomes have been achieved including a new procedure for the commander of an aircraft to notify air traffic control that there may be passengers with pandemic flu on the aircraft in order that a message can be transmitted more rapidly to the landing airport, allowing more time for preparation for the aircraft&#146;s arrival, and the breaking down of silos in order that countries&#146; national plans link to the aviation plan. This has happened in the UK, and the latest document was presented to the most recent meeting of the Aviation  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Health Working Group in October 2008 by the Department of Health. Having been involved in emergency planning and knowing the thoroughness with which it is conducted in this country, I believe that we have proper processes in place.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000066"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Broers, touched on a number of issues about fume events. I hope that what I have said goes some way to meeting some of his concerns. On the matter of space, within the limitations likely on a practical aircraft we do not feel that space is a health problem. As to space and comfort, airlines are in the comfort business and it is a matter for them, their passengers, their fares and the marketplace. It would not be appropriate for us to intervene. We have no evidence that space within the practical constraints of today&#146;s aviation is a health issue. We are concerned that evacuation requirements can be met, but we believe that, with the present practical applications, they are adequately met.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, perceptively pointed out that politics has crept into aviation health. I share that view. When politics&#151;with a little &#147;p&#148;&#151;creeps into anything, one sometimes regrets it, but I sometimes argue that when more than two people meet there is politics. We said it would be good if the Aviation Health Working Group were chaired by the head of the Aviation Health Unit, but the airlines and BALPA asked the Government to retain the chair because it is industry-funded and they felt that the Government are perceived by some as more neutral. Noble Lords will be disappointed by that, but success in this area is by consent, and we must respect that.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000068"></a>We think that the unit has a higher profile than people believe. The website is increasingly seen as a point for aviation health medicine. Hits on the website doubled between last year and this. The unit has relaunched its <I>Travelling Safely</I> booklet, which has raised awareness considerably. More than 80,000 copies have been distributed and another 95,000 are available. The unit is looking at ways to do some market research to gauge how well it is known as an organisation so that it can improve its marketing.</p>

<p><a name="08112411000069"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, is clearly not happy with what the Government are doing so far, particularly on fume events. We think that we are doing the right thing. We are the only country in the world doing anything about it, and we believe that we are taking an evidentially based route. We thank the committee for its support in this general direction. The Mackenzie Ross study that reported to the Committee on Toxicity was a small one without a control group and the subjects came forward as patients. The committee arranged for an independent review of it by Professor Robin G Morris, Professor of Neuropsychology at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College Hospital, London. Professor Morris's report said that the association between flying and neuropsychological abnormality should be interpreted with great caution because of the small sample used.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000070"></a>The logical first step in the research is to examine the potential exposure, as recommended by the Committee on Toxicity, which is underway. The committee said that epidemiological research would be best done on an international basis. The scale of pilots and control

We are also aware that it would be difficult to recruit pilots who in the UK would be legally obliged to report any health impairment to the CAA, which licences them.</p>

<p><a name="08112411000071"></a><a name="81124-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08112411000114"></a>Lord Tyler:</b> Is the Minister therefore saying that the Government now reject a recommendation from our committee that there should be an epidemiological survey of pilots?</p>

<p><a name="08112411000072"></a><a name="81124-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="81124-gc0006.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08112411000115"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> The Government will not react to that until we have the results of the Cranfield study. We are not so much rejecting the recommendation as not answering it on the basis that we believe firmly that until we have the Cranfield work we cannot take a view on a sensible way forward.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000073"></a>I will briefly touch on the other points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler. He talked about the problem of chemical reactions and the disinfection of long-haul flights to certain destinations, but fume events also occur on short-haul flights. The Committee on Toxicity intends to consider chemical mixtures when it has the results of the Cranfield work.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000074"></a>The claim that we face near disaster is unreasonable, as is the claim, which I totally refute, that we are not discharging our duty on this. If you look at the thoroughness with which the Aviation Health Unit and the CAA do their work, they are clearly discharging their responsibilities. That is confirmed by the prominence given to aviation health as a response to the committee ever since 2000, and the amount of research initiated in the UK alone.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000075"></a>I have covered points made by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, in the rest of my remarks. On the 30-minute rule, in many ways he answered the other points for me. It is important that we encourage airlines to be sensitive about this, and from personal knowledge it is a difficult issue. It is about operational guidance. We do not believe that we should make another rule, which would have to be strictly enforced and could produce some extremely undesirable consequences.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000076"></a>Finally, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland, once again for initiating this debate. I liked all the nice positive things that he said about us at the beginning. They were somewhat drummed out of my mind by the details that I had to pick up thereafter. Once again I thank him.</p>

I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, and the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, both of whom showed an informed and engaged interest in the issues, which we find encouraging, because occasionally we think that we are sailing in a small boat and no one can pick up our trajectory. Clearly, they have, and that is appreciated.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>

Heart should be taken from that, and I thank the Minister for his cautious, careful and almost canny response to the various issues. If I found myself striding on to an aeroplane and the noble Lord had reverted to a previous existence and was in the pilot&#146;s seat, I might find that very reassuring.</p>

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000079"></a>The issues that we have taken up have been well summarised, and I shall not go through them again. The committee now has a practice of returning to issues, and we will certainly return to the spread of pandemic flu and infection, which is already on our agenda in a broader sense. Clearly, the points made

<a name="81124-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08112411000080"></a>I have one final solution; to set up the equivalent of &#147;Oftravel&#148;, which would do spot checks on aeroplanes. I have my inspectors&#146; team from hell that would move in; it would be the noble Lord, Lord Broers, with his altimeter, the noble Lord, Lord Patel, with his infection control manual and the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, as the PR man who issued the press releases afterwards. There is an issue of proportion to do with that degree of inspection, but if we do not get this right there could be disasters round the corner.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08112428000007"></a>Equality 2025, the United Kingdom Advisory Network on Disability Equality, was established in December 2006, following a recommendation in the Prime Minister&#146;s strategy unit report, <I>Improving the life chances of disabled people</I>, which suggested that the Government should set up a new mechanism to involve disabled people in the heart of policy making. It is working with government to help it achieve the aim of equality for disabled people by 2025.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08112428000008"></a>Equality 2025 was set up with no formal chair, as the group was keen to offer this opportunity to all members on rotation. However, in December 2007, members agreed that they would like a formal chair. An acting chair has been in place since then, while the recruitment exercise has taken place.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08112428000009"></a>The recruitment exercise was carried out in accordance with the standards set by the Office for the Commissioner of Public Appointments. The quality of applicants for the post was exceptionally high. I am pleased to announce that the successful candidate and new chair of Equality 2025 from 1 December 2008 is Rowen Jade.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08112428000010"></a>Rowen Jade has been a member of Equality 2025 since it was established and has been acting chair since December 2007. I am confident that she will lead the group forward during an interesting and challenging time.</p>

<a name="08112428000011"></a><a name="81124-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="81124-wms0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08112428000030"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State (Michael Wills) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="08112428000012"></a>I am today publishing the Government&#146;s response to the data sharing review and the response to the Ministry of Justice&#146;s consultation on the Information Commissioner&#146;s inspection powers and funding under the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="08112428000013"></a>The protection of personal data will always be a high priority, and we know that good regulation is essential to support a robust data protection framework. We believe that, although the current regulatory framework does not require sweeping changes, more can and must be done to ensure that the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office (ICO) has the powers and resources necessary to carry out its duties under the Data Protection Act. The tools available to the ICO must be flexible enough to meet a range of circumstances and encourage good practice, allowing it to take firm and assertive action when necessary.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS108"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column WS108</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="08112428000014"></a>The use of information underpins government&#146;s ability to deliver benefits for the citizen through targeted and improved public services, opportunities for the most disadvantaged, protection from crime and terrorism and economic well-being. However, we can only do this successfully when we are able to increase public confidence in the sharing and handling of personal data by both the public and private sectors. The proposals as outlined in the two documents being published today will contribute to that process.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="08112428000015"></a>We will increase the powers, penalties and funding available to the ICO by specifically proposing to:</p>
develop the ICO&#146;s inspection powers in respect of public authorities so as to enable the ICO to inspect without necessarily requiring prior consent;allow the ICO to impose a deadline and location for the provision of information necessary to assess compliance;allow the ICO to require any person on the premises, where a warrant is being executed, to provide any information required to determine whether the data controller has complied with, or is complying with, the data protection principles;mandate the ICO to publish guidance on when organisations should notify the ICO of breaches of the data protection principles; andalter the ICO funding structure from a flat-rate notification fee to a tiered fee structure based on size of organisation, providing additional funds for the ICO in a more equitable funding structure.
<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="08112428000016"></a>In addition, to reinforce the framework within which we can safely share data and deliver benefits for the public, we propose to:</p>
place a statutory duty on the ICO to publish a data sharing code of practice in order to provide practical guidance on how to share personal data in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act and to promote good practice in the sharing of personal data; andconfer a power upon the Secretary of State to permit or require the sharing of personal information between particular specified persons, where a robust case for doing so exists.
<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="08112428000017"></a>To further strengthen the powers available to the ICO, we are working on bringing fully into force Section 55A of the Data Protection Act, introduced in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 but not yet commenced. This will allow the ICO to impose monetary penalties on data controllers in the case of serious contraventions of the Data Protection Act.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="08112428000018"></a>The additional powers for the ICO will ensure that the regulatory framework is robust and proportionate and encourage good practice. These measures will increase public confidence in the handling and sharing of data by the public and private sectors.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08112428000019"></a>Copies of both the Government&#146;s response to the data sharing review and the response to the Ministry of Justice&#146;s consultation on the Information Commissioner&#146;s inspection powers and funding under the Data Protection Act 1998 will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Copies will also be available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="08112428000020"></a><a name="81124-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><b><a name="81124-wms0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="08112428000031"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord West of Spithead):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department (Jacqui Smith) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08112428000021"></a>Each day, police officers put themselves in danger to protect the public, so I am committed to providing the police with the tools they tell me they need to fight crime and keep the public and themselves safe. I am also proud that we have one of the few police services around the world that do not regularly carry firearms, and I want to keep it that way. Therefore, I am today giving my agreement to allow chief officers of all forces in England and Wales, from 1 December 2008, to extend Taser use to specially trained units in accordance with Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) policy and guidance. The guidance sets out that Taser can only be used where officers would be facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves and/or the subject(s).</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08112428000022"></a>I am also making funding available to forces to support the purchase of up to 10,000 Tasers. This will allow chief officers to take a decision on Taser deployment according to operational need, without being encumbered by financial restrictions.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08112428000023"></a>Tasers are making a real difference on our streets, not only keeping the public safe but protecting our police officers. Taser has been available to all authorised firearms officers since September 2004 as a less lethal alternative for use in situations where a firearms authority has been granted in accordance with criteria laid down in the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) manual of guidance on police use of firearms.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08112428000024"></a>Since 20 July 2007, authorised firearms officers in England and Wales have also been able to use Taser in  


<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS110"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column WS110</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a wider set of circumstances. These officers are now able to deploy Taser in operations or incidents where the use of firearms is not authorised but they are facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force to protect the public, themselves or the subject.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08112428000025"></a>In July 2007, I also gave my approval for a 12-month trial of the deployment of Taser by specially trained units who are not firearms officers in circumstances where officers were facing violence or threats of violence of such severity that they would need to use force  to protect the public, themselves or the subject. The  trial commenced on 1 September 2007 in 10 forces: Avon and Somerset, Devon and Cornwall, Gwent, Lincolnshire, Merseyside, Metropolitan Police Service, Northamptonshire, Northumbria, North Wales and West Yorkshire.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08112428000026"></a>Independent medical advice was sought from the Defence Scientific Advisory Council (DSAC) Sub-Committee on the Medical Implications of Less Lethal Weapons (DOMILL) on the use of Taser in these extended circumstances. DOMILL has now provided a fifth statement on the medical implications of the use of Taser. The DOMILL statement assesses the risk of death or serious injury from use of the M26 and X26 Tasers within ACPO guidance and policy as very low.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08112428000027"></a>Having considered the latest DOMILL statement and reports on the trial from ACPO and the Home Office scientific development branch, which provide final figures on Taser use in the trial, I have given my agreement for further roll-out. All Taser deployments will also continue to be monitored for assessment by DOMILL. We will continue to publish Taser usage figures on a regular basis.</p>

<a name="81124-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08112428000028"></a>I have placed a copy of the latest DOMILL statement and the Home Office scientific development branch trial evaluation in the Library of the House.</p>

phase 1 systematically identified, appraised and synthesised international evidence on the relationship between alcohol price, promotion, consumption and harm. Summary of the first phase, published on 22 July, found significant links between price and youth and heavy drinkers, but it has less of an impact on moderate and occasional drinkers; andphase 2 explored the potential impact of potential policy changes in this area, especially the population-based impact on health, crime and the wider economy for the population as a whole and also with a focus on young people under 18 who drink alcohol; 18 to 24 year-old hazardous drinkers; and harmful drinkers whose patterns of drinking damage their physical/mental health or cause substantial harm to others.

The Department for International Development has also supported key justice sector reforms providing both legislative and technical assistance. In the longer term, we have initiated the design of a five-year security sector accountability and police programme (&#163;80 million), which will be taken forward in partnership with Congolese stakeholders and international partners. We are working closely with Congolese stakeholders to take this programme forward and have agreed to put in place a high-level steering committee (including senior senate, national assembly and government representatives) to oversee implementation and act as a forum for high-level dialogue on key issues.</p>

The Act also enables the Lord Chancellor to make an order specifying a relevant third party (RTP) to make applications on behalf of a victim of forced marriage without the requirement to obtain the court's permission. It does not specify who should act as a relevant third party, when they should act or what safeguards might be needed for a victim of forced marriage.</p>

<a name="81124w0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_68"></a><a name="08112423000185"></a>Relevant third parties take on a significant responsibility for making an application on behalf of a victim of forced marriage in the absence of judicial scrutiny, so it is important that only appropriate and competent persons or organisations act. The Government therefore consulted to establish what need there was for relevant third parties, what type of people or organisations should act and what safeguards were needed. The response to this consultation was published on 13 November 2008.</p>

<a name="81124w0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_69"></a><a name="08112423000186"></a>The response to consultation showed that generally respondents favoured local authorities as a relevant third party for both adults and children. There was also some support for voluntary sector organisations to act as relevant third party for adults, although no voluntary organisation nominated itself. Respondents recognised that the absence of a leave process could place a victim at significant risk of harm. Therefore, it was seen as important that safeguards were in place to ensure that the victim was protected from possible misuse and that the applicant always acted in the victim's best interests.</p>

<a name="81124w0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_70"></a><a name="08112423000187"></a>The response outlined the Government's decision to specify local authorities as relevant third parties. This will complement the existing role that local authorities have to protect children and vulnerable adults and will ensure that all victims, no matter where they live, have access to a local relevant third party.</p>

<a name="81124w0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_71"></a><a name="08112423000188"></a>The response also outlined the Government's view that local authorities should actively seek advice from and work with voluntary organisations where possible and that a multi-agency approach could be used to support the victim. This will help to ensure an integrated and holistic approach to providing support for victims and recognises the different and complementary types of support that the public sector and voluntary sector provide. As outlined in the response, the work to prepare local authorities to become a relevant third party will look at defining the role of the relevant third party, when it should act, establishing what knowledge it requires to make an informed judgment and look at existing systems of accountability to ensure that applications are made in the best interests of the victim.</p>




<notus-date day="24" month="11" year="2008" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WA240"></a><b>24 Nov 2008 : Column WA240</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="81124w0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_72"></a><a name="08112423000189"></a>The Government recognise the role that the voluntary sector plays in supporting victims of forced marriage. The success of the independent domestic violence advisers (IDVAs) has shown how the voluntary sector can play a key role in a multi-agency-based response to domestic violence with the victim at the heart of the process. Most IDVAs currently operate in the criminal magistrates' court, where there are specialist domestic violence courts (SDVCs), and many already have expertise in dealing with issues like forced marriage and are experienced multi-agency workers. Their work is carried out in accordance with recognised national standards and an accredited training programme. Services are subject to a monitoring and evaluation process, along with other agencies in the SDVC partnership, but specifically those receiving funding from this department towards the IDVA service are required to submit annual data about their workload. The response therefore outlined that there will be a pilot using a local existing IDVA service as an RTP.</p>

<a name="81124w0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_73"></a><a name="08112423000190"></a>Broadly, we anticipate that concurrent schemes will run to assess the effectiveness of local authorities and IDVA services to act as a relevant third party. Appropriate safeguards will be built in to the process for each agency. We estimate it will require nine to 12 months, working together across government and with local government and the voluntary sector, to ensure everyone involved has the necessary guidance and information to act appropriately and effectively as a relevant third party. In the mean time, we will monitor the use of the Act in court and use any emerging information to shape and develop the RTP pilot.</p>

<a name="81124w0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_74"></a><a name="08112423000191"></a>We intend to carry out a formal evaluation after a year of the provisions of the relevant third party coming into force. If this proves successful, we would look at extending the RTP provisions more widely across IDVAs as well as other voluntary sector organisations. There has been no decision taken as yet on which IDVA service will take part in the pilot scheme.</p>

<a name="81124w0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_75"></a><a name="08112423000192"></a>It is important to emphasise that, pending the development and operation of the pilot, it will be possible for anyone, including local authorities and IDVAs, to apply for a protection order on behalf of a victim if they obtain the court&#146;s permission. This will ensure that victims of forced marriage can obtain the protection of the court where they cannot apply for a forced marriage protection order themselves. The court&#146;s scrutiny of an application for permission to apply for an order will ensure that the victim's best interests are safeguarded.</p>

Consultation co-ordinators in departments work with policy officials to help them run consultations that are in line with the code.

In accordance with the code (criterion 6.6), consultation documents cite the criteria of the code and give the contact details of the departmental consultation coordinator so that he or she can be contacted by anyone who feels that the exercise is not in line with the code. Moreover, departments are required, in the better regulation chapter of their annual reports, to describe their consultation activity over the year and the compliance of their consultation activities with the code.</p>

The EU would stick to the tough mandate that has been agreed for the negotiations.

Retired members of the Supreme Court who are Members of the House will be able to resume sitting and voting in the House.</p>

However, the Government keep all taxes under review and as part of this process broader estimates have been made of the wider application of reduced rates in the housing sector. Such estimates take into account a number of factors including: total relevant expenditure sourced from BERR's construction statistics annual; the estimated amount of spending already reduced rated; the price elasticity of demand; the expected rate of pass-on of the VAT rate cut; and the current size of the informal economy and its
