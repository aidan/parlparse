<a name="40323-01_head0"></a><H3><center>Incomes Gap: Social Consequences</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether there are any negative consequences for social cohesion in the growing gap between the highest and lowest pay levels in the United Kingdom.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  My Lords, the Government's objective is to build a strong economy and a fair society, with opportunity and security for all, by tackling poverty and social exclusion. The Government's policies are aimed at raising the incomes of the poorest families with children and pensioners relative to the average of the population, not at trying to drag down the position of the highest earners. With the new tax credits, the national minimum wage and the pension credit, we have taken major steps to achieve this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, top FTSE chief executives are now for the first time being paid an average of £1 million per year, which is 100 times the minimum wage compared to 20 times only a few years ago. Is it not "the unacceptable face of capitalism"&#151;to quote Sir Edward Heath&#151;for the same people to urge ordinary workers not to put in for double-figure pay rises, while at the same time awarding themselves increases that are six times the average in percentage terms and 600 times more in absolute terms than those at the bottom?
<P>

<a name="40323-01_para0"></a>Secondly, in view of the restrictive practices and total abdication of social responsibility by remuneration committees of boards, will my noble friend provide for a representation of employees as well as shareholders on them, and refer their activity to the Restrictive Practices Court or its equivalent?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I happen to share my noble friend's distaste for conspicuous consumption at the top, but that does not take away from the fact that it is far more effective when dealing with social cohesion&#151;to go back to the original Question&#151;to deal with poverty rather than to concentrate on the activities of the highest paid. Even taking that into account, we have to remember that the top 10 per cent of income taxpayers pay 52 per cent of the income tax received.
<P>


<a name="column_586"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 586</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-01_para1"></a>I think that the noble Lord's second question about management boards is somewhat wide of the Question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </B>   My Lords, my question is about children. Top people quite rightly attract a lot of attention. The Government are to be congratulated on wanting to bring child poverty down by 25 per cent in the next two years. Does the Minister agree that 12 per cent of all children living in abject poverty and in lone-parent homes is a worryingly high figure? What does he propose to do about it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I entirely agree with that. I agree that it is a worrying figure. We have to remember that relative child poverty doubled in the years before 1997. We have not yet achieved the reduction of a quarter, but we have taken 500,000 children out of poverty. I take a great deal of pride collectively on behalf of the Government for that. We have done that at a time of very high growth in median incomes against which poverty is compared.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dholakia: </B>   My Lords, is there adequate monitoring of pay levels affecting women and ethnic minorities? Will the Minister confirm that they feature on pay scales at a very low level? If so, what effect does that have on social cohesion?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, there is very full monitoring, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, knows. I have a document in front of me called The Effects of Taxes and Benefits on Household Income 2001 which, at nearly 100 pages, is a little long for me to read. We do monitor the differentials for women and ethnic minorities and we do acknowledge that there are significant differentials at the lower end of pay scales.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord feel that perhaps one aspect of the problem raised by the noble Lord, Lord Lea, was dealt with rather well by the American industrialist J Peter Grace, who, when asked for an enormous salary by one of his executives, replied: "I do not have a problem paying you that sort of money; you just have a problem earning it".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I do not reply to other people's jokes&#151;particularly good ones.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sheldon: </B>   My Lords, is not one of the major problems the remuneration committees themselves? People who are members of those committees have a vested interest because of their other activities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, that may well be the case in some circumstances. My response to the original Question was about our attack on poverty. I stick to that thrust.
<P>


<a name="column_587"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 587</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that one way of dealing with excessive levels of income at the top end and child poverty at the bottom would be to have a somewhat more redistributive income tax policy? For example, the introduction of a rate of 50 per cent on incomes over £100,000 per year&#151;a rate incidentally significantly less than the top rate which obtained during the majority of the previous Conservative administration&#151;might kill two birds with one stone?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am interested that the noble Lord, Lord Newby, should say that on 23 March 2004. If one looks back at the record of what Liberal Democrats have been saying over the past few years since they adopted this policy, one will find that there are periods of strange silence. I am glad to know that the issue is back on the agenda again. It helps us all to know where we stand.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that perhaps the solution is to have employees on the boards so that they can watch these activities?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have already been asked that question. My answer has been about poverty rather than about a small number of people with very high pay. My objection to such people is more aesthetic than economic.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, the Government's own figures show that income inequality is higher now than at any point under the previous two Conservative Prime Ministers. Why has this inequality risen since the party opposite came to power?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, it has not. The fact is that differences between the top and lower 10 per cent, which had been increasing, have now stabilised&#151;they have stabilised since 2001. In the financial year 2002&#150;03, the income of the bottom 10 per cent rose by 3.3 per cent; and of the top 10 per cent by 2.3 per cent. Of course, we can always play different games with quintiles, deciles and so on to produce the figures that suit us, but those figures are significant.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that one of the main reasons for the growing gap in pay is the difference in skills? Does he agree that industry today demands much higher skills and is prepared to pay a lot more for them, and that the reason for the gap is that those people who have the skills get the pay and those who do not, do not?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I cannot disagree with that in general, but there are an awful lot of exceptions of people without skills receiving excessive pay packages.

<P>

<a name="40323-01_time0"></a><H5>2.43 p.m.</H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>When the head of their efficiency review, Sir Peter Gershon, will report to Parliament.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, Sir Peter Gershon is working closely with departments to help them develop efficiency proposals for consideration in the 2004 spending review. Departments' agreed efficiency programmes will be published in parallel with the final spending review settlement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend will know that the public sector can often provide services more efficiently and more cheaply than the private sector. With that in mind, would he ask Sir Peter Gershon whether he recommends the establishment of a national online teacher recruitment agency, which could be run for as little as £2 million or £3 million a year, to replace the existing, fragmented teacher recruitment arrangements, which currently cost between £60 million and £80 million pounds per year? Is not a substantial saving to the taxpayer available?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend asked that question of my noble friend Lady Ashton in May last year. She replied that the Government do not recruit or employ teachers directly but expressed interest in any measure that increases efficiency in the system. However, surely one of the most effective ways of reducing the cost of recruiting teachers is to reduce the vacancy rate. The vacancy rate for teachers, and therefore in parallel the turnover rate, has been decreasing, but I am not resistant to my noble friend's suggestion, which I am sure that the Department for Education and Skills will consider seriously.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the Government cynically leaked an early draft of the Gershon report to a single journalist to spike the guns of the Conservative Party, which was launching a report on public expenditure on the same day? Does he accept that that complete disregard for the parliamentary process helps to reduce trust in government, and will he urge his colleagues in the Treasury to place in the Library of the House the draft of the Gershon report that was leaked to the Financial Times, was briefed by officials to a single Financial Times journalist and was covered over several pages in the Financial Times? The rest of us have not had the benefit of seeing the text of that draft.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I have no knowledge of what the noble Lord, Lord Newby, calls a cynical leak. That is an assertion that he makes. He is entitled to his own interpretation, but it is certainly the case that the report in the Financial Times was broadly accurate.
<P>


<a name="column_589"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 589</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that most of the major themes of the Gershon efficiency report, when it appears, are already in the Red Book and available for everyone to see? In the light of that, does he agree that one of those major themes will be a cross-cutting approach to effect efficiencies? What mechanisms exist in the Palace of Westminster for a cross-cutting approach to be taken to examine our separate establishments for the House of Lords and the House of Commons, to see whether we may seek efficiencies here also?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, on my noble friend's first point, yes, Chapter 6 of the Red Book indeed contains a very full exposition of the Government's position on efficiency and how to achieve it in departments. Perhaps I should have given that answer to the noble Lord, Lord Newby, when he talked as if we are somehow being deprived of information that ought to be in the public domain. However, among the more difficult public sector activities for the Government to control are the House of Commons Commission and the expenditure of the House of Lords.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, let us return to the Government. In his Budget last week, the Chancellor said that he intends to make 5 per cent real-terms savings in a number of departments by 2008. How does that square with the Financial Secretary to the Treasury's view on "Newsnight" the other day, who said of the Gershon review:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"These are very long-term, speculative gains"?

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40323-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I think that we can state the position very precisely. What Gershon is saying is that there is a target of 2.5 per cent savings per annum&#151;in other words, a freeze in money terms&#151;over the spending review period, which is 2005&#150;08. If achieved, that will result in a saving of £20 billion. That target is consistent with both the statements cited by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, in February 2000, the Government set out their comprehensive strategy for addressing the trafficking of men, women and children in the White Paper Secure Borders, Safe Haven. The strategy recognises the need for a multi-faceted response to the abhorrent trade in human beings. The provisions in the Asylum and Immigration <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>(Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill support a continued commitment to the fight against those who would seek to exploit the vulnerable.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his Answer. Have the Government noted that no fewer than 32 London boroughs acknowledge having a problem with trafficked children? Will the many facets quoted by the noble Lord include reimbursement of local authorities for all their protection costs? As to adults, will the criteria for the existing Poppy Project be widened, so that women do not have to suffer sexual abuse before they can receive the help that they need?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am interested in the noble Lord's request for funding on behalf of 32 London boroughs. It must be remembered that London boroughs already receive support through the grant formula, and that the grant formula is finely tuned to take account of pressures on spending, particularly in social services. We keep the formula under careful review, and we listen carefully to what local authorities say on those matters. The criteria for the Poppy Project and Eaves Housing are right. The pilot project has proved to be of immense value. It has been extended until April 2005, and we will need to take careful account of the use that is made of that project in looking at the criteria in the future, particularly if the project is to continue beyond 2005.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, although I welcome the support that the Home Office has given to the Poppy Project, is it not limited to women victims of trafficking for prostitution? What help, other than the Poppy Project, is the Home Office giving to victims of trafficking for other purposes, particularly to children? Does the Answer that the noble Lord gave to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, mean that there is no special help for any local authority that must cope with a large number of trafficked children? Is the noble Lord aware that it is not only a problem in London, but in other parts of the country also? It is particularly a problem in areas adjacent to airports, where unaccompanied children are finding themselves dumped on to social services departments. Will the Government at least ask local authorities to make returns so that we know the size of this problem and the number of trafficked children that are entering the country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, this is a sensitive issue. We listen carefully to what local authorities say. We have been working with the Department of Health to ensure that we have a code of practice that provides guidance in this area. If there are particular spending pressures, no doubt the Local Government Association and those local authorities with particular problems&#151;I understand that those with airports adjacent have particular problems&#151;will make representations. As I described, the Government's approach is multi-faceted. It concentrates on prevention and enforcement, but it <P>


<a name="column_591"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 591</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>also ensures that resources are available to help those voluntary organisations that provide facilities to assist where there is evidence of trafficked children.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Sharples: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister give us an estimate of the numbers involved in this trafficking?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, by the very clandestine nature of the operation, it is hard to give meaningful estimates. Our estimates suggest that anything between 140 and 1,400 persons are trafficked each year, but that is only a very rough estimate. It is hard to seek returns on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St Johns: </B>   My Lords, the Minister referred to the multi-faceted approach of the Government to this serious problem. Within that approach, does he agree that the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill, which is currently before this House, should give protection to people who are so cruelly trafficked? If so, will he give a commitment to support an amendment that I have tabled to the Bill that will come up on Thursday, which achieves that objective? As the noble Lord knows, I am always ready to help the Government.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I am always enormously grateful when the noble Baroness offers her help and assistance. We always have an open mind on these matters, but without the precise wording of the amendment in front of me&#151;I understand the political point that the noble Baroness is making&#151;I obviously cannot give such a commitment. We have a robust strategy in place that is based on co-operation and working with agencies across the world, particularly in Europe. It is based on ensuring that local authorities are effective in the work that they carry out. It is also based on a case-by-case understanding of the problem as it presents itself.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew15"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   My Lords, in line with the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, is the noble Lord aware that Clause 4 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill was well received for its mention of offences? Can he explain why it does not also underline the need for protection, as the noble Baroness mentioned with regard to the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, we have gone some way on the issue of protection. The noble Lord will know better than I that the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 dealt with that issue. We have put in place further measures to penalise traffickers since then&#151;the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and Clause 4 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill&#151;so that sexual exploitation and labour exploitation issues are covered and we hit hard those people who deal in the abhorrent trade of human trafficking.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, we have discussed on several occasions in your Lordships' House the West Sussex case and the allegations of disappearance. An operation was undertaken to investigate that. Sadly, the investigation did not result in arrests or prosecutions, but there have been other instances, particularly in the UK, where useful co-operation has taken place. A number of high profile prosecutions have taken place; some 37 since 2002 when the first phalanx of new offences was introduced. As to our general level of satisfaction with local authority performance, we are satisfied that they are working hard, but there is, as ever, plenty of scope for improvement. That is why we are working hard with them to ensure that we can identify the problem when it first presents itself.

<P>

<A NAME="40323-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, it boils down to ensuring that you have all angles covered&#151;or as many angles as you can&#151;whether it is dealing with immigration across Europe, relations between agencies in the UK, or ensuring that the police are working with social services. It is a strategy that works at many levels.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, the dreadful events in Madrid on the morning of 11 March underline the importance of maintaining the international fight against terrorism as a top priority in the United Kingdom's foreign policy. The threat from indiscriminate, mass casualty terrorism has been with us for several years. This Government have been clear and consistent in their commitment to tackling this threat.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords, I accept the general drift of the Answer given by the noble Baroness. I raise two points. The first is that the change of government in Madrid is likely to lead to a European constitution that is less acceptable to this country than had <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>previously been hoped for. That makes it even more important that there should be a referendum in due course, which is what most people want according to the opinion polls. The second point relates to the dreadful assassination of Sheikh Yassin yesterday in the Gaza Strip. Surely that will be followed by extra terrorism, not necessarily confined to Israel, but possibly anywhere. Surely, that makes it essential that the powers that make up the quartet should now return to the charge to get some momentum into the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, and not leave it until after the American elections in November.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, we must see how the new government in Spain decide to deal with their various responsibilities, both with regard to the European questions that the noble Lord raised and to questions that are perhaps more closely related to Iraq and to terrorism. There will be many questions to be settled and discussed with the new government.
<P>

<a name="40323-03_para0"></a>With regard to the assassination of Sheikh Yassin, which took place yesterday, your Lordships will know that my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has made the British Government's position clear. I remind the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, that the last time that he asked a similar question, I was able to reassure him about the level of the Government's engagement in issues relating to the Middle East and the Israel/Palestine conflict. I assure him that the level of engagement remains very high. We will do everything that we can to pursue through every possible means a peaceful settlement, as we have done in the past few weeks. I do not think that the events of yesterday will have helped.

<P>

<A NAME="40323-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord framed his Question very widely&#151;rather cleverly, perhaps. He asked what the implications were for foreign policy, and then he asked a question about European foreign policy and a question about foreign policy in the Middle East. So, perhaps, he was not that wide of the mark. Even if they were not quite what I expected, they were, I think, legitimate questions none the less.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that we should congratulate the Spanish police on what appears to have been an effective operation to apprehend a range of people who may have been connected with the outrage in Spain? Returning to the main theme of the Question, may I ask whether one of the lessons that we should draw from the dreadful Spanish explosions is that it is unwise to make assumptions about the source of a terrorist outrage until all the facts are known? The Minister will recognise that the then Prime Minister&#151;rather unwisely, perhaps&#151;appeared to attribute the terrorism to ETA. It later emerged that that was very unlikely, although we do not know for certain.
<P>

<a name="40323-03_para2"></a>Does the Minister agree that there is a parallel with the remarks made by Richard Clarke, the senior counter-terrorism expert advising the United States Administration? In a statement to CBS on "60 Minutes", he said that he was specifically asked to try to find reasons to connect Iraq with Al'Qaeda. Would it not be better to conclude that we should concentrate on the fight, as the Minister implied, against Al'Qaeda and not be distracted by a political aspiration to make other people the centre of our charges?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, throughout the discussions in your Lordships' House on foreign policy issues, I have tried hard to deal with facts, not speculation. I am often asked to speculate, and I do my best to resist the temptation, no matter how attractive it may seem.
<P>

<a name="40323-03_para3"></a>Of course I congratulate the police in Spain on the arrests that have been made, but I caution the noble Baroness&#151;she was careful about what she said&#151;that we should not assume guilt before people have gone through a legal process. It is none the less reassuring to know that the police have been active.
<P>

<a name="40323-03_para4"></a>Was there too quick a condemnation of ETA? We must wait for the Spanish authorities to reach some conclusions about who was responsible. The Spanish authorities said that they had good reason, given recent intelligence warnings that they had received. I have no means of knowing the depth of those warnings.
<P>

<a name="40323-03_para5"></a>The noble Baroness referred to Richard Clarke. I say to her that we should also hear the other side of the question. We should hear what is said by Mr Rumsfeld and by Mr Powell, when they too give evidence. The noble Baroness urges us to wait to see all sides of the question; I urge her to wait to see that side of the question too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-03_spnew10"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Portsmouth: </B>   My Lords, I shall return to the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. Does the Minister agree that the <P>


<a name="column_595"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 595</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>new Spanish Government's policy on the Iraq war is a more accurate mirror of traditional Spanish foreign policy than that of the previous government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I do not know that I am in a position to make such a judgment about Spanish foreign policy over the years. I would be reluctant to do so without considerably more information.
<P>

<a name="40323-03_para6"></a>The incoming Prime Minister of Spain has made it clear that no formal decisions will be taken about the way in which Spain deals with the Iraq issue until he has come into office and had the opportunity to consult more widely. To all those who said that it was a fait accompli that Spanish troops would be withdrawn, I say that we should wait a moment and see what the new government decide to do when they are in office and have had the opportunity to take proper briefings. I also understand that the incoming government will be interested to see what the attitude is likely to be with regard to the United Nations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, the Prime Minister goes to Spain tonight to meet Mr Zapatero&#151;the new Spanish leader, although he is yet to form a government. If I may say so, he is a leader who is a little loose with his rhetoric. Will the noble Baroness encourage the Prime Minister to say to Mr Zapatero that he should recognise that if, as he says, Spain wants to continue fighting the war against terrorism, it will have to take not merely a local or even a European view of the battle but a global view? That means staying fully committed, with the global community, to dealing with crisis areas such as the Middle East. Will the Minister make sure that the message is taken to Spain that it should not stick to its traditional isolationism but should act as the responsible Spain that we admire and which is a major player in the world of security and peace that we now need?

<A NAME="40323-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I venture to suggest that I need not give the Prime Minister of this country any such advice. I am sure that he is well equipped to give that advice to Mr Zapatero.
<P>

<a name="40323-04_para0"></a>The noble Lord accused Mr Zapatero of being a little loose with his rhetoric&#151;I think that those were his words&#151;in opposition. Sometimes, opposition parties are a little loose in their rhetoric. In government, there are real responsibilities, and Mr Zapatero has made it clear that he will consider those responsibilities carefully before he takes a decision.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Laming </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will review the financial support given to hospices.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  My Lords, as I informed my noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke on 9 March, the Government have met their pledge to increase NHS investment in specialist palliative care, including hospices, by £50 million a year by 2004. The additional funding has been allocated by the joint NHS/voluntary sector National Partnership Group for Specialist Palliative Care, which will undertake a monitoring exercise to see how the funding has been used, including the level of support for hospices.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Laming: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply. Does he agree that the work of hospices deserves the support of us all, because of the pioneering work that they have done on the management of pain for young and old and on encouraging dignity in death, both in hospitals and in the home?
<P>

<a name="40323-04_para1"></a>Does the Minister share with me and, I suspect, others the concern about the time that the good people who work in hospices must devote to fund raising? There is constant anxiety about the continuation of this valuable service. Will the Government consider a national formula that would guarantee core funding for hospices?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, of course I join the noble Lord in paying tribute to the splendid work done day in, day out, in hospices across the country. As he may know, about three-quarters of all in-patient hospice services in England are provided in the voluntary sector. We have allocated this extra £50 million on a co-operative basis between the voluntary sector and the NHS, so the voluntary sector has played a major part in this allocation and will benefit considerably from the £50 million.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   My Lords, all of us will welcome the additional £50 million and, indeed, the additional £12 million for training that has also been allocated. However, the Minister is no doubt aware of considerable concern about the funding of children's hospices in particular. On average, only 7 per cent of their funding is received directly through the NHS, whereas adult hospices receive more than 35 per cent. Is the department considering this issue?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I draw the noble Lord's attention to the fact that the New Opportunities Fund, <P>


<a name="column_597"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 597</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>chaired by my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley, has given £45 million since 2003 to palliative care for children, of which about £15 million has gone to children's hospices.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Glenarthur: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say how many hospices there are in the public sector and how he expects that figure to grow over the next five or 10 years?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, as I said earlier to the noble Lord, Lord Laming, about three-quarters of the in-patient services in hospices are provided in the voluntary sector. That amounts to approximately 2,630 beds. A third of that, give or take, is provided also in the public sector.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that although the Government have done well as far as hospices are concerned, it is far from good enough? Although the £50 million he mentioned has been helpful and welcome, the Government are relying far too heavily on the voluntary sector. Hospices should have greater responsibility to the Government, and the Government, in my view, should be primarily responsible for funding them. We are nowhere near that, so how about approaching the issue in that way?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, of course we would all like to do better, and we accept that there is a need to continue to improve the funding of hospices. However, the voluntary sector has done a splendid job in hospices and is held in a great deal of public affection by those who use such services. I do not think we would want to, in effect, give a vote of no confidence to that work by implying that we were not satisfied in any way with the work done in voluntary hospices.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Walton of Detchant: </B>   My Lords, while welcoming the extra funding to which the Minister has referred, will the long-term support for the hospice movement fall within the remit of the Select Committee's consideration of the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, which is, I understand, not to meet until July?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, I do not think it is for me to suggest in any way whatever how that Select Committee should do its work. I draw the noble Lord's attention to the fact that the Select Committee on Health will be making an inquiry into hospices and palliative care.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew13"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Oxford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that although hospice care is sometimes said to be expensive, it represents very good value for money? Not only does it represent superb care for patients but, as the noble Lord, Lord Laming, implied, it has pioneered palliative care for the country as a whole and raised standards.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, the right reverend Prelate is absolutely right. Great pioneering work has been done <P>


<a name="column_598"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 598</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by hospices, much of it in developing services outside hospices as well as in relation to in-patient beds. For example, there are 264 specialist palliative homecare teams, 81 hospice at home services and 200-odd daycare services. Some pioneering services have been developed by the voluntary hospice movement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, given that the health service now knows its allocations three years in advance, will my noble friend encourage primary care trusts to enter into longer term agreements with hospices so that they have much more stability and certainty about the funding they receive from the NHS?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   My Lords, as my noble friend knows, primary care trusts will, from April 2004, be responsible for controlling 75 per cent of the NHS budget. Very substantial increases in that budget mean that there will be opportunities for them to respond to local needs, which is the purpose of many of these increases. Much of the £50 million that I mentioned was to improve inequalities in different parts of the country. My noble friend will be aware that in the cross-cutting review by the Treasury and the voluntary sector, strong emphasis was placed on government departments and the public services entering into more secure funding for the voluntary sector.

<P>
<A NAME="40323-04_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer </B>   moved Amendment No. 171B:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 76, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-04_para6"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "GAS AND ELECTRICITY MARKETS AUTHORITY SUSTAINABILITY DUTY
<br>
(1) The 1989 Act shall be amended as follows.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_599"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 599</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(2) In section 3A (the principal objective and general duties of the Secretary of State and the Authority), after subsection (2) insert&#151;
<br>
"(2A) Subject to subsections (1) and (2) above, the Secretary of State and the Authority shall carry out their respective functions under this Part in such a manner as to ensure the contribution to the achievement of sustainable development.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-04_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: Perhaps of all the amendments in the Energy Bill, I regard this one as bringing the Bill up to date in helping the Government achieve what they said they wanted to achieve in the energy White Paper. Ensuring that energy continues to be affordable should not be done at the cost of increased climate change. Indeed, it should be done with a view to decreasing the burden on our environment.
<P>

<a name="40323-04_para8"></a>When I moved a similar amendment in Committee, I included the sort of environmental considerations that Ofgem should take into account. The amendment probed the Government's attitude to both the narrow environmental issues and the much wider issue of sustainable development. The Minister gave some quite satisfactory answers on the environmental issues. He said that guidance on environmental and social issues would be issued to Ofgem. I believe it was so issued on 23 February, between Committee and Report. He further told us that regulatory impact assessments and environmental impact assessments must be carried out. That is good, but there is nothing to suggest that any change of policy must result from their being carried out. Nevertheless, I felt that those were both moves in the right direction and did not retable the part of the amendment dealing with the environmental issues.
<P>

<a name="40323-04_para9"></a>However, the reply of the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, on overall sustainable development was, I believe, totally unsatisfactory; I do not believe that it included the words "sustainable development" anywhere. I fear that this Bill does not recognise the importance of Ofgem updating what it is able to have regard to in its principal duties. With all due respect to the Minister and his department, that may be because there is still a lack of understanding of what exactly sustainable development is. The reply suggested that just dealing with the environmental issues was adequate. But I quote to the Minister from the Government's own publication on sustainable development, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Sustainable development is currently a headline topic for policy making . . .  The significance is given further weight by the recently expanded definition of sustainable development, broadened from its origins within environmental protection and resource conservation now to include social perspectives, as well as economic perspectives, which dictates a relevance to policy making across most if not all of the public sector".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-04_para10"></a><P>

<a name="40323-04_para11"></a>That is a very good statement of policy. It is on the Defra website, and I believe that that department does understand what sustainable development is all about. Indeed, in the recent debate on the countryside, the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, described sustainable development as a three-legged stool. That is a vivid and apt description. All the legs need to be of equal length for the stool to be balanced. That is Ofgem's problem: at the moment, the stool is unbalanced on the <P>


<a name="column_600"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 600</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>economic and social sides. That is not to say that we do not need to regard separately the social, environmental and economic strands, but there really must be an over-arching principle in place. That is what my amendment seeks to do.
<P>

<a name="40323-04_para12"></a>The Minister's reply in Committee was that the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"current drafting of the principal objective and the general duties strikes a fair balance between protecting the interests of consumers and safeguarding the environment".&#151;[Official Report, 4/2/04; col. GC 401.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-04_para13"></a>
That defines the problem that I am trying to explain. The Minister saw the problem as a balance, as if the two objectives were on opposing sides of the equation. However, the core of what sustainable development is all about is that the three things are not in opposition, but are in a complementary tension.
<P>

<a name="40323-04_para14"></a>The interests of consumers should be seen in the context of the price of energy and the manner in which it is generated; that must be something that Ofgem fundamentally concerns itself with. We have seen some good examples recently of Ofgem, without the sustainable development duty, being unable to exercise its powers in a way that is complementary to sustainable development. It is quite interesting that in Ofgem's own folder about what it does, it states that it works in the interests of customers, both present and future. I was intrigued to discover that it believes that it works in the interests of future customers, as that suggests that it believes that it should be able to take issues such as the overall effect of its policies on something like climate change as central to the duties that it should be pursuing. However, following the Minister's reply last time, I do not believe that, given its duties under the legislation as drafted, it would be able to do that.
<P>

<a name="40323-04_para15"></a>The Minister's third point was that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Piecemeal rearranging of the regulator's general duties does not provide for regulatory certainty, which is an important objective".&#151;[Official Report, 4/2/04; col. GC 401.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-04_para16"></a>My wish to put sustainable development as the over-arching framework in which the authority operates is certainly not a piecemeal rearrangement. It would enable there to be a very firm framework so that we should not need to return to the issue in future. With this amendment in the Bill, the legislation should stand the test of time.
<P>

<a name="40323-04_para17"></a>Finally, I quote again from the Government's own writings on sustainable development. When it is understood as a matter of importance, I believe that it is very well expressed. The following quote came from the No. 10 website:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the past, economic activity tended to mean more pollution and wasteful use of resources. Money has had to be spent to clean up the mess. A damaged environment impairs quality of life and, at worst, may threaten long term economic growth&#151;for example as a result of climate change".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-04_para18"></a>That is very well put. However, if Ofgem, as the regulator that considers how energy should be generated and used, including all those important price mechanisms, is unable to take overall regard of sustainable development, it will fail at that first test. The Government are incorrect in saying that there are <P>


<a name="column_601"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 601</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in place sufficient powers for Ofgem to be able to do that. I have not found that to be the case on the reading of the past legislation. Therefore, I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, when my noble friend raised this issue in Grand Committee, she drew attention to the fact that a much stronger obligation to sustainability was laid on Ofwat than is proposed, even with her amendment, on Ofgem. The noble Lord, Lord Davies, in reply to that, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Ofwat is a different structure from Ofgem. Ofwat has clear environmental and sustainable factors built into its remit and role".&#151;[Official Report, 4/2/04; col. 402.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-05_para0"></a> I do not for the life of me see why water, which is a prime necessity, should be treated any differently from energy, which is a prime necessity. I am very puzzled about why the Government, having dealt with the matter with regard to water in one way, should not be ready to deal in the same way with regard to energy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, briefly, I should like to support the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer. It may seem surprising that I do so, given that I have regularly argued that Ofgem is primarily an economic regulator whose primary duty is to look after customers. Where I differ from the noble Baroness a little is in the reference to future customers, which was of course relied on by the Government to resist the amendment that was in the event added to the Utilities Act 2000, that Ofgem should be responsible for,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"securing a diverse and viable",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-05_para1"></a>electricity&#151;or, in the other amendment&#151;gas supply.
<P>

<a name="40323-05_para2"></a>The House took a different view on that occasion, and that amendment was put into the Bill. However, I suspect that we shall hear from the Minister the same sort of argument that we heard on that occasion against those amendments. The Minister said, at col. 1497 on 5 July 2000 that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it follows that amendments such as this are a distraction and would serve to confuse rather than enhance the framework of obligations and duties under the legislation".&#151;[Official Report, 5/7/2000; col. 1497.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-05_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40323-05_para4"></a>I have heard that argument put comparatively recently about the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness. However, the Government were wrong on that occasion, in 2000, and the amendment was added to the Bill and is now part of the Utilities Act 2000. I do not believe that it interferes at all in how Ofgem performs its economic duties. Why should an amendment about the environment, such as the noble Baroness has moved, have that effect?
<P>

<a name="40323-05_para5"></a>In the present circumstances, when we are facing environmental problems on a wide range of fronts, every organisation concerned in any way with regulating or operating activities that could impact on the environment should always recognise that they have the environment as one of the objectives to which they should have regard. For the life of me, I cannot see why this amendment should not be accepted by the Government. I understand the arguments that have been put by Ministers, and no doubt we shall hear them in a moment or two from the Minister on the Front Bench today. However, on this occasion, I <P>


<a name="column_602"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 602</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe that the noble Baroness has got it right, and I shall be happy to support her if she presses the amendment to a Division.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the amendment. My name is added to it, and I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, for explaining her reasons for bringing it back. It is hugely important. As the noble Baroness said, the environmental issue that she raised in Committee has been addressed. I do not know whether she is fully satisfied, but it has been addressed. We do not feel that the issue of sustainable development has been addressed and we support her on that issue. Now the principal duties have expanded to include social and economic impacts it is important that the Government respond in a positive way.
<P>

<a name="40323-05_para6"></a>Other noble Lords who have already spoken are anticipating that the Minister will say, "No". As it is the start of a new day, I am hoping that the Minister will say, "Yes". If he cannot say yes, he may at least say that he has heard what noble Lords have said and that he recognises the reasoning behind the amendment. If he does not like the wording of the amendment, at the start of this day we issue him a challenge for the Government to come back with a wording that will meet all our concerns.
<P>

<a name="40323-05_para7"></a> The noble Baroness is quite right that this is a very important amendment. I was part of the team that took the Utilities Bill through the House and my noble friend Lord Jenkin has reminded us that Ofgem had to take the amendment on board in the end. The Government took it on board with great reluctance because it was not their idea but they had to accept it. I hope that we can start this afternoon in a more positive spirit. The amendment has much to recommend it. It is not asking for too much. All it is asking, in new subsection (2a), is that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the Secretary of State and the Authority shall carry out their respective functions under this Part in such a manner as to ensure the contribution to the achievement of sustainable development".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-05_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40323-05_para9"></a>We are all very conscious that we live in the present but that we must plan for the future. If this responsibility is not put in the Bill I fear that it may slip down the line of importance behind other matters that have to be dealt with. I support his amendment.

<A NAME="40323-05_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, I have no difficulty in supporting the sentiments expressed by the noble Baroness. I am slightly puzzled by the placing of this amendment at this point in the Bill, after provisions on the police and before provisions on offshore zones. I wonder whether that is the best place for it, although I am bound to say that the more I look at the Bill, the less sure I am that there is an ideal place for it. The noble Baroness has my sympathy in that regard but I support the principle that she has enunciated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-05_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Baroness's words about the issue of the environment. Her main complaint now is that we have not reflected the whole gamut of sustainable development in terms of the <P>


<a name="column_603"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 603</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>duties on GEMA. As she said, there are three strands to sustainable development: the environmental, the social and the economic. Essentially, GEMA operates in the economic sphere but it has some environmental obligations and has guidance on environmental and social matters from the Secretary of State. It contributes, via its economic activities, to sustainability. Clearly there is some crossover. For example, as the noble Baroness recognised in her opening remarks, in producing regulatory impact assessments for all important decisions GEMA must include environmental impact assessments.
<P>

<a name="40323-05_para10"></a>The role of an economic regulator is obviously to deliver a degree of economic sustainability as well as to ensure that that is done having regard to environmental and social sustainability. The noble Lord, Lord Ezra, made the point that in the Water Bill, which most of us here discussed not long ago, Ofwat, as a regulator, has a sustainable development requirement. But the water legislation is not drafted in the same way as the Utilities Act and the legislation governing energy. For instance, while GEMA does not have a general duty to have regard to sustainable development, it does have a general duty to the environment whereas Ofwat does not, despite the fact that it is clear that sustainability in the water sector must include an environmental dimension. The balance of responsibilities between the regulator and the Secretary of State in relation to water are different from the balance of responsibilities between the regulator and the Secretary of State under the Utilities Act.
<P>

<a name="40323-05_para11"></a>I was rarely present during debates on the Utilities Act, but noble Lords will remember that the overall duties of the energy regulator were debated in some detail. Noble Lords sought an amendment to place a sustainable development duty on GEMA. At the time, the Government's response was that it should be recognised that measures concerned with such matters will often be in the interests of consumers, in particular their long-term interests; that is, the interests not only of present but of future consumers. That is where the economic sustainability responsibilities of GEMA arise and that is the principal objective of GEMA and, to some extent, the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40323-05_para12"></a>Time has moved on in one respect since the Utilities Act but we are still dealing with a structure that was laid down in it. To accept sustainable development as a direct responsibility in all its manifestations through GEMA would be to alter the balance set down in the Utilities Act. The concept of sustainable development incorporates social and environmental, as well as economic, considerations. If we incorporate the social and environmental considerations into the principal objective then we remove the priority that GEMA, as part of this structure, has afforded to the economic interests of consumers present and future. That is confusing for GEMA and for those who deal with it.
<P>

<a name="40323-05_para13"></a>It is also important to recognise that in the course of production of the energy White Paper extensive consultation took place in relation to how we deliver regulation and the objectives of the energy White Paper. <P>


<a name="column_604"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 604</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The conclusion at that time was that the current drafting of the principal objective and the general duties reflected the objectives, including the balance of responsibilities. That is balance not in the sense of trading one against another but in the sense of delivering all three aspects of sustainable development via GEMA's responsibilities for the economic interests of consumers and the Secretary of State's responsibilities on the social and environmental side.
<P>

<a name="40323-05_para14"></a>I appreciate that we have been round this circle when the Utilities Bill was considered and again with the Water Bill. We have had the present structure of regulation within the energy sector for a relatively short time. It has worked reasonably well and the energy White Paper places wider responsibilities on all players within the energy policy structure, including sustainable development. Now is not the time to alter the central responsibilities of GEMA, bearing in mind that sustainable development is mainstreamed into the Government's whole approach to energy policy and the energy strategy embodied in the energy White Paper. To place that responsibility on GEMA is not consistent with the differentiation of the functions that was set out in the Utilities Act. At the end of various consultations in which varying views were expressed we felt that, on balance, we should keep the situation as it is. I do not propose to move from that position today.

<P>
<A NAME="40323-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, I notice that he has just said that the Government's main sustainability belief is within their White Paper. That is fine but the White Paper will not be part of the Bill. We may not have another chance of a Bill like this for many years to come. I urge the Minister to reconsider because we would be very concerned at missing this opportunity. The amendment will not dilute the responsibilities that Ofgem is being given in the way that he thinks. I think that the opportunity to put a responsibility in law on the face of the Bill will be missed. I am slightly disappointed with his answer and I wonder whether he would like to indicate anywhere in the Bill where there is any reference to what we are trying to achieve with this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the answer is: not in relation to the powers of GEMA, which is what the amendment deals with and presumably why it is in this place. There is no other opportunity to debate that particular dimension, but throughout the Bill we have stressed sustainability and some of the objectives of the Bill relate directly to sustainability. The importance of the structure of regulation and intervention in this market is to ensure that we have a sustainable energy policy. However, the particular responsibilities of GEMA are primarily&#151;sustainably&#151;economic; not all the range of responsibilities comes under the heading of sustainable development.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, I warmly thank noble Lords who have supported this amendment. I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, for his long view and, <P>


<a name="column_605"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 605</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with the length of his experience, for choosing to support this amendment. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, perhaps I wished that the Minister would say "Yes" to this amendment, but unlike her perhaps I was more pessimistic. Like the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, I searched hard for where to place this amendment; there is no obvious place because, contrary to the Minister's view, the Bill does not give us an opportunity to explore the overall framework of sustainable development. As such, I thought that this was probably as good a place as any to put the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para0"></a>The Government did produce an energy White Paper and they do have a policy on sustainable development, but GEMA is so influential in the implementation of that policy that its ability to interpret what sustainable development means in the market is critical. For all that the Minister said about what is in the Utilities Act being sufficient, we have learnt, for example from the NETA fiasco&#151;whereby CHP was significantly depressed by the way Ofgem chose to interpret its powers under the Utilities Act&#151;that this amendment is essential if we are not to see that situation happen again. For that reason I would like to test the opinion of the House.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-06_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 172, I wish to speak also to Amendment No. 184 which stands in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para6"></a>In Grand Committee, again in consort with the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, I moved an amendment regarding the safety of navigation in respect of the establishment of offshore wind farms. The amendment arose from concerns felt in the shipping and ports industries, including Trinity House which is responsible for marking our navigation lanes around the coast.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, who answered on that occasion, conceded that safety of navigation was a serious matter. I do not think that any of us would disagree with that. However, he nevertheless argued that the concerns expressed were already covered by existing legislation. Since then further meetings have taken place with the industries and the Government, as a result of which further amendments, to which I now speak, have been brought forward. I should say at the outset that the first amendment was originally tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, who I am pleased to see in his place. That was a procedural ploy as the noble Lord could not be here last night. Therefore the amendment appeared in my name. It is covered in the generality of what we are <P>


<a name="column_608"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 608</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discussing in this grouping, but he will forgive me if I do not speak specifically to his amendment as I am sure he is quite capable of doing that himself.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para8"></a>Amendment No. 184, which would insert a new clause in the Bill, is designed to meet those concerns from the shipping and ports industries that still exist even after further discussions with the Government. The points covered in the amendment on which I seek assurances from the Government are as follows. The first is the question of consultation. The industries are very worried that they were not consulted early enough in the process of granting licences for offshore wind farms. They would like the Government to publish details of the most heavily used shipping routes for the assistance of would-be developers. They would also like the Government to negotiate possibly a memorandum of understanding on consultation with shipping and ports interests before any further sites are offered for tender.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para9"></a>The industries felt that they were not properly consulted under round one of the offshore wind sites licences. As a result certain sites were proposed such as the one off Cromer where three existing shipping lanes will have to be altered to accommodate a wind farm. The inshore route will become much more difficult. It is one that ships use when there are very strong winds from the west. The middle lane will be moved to go round the wind farm and that pushes it further out to sea and much closer to the third lane, thereby in my view increasing the risk of possible collision.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para10"></a>The industries consider that there is also a need for much more technical study to be carried out into the adverse effects of wind farms on shore and ship radar, radio and other electronic communications systems. An amendment tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, deals specifically with that subject. I shall leave it to him to fill in the details on that. Suffice to say that we should like the Government to give us an assurance that they will commission a study into the effect of wind farms on marine radar and radio communications systems, including the combination effects of these structures.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para11"></a>The industry would also like to see the use of traffic management tools to enable offshore renewable energy installations and shipping to coexist in safety. In Grand Committee I mentioned the use of shipping clearways that were used in the early days of the offshore oil industry. The Government have indicated that they already have the necessary tools to do this, but I should like an assurance from the Minister that any traffic management systems that may be introduced will be required to conform to international standards and that, as a direct result of the establishment of offshore renewable energy installations, they will be financed by the developers. Furthermore, the industry feels that there is a need for a common regime in territorial waters and the renewable energy zones. These are the zones extending beyond our territorial waters where offshore wind farms can be set up. We seek an assurance that the Government will, in practice, apply Article 60(7) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea when considering the establishment of installations in territorial waters, as well as the REZs. Finally, there is a need for a pragmatic approach in applying Article 60(7) <P>


<a name="column_609"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 609</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of UNCLOS, and we seek assurance from the Government that any deviations that may be required of ships&#151;I mentioned an instance earlier&#151;will be kept to a minimum.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para12"></a>I wish to mention one further very important point. In Grand Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, mentioned the Transport and Works Act 1992 and the difficulties involved with that. Industries are seeking an assurance from the Government that they will give full consideration to issues of safety of navigation before installations are consented to, both under the Transport and Works Act and the Coast Protection Act 1949. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, made great play of the Coast Protection Act in his remarks in Grand Committee, but there is another avenue for would-be developers to follow: the Transport and Works Act, which does not require them to look at the interests of safety of navigation. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will expand on that as well.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para13"></a>It is worth mentioning what other countries are doing in respect of this. Denmark, Germany and Holland are taking their responsibilities for the safety of navigation very seriously and have commissioned studies. Indeed, I was reading about one in Lloyd's List, the shipping newspaper, only this morning, whereby a company has been taken on by the German navigation authorities to put a test structure on one of their proposed wind farm sites out in the North Sea, to monitor the density of shipping movements. Our Government should be doing that. It is what I might describe as a precautionary approach. It seems to me that the Government are hell-bent on rushing forward to meet their commitments of 10 per cent renewable energy by 2010, whereas other countries are taking a more careful approach and are looking into aspects such as the safety of navigation.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para14"></a>On the precautionary matter, there is the suggestion that back in 1986, when the North Sea oil and gas development was going on, it was UK practice to avoid licensing not only inside traffic separation schemes but also within 10 miles of them, in case ships went off course. We all know that ships do go off course; ships break down; ships&#151;it is widespread knowledge&#151;are run by officers whose standards are not what they were 15 or 20 years ago. There have been quite a number of incidents where ships have run into well-known structures. In the old days, for instance, they were forever clouting the odd light-vessel in the Thames approaches and the Channel. We had the incident of the Norwegian car carrier, the "Tricolor", which went down just over a year ago after a collision in the North Sea. Shortly after that, at least three ships ran straight onto that wreck. Even when it was properly buoyed and permanently patrolled by ships, one ship a week ran through that exclusion zone. That says a lot about modern standards of navigation, and thereby hangs the worry. It would take only one incident of a ship&#151;through collision, or whatever&#151;running into one of these wind farms, perhaps catching fire, causing widespread pollution, to cause a huge furore in the national press and everywhere. I do think that the whole aspect of the safety of navigation is something we should look at very carefully indeed.

<A NAME="40323-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, for taking on the burden of moving, in effect, my amendment and his, because he knows far more about the subject than I do. I could not be here last night, and it therefore seemed prudent that he, conveniently for me, should take over my amendment. But I do think I should have my say.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para16"></a>This part of the Bill applies to all of the United Kingdom rights under Part 5 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It gives the Government the power to designate, within that huge area of seabed, renewable energy zones. Theoretically, therefore, the Government could surround this country with renewable energy zones. The problem may not be so much with wind in this instance, but the possibility of wave energy in the future. If we begin to extract energy from waves, that opens up the possibility of going out to deeper sea than one would think of conventionally in the context of wind turbines. Once you begin to widen out the scope, the possibility for interference with shipping becomes greater and greater. I am not a mariner in that sense, but I have sailed off the east coast for some years of my life. The approaches to Harwich and Felixstowe became important to me when we were involved with some port improvements in Harwich. I have lived with the problems of the approaches to the Thames Estuary all my life&#151;who does not who lives in either Essex or Kent? The problems of the Goodwin Sands are something that I remember vividly from my childhood. As the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, pointed out, ships still sink off our shores, for whatever reason, and subsequently there is slightly hazardous navigation. We should not pretend that the sea is a safe place.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para17"></a>My original amendment sought to require the Government, as far as was possible, not to put renewable energy zones in those areas where ships are accustomed to make their passage. They do not make their passage in straight lines in the North Sea, and definitely not as they begin to approach the east coast ports. There are offshore sands and shallows which mean that you must have fairly closely defined routes into these ports. The North Sea itself is shallow. There will be areas which large boats will tend to avoid because of shallow water, even if it is deep enough for them to pass through, because of sea conditions and so on. This matter is not straightforward and it requires the most careful consideration.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para18"></a>You cannot slap down a renewable energy zone somewhere in the middle of the North Sea just because you happen to think it is a nice place. The fact that there is a reasonable depth of water that is convenient for the construction of wind turbines will not necessarily mean that it is a safe place if shipping is required to sail close to it.
<P>

<a name="40323-06_para19"></a>That was my motivation in starting my own hare, but the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, has covered the point far better than I. There is no need for me to say <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>more&#151;except that I wholly support everything that is being done to apply the same principles to the inshore areas. In many instances there, they are even more vital because the possible channels for shipping travel are inevitably more constricted.

<A NAME="40323-07_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Sandwich: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Greenway has raised a serious issue on consultation. Will the Minister address the reasons behind the delay in consultation? The industry deserves an apology from the Government if the consultation has not been adequate. I hope that the Minister will deal with that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monro of Langholm: </B>   My Lords, I support the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, and my noble friend Lord Dixon-Smith in tabling the amendments. We must assume that if the Government are not prepared to accept them, they believe that the present legislation is adequate. But manifestly it is not. I want to call the Minister's attention to the wind farms on the Solway Firth, which cross the median line between Scotland and England. The Minister must accept that he has to reply, just as Ministers must reply in the Scottish Executive. It is an English/Scottish decision. We are dealing with UK legislation and UK incentives that provide the enthusiasm for all these wind farms.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para0"></a>What consultations did the Government have with the local interests in the Solway Firth, with the fishermen, pleasure sailing interests and the commercial ports of Kirkcudbright and Annan? The Government refused to have a public inquiry and any form of local authority involvement. They said, willy-nilly, "We'll have the wind farm in the middle of the Solway". How does that measure up with their indication that there is consultation and nothing to worry about when there obviously is something to worry about?
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para1"></a>It is disgraceful that the Government have reached this decision with no consultation or inquiry and to hell with what the fishermen think. It is a most serious matter. One must thread one's way back from the Irish Sea to ports in the Solway&#151;with a great deal of pleasure sailing in south-west Scotland. One cannot just take a sailing boat anywhere one wants to go through a wind farm&#151;it is more complicated than that. Why has this been allowed to happen? Will the amendment avoid the serious difficulty that has arisen? I want to know the answers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord MacKenzie of Culkein: </B>   My Lords, I want to speak briefly, not having spoken previously in the debate. I support the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, particularly about the safety of navigation and whether the general lighthouse authorities are involved in the discussions and consultations. I understand that in relation to the wind farms in Solway Firth the Northern Lighthouse Board had to insist that it was involved. Again as I understand it, at one stage it was told that there was no need for its involvement. It insisted on being well involved because it regarded it as being important for safety and navigation at night that the required <P>


<a name="column_612"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 612</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>structures are properly lit. I join the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, in seeking assurance that the three general lighthouse authorities are involved wherever these structures are being built offshore.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para2"></a>Furthermore, I certainly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, on standards of navigation. In my part of the world&#151;north-west Scotland&#151;when the seamen on watch on board the "Jambo" were sent below, the officer of the watch promptly went to sleep for 40 minutes. That ship went ashore at the entrance to Loch Broom. That can happen anywhere and with disastrous effects. It is important that there is proper consultation and proper involvement with all the relevant authorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-07_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, I, too, want to take up that theme. If your Lordships look at the www.bigconversation.org.uk website, they will see this statement from the Prime Minister:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We should have the confidence to open up the debate, be honest about the challenges, lay out the real choices".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-07_para3"></a>
When it comes to shipping, ports, fishing, recreation and wind farms, far from being a big conversation it is a big silence. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, and others who have spoken that the department ought to be severely rebuked for the lack of consultation that it has undertaken on this important subject.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para4"></a>We are now in round two, and as future rounds come up it is particularly important that the Government do not make the same mistake as they have made with rounds one and two in not consulting. When it comes to the sea around our coast, we need to be careful before doing anything. Your Lordships will appreciate that some 95 per cent of our trade comes by ships. We take that for granted, but ships have accidents for all kinds of reasons.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para5"></a>I was involved with the "Braer" and "Herald of Free Enterprise" accidents and I know only too well the disasters that can happen. Both those ships were exercising the right of free passage; an international right. It is the Government's responsibility not to hinder that right. The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, referred to Article 60(7) of UNCLOS; it is worth reading that to your Lordships. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Artificial islands, installations and structures and the safety zones around them may not be established where interference may be caused to the use of recognised sea lanes essential to international navigation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-07_para6"></a>
That is what is happening with some of the proposals under round two.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para7"></a>That agreement with UNCLOS, to which the British Government have signed up, does not apply to territorial waters, but it applies within the UK renewable energy zone and both should have a common energy regime. It is wrong that there should be two different regimes. I support that statement with the argument that the Thames estuary and the Greater Wash strategic areas straddle both the UK territorial waters and the UK renewable energy zone. It is therefore important that a common regime applies to both.
<P>


<a name="column_613"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 613</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para8"></a>Increasingly, Britain and Europe are moving to a short sea shipping regime&#151;a regime supported by the Commission and the governments of member states. That is for two reasons: one is the appalling congestion on our roads and railways; the other is pure economics. Inevitably, much trade to Britain comes on short sea routes from Europe rather than arriving in this country and using the motorway. For example, most of B&Q's goods coming into the Humber estuary come from Rotterdam. There they come off the big international liners, are broken down on to smaller vessels and they come across the sea into the Humber estuary.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para9"></a>It is worth looking at the Humber estuary for a moment. The area will be affected by a proposed wind farm. In 2002, the Department for Transport's statistics showed 15,321 ship arrivals in all the Humber ports. In 2002, more than 1 million passengers sailed either on the Hull/Rotterdam ferry or the Hull/Zeebrugge ferry. Grimsby and Immingham are the largest freight ports in this country, taking 10 per cent of the 2002 traffic&#151;some 55.7 million tonnes. If one sites a wind farm so that restrictions are imposed on that kind of shipping traffic, one is asking for trouble. I ask the Government to consider this matter very seriously. It is not only the Humber ports that are affected; as the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, said, Cromer is affected, as are the Merseyside ports by the development of Liverpool.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para10"></a>Another reason for considering this matter particularly carefully is that there is an EU initiative on short-sea shipping called "Motorways of the Sea". When I was in Brussels last week talking about short sea shipping, one lane that was mentioned as possibly being designated as a new motorway of the sea was the Rotterdam-Humber link. A wind farm in the middle of that lane would affect the shipping and merely complicate the hazards. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, may say that it would be very easy for ships to sail round the wind farm, but I ask him what his reaction would be if one of us submitted a planning application to place a mast on the flight path into Heathrow. It is perfectly feasible for an aircraft to divert around a mast but it is not terribly practical to do so. The more that people are asked to divert ships, the more that will cause congestion. That is true not only of ships bringing in freight and passengers; one will be forcing fishermen and recreational craft into a smaller and smaller area.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para11"></a>I want to move on to the subject of recreation and draw your Lordships' attention to some of the effects of wind farms, particularly the one proposed for Portland Harbour and Weymouth Bay. I freely recognise that that is not one of the round two wind farms, but a wind farm there will cause sufficient turbulence to prevent that stretch of water, which is the finest small-craft racing water in northern Europe, being used as our 2012 Olympic sailing event post. That will have a very serious implication for recreational craft and for the economics of this <P>


<a name="column_614"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 614</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>country. If our best racing water would be disturbed by turbines, for goodness sake, let us think again and put the turbines somewhere else.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   My Lords, I believe that my noble friend Lord Whitty should pay great attention to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Greenway. This is a very serious matter and I do not consider that the Government have treated it with proper courtesy. The question is partly one of diverting shipping around intrusions in the shipping lanes. The important point about those intrusions&#151;it has not been mentioned thus far in the debate&#151;is their size. The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, referred to the controversies in the 1960s and thereabouts concerning oil rigs. Oil rigs were certainly an intrusion and a potential danger but, from the point of view of energy policy, they were useful. None the less, there was a good deal of concern about their effect upon shipping in the North Sea.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para12"></a>I am struck by the fact that wind farms are far bigger than oil rigs. Therefore, they intrude far more and are much more dangerous. A wind farm with 30 turbines was recently erected off Anglesey. I do not remember its exact size but it produces 60 megawatts of power. That is not a great deal, but it is no doubt worth having.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para13"></a>However, the other day I read in New Civil Engineer magazine, which comes my way, about a proposed wind farm off the East Anglian coast. I am not sure whether it was the one to which the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, referred, but the point is that it will be at least two kilometres&#151;that is, a mile&#151;wide. It is far wider than any oil rig of which I have heard. In addition, it will be five or six kilometres in length. Therefore, we are talking about an area off East Anglia which is two kilometres wide by five or six kilometres long, which is a sizeable area of intrusion into the North Sea.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para14"></a>The Government must consider the following. First, from their point of view, it is highly desirable to obtain energy which does not produce carbon dioxide and other such by-products which are thought to be undesirable. Secondly&#151;this appeals to me as a Scotsman&#151;in a sense, the fuel is obtained for free. On the other hand, the amount of fuel produced is far less than one imagines. In Denmark, wind farms produce only 25 per cent of the available energy, which is less than one might have thought. None the less, wind farms are desirable.
<P>

<a name="40323-07_para15"></a>But, against that, the Government must set the fact that, in producing any energy from off-shore wind farms, the intrusion into the North Sea or, indeed, into other seas around our islands will be unreasonable. The Government must rethink their policies from first principles and not from a mere desire to meet their Kyoto requirements, reasonable although that may be.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   My Lords, I want to pick up the last point concerning the fact that a wind farm is not an isolated object, such as a platform. One must also remember that it has a safety zone around it, which may contribute to the safety of the wind farm if <P>


<a name="column_615"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 615</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to no one else. On the other hand, a far larger zone is thus created which, necessarily, should be regarded as a no-go area.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para0"></a>Much of the planning will depend upon having a clear idea of where ships go, and I am reminded of some surprising situations. In 1993, I was asked by the Government to conduct an inquiry into pollution around the coast of the United Kingdom and into what could be done to prevent it. One question which I asked of the department was, "Where do ships go?". There was a deafening silence and then back came the answer, "A lot of research was done some years ago and clearways were established so that platforms would not be built in the areas where ships go". I said, "Well, that's a useful starting point for us. How does it work?". The answer was, "It doesn't work at all because either nobody tells the ships or it doesn't suit the ships. They don't use the clearway; they simply thread their way as best they can through the platforms". Therefore, it is no good simply to have bright ideas about where one would like ships to go; one must take account of where they actually do go. I was helped a little by some retired mariners of whom I asked, "If you were going from A to B, what route would you take?". At any rate, that was better than the clearway system.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para1"></a>However, since then, some fairly detailed studies have been carried out on where ships go&#151;at least, in coastal areas&#151;and clearly those must be taken into account. Again, I commend the Dutch example of updating such statistics through monitoring. As the size of ships change, draughts change and so patterns will change. One has to be careful to take account of reasonably foreseeable future developments.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para2"></a>It has been said that nowadays standards of navigation vary considerably. That is right, but I do not believe that we should dismiss that on the basis that some third-world countries licence their mariners rather freely. The general-secretary of one of the maritime unions, who I am sure is an admirable trade union leader, has no personal experience of ships. He went to the east for a fortnight and came back with a full master's ticket. It cost the union £5,000, but that was money well spent as it revealed the realities of life. One cannot assume that someone with a certificate in charge of a ship necessarily knows what he is doing.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para3"></a>I do not necessarily believe that that is the greatest risk. The biggest risk is fatigue. Ships often comply with minimum standards, but really they are undermanned. Two examples come to my mind. The first was a gentleman who ran his brand new ship on to an island&#151;I forget whether it was the Pentland Firth, but it was in that kind of area&#151;where it stays to this day. When asked why he had done so, he said, "I got blinded by the lighthouse on the island". That was not a very good excuse. Further research showed that he had been very tired, had come across the Atlantic and that only he and the master were competent watchkeepers. He had undoubtedly dozed off and, at the last minute, seen the lighthouse. Because of his tiredness and in the confusion, instead of putting the <P>


<a name="column_616"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 616</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>helm hard over, he worked through the auto-pilot which had limitations on the extent to which one could put the helm over. Hence the accident occurred.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para4"></a>A second example is that of a banana ship which came in after fierce troubles in the Atlantic. It berthed in Portsmouth. The master was given two hours in which to discharge some cargo and put to sea again. Desperately tired, he put to sea and, thinking he saw a navigation light, he took emergency action, putting his ship straight into the Nab Tower. He was a perfectly competent master&#151;I believe he had 40 plus years' experience and an unblemished record. I very much regret that the coastguard agency saw fit to prosecute him. I believe that his employers should have been prosecuted. Such situations happen and we have to take account of them.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para5"></a>Those who erect wind farms should bear in mind that, relatively speaking, they are very fragile structures. The individual structures in a wind farm have absolutely no chance against a ship of any size, with any dead-weight. A ship would skittle them down and there would probably not be much harm caused to the ship. People who erect wind farms might like to take such matters into account.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para6"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Caithness, mentioned the entrance to the Humber. I have been looking at a chartlet produced, I believe, by the Chamber of Shipping on which it says at the bottom that it is not to be used for navigation purposes. That is plainly true, but it is a frightening prospect. How will a ship enter the Humber if the various projected wind farms are erected? I am sure it can be done, but the exercise will call for the utmost skill and vigilance and a high degree of risk will be involved.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para7"></a>I want to mention radar. I have heard interesting remarks&#151;on the radio or wherever&#151;by someone speaking on behalf of the MoD&#151;I believe he came from the air ministry side&#151;concerning worries about the effect of wind farms on radar. To my surprise he said that the MoD was very worried about wind farms in areas where low-flying aircraft operate, but that otherwise it was not very worried. If the radar used by aircraft can be disturbed by wind farms, those in the MoD concerned with the sea should consider this matter carefully, as should the Government.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para8"></a>For all those reasons, I wholeheartedly support the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway. It is too much to expect the Government to support it, but I hope that they will give it careful consideration and will not oppose any amendments in this group that are pressed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   My Lords, individual windmills have fairly substantial foundations which a ship could strike and a good deal of damage would be done to a ship.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   My Lords, no doubt that is right, provided that the foundation projects sufficiently high from the sea bed. If the foundation is sufficient, I do not see why the stalk of the windmill <P>


<a name="column_617"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 617</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should not stay up. Provided that the draught were not too great, a ship would just whip off the stalks at the top of the foundation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, this debate provides a good example of the unfortunate fact that we already have the renewable energy zone proposition and the safety zones around renewable energy installations have been proposed before the Government have brought forward their long-promised marine Bill, which would give a marine planning framework. Without a spatial framework, it is very difficult to balance the competing demands of renewable energy, commercial shipping and even recreational yachting.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para9"></a>In disagreeing with the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, I declare an interest as a recreational sailor. I view the issues of climate change as more important than whether I shall be able to sail in a recreational manner here or there. If push came to shove, I would certainly choose to have my recreational sailing slightly disrupted.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para10"></a>In principle, I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, has raised an extremely important point about whether the competing demands are being dealt with fairly despite the lack of a spatial planning framework. One slight concern is that the debate on the amendment has focused mostly on renewable energy zones. The amendment talks about approaches to ports. My understanding was that most renewable energy zones&#151;perhaps the Minister can clear up this point&#151;will be further out to sea. As regards approaches to ports, the important factor is the safety zones around the renewable energy installations. A number of issues with regard to commercial shipping need to be addressed and I suggest that Clause 87 should concern those who have a great interest in it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, for moving Amendment No. 172. As he pointed out, it has been grouped with Amendments Nos. 179, 184 and 184A. The issue is clearly extremely important. In a sense, we have had a Second Reading debate. Depending on the Government's response to these amendments, it may or may not be necessary to vote at a later stage in the proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para11"></a>It is extraordinary that whatever subject comes up in your Lordships' House there is immediately a huge amount of expertise available to debate it. I shall not go through this matter in the form of a wind-up speech, but I shall comment on some of the points that have been made and make a few of my own.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para12"></a>As I said in Committee, I am not intrinsically against wind farms. Almost every weekend I fly to Holland at a rather low altitude, and I am surrounded by wind farms when I arrive there. In the course of doing that, one is very conscious of the large amount of shipping passing from one side of the Channel to the other. It is quite extraordinary that we have reached this stage in relation to such matters without proper consultation and consideration having been given to them by the Government. If the Government were <P>


<a name="column_618"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 618</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>thinking of placing offshore wind farms in various parts of the English Channel, off Hull, off Liverpool and in Scotland, it should surely be necessary first to ask, "Where are the shipping lanes?" and then to place the wind farms somewhere else. So far, there appears to have been absolutely no attempt to do that or to consult the relevant interests. That is a very dangerous situation.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para13"></a>The effect of the location of the wind farms, of course, is partly economic, partly environmental and partly a matter of safety. So far as the economic side is concerned, my noble friend Lord Caithness pointed out that 95 per cent by volume of our international trade is by ship, and he also implied that 25 per cent of our internal trade is carried by sea. That is a matter of very great importance.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para14"></a>To what extent have the Government evaluated the problems that arise from diverting our own and other countries' shipping as a result of putting up the wind farms? More particularly, with regard to the environment, have they taken into account the extent to which there may be an increase in pollution because of the re-routing of ships as well as some saving from the location of the wind farms? Whether or not the wind farms are located sensibly will have an effect on the net gain with regard to the sustainable environmental aspects of the question.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para15"></a>It is also the case that there is potential, to which the noble Lord drew attention in proposing the amendment, for an environmental disaster. If we do not take fully into account the safety aspects, we shall almost be planning for a disaster, and not necessarily only one. As the noble Lord pointed out, the degree of damage following the sinking of the ferry in the Channel last year was very considerable. If the wind farms are located in the wrong place, the dangers are likely to be repeated time and again and the likelihood is that more than one super tanker will collide with them. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson said, although the damage to a super tanker is not likely to be very great, it is still possible that there would be some leakage. That would pose a constant threat to the environment, which needs to be mitigated as much as possible by locating the wind farms in the right places.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para16"></a>Amendment No. 179, standing in my name, takes up the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, about radar. The amendment proposes the insertion of a new clause as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Provisions in this Act and earlier legislation concerning the granting of new licences for generating stations shall not come into effect until the Secretary of State has commissioned, received and approved a full report on the effect of offshore wind farms on radar, radio and other devices used by vessels for the purposes of navigation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-08_para17"></a>
I stress that that is the Government's responsibility, though no doubt they will wish to consider to what extent the cost of such an investigation should be borne by the developers of the wind farms.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para18"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, referred to a broadcast that he had heard. I can give him a more specific reference. On 16 March, the noble <P>


<a name="column_619"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 619</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord, Lord Bach, replying to a parliamentary Question about wind farms and low flying aircraft, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is undisputed that wind turbines can affect radar, low flying, and communications links, so we have to ensure that wind farm developments do not impair our operational needs and safety".&#151;[Official Report, 16/3/04; col. 127.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-08_para19"></a>
If that is the case for air force training, it is surely far more important in the context in which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, drew attention to it. I therefore hope that the Government will accept my Amendment No. 179. Alternatively, it may be necessary to press it to a Division.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para20"></a>In proposing the amendment, the noble Lord spoke also to Amendment No. 184, which raises a number of points. It is extraordinary that the issue is to some extent divided between different departments. The lead department appears to be the Crown Estate&#151;perhaps not a department that immediately comes to mind with regard to the development of international or offshore waters. The document produced by the Crown Estate shows a mass of proposed sites&#151;some, as mentioned on the other side of the House, of very considerable extent&#151;which could not be more conveniently located, not off the shipping lanes but in the Thames Estuary, off the Greater Wash and off Liverpool. All that appears to have happened without any regard to where the shipping lanes actually are and the extent to which the ships will need to divert in order to avoid them, subject to all the hazards of navigation, to which a number of noble Lords have drawn attention.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para21"></a>That brings me to another point regarding the amount of data that we have on shipping lanes. Amendment No. 184A, also tabled in my name, relates to the use of recognised shipping lanes. It reads:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Installations and the safety zones around them may not be established where interference may be caused to the use of recognised sea lanes essential to international navigation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-08_para22"></a>
I understand that on 19 March a government department issued some information on shipping lanes. However, it appears to have been sent only to the developers, but apparently not to the shipping interests that are involved. Perhaps the Minister will let us know whether or not that is so.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para23"></a>Clearly, these are matters of very great importance. It is right that we should debate them and, if necessary, vote on them. A number of other points have arisen, particularly with regard to our international treaty obligations, which perhaps may more appropriately be dealt with on consideration of later amendments. I believe that we have been right to raise this issue today. We are grateful to the noble Lord for moving the amendment. There are a number of additional points of greater detail, to which I am sure we shall want to pay close attention in a moment.

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 620</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the amendments grouped with it for having identified the issues that we debated generally at Second Reading and considered extensively in Committee. As the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has indicated and the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, has expressed through his contribution, there are a number of issues about which Members of the House are dissatisfied, and I hope to allay their concerns when I speak to their particular amendments. However, I am also obliged to respond to a debate, which has all the hallmarks of a Second Reading, about general issues of marine safety without having anything to do with wind farms and the sea. That is a fairly extensive remit, and I shall therefore limit my response to certain aspects.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para24"></a>Perhaps I may first clear up one important misconception that I believe has underlined one or two contributions to the debate. To a degree, that misunderstanding is implicit in Amendment No. 172, the first amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para25"></a>The amendment implies that decisions will be taken about whether offshore renewable energy development is to be permitted and then the renewable energy zone will be created over that area of the sea. That is exactly the wrong way round. The process we are introducing is the opposite. The renewable energy zone will be created first around the whole of the United Kingdom. The reason why it is referred to in plural is that it is cumulative.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para26"></a>The zone is not defined totally in one stage. Zones are defined but the concept is a zone around the United Kingdom established in stages in the area of the sea where the UK has the right to produce energy from the water and winds. Designation of the zones is purely an enabling step to give us the legal power to consider and control renewable energy development within them. Creation of these zones does not imply that renewable energy development will take place in any particular location. The process of deciding where and how development will take place comes at a later stage.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para27"></a>In response to the noble Lord, Lord Monro, as regards the Scottish issue, the Solway Firth was the subject of consultation. It featured in round one and was carried out with the agreement of the Scottish Executive. As the noble Lord rightly identifies, it is in Scottish waters. The process might not have been as extensive as he would have liked. It may be that we need to learn lessons from round one on several aspects of consulting more effectively. However, I assure the noble Lord that that was not carried out as part of a "mega" project by the Department of Trade and Industry imposing a requirement upon the locality against some kind of master plan. That is not the way the issues are evolving and it was not so in that case.
<P>

<a name="40323-08_para28"></a>What I have learnt from this debate and what noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Monro, have pressed with great strength, is that we need carefully to consider the process of consultation and the position to which the noble Lords, Lord Greenway and Lord Higgins, referred where certain interests felt that they had been consulted on general issues contained in <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for giving way. I want to be clear. If I understand the Minister correctly, in effect he is saying that there will not be renewable energy zones; there is one zone which will circumnavigate the United Kingdom. I have always accepted that within the renewable energy zones the position of a wind farm would be much more closely and strictly defined. Certainly, in so far as I was involved in Amendment No. 172, the purpose of that is specific and identifiable and, I thought, clear from its wording; that is, that there would be areas that were not renewable energy zones and would be reserved to shipping. That is the reason it was worded in that way. That may cause complications for the Minister because it means that there would then be renewable energy zones because shipping would have priority, as, indeed, I think it should, in particular parts of the North Sea where there are these "maritime motorways".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to belabour the point. I merely indicate that the concept of zones is just a sub-section of the zone around the whole of the United Kingdom for which we have legal powers to examine the issues of wind energy. The question of where the installation should be, the whole issue of maritime safety, consultation and all the issues that have been aired in the debate, are part of a secondary process. The amendment addresses the concept of the zone and in that sense is not effective in terms of seeking to obtain what has been expressed in the House.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para0"></a>I shall respond in a more direct way to the very important points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway. By that technical approach at the beginning I do not in any way seek to disavow the importance of the issues he raises. The safety of navigation is a predominant concern to the Government. I remind the House that we are dealing with Report stage. We have had Committee stage and are now into the detail. However, in the course of this debate I have been asked two questions, or they were implicit by some contributions. First, I was asked whether the Government have any concept that building wind installations might affect maritime safety. There is only one answer to such a general question and it is brief. The answer is "yes". Secondly, I have been asked the general question of whether we have any idea that there are important sea lanes which ships pass through, some of which can be likened to motorways on land and that it would be absurd to build an installation in the middle of a motorway. The answer to that is also "yes". The Government unreservedly recognise that point too, to say nothing of the fact that there are international shipping lanes. We are governed by international law and therefore there would not be any question of producing such intrusions.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para1"></a>However, I think this was addressed more accurately by the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, who participated in our deliberations in Committee. He identified concerns for certain kinds of shipping and concerns with regard to access to certain of our ports. <P>


<a name="column_622"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 622</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, if we can talk about ports in the east of England and not mention Felixstowe I am a little worried about just how precise the debate is on the concerns of Britain as a maritime trading nation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, I apologise for intervening again. Harwich and Felixstowe are the same; if you talk about one, you talk about the other.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I accept the correction from the noble Lord. I was seeking to emphasise that it is important that we concentrate on the detail, which has been identified as issues which the Government should appropriately address, and not on the more general issues which obviously the Government are enormously concerned about but which do not relate directly to these amendments nor in a very real sense to the Bill. We all recognise that the Bill has implications for shipping and the sea. However, it will also be recognised that other laws govern the processes of consultation. The question of decisions taken which affect shipping are extant, viable, crucial and still impact upon this process. However, in this Bill we need only concentrate on those issues which arise particularly because of the proposed wind farm installations.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para2"></a>I turn to the substantive issues covered by the amendments. We understand the concerns of the shipping industry about the development of the renewable energy sector. The Government are committed to working creatively and positively to finding ways in which those two sectors can co-exist.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para3"></a>The Minister responsible for energy, my right honourable friend Stephen Timms in the other place, met representatives of the industry on 16 March and has written subsequently to the Chamber of Shipping to give the shipping community assurances which I trust will allay its concern. The most important point is that the Government will not permit the location of offshore renewable energy installations where they would put at risk the safety of navigation. That is the concern behind the amendments tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Greenway and Lord Higgins. As I stated in Committee, the Government are committed to maritime safety and I am happy for the opportunity to emphasise that point again today.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para4"></a> The statement that we shall not permit the location of offshore renewable energy installations where they will endanger navigation is not a vague aspiration on our part. As I indicated in my opening remarks, we already have legislation&#151;the Coast Protection Act 1949&#151;to ensure that offshore renewable energy installations are not located where they would obstruct or endanger navigation. The Department for Transport considers applications for consent very carefully and consults the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and other organisations with an interest in marine safety before deciding whether to grant an application.
<P>


<a name="column_623"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 623</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para5"></a>The Coast Protection Act applies to development in territorial waters and to areas designated under Section 1(7) of the Continental Shelf Act. So, it will cover installations in the renewable energy zones which are being established by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para6"></a>I appreciate that a developer can choose to seek development approval for a project in English and Welsh territorial waters using the Transport and Works Act 1992, which disapplies the Coast Protection Act. However, I want to assure noble Lords that control of such developments is equally stringent under those provisions to ensure maritime safety is not compromised. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is consulted on all applications.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para7"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, in his Amendment No. 184A, raised the important point of the cumulative impact of wind farms. I assure him that we regard that as a very important factor in looking at whether development consent can be given for those projects. Developers will be obliged to work closely with each other and with shipping interests to understand the cumulative elements of the development of such installations.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para8"></a>I recognise that the shipping industry would like to see wind farms relocated rather than shipping diverted. The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, emphasised why significant costs would be potentially involved to the shipping industry if diversions were necessary in order to avoid wind farm installations. That is the burden of his Amendment No. 184, which we are considering in the group. This may not be a simple matter, given the technical and environmental constraints on where wind farms can be located. A number of factors will undoubtedly have to be taken into account in reaching decisions in this area. They will include, of course, the efficacy of wind farms and our need, as the House would recognise, to improve production of energy from renewable sources. One important issue to take into account is the possible impact on shipping. Consents decisions have to be carefully balanced across a range of interests. I merely wish to acknowledge in this debate the fact that, as the noble Lord has emphasised, shipping is important.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para9"></a>It may be reasonable in certain cases for ships to re-route around a proposed wind farm rather than for the wind farm developer to find a new site. Where such a re-routing could be achieved safely&#151;I emphasise "safely"&#151;we would want to consider it as an option. We would not propose such a change lightly, and would want to look at all the other aspects identified by the noble Lord, including the environmental, but certainly the economic, aspects of interfering with shipping. I can give an assurance that any such requirements for shipping to deviate from its present routes will be kept to a minimum. We shall need to bear in mind also our obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. It is just not possible for us to site installations, and the safety zones around them, in international shipping lanes.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para10"></a>Looking to the future, the Minister has given an undertaking that the Government will work with the shipping industry to see whether we can improve our <P>


<a name="column_624"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 624</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>current processes for making the initial high-level decisions about the areas, within which development of offshore renewable energy installations can take place. The re-establishment of shipping clearways would certainly be one approach that could be considered further in co-ordination with the industry.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para11"></a>Amendment No. 179 raises the issue of possible interference with ship communications systems. As the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, identified, the House has considered&#151;albeit briefly in Question Time&#151;issues with regard to low-flying aircraft concerning the Ministry of Defence. There is the issue of whether wind farms will affect ships' communications systems. I give the noble Lord this assurance: we agree that a further study of the matter needs to be undertaken in view of the possible effects on navigational safety. Such communications are of paramount importance in search and rescue operations. I hope noble Lords will recognise that we take that point on board. We shall carry out such a study and ensure that the results give us the assurances we need that such radar systems are not adversely affected in such a way as to jeopardise the activity of shipping.
<P>

<a name="40323-09_para12"></a>As I have indicated, I have spoken at considerable length. This has been a lengthy debate. I apologise for the length of my reply, but I thought I owed it to the mover of the amendment and those noble Lords who have contributed to the debate to give a comprehensive reply. I see that I am being stimulated to add to my already extensive remarks. I give way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I should like to refer to the question of radar. Am I to understand that he accepts the amendment, which is much more precise than the statement he has just made, in as much as more licences should not be granted until that study has been carried out? It would be quite absurd to grant the licences and then to find that the radar implications make the licence dangerous.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I do not want to accept the amendment at this point. I am giving the noble Lord a general response that we recognise the validity of the points that he makes and that we intend to carry out such a study. I am quite prepared to discuss the matter further with him. I was hoping that he would recognise the degree to which I have sought to meet him regarding his amendment in recognising the validity of his points; that he would give us time to work on this issue and to discuss the matter further. I have made my response to his points on that basis.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para0"></a>The amendments cover very important issues. That is why we have had such an extensive debate. I wanted to emphasise just how seriously the Government take the issues and why we recognise the validity of many of the points that have been made. However, I also want to emphasise that we are not convinced, as I hope I have demonstrated, that it is necessary to write new legislation on the face of this Bill. Many safeguards regarding shipping obtain in other legislation, which were already operating with regard to round one of the development of these installations. We do not believe that we need to use the vehicle of this Bill for more <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>extensive amendments save that&#151;and I have told the noble Lord&#151;we shall look further at the question of radar, discuss it further and see whether we need to make changes.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para1"></a>As for the rest, I hope I have given the assurance that this debate has raised very important issues. The Government take them very seriously. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   My Lords, at the outset I thank all noble Lords from all sides of the House who have contributed to this important but lengthy debate. I must confess that I was wondering what would have happened had the amendment been reached late last night. I think we might have had a much shorter debate. Nevertheless, some very interesting points of view have been put forward. I am very grateful to noble Lords who have been able to expand on the many points that I could not possibly cover in my opening remarks.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para2"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, is not in her place, but I should like to pick up her point suggesting that perhaps we might be anti-wind farms. I can categorically say that the shipping industry is not against wind farms. It recognises that the Government have chosen this way forward with renewable energy. All it seeks is the right mechanism and the right early consultation to enable the developers and the users of the sea to cohabit. Indeed, the Minister has said that the Government want to achieve that.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para3"></a>The Minister has been generous in the assurances that he has announced: I have not been sitting with a checklist, because there were too many of them. He has certainly gone a long way towards meeting many of our concerns. There are still one or two concerns outstanding, particularly with regard to the Transport and Works Act 1992, where developers have an alternative route of going about things, which, although it may be expensive, could be attractive to them because of the possibility of extinguishing rights of navigation and therefore reducing risks.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para4"></a>The Minister said that route would be subject to the same checks and balances as under the Coast Protection Act 1949, but there are still one or two worries on that. Using that route, there is no statutory requirement for wind farms causing a hazard to navigation to be addressed. It is appreciated that the MCA, as the Minister said, will be asked to assess orders from the safety perspective. However, the MCA is not legally part of that consent regime, and therefore any conditions in the consents imposed by them would not be legally binding on developers.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para5"></a>If that route was to be taken, there would be a serious weakness in the legislative machinery to protect against wind farms causing a hazard to navigation and therefore compromising safety. I do not know whether, with the leave of the House, the Minister is able to say a little more on that before I decide what to do on this amendment&#151;no answer is forthcoming. In that case, once again, I <P>


<a name="column_626"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>thank all those who have taken part in the debate and the Minister for his assurances. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40323-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>   moved Amendment No. 173:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 59, line 25, leave out "negative" and insert "positive"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-10_para7"></a><P>

<a name="40323-10_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is concerned with the procedure that would be exercised for Orders in Council. The paragraph as a whole is concerned with the exploitation of areas outside the territorial sea for energy production. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The rights to which this section applies shall have effect as rights belonging to Her Majesty by virtue of this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-10_para9"></a>
This is an important assertion of British sovereignty. I make no complaint about that, but it then goes on at subsection (6), to which the amendment applies:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Orders in Council under this section, and orders under subsection (5), are subject to the negative resolution procedure".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-10_para10"></a>
It seems most extraordinary that something as important as this&#151;asserting our sovereignty over exploitation of areas outside the territorial waters&#151;should be done by negative resolution. I hope that the Minister can agree that it would be more appropriate for there to be an affirmative resolution and that he can accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate the precision and cogency with which the noble Lord has addressed this amendment, but I am afraid that I will not be as forthcoming as I was on his last significant amendment.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para11"></a>There are two slightly different delegated powers in Clause 76, both of which, as the noble Lord indicated, are subject to negative resolution where he would prefer an affirmative resolution. The first, in Clause 76(4), is a power for Her Majesty to designate an area, which we are calling a renewable energy zone, as an area to which the rights under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea set out in subsection (2) are exercisable. The second power, in Clause 76(5), is a power for the Secretary of State to designate the whole or part of a renewable energy zone as an area in relation to which Scottish Ministers are to have functions, as set out, for example, in Clause 80 and the decommissioning powers in Chapter 2.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para12"></a>Both are important powers, but the subject matter of the orders will be technical in nature. My reason for seeking to rebut the argument made by the noble Lord is that we regard them as technical in nature, and we do not foresee that they will be particularly controversial. That is why we have chosen the negative resolution procedure. The Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform, in looking at the delegated powers in this Bill as a whole, thought that this was reasonable. We do not see a case for a change to an affirmative resolution.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para13"></a>It may be helpful if I add a little more about the powers. As noble Lords will be aware, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea gives the UK the right to exploit the renewable energy resources from the winds and waters in an area that we are <P>


<a name="column_627"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 627</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>calling the renewable energy zone. It is essential that there is a power to designate the area that we are claiming as the United Kingdom's renewable energy zone. UNCLOS lays down the rules that contracting parties are to use in designating this area. It is not to extend beyond 200 nautical miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. The rules for establishing these baselines are set out in UNCLOS and the baselines around the UK coast have been established for a long time, so there is no problem in this regard. Noble Lords will recognise immediately that we are not able to claim a full 200 miles in some places, for the obvious reason that we would impact on the areas of our neighbours. This is not a problem, as we intend that the zone will extend only to the median line between us and other sovereign powers. This is the agreed maritime boundary, which we have established for the purpose of designating the UK's continental shelf. We envisage that the renewable energy zone will be designated in stages, hence the reference to zones in the plural throughout the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para14"></a>I hope that noble Lords will appreciate from this brief description of the process that this is an entirely technical exercise. We would not expect this to be controversial. The process will be similar to the mapping of the UK continental shelf. Our conclusion is that the negative resolution procedure for Orders in Council for such a technical matter is entirely appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40323-10_para15"></a>On the second power, which concerns Scottish Ministers and the Scottish dimension, it follows that we need to designate the areas in the United Kingdom renewable energy zone as a whole, within which Scottish Ministers are to exercise certain functions regarding certain parts. The process of designation will be similar to that outlined above. However, we will need to define the maritime border between Scotland and the rest of the UK. There are precedents for this in other legislation. We will want to consult the Scottish Executive before making an order under Clause 76. Again, it seems to us that this is not an area of high controversy. Therefore, we think the negative resolution procedures entirely appropriate. I hope that the noble Lord is convinced by my argument and will be prepared to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="40323-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, and with the leave of the House, he mentioned the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform, of which I am a member. I looked up the proceedings of the committee, as printed and available to noble Lords. The committee did not disagree with the point that this was a technical matter, and therefore did not disagree with what the Government wanted to do. However, the point that this measure means ceding sovereignty was not raised. My noble friend Lord Higgins raised the point that the sovereignty of the seas is being ceded. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Following the Minister's argument, I was not sure whether he took that point or not. My noble friend will doubtless pick up on it if he sees fit to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform looked at this matter and saw that the decision taken that we were involved in was of a limited nature. The first point is that we are bound by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The other point is that it is simply a question of defining those territorial waters for Scotland in which the Scottish Executive has the right to make its point. I do not see that that is anything more than a technical matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-11_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, it was not a Scottish question; I understand that completely. My question was about the point that my noble friend Lord Higgins made to the effect that we were ceding sovereignty of the sea through the Order in Council.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Baroness says, but I have nothing to add.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I found some parts of the Minister's reply more convincing than others. Some were irrelevant. The irrelevant ones can be pursued with some of the later amendments.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para0"></a>I share the concern of my noble friend who intervened a moment ago. I am far from convinced that it is a mere technical matter. I will consider the matter further and will come back to it, if necessary, at Third Reading. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-11_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 174, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 175, 189 and 190, which stand in my name.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para4"></a>All four amendments are based on the amendments that we tabled in Committee&#151;Amendments Nos. 106A and 106B. Those amendments were debated at great length, and the debate is reported at cols. GC 316 to GC 325 of Hansard for 3 February 2004. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, felt that we had tabled the amendments too early in the process, which explains their repetition in the provisions dealing with interpretation of the chapter. I should hate to think that, by reiterating them only in sections that deal with the setting-up of the zones, we would give carte blanche to builders and developers to behave as they pleased. I am sure that the Government would not wish to see that.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para5"></a>In Committee, I said that the use of the word "exploitation" worried me. It still does. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, explained that the word,
<P>

<a name="column_629"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 629</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
I humbly suggest that most international conventions use words that have probably been translated and retranslated from a number of different tongues. If the noble Lord can tell me that English was used, I will stand corrected.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para7"></a>The use of the word in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea does not mean that it is precisely what is intended by the original German, French or American explanation. My alarm was compounded recently, when the Prime Minister used it in extolling changes to the way in which asylum seekers would be dealt with. He referred to the new regime and the prevention of the "exploitation" of our social security system. That is precisely the normal shade of meaning of the word that, I think, people would accept. It might be used to refer to someone who tried to exploit a loophole and gain something by it. In most cases, that will be the interpretation that an ordinary member of the developer's workforce will understand.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para8"></a>Of course, developers seeking permission to work at sea will present a picture of responsibility. I merely want to make sure that there is in the Bill a description of what is not acceptable. The seabeds around our shores must, as we said earlier, be littered with crashed aeroplanes, sunken ships and waterlogged rubbish that has accumulated over the years. It is no excuse for adding so much as one dropped spanner or ploughing up a seabed for half a mile to say that it is quicker and easier to do so.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para9"></a>I have used the definitions that I have because I feel that harm or damage, in most cases, is relevant to its context. Digging a hole to erect a pylon in an area with a radius of several hundred feet is not, in itself, harmful to the environment, but removing a chunk of seabed measuring 100 by 100 feet probably is. Excavating a black coral reef, as has happened, is both harmful and irrevocable, and we know that damaged coral cannot be regenerated.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para10"></a>I do not apologise to the Minister. I know that we had a long debate in Committee, in which I was supported by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, and by my noble friends Lady Miller of Hendon, Lord Ullswater, Lord Dixon-Smith and the Duke of Montrose. It is important that we clarify the point again. If the Minister responds by saying that he does not like my words or does not think that the amendment is necessary, I will encourage him, at this stage of the Bill's progress, to think of another word that does not have such direct influence in everyday language. "Exploitation" is not a good word, which is why I have brought the matter back.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para11"></a>Amendment No. 175 refers to anything which does not cause irrevocable damage in the marine environment. I shall give an example. We live opposite the biggest granite quarry in Europe. It was originally Mountsorrel, became Redland and is now Lafarge. It is on a site of special scientific interest. I realise that, although the work to get the granite out will be done for many years, the site must ultimately be restored, so that the totality of the environment will not be damaged. I used to know it as a lovely woodland, but I fear that I will be under the soil long before that restoration happens.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para12"></a>The word "exploitation" raises alarms for many people. For that reason, I brought the matter back. I was unable to divide the Committee, as the Minister knows. If I had been, I would have done. I apologise to noble Lords who sat through our debates in Committee in the Moses Room, but the issue was important enough for further discussion. I hope that I have persuaded the Minister that the use of the word in the Bill is undesirable. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-11_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, in Committee, I supported the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and agreed with what she wanted to achieve with the amendments. I continue to do so. I noticed that, with regard to Amendment No. 175, she said, perhaps in error, "irrevocable", when the amendment actually says "irreversible", but I am splitting hairs. The two words have the same meaning.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para13"></a>I hope that the Government will, as the noble Baroness invited them to do, produce a definition in both cases. It is useful, in such a Bill, to have some reference to the protective framework that the marine environment can expect, given the sort of work that will take place. I mention again the fact that there is no marine Act protecting the marine environment, such as the Government themselves thought necessary. They have committed themselves to bringing in such an Act, but they have given no timescale for doing so. If such an Act were in place, we would not need such a definition in the Bill, but because there is no such Act, the marine environment lacks protection, as the Government have recognised. The Government should recognise that lack and put something in the Bill to achieve what the noble Baroness is getting at.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-11_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Baroness said, the matter was discussed at some length in Committee. I see no reason to change the Government's position. The noble Baroness is attempting to use somewhat tendentious definitions of words that are used in international legislation to achieve the aim of avoiding irreversible harm to the marine environment. The procedures that we are adopting will achieve that, and we cannot stretch the definitions in the way that she suggests.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para14"></a>The noble Baroness obviously has an aversion to the word "exploitation". If I might venture to say so, she seems to regard it in a rather Marxist way as always being likely to be damaging, unless otherwise stated. In fact, the term "exploitation", in English or French&#151;which is what the United Nations treaty is written in&#151;would undoubtedly mean simply taking advantage of, using or operating in a way which made use of natural resources. Whether that was damaging or not depends on the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para15"></a>There is also a problem in the noble Baroness's definition of what "damage" and "diminish" actually mean. Clearly, no development of this nature can be entirely impact-free. Certainly, almost any wind farm at sea is bound to change, to some extent, the marine environment. It might diminish the wildlife or it might, in the short or long term, attract a wider range of biodiversity and species into the area&#151;that is likely to <P>


<a name="column_631"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 631</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be the long-term effect. Whether people regard that as harmful and negative or beneficial depends on a rather subjective view. Therefore, I do not think it is very easy to use the definition that the noble Baroness has chosen because there is no construction of wind farms at sea that will not have some effect on the marine environment.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para16"></a>In addition to the effect on the marine environment and ecology, there is the overall impact of creating this development in the first place. The whole objective is, after all, environmental&#151;to provide non-carbon fuel in order not to diminish the planet's resources as well as not to pump carbon into the atmosphere and to heat up the planet. The net environmental gain of the successful exploitation of wind farm possibilities is therefore likely to be substantial. The same would be true of wave and tidal operations. Therefore, it is not just the immediate and local environmental effect which has to be taken into account but the total environmental effect of the whole operation. I do not think that that is covered by the noble Baroness's definition.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para17"></a>The Government's approach to such propositions is through the safeguards of the strategic environmental assessment process and through the site-specific environmental impact assessment of any proposed development application. That will look at the impact on marine life and on any micro-climate as well as the overall environmental effects and benefits of the scheme. That will be a rigorous process and it will not depend on definitions which are somewhat different from the dictionary definitions of "exploration" and "exploitation". The developers will be forced to go through such a process before the Government approve any particular site development or designation of a zone or area.
<P>

<a name="40323-11_para18"></a>While I utterly sympathise with the need in this process to ensure that renewable energy projects do not have an unreasonable, disproportionate, negative effect on the local environment, our procedures are in place to avoid that. That is a better way of tightening up control over such developments than attempting a definition, as the noble Baroness suggests.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, for her support and her questions to the Minister again.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-12_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40323-12_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 176A and 176B are intended to remedy a problem, which seems to have been unnoticed by the Government and their advisers, in relation to the application of the criminal law to offshore renewable energy installations.
<P>

<a name="40323-12_para6"></a>Clause 77 provides that, by Order in Council, the criminal law may be applied to any actions which take place around an offshore renewable energy installation or within a renewable safety zone. Under subsections (6) and (7), liability may attach personally to directors and officers of companies for any criminal offence, whatever its nature, which is committed on the installation or in the safety zone.
<P>

<a name="40323-12_para7"></a>The effect of this must be to widen the scope of the criminal law. It applies to all criminal offences which must include some in respect of which directors and officers would not otherwise be personally liable. Moreover, this widening will apply in such a way as to establish a legal inconsistency between certain offences committed within the jurisdiction, to which personal liability may not attach, and those committed in a safety zone, to which it will always attach.
<P>

<a name="40323-12_para8"></a>We support the application of the normal criminal law to renewable installations and the area around them. However, there is no obvious policy rationale&#151;at least, none that has been explained by the Government in consultation&#151;either for widening the scope of the criminal law or for creating the difference in approach between the onshore and offshore regimes.
<P>

<a name="40323-12_para9"></a>In our view, both subsections (6) and (7) of Clause 77 should be subject to the proviso that they are applicable if, and only if, the person in question would have been guilty of the offence, and therefore liable to be proceeded against, if the offence in question had taken place within a part of the United Kingdom. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the provisions in this part of the Bill relating to the criminal law are modelled on those in the Petroleum Act 1998, which itself consolidates a similar provision in the Oil and Gas <P>


<a name="column_633"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 633</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>(Enterprise) Act 1982. There is therefore quite a long history of treating offshore activities in this way. Quite a lot of modern legislation includes provisions for officers of corporate bodies to be punished when it can be proved that they had consented to or connived at criminal behaviour by the company or were negligent in allowing that to so happen.
<P>

<a name="40323-12_para10"></a>I understand the point that the noble Lord is making, but there is a corporate responsibility here. It is largely corporations which will be operating in these renewable energy zones and on the installations to be established there. Officers of corporate bodies have a responsibility if it can be proven that they consented to or connived at the commission of an offence. The noble Lord is right that the provision extends the liability for an offence; it does not extend the definition of an offence as compared with onshore, but it is done in a way which has applied in the offshore petroleum industry since the 1980s for the reason that, by and large, what happens on oil and gas platforms and, likewise, offshore wind farms, is a corporate responsibility.
<P>

<a name="40323-12_para11"></a>That seems to us sensible; I am not sure that the noble Lord has convinced me otherwise, although I understand his point. However, I am not at this stage inclined to accept that we should treat this differently from the very analogous situations that exist elsewhere offshore.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Lord's response. The fact that there is a similar clause in previous legislation is not a conclusive response to the arguments I have put forward on behalf of the Opposition in support of the amendments.
<P>

<a name="40323-12_para12"></a>We shall have differential criminal law regimes for directors of companies: one onshore and the other offshore. In my submission, that is inherently undesirable. All the Government have to do is to agree with our amendments. There will then be a level playing field for directors whether or not the offences are committed inland or outside the territorial waters. Why is that such a difficult pill for the noble Lord to swallow?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-12_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I am not entirely sure that I am in order in responding at this point but I shall do so as long as we do not make a habit of it.
<P>

<a name="40323-12_para13"></a>Presumably the same logic applies with petroleum platforms. Offshore it is extremely unlikely that individuals will commit offences unless they are under the broad jurisdiction of a company which either owns, is operating or is a subcontractor on that site. Onshore there is clearly a high probability that someone is acting entirely on his own whether or not he is a company employee. Therefore, one is dealing with a situation of corporate responsibility for the site, part of the site or part of the operation on the site in a way that does not apply on land. It is not unreasonable, therefore, that there is some additional <P>


<a name="column_634"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 634</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsibility&#151;not additional extension of the criminal law&#151;on the people who are in charge of the operations on that site.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-12_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Kingsland: </B>   Additional responsibility means an extension of the criminal law since we are talking only about criminal obligations in this case. I am most grateful to the noble Lord for engaging in a discussion about this matter. I do not propose to pursue it to a vote today but I shall bring it back at Third Reading.

<A NAME="40323-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>   moved Amendment No. 184B:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-13_para6"></a><P>

 "INTERFERENCE WITH SAFETY OF NAVIGATION
<br>
 In assessing whether installations and the safety zones around them present a danger to navigation, the Secretary of State shall ensure that their cumulative effects on safety of navigation are taken fully into account."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-13_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment relates to interference with the safety of navigation, which is an issue that we have already considered in some detail. In the course of earlier debates, the Minister recognised the importance of taking into account the cumulative effect of these wind farms. There may be a series of them dotted along a sea route requiring ships to divert a number of times. In dealing with some of these issues, the Minister said that the Coast Protection Act would be the main legislative tool that the Government would use to protect safety and, for proposed installations within the territorial waters of England and Wales, developers will also be able to seek approval in applying the order under the Transport and Works Act 1992.
<P>

<a name="40323-13_para8"></a>Experience under round one indicates that this legislative route, while expensive, will be attractive to developers since it is possible to extinguish rights to navigation under this arrangement. Furthermore, this procedure does not cover danger to navigation. As I understand it, it does not refer to dangers to navigation or to the safety of navigation and it expressly excludes the requirement to obtain the consent of the Secretary of State under the Coast Protection Act. Consequently, using the Transport and Works Act route, there is no statutory requirement for wind farms causing a hazard to navigation to be addressed. If that route is taken there is a serious weakness in the legislative machinery to protect against wind farms causing a hazard to navigation. Therefore safety could be compromised. We therefore believe that the amendment is necessary. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, we have had a substantial debate on safety issues. During the course of that debate, I indicated that the Government recognise the importance of the issue and the salience of the point that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, raised. We regard it as essential that when the Government are considering the impact of wind farms on the safety of navigation, installations are considered separately and the cumulative effect is taken into account. We accept that point entirely.
<P>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 639</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-14_para0"></a>On round two wind farms, I give the noble Lord the firm assurance that the cumulative impact of wind farm sites in neighbouring locations will be a very important factor in deciding whether development consent can be given for such projects. This will apply whether the developer seeks consent under the Coast Protection Act, to which the noble Lord referred, or the Transport and Works Act 1992. Developers will need to work closely with each other and with shipping interests to understand these cumulative impacts. We shall ensure that that is done. The regulatory framework in the Bill is already flexible enough to take account of cumulative impact so, although I hear what the noble Lord has said, the position of the Government is that we do not think that this amendment is necessary. We regard the noble Lord's point as very important and I reassure the House that we have it covered in the way in which the legislation is framed. 

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I note what the Minister says but he has not replied to my point about the danger of developers being able to bypass the normal procedures under other legislation, to which he referred. We believe that this is a danger and that this amendment would reinforce the need for the cumulative effect to be taken into account and for these procedures to be dealt with adequately. In the light of the Minister's reply, and the point made by my noble friend Lord Greenway, I feel we should seek the opinion of the House on this issue.

<a name="40323-14_para3"></a>Clause 91 [Extinguishment etc. of public rights of navigation]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins </B>   moved Amendment No. 185:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Leave out Clause 91.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-14_para4"></a><P>

<a name="40323-14_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we move into somewhat calmer waters. The clause with which this amendment is concerned deals with the rights of navigation. Some of the points which are affected by that have been touched upon by the Minister. I have one or two questions and seek to clarify his remarks.
<P>

<a name="40323-14_para6"></a>This clause is concerned with declarations extinguishing public rights of navigation. In his earlier remarks, the Minister pointed out that we were concerned with energy zones, within which apparently there were to be specific projects for approval. But there also seems to be an intermediate stage which the Crown Estate has gone ahead and published for stage two sites. To put it another way, there is the overall zone, which the Minister referred to, which on the map provided by the Crown Estate is a dotted line covering a very large area. Within that there are a number of specific sites, and then finally one comes to an actual approval of the construction of the wind farm by a particular developer.
<P>

<a name="40323-14_para7"></a>At what stage are the public rights of navigation extinguished and over what area? That is clearly not over the entire renewable energy resources area and must be for the particular development. But is it proposed that public rights of navigation will be <P>


<a name="column_642"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 642</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extinguished within what the Crown Estate calls a "site"? What puzzled me about the map which it provided, was that alongside the particular sites there were the names of particular developers. Those sites cover a larger area than I imagine the actual farm itself would cover. To what extent have decisions already been reached by the Crown Estate or by the Minister as to which of those sites should be allocated to particular developers? If decisions have been made, is it proposed to extinguish the public rights of navigation in the intermediate stage?
<P>

<a name="40323-14_para8"></a>The other problem which has arisen is in relation to the United Nations treaty and the Article 60 obligation. As for extinguishing public rights of navigation, presumably that will affect the shipping routes which normally would be protected under the UN treaty.
<P>

<a name="40323-14_para9"></a>We seem to be concerned with territorial waters in their widest extent, the 200-mile limit, which I understand the Government do not propose to declare. Within that there is, apparently, an intermediate renewable energy zone. If the Government are to extinguish public rights of navigation of international ships, we are not clear why they consider that they do not need to put on the face of the Bill a common regime regarding the renewable energy zone. I am not sure that I have explained that clearly; it is extremely complicated.
<P>

<a name="40323-14_para10"></a>What I seek to establish is to what extent&#151;we can return to the matter at a later stage in the Bill&#151;an intermediate stage exists where renewable energy zones are likely to affect or extinguish public rights of navigation. The Government still take the view that the relevant matter does not need to be put on the face of the Bill as it is covered by the treaty. However, the intermediate stage does not seem to be covered by the treaty. I hope that the Minister can clarify the position or perhaps we can have a further discussion on it. Serious points relating to the treaty and the extinguishing of international rights are not entirely clear at this stage. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, if my noble friend has concerns after the long debate that we have had, I am bound to say that I must support him. I was beginning very much to hope that the only places where rights of navigation would be extinguished were in those areas that were either covered by construction or by the buffer zone necessary to protect that construction. If there is any question in my noble friend's mind&#151;which there obviously is&#151;that the extinguishment of navigation rights will go any wider than that, it seems to me that we are in considerable difficulties and very great trouble. I await the Minister's clarification of the point with great interest. It is absolutely essential that we know precisely which part of&#151;I was going to say "ground", but I suppose that I should refer to the sea bed&#151;the sea bed this all rests on.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, I should like to support my noble friend Lord Higgins. I too am concerned about the map produced by the Crown Estates. It seems to indicate that sites have been allocated for wind farms that will affect our obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). <P>


<a name="column_643"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 643</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I mentioned this on an earlier amendment. I refer to the international right of passage. No country is allowed to impede that. Looking at the map in front of me, it appears that we have already taken decisions that will impede the international right of passage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   My Lords, I have not had any advance notice of this matter. There is no reason why I should have. It is entirely my fault for not having informed myself of it. Therefore, I have not studied UNCLOS carefully. However, from my recollection of first principles, I am not entirely sure that the international rights of innocent passage and the rather different international rights through straits depend on UNCLOS. I think that they may depend on what one might almost describe as the common law maritime law of the sea, which UNCLOS will to some extent, perhaps wholly, have confirmed.
<P>

<a name="40323-15_para0"></a>However, I have pondered the question of whether one could build a wind farm which would narrow the Straits of Dover. I wonder what the answer to that would be in terms of international rights. I came to the conclusion that that possibly would be all right so long as one left something for international ships to pass through. However, one could not extinguish their rights of passage. If they choose to thread their way through a wind farm, I shall not say, "good luck to them", but I think that one would have to establish an exclusion zone for the purposes of preventing pollution. You can do that under the merchant shipping Act. However, the measure that we are discussing seems to me to be an entirely new concept. I should be much happier if it could be explained to me how the United Kingdom Parliament can designate areas over which there is at the moment an international right of innocent passage or an international right of free passage through straits. If that can be done, that is very interesting, but I should like to know how.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   My Lords, following what the noble and learned Lord has just said, with regard to the Straits of Dover I believe that there is, indeed, a planned installation of wind turbines somewhere off Ramsgate, which is fairly close to the English Channel and the Straits of Dover. However, as I see it, the problem would not arise in that regard because we would already have properly designated separation lanes in the Straits of Dover that are sacrosanct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, I should like to ask a question in this regard. Do the rights of navigation referred to in the clause that we are discussing include rights of navigation on the part of fishing vessels? If a zone were declared, could fishing vessels be excluded from the whole of it under the clause? I may return to the matter on a later amendment in connection with the issue of compensation. However, I should like to know whether fishing vessels are covered by the clause that we are currently debating.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, this is an important provision in the legislation and I wish to resist its <P>


<a name="column_644"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 644</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>removal strongly. As the legislation stands it is not entirely clear whether a consent for the construction and operation of a generating station under Section 36 of the Electricity Act extinguishes public rights of navigation. The result for a developer is that although he has a consent from the Government to build, say, a wind farm in territorial waters, he is laid open to the possibility of being sued in the courts for causing a public nuisance because the wind farm is interfering with rights of navigation. This situation is plainly not conducive to attracting investment in offshore renewable energy projects. Investors need certainty before they will commit the significant funds needed to bring a wind farm to fruition. They will need to know how they stand.
<P>

<a name="40323-15_para1"></a>The concept of extinguishing the right of navigation is not novel. An order under the Transport and Works Act 1992 can include provision to extinguish rights of navigation and several offshore wind farm developers have already used this legislation to gain development consent for their projects. What we want to achieve by this provision is to make the Electricity Act more appropriate for offshore generating stations. Without this power developers will be forced to use the Transport and Works Act for projects in territorial waters if they want to extinguish the right of navigation. This Act was not drafted with offshore wind farms in mind. We would have lost a real opportunity to bring the Electricity Act up to date and to make it more appropriate to marine projects. I make those comments to set the scene in terms of the purpose of the clause.
<P>

<a name="40323-15_para2"></a>The point needs to be borne in mind that the power to extinguish the right of navigation applies only to the physical structure itself. I believe that that was one of the key questions that noble Lords have asked. It does not extend to any of the waters around the installation, so that, if they are small enough, vessels can continue to navigate through a wind turbine array, so long as a safety zone is not in place which may prevent their entry. Fishing vessels may well be small enough to navigate through such areas whereas vessels with a much greater draught may not be able to do so.
<P>

<a name="40323-15_para3"></a>It is probably an appropriate moment to clear up another question. The proposal here relates to the extinguishment of domestic public rights of navigation, not international rights. It is not intended to touch upon international rights. Public rights will be extinguished out only to the limits of the territorial sea and not beyond in the renewable energy zone, which addresses the question noble Lords have understandably asked.
<P>

<a name="40323-15_para4"></a>We recognise that extinguishing a public right of navigation is a serious matter and that there must be a robust, fair and open process in place for the Secretary of State to decide whether the issue of a declaration is justified. Clause 91 amends Section 36 of the Electricity Act, so that the well tried and tested process for deciding whether to grant a consent for the construction and operation of a generating station will also apply to applications for a declaration extinguishing rights of navigation. There will be full consultation with all stakeholders with an interest in the matter, and there is provision for the holding of a public inquiry where the <P>


<a name="column_645"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 645</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>issues raised are of particular importance. I emphasise that the Electricity Act process has stood the test of time well, and it seems to be the best way of ensuring that this process is one that would be conducted in the interest of all parties and stakeholders, in the fairest possible way.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, can he help me? I fully accept the point about international passage on the high seas. But am I wrong in thinking that there is a right of innocent passage through our territorial waters? In so far as this is merely confined to the actual site of the turbine, clearly there is no problem. If it goes further than that, may there be a problem?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, it is the site of the installation that we are trying to ensure is properly protected, and I would not want to get the two things confused. That is the exclusion I have referred to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew8"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, can he help me? I understood that within each wind farm there was going to be a safety zone, from which all vessels were going to be prohibited. The Minister now seems to lead me to believe that it is only for the structure of the turbine that there might be&#151;not automatically, but might be&#151;a safety zone as well. Could he clarify that for me?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, in response to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, there might be a safety zone. The safety considerations at stake will be the way that is determined. I do not want to speculate about much, because I do not think it is particularly helpful to do so, but you could imagine a site in which the individual wind turbines were very well spaced out, and some where they were much closer together. I can imagine that different kinds of considerations about whether it was navigable in one circumstance, rather than the other, would apply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-15_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, it follows from what the Minister has just said in response to my noble friend Lord Caithness that a safety zone could be declared which would exclude fishermen from what might well be very valuable traditional fishing grounds. Could he confirm that this is indeed the case?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo040323/text/40323-16.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, I do confirm it. I think it was me who confirmed it when asked a question in Committee as well. I recall saying on that occasion&#151;no doubt someone will check the record to make sure that I did&#151;that the establishment of one of these zones, for the purposes of making sure that we could generate clean energy, could not be achieved with absolutely no conceivable downside. That would be a fiction. I certainly would not wish to be party to a fiction of that kind. As I said in Committee, safety will be the forefront issue. The exclusion of shipping, including small shipping, must be a safety judgment in the interests of the mariners.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, before the Minister sits down, can he help me? I hope I am not out of order, <P>


<a name="column_646"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 646</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>because he has described the safety issue and that is the one I want to keep to. If my memory serves me correctly&#151;I am sure that the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#151;my understanding in Committee was that while the wind farms were being constructed you would have a safety zone. Once they were constructed, there would be no safety zone. I am a little confused by the contribution he has just made because it seems to differ from what we were doing at Committee. I do apologise, because I do not normally come back but I think we need clarification.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Howie of Troon: </B>   My Lords&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, this is Report stage of the Bill. It is right, of course, that questions can be addressed on the issue of clarification. But we cannot have the Minister subjected to cross-examination after he has completed his speech as if this were Committee stage, because it clearly is not. Certainly, the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, has asked a question and she should be replied to. But that really ought to be the end of this particular part of the deliberations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, while I have the opportunity to reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, this clause does not deal with safety specifically. I was trying to illustrate a point by making reference to the different sorts of circumstances that might arise. It is certainly one of the circumstances that, while construction is going on, a safety zone might well be a sensible and necessary precaution. It may also be the case that after construction is completed, were it to be a completely non-safely navigable area, that that might continue. In general, that is not expected to be the case.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Lawson of Blaby: </B>   My Lords, there is just one point of clarification that might be of help to this House. As former Secretary of State for Energy I have a lot of nostalgic feelings towards all energy Bills and such issues. The Minister referred to the Transport and Public Works Act, and the provisions there which up until now have had to be used for this purpose. Could he clarify in precisely what way the provisions to be inserted in this Bill go beyond the provisions in the Transport and Public Works Act?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, the belief is&#151;I think this is probably the best way I can explain it&#151;that an amendment to the Electricity Act would make it a great deal easier and more transparent than other available routes. That has been the experience of the industry in making applications more generally. That is the reason that this change is being contemplated: it involves transparency, simplicity and greater relevance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I think I am in order in coming in at this point. Unfortunately, we have the next amendment on the Order Paper which relates to the following clause, on which the same issues will arise. No doubt the noble Lord, Lord Howie of Troon, will be able to raise his point then if he wishes to do so. <P>


<a name="column_647"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 647</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It is very inhibiting to have a Report stage rule, but I certainly believe it is right that we should seek to adhere to it.
<P>

<a name="40323-16_para0"></a>I am now somewhat puzzled by what the Minister has said. I am not asking him to reply to it again, but perhaps he might like to do so on the next amendment. We have got a clause here, as well as the following clause, about extinguishing public rights of navigation. But I am now not at all clear what sort of area&#151;I cannot find another word for it&#151;the Government are proposing to extinguish the rights in. From what has just been said, it seems to involve just the turbines themselves. I would have thought it would normally include the safety zone. Or am I to understand that you can have a safety zone within which the public rights of navigation will not be extinguished? Will it apply to some sizes of vessels and not others? I am not in the least bit clear about that. The other thing is, over how large an area beyond the safety zone is the public right of navigation going to be extinguished? For example, will it be extinguished within the relative territorial limits of the sites set out in the Crown Estate's documentation?
<P>

<a name="40323-16_para1"></a>Finally, during the day we have had a great deal of discussion about the Transport and Works Act. I am nowhere near as familiar with that Act&#151;indeed, I am totally unfamiliar with it&#151;as is my noble friend Lord Lawson. It would seem that the existence of that Act is a positive disadvantage to this legislation. It provides a loophole whereby developers can get around the restraints that would otherwise be put on them&#151;albeit a more expensive option.
<P>

<a name="40323-16_para2"></a>Would the Government care to consider whether the operation of the Transport and Works Act ought to be excluded from the operation of this legislation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, I shall deal with the last point first. We are not disapplying the Transport and Works Act, so developers could, if they wished, continue to use it. It is a matter for them if they wish to use it in relation to projects in territorial waters. We are giving developers a choice. For reasons I gave earlier, we expect that they will want to use the Electricity Act, which will prove more efficacious for their purposes. The Transport and Works Act process requires a lot of input by lawyers and the costs to developers are estimated to be much higher by using that route. The Electricity Act process is a good deal more streamlined, but it is robust at the same time. Far be it from me to wish to interfere with the legitimate earnings of the legal profession, but it may well be that one or two people will feel that it is as effective and a tiny bit more economical, which would be helpful.
<P>

<a name="40323-16_para3"></a>On the question of which area, I had hoped that I had been clear. I apologise if I have not been sufficiently clear. The safety zones are designed to exclude the passage of shipping for reasons described in exchanges between myself and the noble Baroness, Lady Byford. The area of installation is the subject of this clause and I have described the arrangements contained in it. The public right of navigation will be extinguished for the installation only. I had hoped that I had made that clear. This is to deal with the problems of claims in law for <P>


<a name="column_648"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 648</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nuisance, to which a developer would become liable if he did not have the protection. Safety zones, if applied, may stop navigation through them. I said "may" because we said that it was conditional. However, they do not need to distinguish the public rights of navigation. It is merely a practical matter to exclude vehicles under particular circumstances because there is no legal concern relating to the nuisance of the safety zone and the kind of risks that might be run. That is the distinction which the clause tries to make clear and I hope that in this effort I have made it somewhat clearer, too.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, in the light of the Minister's reply, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40323-16_para4"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-16_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40323-16_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, happily this may be the shortest contribution to the debate. In Committee, the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, made a drafting amendment which considerably improved the drafting of Clause 91(1) in regard to the rights of navigation which might be extinguished. I thank her for having done so. The amendment seeks simply to make the same changes to Clause 92(3) and to make the Bill consistent. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-16_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister. Success has been slow in certain parts of the Bill, but the provision was a nonsense. I am grateful to the Minister for putting the matter right.
<P>

<a name="40323-16_para8"></a>On Question, amendment agreed to.

<a name="40323-16_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40323-16_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this is a probing amendment. It is a question of tidying up one or two points. The Minister's previous reply was helpful in a number of respects and we will need to consider carefully what was said.
<P>

<a name="40323-16_para11"></a>Perhaps I may clarify one point. Suddenly the Electricity Act has appeared in our debates&#151;at least during my presence. If a developer goes through the Electricity Act process, are there sufficient powers for the Secretary of State to prevent a development taking place which would endanger the safety of navigation? Although there seems to be some disagreement between the two sides, we understand that there is a loophole under the Transport and Works Act. It is now suggested that developers might alternatively use the Electricity Act. In the context of wind farms, which presumably were not necessarily envisaged at the earlier stage, might that not be another loophole which one would want to cover? I beg to move.

<a name="column_649"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 649</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, having disallowed further questions in the previous debate, I hope that he will allow us to have our say in this one.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para0"></a>I gather that under Clause 87(3), safety zones can be declared by the Secretary of State, or an applicant may apply to the Secretary of State and he can then choose whether or not to declare a safety zone. If the application is made and the Secretary of State decides not to grant the safety zone and an accident happens within that area, who will be liable? Will it be the applicant for the safety zone&#151;the person who developed the renewable energy installations&#151;or will it be the Secretary of State who decided not to grant a safety zone?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-17_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, at page 73, line 47, the phrase "relevant waters" appears. Given what the Minister said on the previous amendment, I presume that "relevant" means territorial waters. That is what the Minister concerned himself with on the last amendment.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para1"></a>As regards Amendment No. 187, what happens to the right to navigation in waters outside the 12-mile territorial waters but inside the renewable energy zone? That point was not covered. How will the rights of navigation be extinguished to prevent structures being hit in those waters?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, I want to return to the question of fishing vessels. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, in his last couple of interventions left me more confused than when he started. I am no great expert in offshore fishing, but as I understand it one of the common methods of fishing is that the trawler trawls a substantial net behind it hoping to catch the fish. They are then pulled in and hauled up on to the deck. I am not going to get involved in the common fisheries policy or the conservation of marine resources&#151;both of which are hugely important subjects&#151;but I want to know what is the impact of this clause on fishermen coming out from an established fishing port and wanting to fish in what may well be traditional fishing grounds?
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para2"></a>As I understood the Minister, he said that the only exclusion zone is several metres broad and covers the pillar on which the turbine sits, and that people are excluded only from the part of the sea which is occupied by each wind turbine standing on its pillar. But then came the question of how big the extension would be after taking into account the safety zones. Looking at this from the point of view of a trawler fisherman, I can tell the noble Lord that there is no way that a fisherman trailing nets perhaps 100 metres or more behind a boat will go anywhere near those places. In fact, he will be excluded from fishing anywhere within an area where many wind turbines are installed. In a sense, that will be the case irrespective of the area of the sea&#151;the circle drawn on the chart&#151;where the individual turbines are located. That is an important point.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para3"></a>Will the declarations made under this clause cover a wider area so that it is perfectly clear where people may not go once the wind farm has been established, or are we playing around with small circles on a chart as the <P>


<a name="column_650"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 650</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>only areas from which vessels are to be excluded? If the latter is the case, that is nonsensical because it bears absolutely no relation to what seamen, fishermen or anyone else would do in the circumstances. If that is all that is involved, one seriously wonders what is the point of doing it.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para4"></a>The Minister seems to be saying that, while the wind farms are being built and once they are established, it is important that there is an area around them from which navigation is excluded, presumably to ensure that the wind farms continue to generate their renewable energy so that we can all keep the lights on. That is the object of the exercise and it will not be helped if fishermen travel too close to the turbines, their nets become tangled and everything must be stopped while they are untangled. I cannot believe that the clause is directed only at the circles on the charts; there must be a significant area around the turbines, such as the safety zone, which my noble friend mentioned during debate on the previous amendment. I believe that this is the opportunity for Ministers to clarify the matter so that we know what the two clauses mean.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry if this is becoming repetitious but it is a fundamental point. I thought that we had reached the point where a wind farm was a wind farm and shipping was excluded. From what he said at the end of the debate on the previous amendment, the Minister seemed to envisage what I can only describe as a dispersed wind farm from which shipping might not be excluded. However, it seems that if there is to be a series of individual points, as my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding has just enunciated, an even worse hazard for shipping will be created.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para5"></a>It is one thing to have a defined area where one knows that wind turbine generators are spaced at 200, 300 or 400-metre intervals, surrounded by a buffer zone, from which shipping is excluded; it is entirely another to say, "We'll have a turbine generator here and a turbine generator a mile away and another a mile away and navigation can continue through that". From the point of view of those who are to erect these installations, separating the generators to such an extent, with all the additional transmission costs that would be involved in trying to link the turbines, would appear impossible and an idea in which they would not be interested. In sheer practical terms, a wind farm must be just that: it must be as tight and as dense as is sensible and practical. However, that of course makes it a potentially greater hazard to shipping.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para6"></a>If we enter a debate about shipping accessing these areas, how shall we draw the line? It is one thing for a 50-foot shipping vessel to enter the area and pass through it, but will there be a distinction between that vessel, many of the medium-sized freighters which go through the North Sea or even, heaven help us, a supertanker? Heaven forbid that a supertanker should ever get anywhere near such an installation. However, in some sea conditions, who can say what might <P>


<a name="column_651"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 651</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>happen? I know that, in theory, it should not, and my guess is that a vessel would hit the bottom before it hit the wind turbine.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para7"></a>However, I do not believe that we can begin to distinguish between one type of ship and another. Either one prevents navigation, including fishing vessels, which seems to be the practical option, or there is a free-for-all. The Minister paid specific attention to the safety issue and said that that would be the driver. If safety is the driver, shipping should be excluded from a wind farm, whether it is a deep-sea or inshore installation or wherever it is. That is the beginning and end of it. At the end of his remarks, the Minister left me very confused as to whether or not that would be the situation. He said that the exclusion zone would be in place only during the construction period. I believe that I am right in saying that. But if that is the case, that will create huge problems in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   My Lords, I, too, would like to see this uncertainty cleared up because I know that it has been a subject of concern for the yachting authorities. Such people are quite used to sailing close to all kinds of obstructions in the water and they feel that they may be unnecessarily penalised if they are totally excluded from the areas surrounding some wind farms where, I understand, the turbines will be quite far apart. Also, I believe that the height of the turbine blades has been raised so that most yachts can get underneath them.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para8"></a>I also want to confirm the surmisal of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, with regard to trawling. A couple of weeks ago, a meeting took place of the All-Party Parliamentary Maritime Group that was very well attended. If my memory serves me correctly, the fishermen present stated explicitly that they would not trawl within the site of the wind farms because it would be too dangerous.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-17_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, fishermen do not only trawl; they set lobster pots. It would be extremely difficult to service a wind farm if it were full of lobster pots.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-17_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Donaldson of Lymington: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may reminisce for one moment. I was asked by the previous Administration to conduct an inquiry into the best methods of command and control and state intervention in salvage projects or other situations in which there was a potential for pollution. I had the happy idea that we could adapt the whole of merchant shipping to platforms, which is what we were considering, by simply redefining a ship as including a platform. However, I found at once that that was unacceptable to the DTI, which said, "Oh no. We have our own regime".
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para9"></a>The essence of my conclusions, which were accepted by the government of the day and by the present Government, was that one man must be in charge whenever an incident occurs. Not only should one man be in charge but Ministers should keep out. They must either back him or sack him. That was obviously a problem. But as the DTI insisted on having its own <P>


<a name="column_652"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 652</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>SOSREP, I did at least receive an undertaking that the same man would be appointed by both Secretaries of State.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para10"></a>However, the underlying point was that there was no instinct for joined-up government; there was a turf-war element&#151;perhaps not at ministerial level but lower down. I wonder to what extent this legislation has been discussed with the Department for Transport at a level rather lower than ministerial. It is at that lower level that people are aware of the nuts and bolts of the problems.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-17_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lord Higgins asked whether there is a loophole in the Electricity Act and whether it would be possible to prevent a development from taking place if it were not in a suitable place, which would affect our discussions on shipping access. I have one or two questions to ask the Minister.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para11"></a>On the renewables obligation and the way in which the Government are trying to reduce the CO2 emissions, can the Minister indicate how many wind farms and individual wind turbines the Government have in mind? The answer could make a huge difference to our present discussions. If there are to be three pockets, that is one matter, but I suspect from the lobbying that I have received from those who are concerned about productivity on wind farms, that many more will be needed than was originally anticipated. I do not know what evaluation the Government have carried out in advance of presenting the Bill, but I would be interested to know.
<P>

<a name="40323-17_para12"></a>On the existing wind farms, were there any difficulties or dissatisfaction when previous Bills were enacted? The Government have an understanding of what has happened already with those wind farms. Returning to my noble friend's original question, was the existing legislation good enough, strong enough and sufficient to undertake what the Government are trying to do under this Bill, or is the previous experience partly the reason for greater clarification in this Bill? I would be grateful if the Minister could answer those questions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I owe the House and particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, an apology. I was not seeking to cut off an extremely fruitful and interesting debate. I actually have a very clear answer to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, and for some ridiculous reason I thought that no one else was rising to speak. I was eager to respond to him in as positive a way as possible. That was why I rose when I did and in no way was I trying to constrain debate. The House will recognise that being a Whip&#151;ensuring that a self-regulating House stays broadly in order&#151;sometimes can be difficult when one is also responding to a debate. In that respect I made an error and I apologise.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, specifically asked whether the Secretary of State had sufficient power to deal with the situation and to reject or to agree to matters. The answer is in the affirmative. I was eager <P>


<a name="column_653"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 653</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to rise to my feet to assure him of that. Under this Bill we shall ensure that that power exists for the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para1"></a>I have been asked a plethora of questions on the amendment about safety and wind farms. One could almost have forgotten the original amendment. I shall be asking the noble Lord to withdraw his amendment. The simple fact is that we need both clauses in the Bill. I do not want to repeat all the arguments in relation to preceding amendments, but I can give the noble Lord a positive answer to his most trenchant and searching question. On that basis, I hope that he will withdraw the amendment, although I recognise that there is a whole range of questions that require answers. I shall do my best.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para2"></a>I was grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, for introducing the lobster pot fishermen. I had thought that we were all caught up with major vessels. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, quite rightly expressed concern about the fishing interests, with their vast trawling nets that will steer well clear of installations such as wind farms for all the obvious reasons. All noble Lords recognise that there are other fishermen besides deep-sea trawler fishermen. We are eager to preserve the rights of fishermen as best as we can. We are not seeking to limit them. Nor are we seeking to limit competent yachtsmen, people with pleasure craft or anyone who is in control of a vessel that will not cause enormous damage to an installation&#151;one that can extricate itself.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para3"></a>When a safety zone is put in place we would expect a clear indication of who and what must be kept clear. It may not be everyone. It may depend on the safety zone. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, indicated that through her questions. One of her questions related to the number of wind farm installations that we intend to construct. I have some indication of how many turbines there will be in each wind farm. In round one we are expecting about 30 turbines in each wind farm and in round two we are expecting as many as 200, but there will be smaller wind farms as well. There will be a great variety. The upper number may be as great as 200. That will be an extensive complex and it will need governing and a safety zone around it.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para4"></a>In answer to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, we shall certainly require safety precautions while the installations are being erected. A great deal of activity will take place while the large turbines are being installed, but a safety zone can last beyond installation for the necessary protection of shipping if the circumstances indicate that that is necessary. In a large installation of 200 turbines that may be important.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para5"></a>Noble Lords should recognise that we are seeking to meet the principles identified by noble Lords in terms of safety, but we are also seeking to preserve the freedom of the seas as regards access so that these installations do not necessarily restrict that freedom. Some installations will cause small vessels very little problem and it would be wise for others to steer clear of the installations. The definition of a safety zone will indicate whether that is necessary.
<P>


<a name="column_654"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 654</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para6"></a>That is against a background of the range of turbines that may be constructed at any one installation. The difference between the smallest and the largest will be a factor of nearly seven. That is a considerable difference. There is also no immediate prescription on how far away the turbines will be from each other. A range of factors have to be taken into account, but it should be recognised that it would not be sensible to be unduly prescriptive about the nature of the safety zone on the face of the Bill. We need extensive consultation. One theme that has run through the whole of this debate on shipping is that consultation is required to get these matters right.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para7"></a>In the course of the debate two noble Lords spoke about fishing, which is an important element. Fishermen's interests need to be taken into account, including the interest in access. There is also the issue of navigational channels that vessels use. I sought to indicate earlier that major channels of navigation are bound to be protected and that installations will be placed away from those. It is also clear that at times there may be a trade off between the requirement to build a wind farm installation and some change to the pattern that mariners are asked to pursue in setting out from particular locations. In each instance, those kinds of trade off will be the subject of considerable discussion and negotiation. However, one cannot generalise and be prescriptive in any precise way about such matters.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para8"></a>I regret to tell the noble Baroness that I do not have global figures for how many wind farms are proposed. I hope she will recognise that it would be helpful to obtain information about the size of the sea installations. If and when we have an estimate of the number at sea, I shall be only too happy to communicate it to the House in writing. Alternatively, as we still have not quite completed all the stages of the Bill, I may be able to exploit a fertile opportunity to provide that information.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para9"></a>With regard to the point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, there is no public right of navigation in these zones. The public right of navigation is governed by a domestic law that applies particularly to inshore waters, not to these zones. As has been indicated, the zone can extend as far out as the median line away from the coast. However, we recognise&#151;we have debated some of these issues in relation to earlier amendments&#151;our obvious international obligations with regard to the big navigational routes, and we are also well aware of the fact that this country uses the sea for both pleasure and enjoyment and necessary economic activity. We are still a substantial trading nation, carrying on a great deal of trade by cargo-bearing vessels, and we have to protect those interests. It will be necessary to strike a balance between the installation of wind farms and the necessary economic activity enjoyed by all those exploiting rights at sea&#151;

<P>
<A NAME="40323-18_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Caithness: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving way. Will he answer the question that I asked him? For instance, at least 12 major shipping routes pass through the proposed national wind-powered farm coming up to the Humber. That <P>


<a name="column_655"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 655</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>wind farm will be outside the territorial waters, within the renewable energy zone. How do the Government intend to alter the rights of navigation in such a situation? Under what powers can they do that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the granting of applications to develop those positions will be taken into account against the necessary rights of navigation. In distant waters beyond our immediate territorial waters&#151;we have been down this path previously&#151;there exist oil and gas installations in relation to which it is very necessary to consider what may be the navigation rights. I do not have to hand the benefit of enormous maps or statistics. However, like many other noble Lords, I have stood on the beach at Felixstowe or Lowestoft and seen installations that are both visible from the land and in the path of an extensive amount of shipping. That problem had to be addressed when we dealt with the Acts that gave authorisation to the exploitation of North Sea oil and gas, and a similar process is envisaged with regard to this Bill. Because we have in place the Electricity Act, which governs some of those issues, we do not need to write on to the face of the Bill powers that we already enjoy for conditioning such issues.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para10"></a>I can see by the wracked faces opposite that I have not satisfied each and every answer. It will be recognised that this has been not so much a debate as a volley of questions. I have not sought to dodge the questions. The ones that I have missed are those that I am quite incapable of answering, for which noble Lords will have to forgive me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, we are grateful to the Minister for that sympathetic response and for his exploration of the various issues. Some of the questions that have been asked remain unanswered. If necessary, we shall no doubt return to them at Third Reading. However, we appreciate the trouble that the Minister has taken in replying. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para11"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon </B>   moved Amendment No. 188:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 92, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-18_para12"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "COMPENSATION UNDER SECTION 91 OR 92
<br>
(1) If the Secretary of State shall grant any consent or make any declaration under section 91 or 92 which shall interfere with the private or commercial interests of any person or corporation, he or it shall be entitled to compensation.
<br>
(2) Such compensation shall not be limited to the financial or other benefit received by the person in whose favour the consent or declaration is made."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-18_para13"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, when I introduced this amendment in Grand Committee, I began, as I do today, by reminding your Lordships that, in presenting the Bill to Parliament, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, made a statement under Section 19(1)(a) of the Human Rights Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para14"></a>Clauses 91 and 92 provide for the extinguishment and modification of public rights of navigation. The need to extinguish or interfere with those public rights <P>


<a name="column_656"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 656</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is most likely to be caused by the erection of offshore windmills. It is not necessary for us to consider whether any other causes of such extinguishment might arise.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para15"></a>A "public right" is a public right, and a right is a right. To take away such a right is to deprive someone of a possession. That is contrary to the first protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-18_para16"></a>
It is perfectly clear, without any convoluted exercise of interpretation, that to deprive people of public rights of navigation, or to interfere with such rights, is at the same time to deprive them of a possession.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para17"></a>I am not arguing that the measures provided for in these two sections are wrong, unreasonable or unnecessary. On the contrary, it may be perfectly reasonable to have an exclusion zone at sea or to modify access to waterways, or even a harbour, for the public good derived from wind farms as a renewable source of energy. However, it is not right that those who have lost their rights, in whole or in part, should receive no compensation or that they should in effect contribute to the cost. I need say no more about the merits of the amendment, which I submit are self evident.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para18"></a>The Minister's reply was that a public right is not an individual right and that a right of navigation is not a possession. As a kind of long stop back up, he then said that even if such a right were a possession in normal parlance, it did not lead to the inescapable conclusion that compensation should be paid. He concluded his remarks by saying that he did not believe that any normal reading of English or the Convention on Human Rights would lead to any claim for compensation.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para19"></a>My noble friend Lord Kingsland had anticipated and dealt with such an argument in his speech during the debate, when he quoted the case of Beyeler v Italy, which established that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The concept of 'possessions' in Article 1 has an autonomous meaning which is not limited to ownership of physical goods, and is independent from the formal classification of domestic law; certain other rights and interests constituting assets can also be regarded as property rights, and thus as possessions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-18_para20"></a><P>

<a name="40323-18_para21"></a>I should also briefly and in passing mention new subsection (2) which defines the compensation to be paid to the person adversely affected as the loss he suffers, and not the benefit received by the person in whose favour the modification of rights is made. That resolves the problem of calculating compensation, because it puts the onus squarely on the person making the claim.
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para22"></a>Reverting to the legal concept of a right to compensation, first, I do not understand why the Government should insist that other people should have to bear the financial consequences of any benefits given to commercial concerns, such as the owners of wind farms, even if being built for the public good. If the Government have to bear the initial cost, that is something that can be passed on to the generator as part of the licence conditions.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-18_para23"></a>Secondly, with due respect to the Minister, I prefer the legal opinion of my noble friend, with his wide legal experience and knowledge of EC law, to the opinion expressed by the Minister on the last occasion we discussed this matter. I hope that since then the Minister has had the opportunity to further consider the matter with his advisers and will now concede that both law and justice demand that persons suffering from an administrative action of the Secretary of State shall be compensated for what is an act of confiscation of those rights by the state. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-19_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, the amendment enables us to continue with an interesting discussion in Committee. I agree with the noble Baroness that a number of issues are involved. However, I have some misgivings about the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para0"></a>Compensation for the fishing industry is complicated considerably by the effect of the future of the common fisheries policy. Without doubt there will be established no fish zones, a limit on days fished and so forth. It is difficult to see how the compensation clauses in the Bill will fit in with that. That is a question which the Government may want to address.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para1"></a>Furthermore, as a supporter of renewable energy, there are arguments for the establishment of wind farms being in the public interest. The same argument could be run in terms of public access issues. In any case the arguments are not cut and dried. I think that everyone is agreed that the overriding public interest here must be to try to combat climate change.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para2"></a>On 18 March the Government sent a helpful reply on the issue of compensation stating that it would be tailored to each renewable energy installation and that the DTI would work with the fishing industry to establish in what circumstances fishing vessels could safely enter a safety zone, whether on size of vessel, type of fishing activity and so forth. That is a helpful and practical approach.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para3"></a>However, in the penultimate paragraph is an issue which I should like the Minister to clarify. The Government state that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We take the view that the question of compensation whether for the establishment of a safety zone or the operation of the renewable energy installation itself must be one for the commercial judgment of the developer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

Given that the right to have a safety zone rests with the Secretary of State, as I raised with the Minister, and that it is by no means clear that all the applications for a safety zone would be granted, that raises two issues. First, who is liable if the application is not granted? Secondly, if it is granted, the Secretary of State thereby takes responsibility for the fact that that zone is necessary. As I have just quoted, it is up to the commercial judgment of the developer whether to give compensation. Surely, that is very curious and is a matter which in any case should be decided in this House and another place rather than left to the commercial judgment of the developer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, I should like briefly to follow the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, and then <P>


<a name="column_658"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 658</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to come back to the question of fishing. This is why I was rather keen to establish from Ministers that we are not talking just about little rings on the chart but about significant areas, from which fishermen, trawlers in particular, might need to be excluded. One comes back to the question of compensation for that.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para5"></a>I have re-read the debate held in Grand Committee and I understand the point then made by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that this is primarily, or at least in the first stage, a matter as between any fisherman likely to be affected by a proposal put by a developer, and the developers. Indeed, if there were a case for compensation for the fishermen, it would be for the developers to agree that before going ahead.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, also recognised that there may be cases where the developers are reluctant to agree to pay compensation yet where compensation may be necessary. However, my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon failed to get from the Minister what would happen then. The noble Lord said that they might consider that as a reason for refusing consent to the developer. That would be a fairly extreme case. There might well be cases where, because of a traditional fishing ground for fishermen who have fished there for some time, it would be perfectly reasonable to grant permission for the development but to compensate the fishermen for being kept off their traditional fishing grounds.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para7"></a>The reason I raise these issues is because of the substantial report published by the Royal Society of Edinburgh&#151;I declare an interest as an honorary fellow, of which I am very proud&#151;which has considered the whole question of the future of the Scottish fishing industry. As noble Lords will know, the largest proportion of the fishing industry in the United Kingdom is in Scotland. As has been said, and was certainly said in Grand Committee, many other factors currently affect the fishing industry. It is not right for us to go into those today. However, paragraph 11 of Chapter 1 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In the whitefish sector, there has been a collapse in profitability as a result of quota restrictions. Although it catches a diversity of species, its difficulties have been dominated by cod and haddock".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-19_para8"></a>
It goes on to talk about the decline both in landings and employment.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para9"></a>If one is to find in addition an exclusion from what has hitherto been regarded as profitable fishing grounds because of the construction of a wind farm, it seems to me that in those circumstances the Bill should include a right to compensation. As I read my noble friend's amendment, it should cover compensation for that loss of fishing. I should like the Minister to confirm that that would, indeed, be the case and then to try to justify why that should not be put into the Bill. As the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, stated, there is no doubt that the fishing interests are considerably worried by what could happen to them as a result of the substantial expansion of wind farms in their traditional fishing grounds.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para10"></a>It is not enough simply to rest this on the question of getting an agreement between the developer and the relevant fishing industry. The fact of the matter is that it could be a very unequal bargain. The developers are sometimes very large and powerful companies, and the fishermen, as is shown in this report, are often quite small partnerships of individuals who run their boats as individuals. To expect a fair result from that could be very difficult. So, it seems to me that there is a case for writing into the Bill a clear right to compensation for fishermen who are excluded from traditional fishing grounds as a result of developments given under consents by the Secretary of State. I hope that we shall get a very clear statement from Ministers that that will indeed be the case.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Well, my Lords, I am sorry to disappoint the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, again, and indeed the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. My understanding of the legal position, based on what I regard as good legal advice, remains the same.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para11"></a>I shall deal with the basic legal point first. We are talking about a public right of navigation. I shall turn in a moment to the special case of fishermen. The public right of navigation is in normal parlance and in English legal experience not a possession in the normal sense of the word. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in a previous debate was clearly right that possession is an autonomous concept&#151;that is, that Strasbourg can make up its mind at any given time about what is and what is not a possession. But it seems fairly unlikely that a public right of navigation would be regarded as a possession.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para12"></a>As the noble Baroness rightly pointed out, I said that&#151;as lawyers frequently do, although I am not a lawyer&#151;even if I am wrong on that and the public right of navigation were to be found to be a possession, the question would be whether its extinguishment is a deprivation or control of use, which is the more accurate situation in this case, and whether that would amount to a control of use for which compensation would be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para13"></a>On the public right of navigation, we are talking about a restriction, which, if we have a turbine site with 200 or so turbines, relates to quite a sizeable turbine site. I think that there have been some serious problems in the course of today's debate, and to some extent in Grand Committee, between the zone&#151;the site, which is awarded for exploration and other purposes to the contractor&#151;and the actual installation, which would be substantially smaller. Even the biggest installations would leave plenty of space for most navigation channels to be achieved. Clearly, if installations threatened that achievement that would be a major factor in whether the consent was given in the first place. A turbine that was blocking the Humber, the Mersey or whatever, would be a major consideration that the Secretary of State would have to take into account before he granted the consent in the first place. I think the restriction would be pretty limited and therefore the <P>


<a name="column_660"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 660</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>degree of deprivation, which could be established in terms of commercial loss, would be fairly small in relation to the rights of navigation as such.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para14"></a>Therefore, I think it is extremely unlikely that any court would find that any compensation was appropriate in those circumstances. That is why I think the Bill as it stands remains in conformity with the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para15"></a>In relation to the case of fishing, on which we had a separate debate in Grand Committee, the two issues have now become slightly elided. Clearly, a traditional fishing ground may or may not be a main channel of navigation in the sense of commercial traffic from fishermen, whether they are lobster or inshore fishermen. That might actually be a serious problem for them.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para16"></a>In those circumstances, compensation may or may not be appropriate. That situation is essentially no different&#151;to answer the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, and supported by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin&#151;from a road scheme, where if a developer comes forward with a proposition which would effectively cut off the garage from access to the road, normally part of the deal is that compensation is paid to that garage owner, either by giving him a different site or by paying him cash. Those kinds of deals would no doubt be part of the development process. Either there will be a negotiated deal to the fishermen affected, if they could establish a reasonable case, or it could be&#151;as I think I said in response to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, in the earlier debate&#151;that one of the conditions of the consent was that such compensation should be paid.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para17"></a>Should the developer be less than willing to offer such compensation there could be an intervention, which effectively ensured that the developer did pay such compensation. As a former roads Minister, I have to say that that is not unknown in relation to developers of road schemes.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para18"></a>So, I think the principle is well established. It is not written in legislation but is part of development law and practice in general terms. Of course whether or not the fisherman actually suffered a loss is hugely complicated by the wider issues touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, in relation to whether we are restricting fishing for other purposes, and whether or not that could actually be a benign proposition if they have moved away from one fishing site. That would have to be argued case by case. In other words, there could be situations where part of the developing consents, either voluntarily or as a condition of that consent, would be compensation. I do not think it is sensible for the Bill to provide for a general system of compensation.
<P>

<a name="40323-19_para19"></a>I do not think that the limit of the right of navigation would give rise to compensation, and I think the situation of fishermen, and potentially others, would be dealt with in the same way as it is dealt with in other planning situations. I therefore do not think that we would need a scheme of compensation written in these terms into the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-20_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry that the Minister did not see some merit in the amendment. I think that the issue will cause a problem for a lot of people. He was saying that you might be able to appeal to someone. To whom? I do not know to whom you would appeal if you were not happy or content or what you could do about it.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para0"></a>Moreover, this involves not just one installation but an awful lot of them. There might be very many people who will be, if you like, not able to do the things that they want to do. I do not know quite why the Minister has set his face so much against it.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para1"></a>This is not to say we are not for wind farms. Nobody has ever said that. We have always said that it is probably a very good source of energy. The bottom line is that nothing is free; there is no such thing as a free lunch. Some people are going to be very badly disturbed by the idea that compensation is not payable under any circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para2"></a>If there are cases where compensation might be paid, to whom does one actually go? Perhaps the Minister could answer that before I withdraw my amendment. While on my feet, I thank the noble Baroness and my noble friend for intervening in the short debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may take the analogy of a road scheme. In the process of the planning permission being given to the road scheme, the garage owner would object that he was being deprived of his livelihood as a result of that scheme. Either the developer would then offer him cash or an alternative site, or the planning officer, and the planning inquiry if necessary, would say that it is a condition of his going ahead with this scheme that he pays such compensation in some form or the other.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para3"></a>Exactly the same applies in this case. If the fishermen think that they are going to be deprived of their livelihood as a result of the scheme, that will arise during the course of the process of giving consent. Either the developer will recognise that as compared with the developer's potential outlay and profit it would be a relatively small amount that would be payable to the fishermen, and it might be very sensible for him to recognise that on a voluntary basis, or it would be for the Secretary of State in giving that consent to make it subject to paying compensation.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para4"></a>All I am saying is that that could arise in particular situations, but it would not arise in general because of this part of the Bill, which relates to the public right of navigation for everybody. In general, the public right of navigation would not be significantly inhibited, such as to lead to commercial loss of that nature.

<P>

"(2) In section 130(7) of that Act, leave out "(4)" and insert "(4A)"."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-20_para10"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the amendment stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Lyell. Before speaking to the amendment, it may be helpful to the House if I explain why we are not pursuing our concerns about what are now Clauses 10 and 13. It would be preferable for another place to receive and debate the Bill more or less as the Government intended.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para11"></a>Returning to the amendment, its objective is to increase certainty and to keep UK patent law as closely as possible in line with the practice of the European Patent Office. The 1997 Act has a "same effect" proviso, similar to that in Clause 2(5), to bring the UK law into line the that of Europe. It applies to specified sections only. Without the amendment, the proviso will not apply to new subsection (1)(1) of the 1997 Act, although it will apply to others. Slight and unnecessary differences between UK and European law make matters more complicated, and hence more expensive, for UK inventors. The amendment would make it less likely that the laws would diverge.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para12"></a>It might make sense to apply the proviso even more widely. It is not clear how the sections to which it will apply differ from the rest. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-20_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, if I may, I shall preface my remarks with one or two words about Clause 1. The present position is that methods of treatment or diagnosis are not considered to be patentable because they are not, in the words of the 1977 Act, "capable of industrial application". That was regarded as an undesirable position to uphold in the revised European Patent Convention, since medical methods are not patentable in the interests of public health. Thus, Clause 1 makes clear that inventions consisting of such medical methods cannot be patented and conforms with how such methods are dealt with under the revised EPC. The scope of the exclusion will remain the same as that under current provisions.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para13"></a>Clause 1 also concerns the patentability of substances and compositions that are to be used in medical methods. In particular, an invention may comprise taking a known substance, which has already been used in a medical method, and finding a new <P>


<a name="column_663"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 663</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>medical use for that substance. Clause 1 does not extend the availability of patent protection in respect of such inventions, but it does allow such inventions to be patented in a more simple and direct form than is possible at present.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para14"></a>New Section 4A, inserted by Clause 1, is drafted to implement articles 53(c), 54(4) and 54(5) of the revised EPC. I agree with the noble Lord that legal certainty for users is important and that any discrepancy between practice under the EPC and practice in the UK should be minimised. Noble Lords want to ensure that new Section 4A falls within the scope of Section 130(7) of the 1977 Act, but the amendment is unnecessary, because that is already the case.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para15"></a>If noble Lords turn to the Act, they will see that Section 130(7) applies to Sections 2 to 6. It states that the following sections are covered: from 1(1) to (4) and Sections 2 to 6. That would already include new Section 4A, so there is no doubt that the new section will have, as nearly as practicable, the same effect as the corresponding provisions of the revised European Patent Convention.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para16"></a>I trust that, with that explanation, the noble Earl will withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-20_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the Minister's explanation. I am afraid that I did not understand it; I shall read it carefully and take advice, but I doubt that I shall return to that. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

 "INVENTOR CONFIDENTIALITY
<br>
 In section 13 of the 1977 Act (mention of inventor), after subsection (1) there is inserted&#151;
<br>
"(1A) When the applicant for a patent is not the inventor or joint inventor of the invention, the inventor or joint inventor shall have a right not to have their names and addresses mentioned on any patent granted for the invention and shall also have a right not to be so mentioned if possible in any published application for a patent for the invention and, if not so mentioned, a right not to be so mentioned in accordance with rules in a prescribed document.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-20_para19"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the amendment had a good run through in Grand Committee. I fear that, having listened to the Minister explain why the amendment was not being accepted by the Government, I must return to it on Report. For many people, this Bill is somewhat dry&#151;albeit at this relatively late hour, the attendance in the House indicates the dryness of the topic. It is nice to see the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, in his place, adding to the general jollity of the occasion.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para20"></a>Of all the points made and amendments tabled to the Bill, this is the one that goes wider than the dry dust of patent legislation. What we are talking about here is potential threats to the lives of inventors if names and addresses appear on patent applications. We are aware that in applications made by bio-science companies, there is currently a practice, especially by animal welfare extremists, of putting the individual's personal <P>


<a name="column_664"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 664</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>details on the Internet and in other public media. That means that the development of the Internet has significantly increased the risk for inventors who, as we know, have had significant threats to their lives.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para21"></a>My amendment would make a small step to protect those inventors, especially in those the field of bio-science. In every other field, in which there is no possible life-threatening implication to having their name published, most inventors would be delighted to have their name published, because it goes to their credit for their career. So my amendment does not say that no one should have their names and addresses mentioned; it simply gives the right to an inventor who is worried&#151;that is likely to be in the bio-science area&#151;to have his name excluded.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para22"></a>The two arguments made by the Government were that this is of course a finely balanced argument and that those of us who table amendments perhaps make the case too strongly and do not recognise the balance of the argument. That does not mean that we do not think we are right, but we recognise that that argument is finely balanced.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para23"></a>The first argument is that when the Government consulted, they received an adverse response to that suggestion, especially from the patent industry&#151;the agents&#151;who all said that that would make it difficult to perform proper searches and would make their lives much more difficult. That may make their life more difficult, but that is not quite the same as the life-threatening risks to inventors in the small number of cases where the right would be exercised. So I am not persuaded by that argument. I understand it, and I understand what the patent agency community said&#151;it is a perfectly respectable argument; but it does not override the need for the Government to give certain inventors the ability to have that protection. The second argument made is that other countries, especially the United States, do not have this protection. As I understand it, in the United States, the inventor must be the applicant. Again, that is fine, but the inventor does not have to choose to put the application forward. If an inventor who is working for XYZ Ltd or XYZ plc fears that if the application is made, his or her life will be under threat, he or she does not have to do it. So, again, there is a self-protection provision. He or she can say to his or her employer, "Actually, I am not prepared to make this application because I think that if I do, my life could be in danger". Again, I do not think that that is a satisfactory argument. So I urge the Government to think again. I suspect that when the matter went out to consultation, they may have been minded to go down that route.
<P>

<a name="40323-20_para24"></a>The third argument used in this regard&#151;the Minister will no doubt use it&#151;is that the intention is to involve the option for addresses not to be disclosed. That is all very well, but with modern search engines, as I said in Grand Committee, with a name like mine, or that of the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, you would not need to be a nuclear physicist of utmost renown to be able to discover where we live. Smith might be harder, or even Sainsbury&#151;they might get the wrong Sainsbury&#151;but the ability to exclude addresses does not really give the protection that <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-21_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I omitted to put my name to the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, but I fully support his reasoning, and I would support him if he chose to test the opinion of the House.
<P>

<a name="40323-21_para0"></a>We are living in different times. In the 1950s, the noble Earl, my grandfather, used to go home by public transport, and everyone knew where he lived. It is now easy to work out an address, given a name, especially if it happens to be Razzall or Attlee, as mentioned by the noble Lord. It is true that other countries require the name and address of an inventor to be published, but there will be other significant differences in their legal system. They will have other checks and balances to protect the individual. If we stop making the release of the inventor's name compulsory, other countries might consider whether their arrangements need to be reviewed.
<P>

<a name="40323-21_para1"></a>The Minister will point to the requirement of researchers to know the inventor's name. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, suggested that it would be a small number of inventors who would want to keep their names confidential. In Committee, I suggested that it should be possible to give an inventor who requests it an anonymous reference number. Of course, once he starts using that reference number, he must keep using it. Most inventors would want their names to be published&#151;in fact, it is thought that is the reason behind the significant number of patent applications. However, there will always be some who desire privacy. In Grand Committee, the Minister said that the public had a right to know the inventor's name, as part of the deal when the state bestows a right in the form of a patent. It is important to remember that the applicant enjoys the right, not the employee inventor, who normally gets only his usual reward as an employee, except if he is enjoying compensation under Section 40. I support the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-21_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, argued in Committee and again today that there is a balance to be struck between the right of the public at large to have access to information that is relevant to patents, and the right of a more limited group of individuals to have their personal details protected. Other noble Lords supported his view. I have had time to reflect on the arguments put to me in Committee, and I have listened carefully to the points made by the noble Lord today.
<P>

<a name="40323-21_para2"></a>I remain of the view that it will be only of fairly limited benefit to an inventor if he can have his name and address kept confidential in the UK. In many cases, patents will have been applied for in other countries where the inventor's details will be made public. The noble Lord, Lord Razzall, was somewhat dismissive of this point in Committee and again today, on the rather curious argument that you did not have to apply for a patent, but with patents, particularly in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the biosciences, almost the first place you go to is America to do that. That does not stop it from being an obviously relevant point.
<P>

<a name="40323-21_para3"></a>In light of what I have heard from the noble Lords opposite, both today and in Committee, I am prepared to provide the limited benefit that will result from changing UK practice in this respect. We will therefore bring forward an amendment at Third Reading that will ensure that an inventor may have his name and address kept confidential at the patent office in appropriate circumstances. This amendment may simply make one or two minor adjustments to the 1977 Act, which will clear the way for the necessary procedures to be set out in secondary legislation. We will be looking carefully at the drafting necessary to achieve this. It will not become possible for a patent applicant or patent holder to keep his name and address confidential, but we will no doubt wish to consult users of the patent systems before setting out the detailed mechanism in rules. I hope that the noble Lord will accept our undertaking and withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, I am obviously delighted to have made some progress on this point. I thank the Minister for his courtesy in dealing with it, and I am happy to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-21_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Attlee </B>   moved Amendment No. 3:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 4, line 3, leave out from "security;" to end of line 5.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-21_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40323-21_para7"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the objective of this amendment is to make the law clearer and lift vague and unnecessary burdens from industry and its advisers. Under current law, Section 22 of the 1977 Act gives the comptroller power to control publication of information in patent specifications if to do so would be prejudicial to the defence of the realm or the safety of the public. To allow for this, Section 23 provides that patent applicants must not file abroad until six weeks after filing in the UK without special leave. To make life easier, the Bill as amended abolishes the six-week period for all information not prejudicial to national security or the safety of the public. This is most welcome. However, it is not completely clear what is meant by the safety of the public. No doubt it overlaps largely with national security. If it overlaps completely, it is redundant, and if not, what else does it include? Many applications include information that is capable of misuse; for example, toxicity data for drugs or pesticides. The problem is that applicants may have to err on the side of caution and adhere to the Section 23 provisions, thus negating the Government's laudable deregulation aims.
<P>

<a name="40323-21_para8"></a>The Minister will say that the safety of the public has been in the Act since 1978, and has not caused problems. That is a reference to Section 22, the power of the comptroller to restrict the release of information. The comptroller must make the judgement on behalf of the applicant's Section 23 notification, if I may put it <P>


<a name="column_667"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 667</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that way. The Bill as drafted will require the applicant to make that judgment, but he may not be well equipped to do so. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-21_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, as I said in Grand Committee, the provisions now in Clause 7 would provide considerable benefit for UK residents wishing to file patent applications in other countries. The existing general restrictions on the filing of such applications in Section 23 of the 1977 Act would be deregulated by this clause. They would only apply where the application contained information which, if published, might be prejudicial to national security or the safety of the public. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked what the distinction between those might be. I have also sought to satisfy myself as to what the distinction might be. To be candid, it is not easy to give detailed examples, but it is certainly the case that the security services believe that the comprehensive nature of the two expressions covers every kind of eventuality that could be conceived. That is advice that it would be better to take. Therefore, retention of references to the safety of the public in Section 22 and including it in Section 23 achieves that. It is possible to come up with some sorts of hypothetical examples, but that would not be particularly sensible.
<P>

<a name="40323-21_para9"></a>The effect of the amendment would be to further limit the application of Section 23, and it would remove restrictions where publishing the information in the application might be prejudicial to the safety of the public. As I hope I made clear in Committee, an important reason for referring to both national security and the safety of the public in this section is for parity with Section 22 of the 1977 Act. It provides continuity in that sense. Section 22, which sets out procedures restricting or prohibiting publication of information in patent applications filed at the UK patent office has, for more than 25 years, covered information prejudicial to the safety of the public and information that is required to be restricted for the defence of the realm.
<P>

<a name="40323-21_para10"></a>It is true that the provision in Section 22 relating to the safety of the public has been invoked on few occasions. Although there may be relatively few circumstances in which the provision might be needed, an application could contain information that might not fall within the ambit of national security but could be of a nature such as to necessitate prohibition, in order to protect the public. Moreover, we cannot always predict the future direction of innovation or the ingenuity of inventors, so we would want to ensure that the provision could serve a more important purpose in safeguarding the public in the future.
<P>

<a name="40323-21_para11"></a>In order to ensure that no necessary protection for the public is lost&#151;now and until the next time that we have an opportunity to update patents law&#151;the simple and safe solution is to follow the precedents and retain the provision in this form. I hope that, in the circumstances, the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, and the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, who is also rightly <P>

<P>
<A NAME="40323-21_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his response. He said that the two phrases would cover every eventuality. That is what worries me. Applicants will play safe, and my fear is that the deregulation will not work as well as the Minister intends.
<P>

<a name="40323-21_para12"></a>I am also not convinced that the Minister has grasped all my points, but I do not think that it matters. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="40323-22_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Attlee </B>   moved Amendment No. 4:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 6, leave out lines 25 to 28 and insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-22_para0"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(b) either&#151;
<br>
(i) the patent alleged to be infringed is not shown by the claimant to be invalid in a relevant respect, or
<br>
(ii) the patent alleged to be infringed is shown by the claimant to be invalid in a relevant respect and the defendant or defender proves that the time of making the threat he had no basis for believing the patent to be invalid in that respect.""
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-22_para1"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, the objective of the amendment is to hold the balance between honest patentees who believe that their legitimate rights are being infringed and honest third parties who are entitled to continue lawful activities without harassment.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para2"></a>The object of Section 70 is to prevent powerful patentees oppressing small traders by claiming dubious rights that the latter cannot afford to contest. It also hinders all patentees, large and small, from enforcing legitimate rights. There is no point in having rights that cannot be asserted. It should be possible to challenge apparent infringers without having to issue a writ first.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para3"></a>The useful reforms of the legal system brought about by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, emphasise the importance of reasonable discussion to achieve settlement. Section 70 obstructs such discussions. Just as threats may be issued oppressively or for purely tactical reasons, so may actions for threats. Suing a lawyer for issuing threats on behalf of his client can drive a wedge between the client and his adviser and deny the client justice. Although lawyers may find it convenient to be exempted completely from threats actions, the provision might also allow them to evade the intentions of Section 70. That is why I opposed the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, on that point in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para4"></a>The amendment would allow patentees and their lawyers to issue threats believed in good faith to be justified. The burden would be on the issuer of the threats to prove his good faith. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40323-22_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for the explanation of the thinking behind the amendment. Taking the amendment at face value, as it is on the Marshalled List, I find it puzzling. It would involve substituting our proposed new Section 70(4)(b) with some new wording. The new wording does not follow from the wording of the proposed new subsection (4)(a), either grammatically or logically. I strongly suspect that the noble Earl's intention is to replace existing subsection (2)(b) of Section 70. The noble Earl's proposed paragraph (b)(i) reproduces the wording of subsection (2)(b). The proposed paragraph (b)(ii) then adds to that existing wording.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para5"></a>I am helped in that piece of deduction&#151;I hope that it is correct&#151;by having seen a paper from the Chartered Institute of Patent Agents that contains exactly that proposal. My reply will therefore reflect the proposal put forward in that paper. I think that it mirrors the noble Earl's proposal.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para6"></a>The amendment proposes an additional way in which a patent holder may successfully defend himself against an action for making unjustified threats. The patent holder may genuinely believe that he has a valid patent and that it is being infringed. If he is sued for making threats against someone, the court may find that the acts under dispute amount to infringement of the patent. In that case, the patent holder is excused, as no unjustified threats were made. However, in those circumstances, the court may also find that the patent is invalid. If so, the patent holder is robbed of his defence and is found to have made unjustified threats, despite the fact that he was right in his assessment that infringement was taking place.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para7"></a>I agree that that seems unfair and may dissuade a genuine patent holder who has correctly assessed that infringement is taking place from seeking to resolve the dispute. As I understand it, the amendment addresses the apparent unfairness. If the court has found that the acts under dispute would have constituted infringement but also that the patent is invalid, the patent holder will not be held liable for making unjustified threats, provided that he shows that he genuinely had no reason for realising that his patent was invalid.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para8"></a>The point was not raised with us during the consultation. Had it been, we would, I think, have welcomed it. I am therefore prepared to agree an amendment that addresses the noble Earl's concerns and will table such an amendment at Third Reading. In other words, we have put the most favourable interpretation that we can on the noble Earl's amendment and will table amendments to take action on the point. We could not be more helpful than that, and I hope that the noble Earl will withdraw his amendment on that basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-22_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful for the Minister's interpretation of my amendment. I apologise for the drafting. I must confess that, when I studied the detail of it, I could not quite work it out myself.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para9"></a>The Minister has given a helpful reply, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para10"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-22_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Attlee </B>   moved Amendment No. 5:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 6, line 41, leave out "best endeavours" and insert "reasonable endeavours in all circumstances"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-22_para11"></a><P>

<a name="40323-22_para12"></a>The noble Earl said: My Lords, we return to the issue of the meaning of the phrase "best endeavours", in what is now Clause 12.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para13"></a>I remind the House that Clause 12 provides for the insertion of new subsections into Section 70 of the Patents Act 1977. They give a defence in threats proceedings, when a person finds that he needs to resort to pursuing secondary infringers&#151;often retailers or wholesalers. The defence is that he has used his "best endeavours" to determine who was the primary infringer or importer.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para14"></a>In support of his argument, the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, referred to the IBM case, decided in the Court of Appeal. It is true that the finding watered down the phrase "best endeavours", but I understand that, previously, it meant "to the point of commercial ruin". However, it still meant that IBM was expected to appeal a planning decision which, presumably, it reluctantly agreed with.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para15"></a>I believe that the Bill as drafted will not achieve what the Minister desires and that Clause 12 will be far less valuable. If my amendment is agreed to, the patent holder will still be obliged to try very hard to identify the primary infringer. However, the courts will be able to take into consideration all the circumstances and the reasonableness of the patent holder's actions. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lyell: </B>   My Lords, I support my noble friend Lord Attlee, who has raised an interesting point. I will not weary your Lordships tonight with the case of IBM; I think it was Mr Justice Laddie who had things to say about it.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para16"></a>My noble friend has argued his case cogently&#151;I think there is, or can be, some difficulty with the interpretation of "best endeavours" or other words in quite how far the patent holder or the defendant will go in these cases. Perhaps the Minister can explain. I think that my noble friend's amendment has merit, and we are looking for clarity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-22_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, it was clear in Committee that the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, had reservations about the best endeavours threshold setting too high a standard. In particular, he was concerned that it would, as he put it, hit SMEs hardest. I recall that the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, also expressed his concern about this point in Committee. I have listened carefully to the arguments put forward again this evening.
<P>


<a name="column_671"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 671</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para17"></a>As my noble friend Lord Triesman made clear in Committee, the intention of our best endeavours threshold is not to set an impossibly high standard. If we thought that it did so, we would not be putting it forward. Neither is it our intention to set a threshold which is easier for some to achieve than others. In particular, we would not wish to weigh the scales unfairly against the small or medium-sized patent holder. However, I am not convinced that this is what the threshold actually does.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para18"></a>The wording in Clause 12(4) makes it clear that the person concerned&#151;I emphasise that point&#151;must use his best endeavours. It does not measure his best against an absolute standard. Instead, the standard that he must attain is to make the efforts that a prudent, determined and reasonable person in his position would make. Since this is the case, the circumstances in which he finds himself&#151;that includes the resources that are available to him&#151;are an important consideration.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para19"></a>The endeavours that a multinational firm can make may well, when all the circumstances are considered, go further than the endeavours that can be made by a small business with five employees. So the person concerned will not necessarily be required to match what someone else with more time, money and resources could do. He must do his best to track down the alleged primary infringer, but that does not necessarily mean that he is required to do more than he is reasonably capable of doing.
<P>

<a name="40323-22_para20"></a>I hope that, with those words, I have been able to allay the fears of noble Lords opposite in this respect and that they will agree that the current wording achieves the right balance without being unreasonably hard on any particular person or size of business.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-22_spnew6"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, unfortunately, my legal advice differs from that of the Minister. I fear there will not be a meeting of minds on this issue. Therefore, I wish to test the opinion of the House.

<FONT SIZE=3>correctly given an opinion that a patent is being infringed but the alleged infringer knows that the patent is invalid by reason of very clear prior art. If the alleged infringer knew that an infringement opinion was being sought, he could easily apply for a validity opinion himself.

<A NAME="40323-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, before considering the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, and the noble Lord, Lord Lyell, I should first like to make some general points regarding the proposed opinion procedure, partly in response to comments made in our debate in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="40323-23_para5"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, spoke in Committee of his concern that proposed new Section 74B(2)(d) was not compliant with TRIPS or Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, let me reassure the noble Earl that the proposed new section does not contravene either TRIPS or the convention. The provision is in place to remove any overlap or confusion with existing procedures. It ensures that, in those instances where there will already be a sufficient means of challenging the outcome of a review, an automatic right of appeal from the new procedure for review of an opinion by the Patent Office can be excluded. The power will be exercised only in appropriate cases.
<P>

<a name="40323-23_para6"></a>In Committee, the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, stated of opinions that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am of the view that the only use would be as a sanity check".&#151;[Official Report, 8/3/04; col. GC 377.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-23_para7"></a>I agree wholeheartedly with the idea that opinions will help to introduce greater sanity into the area of patent enforcement. What is needed is a procedure which, because of its non-binding nature, can be used at any stage in the life of a patent to help the patent holder or a third party in their decision-making processes and which does not compel them to act in a particular way.
<P>

<a name="40323-23_para8"></a>It is for that reason that the Patent Office is best placed to be the provider of such opinions. The Patent Office has an excellent reputation for the quality of its work granting patents, as evidenced by its recent success in achieving the international ISO 9001:2000 quality accreditation, and is experienced in dealing with issues of validity and infringement. The advantages of the opinion procedure, which is a generally rapid, paper-based procedure, militate strongly against making it a binding one. This is to ensure that, precisely because the Patent Office is, as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, said in Committee,
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>process that could assist in the early settlement of disputes rather than the need for another binding litigation procedure.
<P>

<a name="40323-23_para10"></a>I now turn to the amendment itself, which would make a change to new Section 74A(5) to require an examiner to obtain comment from a number of parties likely to be affected prior to issuing an adverse opinion. As I said in Committee and at Second Reading, much of the detail for the opinion procedure will be laid down in secondary legislation following further consultation with stakeholders on implementation. However, in order to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived from the opinion process, it has always been our intention to ensure that the request for an opinion is widely notified. This would ensure that those who are directly affected, for example, the patent holder, as well as those who have an interest can all submit their comments and observations for consideration by the examiner. However, at all times, we must make sure that the key advantages of the opinion procedure&#151;its low cost and its speed&#151;are not compromised.
<P>

<a name="40323-23_para11"></a>There are a number of steps that we can take in order to ensure that a request for an opinion is widely advertised and notified. Clause 13(3) ensures that notification of the request for an opinion and of the outcome of the opinion can be made on the patents register. Any party who has an interest in a particular patent, such as the patent holder, a licensee or a third party competitor of the patent holder, can ask to be informed whenever such an entry on the register is made. This is a service that the Patent Office can provide upon payment of the appropriate fee.
<P>

<a name="40323-23_para12"></a>In the case where the requester is not the patent holder we envisage that the Patent Office will notify the patent holder directly that a request for an opinion as to the validity or infringement of his patent has been received. We also propose to consult on whether or not it would be appropriate for the Patent Office to notify directly any party identified by the requester as having an interest. They could then be invited to submit observations on the question at issue within the appropriate time limit.
<P>

<a name="40323-23_para13"></a>It is also proposed to notify all requests for an opinion in the Patents & Design Journal, which records the progress and status of all patent applications and granted patents and is readily available in electronic as well as paper form.
<P>

<a name="40323-23_para14"></a>I hope that this will reassure noble Lords that requests for opinions will be widely notified and that all parties who have an interest will be able to be involved before the examiner issues an opinion. I believe that this will ensure that the interests of all, including the public interest, are safeguarded and will avoid the type of uncontested pre-emptive strike referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, in Grand Committee.
<P>

<a name="40323-23_para15"></a>It is appropriate, and more consistent with what happens for other procedures under the 1977 Act, for details of the procedure to be laid out in secondary legislation, the Patent Rules. I would therefore ask noble Lords to accept my reassurance that their concerns will <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-24_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham </B>   rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 9 February be approved [10th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: The Government introduced an important set of measures in April 2003 that gave parents more choice and more support than ever before to balance work and family life.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para2"></a>All mothers can now take 26 weeks ordinary maternity leave with most able to take an additional 26 weeks additional maternity leave, giving up to one year off in total. Statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance are now paid for 26 weeks and the standard rate was increased to £100 per week. These provisions give mothers far more choice in the vital first year of a child's life.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para3"></a>The Government also introduced a brand new right to two weeks' paid paternity leave. This acknowledged the crucial role played by fathers at birth both in supporting the mother and in caring for the child. For the first time the important role of adopters was recognised as they were given similar entitlements to birth parents. They can now take one year's adoption leave with 26 weeks' statutory adoption pay. As this was important new legislation we have been carefully monitoring its implementation. In doing so we have discovered a few minor oversights. The amendments we are debating today will smooth out the glitches and ensure that the new rights work as we said they would.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para4"></a>There are three amendments within the two statutory instruments before your Lordships today. The first removes the condition that an employee has to supply the name and date of birth of the child to be adopted if the employer requests it. There can be no doubt that the privacy of the child should be protected. Employers can still ask to see evidence of the expected placement if they suspect that the claim is false.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para5"></a>The second amendment deals with employees returning to work after taking adoption leave. It makes sure that they have the right to return to work on terms and conditions no less favourable than would have applied if they had not been absent. The Government clearly stated their intention to treat adoptive parents the same as mothers on maternity <P>


<a name="column_676"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 676</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>leave as far as possible&#151;a principle that was widely accepted during the extensive consultation on the new laws for working parents. This amendment brings adopters in line with women returning from maternity leave.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para6"></a>The third amendment aligns the payment process for statutory paternity pay with that for statutory maternity pay and statutory adoption pay. It will make certain that employees whose second week of statutory paternity pay begins on or after the date of any increase to the statutory rate will receive the higher amount in the second week rather than the existing rate. The existing legislation was drafted to deal with paternity periods that were taken before 6 April 2003 by fathers whose babies arrived early. This change will simplify the process for both employers and employees.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para7"></a>These are minor technical amendments intended to fine-tune the existing regulations. There will be little impact on employers but it will make a difference to employees and their children as the right to privacy will be upheld and neither adopters nor fathers will be disadvantaged by taking their statutory entitlements to leave. I commend the regulations to the House.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para8"></a>Moved, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 9 February be approved [10th Report from the Joint Committee].&#151;(Lord Davies of Oldham.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-24_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his explanation of these two very straightforward regulations. Both of them were described by the Minister and his colleagues in the Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation in the other place as "fine-tuning" of the original regulations which came into effect just under a year ago.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para9"></a>Perhaps I can remind your Lordships of what my honourable friend, the Member for Malden and Chelmsford East, then the Shadow Secretary of State for the DTI, said about the Employment Act 2002 during its passage through Parliament. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We welcome measures to help parents maintain their place in employment while at the same time spending time with their family, particularly during their children's early years".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-24_para10"></a>
For that same reason, we support the regulations which clarify those regulatory measures.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para11"></a>The removal of the right of an employer to demand details of the name and date of birth of the adopted child must be right. That was a piece of over-regulation which impinged on the child's right to privacy, which is carefully guarded in the case of adopted children. The number of possible cases where some dishonest employee might try to pretend to adopt a child to get some benefit must be so negligible as to make that particular requirement a gigantic hammer to smash a tiny nut.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para12"></a>The other two amendments, one to refine the terms and conditions on which an employee will return to work, and the other, in the weekly pay rates regulation to adjust the method of calculating pay, both seem to be innocuous.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para13"></a>I have only one question for the Minister. His colleague told the Standing Committee in the other place that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The cost . . .  to employers is negligible".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 8th Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, 10/3/04; col. 6.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-24_para14"></a>But he could not give any figures of the actual cost because the Government are waiting for the Inland Revenue to report via the annual PAYE returns, which are due in May.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para15"></a>I ask the Minister to ensure that, when the whole PAYE report is available, the figures for the cost of these regulations are extracted from it and made available in the form of a Written Statement on the record for the benefit of noble Lords and other interested parties, including employers' associations and particularly the Federation of Small Businesses and the Small Business Bureau.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para16"></a>As I said earlier, we see no objection to either of these two sets of regulations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-24_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Barker: </B>   My Lords, I, too, thank the Minister for introducing the regulations. I agree with him and the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, that they constitute very welcome tidying up amendments. I am very glad that the Government have taken on board the points made by adoption agencies and others that the regulations as they were previously would not work.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para17"></a>I have a couple of questions for the Minister that I accept he may not be able to answer this evening. First, will the regulations, along with other changes that were made to improve the employment terms and conditions of adoptive parents, be evaluated in the long term? This is a worthwhile policy which had the support of these Benches when it was going through. However, it would be good to know whether there is to be a longitudinal study of the economic effects and benefits of keeping families, and particularly fathers, in touch with children but also in touch with the world of work.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para18"></a>Secondly, are the provisions of the Adoption and Children Act that relate to special guardianship similarly covered in terms of a right to employment leave? I too noted the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, that, unhappily, the Federation of Small Businesses has raised some objections to these regulations. I believe that the noble Earl's suggestion concerning a report would be welcome, not least to small businesses, to enable them to see the overall effect of the benefits of the measure. Those of us who are normally more concerned with adoption regulations than employment regulations know how important in psychological terms the presence of parents can be at an early point of a child's placement. I am sure that the presence of fathers at an early stage in a placement must have a beneficial effect on the long-term stability of that placement. It would be good to know whether there is research to that effect.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-24_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl and to the noble Baroness for their broad welcome for the regulations which, as we have indicated, are minor in their effect but, none the less, important.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para19"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked me about the effect on employers. I can assure him that there will be minimal costs on employers because of the technical nature of the changes. They merely implement the policy that should have obtained over the past year but which, due to slight defects which we have now put right, did not. There are only 3,500 adoptions a year so adoption leave will be a rare occurrence even for the very largest of employers.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para20"></a>I emphasise to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that the costs involved are marginal. The noble Baroness struck a welcome note when she talked of the necessity of studying the impact of legislation, and particularly the necessity of studying what we all recognise is a very important social feature that we need to get a grip on; namely, the whole question of the costs of parenting and the advantage to the child of policies being pursued that encourage both parents to play a full role right from the birth of the child.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para21"></a>I do not think that anyone is in any doubt that one of the great social challenges that we face is enhancing family life and support for children and making sure that they are well looked after. The relatively minor costs in early years can reap great dividends if children behave in a social manner in their teens and later. Consequently, this is investment well spent, and why the Government address themselves to these issues with considerable enthusiasm. I can therefore say to the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, that we do have a longitudinal study in progress on the question of the extent to which fathers are in touch with their children. We certainly intend to make sure that we have the evidence which both identifies whether we are pursuing the right policies, and which will give us a guide to any changes that need to be effected. That is most welcome.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para22"></a>I cannot reply to her on the issue of guardianship. We have no information on that, and the orders do not directly apply to that. But I will be happy to write to her if I have additional information.
<P>

<a name="40323-24_para23"></a>On the basis of those responses, I commend the regulations to the House.

<P>

<a name="40323-25_time0"></a><H5>8.42 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham </B>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 24 February be approved [10th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the draft order is the culmination of a technical review of the Renewables Obligation Order 2002, set up to check that the order was working as originally intended. It also represents the outcome of a consultation on the issue of late payments made into the buy-out fund. The changes proposed are divided into two types: those designed to enhance the likelihood of achieving a 10 per cent target by 2010, and those of a more administrative nature. In explaining the provision, I will of course focus primarily on the former.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para3"></a>I would like to say a little at this point on how effective the obligation has been since it came into force in April 2002. We have seen a step change in renewable energy projects commissioned and planned. When I say "planned" I mean the number of projects which have now come off the drawing board and for which planning consent is being sought. The wind industry trade association has calculated that nearly 500 megawatts of new capacity will be built this year, out of 2,000 megawatts of consented projects. Offshore wind and electricity production is now really taking off, with over 1,200 megawatts consented under round one and, of that, North Hoyle at 60 megawatts has now been commissioned. A further 7.2 gigawatts of offshore wind projects have been offered site leases under round two. It is the renewables obligation that has stimulated this level of renewables development, and the order before us today is designed to improve the investment climate for renewables even further.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para4"></a>Investor confidence is clearly very important and the extension of the profile of the obligation&#151;from 10.4 per cent in 2010&#150;11 to 15.4 per cent in 2015&#150;16&#151;will also be an important factor in this. We have already announced this, and we shall be consulting on it later this year with the intention of legislating in a year's time. The Renewables Innovation Review confirmed that 10 per cent renewables electricity by 2010 is achievable, while highlighting the importance of wind energy in achieving this.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para5"></a>Let me turn to the main provisions of the order. There are five main provisions on which I wish to focus: co-firing, conversion of fossil fuel stations to biomass, smaller generating stations, NFFO sites and the recycling of late payments into the buy-out fund. Of these, the most significant change is to the rules for co-firing.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para6"></a>By co-firing, we mean the dual firing of biomass with fossil fuel, usually coal. We are using the co-firing of biomass, which includes energy crops, as a transitional measure to encourage the planting and use of energy crops <P>


<a name="column_680"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 680</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as a fuel for electricity generation. Our existing fossil-fuelled generating stations are able to burn a proportion of biomass, including energy crops, and this is what the renewables obligation encourages by awarding ROCs for the electricity produced from the biomass element. At the moment, to be eligible for renewable obligation certificates&#151;with the leave of the House, I shall now refer to them as ROCs&#151;co-firing generating stations must have 75 per cent of their biomass by energy content as energy crops from 2006 and the eligibility of co-firing for ROCs ceases in 2011. After a detailed study on co-firing, we have concluded that more time is needed to develop energy crops and that farmers and generators need greater security. The requirement for some biomass to be energy crops has therefore been deferred until 2009, rather than 2006, and thereafter there will be a stepped increase. Co-firing stations will continue to be eligible for ROCs until 2016, giving time for farmers to harvest three full crops of new short rotation coppice. To balance this and to reduce the risk of co-firing ROCs flooding the market, the amendment order tightens the cap on co-fired ROCs that may be used to meet an individual supplier's obligation. This will be progressively reduced from 25 per cent currently to 10 per cent in 2006 and to 5 per cent in 2011 until 2016.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para7"></a>I am aware that concerns have been raised that we have not limited energy crops to those grown in this country. I should like to comment on that briefly. Electricity generated from biomass is eligible for ROCs whether the biomass is imported or produced here. This will not change as a result of the order. The obligation is a market mechanism, leaving generators free to decide on the source of their fuel. Any restriction on the source of the fuel would not be permissible under international trade rules and would also deprive generators of a source of fuel, some of which is waste with no other end use. However, we expect the amount of imported biomass to decline as home grown energy crops increase. DRAX power station, one of our largest, last week announced trials of UK-sourced biomass for its co-firing; it has previously been using imported fuel.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para8"></a>Staying with biomass, the amendment order will permit fossil fuel generating stations to convert to biomass without refurbishment. At present, most generating stations, other than co-fired stations and micro hydro, if built before 1990, have to refurbish before they can claim ROCs. By eliminating this requirement for stations converting to biomass, we shall give a boost to this sector.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para9"></a>We have also made provision for small generating stations&#151;those of 50 kilowatts DNC or less&#151;to accumulate output and to claim ROCs on the basis of their annual rather than their monthly output. Although eligible for ROCs, at present their monthly output is often too low to claim any ROCs, but in future they would be able to acquire a few on the basis of their annual use. This will benefit those such as homeowners who have put a PV panel on the roof of their house.
<P>


<a name="column_681"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 681</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para10"></a>Another of the changes relates to NFFO contract sites that have not been developed. There are a large number of NFFO contracts not yet commissioned&#151;some 1,500MW of capacity. As the order currently stands, projects on those sites are deterred from being developed by others as they would not attract ROCs. The amendment order will now allow third parties who are not connected or linked persons to the NFFO contractor to develop renewables projects on these sites and qualify for ROCs for eligible output. It also has the effect of encouraging NFFO contract holders to move ahead and develop their, as yet, undeveloped projects as there is now no point in holding off in the hope that they will in time be able to qualify for ROCs. This amendment will be beneficial all round, encouraging NFFO contractors to develop their projects and, if they fail to do so, making ROCs available to those who will move ahead with these developments.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para11"></a>Finally, as a result of TXU going into administration last year, it became clear that the current order did not make provision for any late payments and their recycling to suppliers. There is now a provision in the amendment order that allows any late payments received into the buy-out fund to be recycled to eligible suppliers for the relevant obligation period.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para12"></a>As the other changes are mainly designed to facilitate the administration of the obligation, I do not believe that I need to go into detail. I confirm that, in my view, the provisions in the amendment order are compatible with convention rights, as defined by Section 1 of the Human Rights Act 1998. Accordingly, I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para13"></a>Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on 24 February be approved [10th Report from the Joint Committee].&#151;(Lord Davies of Oldham.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-25_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his detailed and interesting explanation of the order, whose complexity may be judged by the fact that his department's Explanatory Memorandum is just about double the length of the order itself. I say at once, as my honourable friend the Member for Tewkesbury told the Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation in the other place, that we do not oppose the order.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para14"></a>Your Lordships have had the benefit that another place has not yet enjoyed: we have had a lengthy and well informed Second Reading debate, followed by 11 sessions in Grand Committee and, so far, three days on the Report stage of the Energy Bill. I suspect that some of your Lordships may, by now, be suffering from what sounds like a paradox&#151;energy fatigue.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para15"></a>The purpose of the order is to give a stimulant to an important renewable source of energy, both to assist in our Kyoto commitment and&#151;to my mind, no less importantly&#151;to reduce the United Kingdom's reliance on fuel from abroad while our own domestic <P>


<a name="column_682"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 682</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sources almost totally disappear over the next 15 years or so. So far, we are woefully short of our target for renewables. I do not say that in any recriminatory sense, but facts are facts.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para16"></a>The Minister quoted some impressive figures, but by far and away the largest component is wind. Therefore, anything that can stimulate growth in our use of renewables is to be welcomed. Biomass can be a reliable and non-intermittent source of fuel and, to repeat the word, a stimulant to our agriculture industry at the same time. It is hoped that the co-firing concept for this new source of fuel will rely on home-grown material without the need for further imports. However, I listened carefully to what the Minister said about the temporary need for imports.
<P>

<a name="40323-25_para17"></a>As a result of an opposition amendment to the Energy Bill passed by your Lordships on 18 March by a majority of 22, the Government are required to provide annual reports of information on various sources of renewable energy, including biomass. In supporting this order, perhaps I may say that we look forward to that report so that we may see the progress made in this area.

<P>
<A NAME="40323-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, first, I apologise for missing the first few words of the Minister's opening statement. As mentioned by the noble Earl, I, too, believe that I am suffering from energy fatigue. I recognise that the Minister must be suffering in the same way, having spent all day on the Report stage of the Energy Bill.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para0"></a>I very much welcome the order and the practical approach that it takes further to encourage biomass. I also welcome the recognition that the Government have given to the fact that more time and encouragement is needed so that farmers can develop energy crops, as the Minister said.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para1"></a>I noted the Minister's comment about home-grown crops. At some stage&#151;I certainly do not expect him to comment on this tonight&#151;it would be useful to have a joint letter from Defra and the DTI explaining how growers of energy crops, and in particular short-rotation coppice, will fare under the CAP reforms as proposed and also how they will fit into the entry level or higher-tier agri-environment payment system. Coppice may well qualify as a higher-tier environment, although I suppose that if coppicing has taken place frequently, it may not. I simply seek, at some stage, a letter which lays out how farmers looking to their future see the attitude of the two departments inter-relating.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para2"></a>My second comment on the order is that it recognises that small generating stations can earn ROCs. They should be allowed to accumulate and be put on an annual basis. The Explanatory Notes spell out what is in the mind of the Government: that the change will enable smaller generators to offset some of the cost of their investment. Although that is true, if <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the Government really wanted to help small generators&#151;I mean domestic households&#151;they would look at net metering. That means that people who invest in a small generator could sell the electricity that they generate into the grid at the same price at which they buy their electricity. At the moment they have to sell it at a pathetically low price and buy it at a more expensive price. That is the true disincentive. I hope that that is the next matter that the Government address in what is otherwise a welcome commitment to fulfilling their obligations under Kyoto.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the positive, sympathetic way in which noble Lords have responded to the order. One cannot be fatigued by the Energy Bill. It provides such stimulation to the intellect and keeps us occupied. I am sure that we have all enjoyed every sitting on the Bill, not least today. I recognise that the order represents a slight return to old haunts. Only an hour after we suspended discussions on Report stage of the Energy Bill, we find ourselves discussing an energy order.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para3"></a>I hear what the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, says. We shall have an annual report, which will monitor progress in the area. He will know that we disagreed on that and that was why we voted in different Lobbies on the question. There is a necessity for an annual report on progress in those terms but he has the obvious right to delight in the victory secured in an earlier stage of the Bill. I can confidently predict that as the reports come through they will show the stimulus that the Government are providing to essential developments of alternative energy strategy and we shall be pleased and encouraged by the results. He is right to say that one cannot disavow the central issue on wind energy which is to reach the targets by 2010 and 2015. However, it is important that we recognise the contribution that other technologies can make and, with encouragement, will make as the years go by.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para4"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her comments. She will recognise that I appreciate that there is a danger that coppicing&#151;I am not sure of the correct verb for developing coppice&#151;may fall within different categories of the CAP. I shall write to her on that point as I do not have the details to hand. She will appreciate, as I am sure all sides of the House do, that a great deterrent to the lack of stimulus for the development of coppicing is less a matter of the CAP and its position, and rather more the fact that one needs to know that there is a market for it. Inevitably, such investments take time to mature, so there is a long-term nature to that market and to the guarantees. Under the order we have sought to give assurances in that area so that the generating stations have the assurance that there will be an increased amount of home-produced biofuel that they will be able to use and that farmers will have a longer-run projection of how worth while it will be to invest in development. That is the purpose.

<a name="40323-26_para5"></a>On the issue of very small generators, I hear what the noble Baroness says. It is not the first time that I have heard it. I am sure that we have not progressed far enough through our consideration of the Energy Bill to prevent me from hearing the noble Baroness press her point on a third occasion. I recognise the validity of a great deal of what the noble Baroness says. However, she will also know that there are considerable on costs involved in the development of the link-up to the national grid, and we cannot at this stage pretend that we have ready and easy solutions to that. Of course, that does not mean that we should in any way underestimate the contribution that individual householders and small generators can make to our future energy production, nor the inevitable lesson that goes alongside electricity generation; namely, the obligation on all of us in smaller units to conserve energy.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para6"></a>On the basis of those constructive responses, I hope that I have answered the points made. I commend the order to the House.

<A NAME="40323-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham </B>   rose to move, That the draft regulations laid before the House on 23 February be approved [12th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, there has been a slight procedural hiccup in relation to these regulations. There is a mistake on the Order Paper. The Motion refers to a draft laid on 23 February and the 12th Report of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. It should refer to a new draft laid on 18 March and the 13th report of the JCSI, which was published today. Furthermore, until 7 o'clock, the Printed Paper Office was distributing the 23 February text, not the 18 March text. That has been corrected in the intervening two hours. I do not believe that either error was entirely the Government's fault. Nevertheless, I apologise on behalf of the Government. The usual channels have agreed that we should debate these regulations today, as planned, at the end of which I shall withdraw the Motion because it is not accurate. The correct Motion will then be moved and hopefully agreed formally on Thursday.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para9"></a>The only difference between the drafts relates to paragraph 26A(1)(a), which has been clarified in response to the recommendation made in the 12th Report of the JCSI. Today's 13th Report of the JCSI clears the new regulations without comment. I therefore believe that, far from wasting our time today, we shall be engaging in a debate to which we have all looked forward, and I apologise for that small hiccup in the proceedings.

<P>

<a name="40323-26_para10"></a>The House will recognise that discussion of the national minimum wage always represents an occasion of joy for these Benches, because it is one of the Government's great successes. The regulations before the House today are concerned with how the minimum wage applies to output workers, including home workers. They replace the present system of fair estimate agreements with a system of fair piece rates linked to the minimum wage.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para11"></a>As noble Lords will know, the Government introduced the minimum wage in April 1999. We were absolutely determined that the minimum wage should be successful and that it should not lead to increased unemployment for the very people we were trying to help, nor that it should damage the economy. I believe that we have succeeded in achieving both goals.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para12"></a>Last week we announced that the minimum hourly rate would go up from £4.50 to £4.85 in October and that a new hourly rate of £3 would be introduced for 16 and 17 year-olds where there has been some evidence of exploitation. The minimum wage has made an enormous difference for more than a million low paid workers in the United Kingdom and has helped us to tackle the very low rates of pay that were so prevalent under the last government. There has been little or no evidence so far of any adverse impact on the employment prospects of low-paid workers. The minimum wage has been widely recognised as a success. In my view the Government can be proud of their achievement.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para13"></a>However, we cannot be complacent. The vast majority of employers are complying with the minimum wage. But there is some evidence that homeworkers are not receiving it. The regulations we are discussing tonight will attempt to remedy that. They will help all workers who are paid on the basis of the number of goods they produce or tasks they perform rather than the hours they work. The main beneficiaries are likely to be homeworkers who include, as I think will be recognised in all parts of the House, some of the most vulnerable people in the workforce.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para14"></a>The regulations replace the system of "fair estimate agreements" with a new system called "rated output work". Under the fair estimate agreements system, employers set a fair estimate of the hours needed to complete a block of work and then pay the worker the hourly rate of the national minimum wage for the hours actually worked up to the limit set in the estimate. Such a limit must be fair and will not be if it is less than four-fifths of the time that an average worker would take to do the same amount of work in the same conditions.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para15"></a>It seems clear that the "fair estimates" regime has been widely ignored. Part of the problem is that it is complex and difficult to administer. In practice, it has been difficult to predict the estimated hours for each block of work taken on by an individual homeworker from week to week. Also, the fact that an estimate will be fair if it is only four-fifths of the time that an average worker takes to do the block of work is very unpopular among workers. Most employers who apply the fair <P>


<a name="column_686"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 686</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>estimates system routinely set the estimate at this four-fifths level; that is, they do not take into account all of the time spent by the average worker. The regulations we are debating provide for a more straightforward system which will be easier for employers and employees to understand and apply.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para16"></a>We consulted all interested parties fully when drawing up the regulations. Perhaps it would help if I explain them in more detail. They extend to Great Britain and Northern Ireland and amend the National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999. They mainly come into force on 1 October 2004 with an amendment coming into force on 6 April 2005.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para17"></a>Regulation 1 provides for the new "rated output work" system to come into force on 1 October 2004. That will give affected employers sufficient time to prepare and plan for the changes. In addition, Regulation 1 provides for the coming into effect of an amendment to the system on 6 April 2005.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para18"></a>Regulation 2 amends the principal regulations by substituting new Regulations 24, 25 and 26 and inserting Regulation 26A. The effect of new Regulation 24 of the principal regulations is to provide that, in relation to a type of piece produced or a type of task performed, output workers must be paid the hourly rate of the national minimum wage for all hours actually worked unless the work in question is "rated output work". Work will be rated output work only if various conditions are satisfied.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para19"></a>New Regulation 25 of the principal regulations sets out the various conditions. Those are that the work in relation to a type of piece produced or type of task performed is work in relation to which the contract between the employer and the worker does not set any normal minimum or maximum working hours; that the employer does not control the hours that the worker works (for example, does not set his starting or finishing time or the length of time spent in producing the piece or performing the task); that the employer has arrived at the "mean hourly output" (the average number of pieces that can be produced or tasks that can be performed in an hour) in relation to a piece or task; and that a written notice containing specified information has been given to the worker to whom the "rated output work" system is to apply.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para20"></a>New Regulation 25 of the principal regulations also provides that the written notice must be given to the worker before the beginning of the pay reference period (which, broadly speaking, is the period of work for which a worker is paid) and sets out the specified information to be included in the notice.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para21"></a>Regulation 26 provides that where the conditions relating to "rated output work" are satisfied, to determine whether the worker has been paid the minimum wage the employer must calculate the number of hours that the worker is deemed to have worked. The number of hours taken by a worker in producing the piece or performing the task is deemed to be the same number of hours as a worker working at the "mean hourly output rate" would have taken.
<P>


<a name="column_687"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column 687</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para22"></a>New Regulation 26 also defines "mean hourly output rate", that is, the average number of pieces or tasks produced or performed by workers of the employer.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para23"></a>New Regulation 26A of the principal regulations contains provisions relating to the determination of the "mean hourly output rate" in relation to a type of piece or task. The employer must test the speed at which all his workers, or a representative sample, who produce&#151;in similar working circumstances&#151;the piece or perform the task work, and then divide the number of pieces produced or tasks performed in an hour by the number of workers thus tested.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para24"></a>Alternatively, the employer may, in certain circumstances, estimate the average speed by making an adjustment to a pre-existing test result. He may do so where the piece or task is reasonably similar to, but not the same as, the piece or task that has been the subject of the test and is being produced/performed in the same working circumstances; or where the piece or task is the same as the piece or task that has been the subject of the test, but is being produced/performed in different working circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para25"></a>Subsequent changes in the identity or number of the employer's workers producing the piece in question or performing the task in question do not, generally speaking, require the employer to retest or re-estimate to determine the average speed.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para26"></a>The effect of these provisions is that the average worker will be entitled to the national minimum wage from October this year. We want to provide some time for employers to understand and operate the new system. But by definition this means that workers who are a little slower than the average&#151;which could be half of the relevant homeworkers&#151;will not receive the minimum wage.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para27"></a>Accordingly, the effect of Regulation 3 is to provide that, from 6 April next year, most people, including those who work a little slower than the average worker, will be entitled to the minimum wage. That is achieved because Regulation 3 will ensure that the number of hours taken by a worker in producing pieces or performing tasks during the pay reference period will be treated as being 120 per cent of the number of hours that a worker working at the mean hourly output rate would have taken to produce or perform the same number of the same type of pieces or tasks.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para28"></a>According to the regulatory impact assessment prepared by the Department of Trade and Industry, approximately 170,000 homeworkers will be covered by the new "rated output work" system from April 2005, equating to an average benefit per worker of around £3,000 per year, before adjusting for taxes and any benefit entitlements. These proposed changes to the law will be especially important to ethnic minority and women workers, who make up a large proportion of people who work at home.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para29"></a>We recognise that some people are concerned about possible job losses. That is why we have agreed that the full effect to the proposals&#151;the 120 per cent uplift&#151;should be delayed until April next year to give business the opportunity to plan for its introduction. But the current position with tens of thousands of homeworkers earning less than the minimum wage is completely unacceptable. We will never be able to compete with countries such as India or China on the basis of pay costs, nor should we even aim to do so. We need to build the skills of our workforce to achieve high performance work places delivering quality output and not of course on low wages.
<P>

<a name="40323-26_para30"></a>Finally, we are aware that employers and homeworkers need to be aware of the new regulations and have already produced draft guidance which we will update once the regulations have been approved by both Houses of Parliament. We are discussing with the National Group on Homeworking how we can generate publicity surrounding the changes, but our aim will be first to warn employers about the changes, encouraging them to prepare by conducting necessary tests, followed by a campaign in the autumn advising homeworkers of their new rights. I commend the regulations to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-27_spnew0"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his detailed explanation of these important regulations.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para0"></a>We fully understand the difficulties with the drafts explained by the Minister and we have no problem with the proposed solution.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para1"></a>The fact is that workers on piece work are among those likely to find that they are being paid less than the national minimum wage, and those who work from home are faced with, in a phrase coined by my right honourable friend the Member for Rushcliffe, "a double whammy".
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para2"></a>People who do piece work at home are among the most vulnerable in society. I refer, for example, to the disabled, or those who have family commitments which prevent them from seeking regular outside work. These same people are often the least able to complain about exploitation by unscrupulous employers, or the most fearful about their already small income to risk doing so.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para3"></a>Of course, not all companies employing outworkers are wicked exploiters, and I have no doubt that most of them behave honourably. It is also probably true that for various reasons it may be difficult for the Inland Revenue, which is responsible for catching out those defaulting on their national minimum wage obligations, to do so in this case. However, that is no reason why a proper legal framework for calculating outworking pieceworkers should not be established and what appears to be a loophole in the existing regulations should not be closed. We support the regulations.

"( ) Regulations under subsection (4) shall permit applications to be made by electronic or other means which do not involve the physical transfer of the voucher to the account provider."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-27_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 31, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 34. Amendment No. 31 deals with electronic applications.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para9"></a>I know that the Minister will say that electronic applications are not forbidden by the regulations, but the regulations do not require the voucher to be transferred to the account provider, and that is what undermines electronic applications. The account provider would have to send documentation asking for the voucher and then have a system for receiving and storing it. The regulation also requires three years' storage and, presumably, potential retrieval.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para10"></a>The Children's Mutual told us that up to 50 per cent of electronic applications for investment accounts are not followed up when the paperwork is sent. If that is the experience for child trust funds, there will be many accounts that cannot be fully activated for want of a voucher. That will add to providers' costs, and brings us back to the issue of the charge cap, which we have already debated.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para11"></a>I hope that the Minister can explain why the Government are insisting on this archaic paper-based system. It cannot be for fear of fraud because it is difficult to think of any kind of fraudster who would play an 18-year-long game for £250. In any event, unique numbers can minimise the possibility of fraud. I do not know why Tesco can issue me with e-vouchers for use when I shop online but the Government cannot do the same for child trust funds.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para12"></a>Amendment No. 34 is partially directed at this issue, and, more widely, at the way in which the voucher system is working. It requires a report on the voucher system to be prepared after two years' operation. If the Government have imposed massive bureaucracy on providers, this review would provide a mechanism for that problem to be aired and, it is to be hoped, addressed.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para13"></a>My concern is the burden on providers, but there are other aspects, such as the costs of the Inland Revenue and its effectiveness in communicating with parents. All in all, we believe that a review is a good idea. We hope that the Government will agree. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   Amendment No. 31 seems eminently sensible. Given that the Revenue will be required to open child trust funds for those parents who do not turn up with a voucher, anything that can be done to make it easier for people to register with a provider would be sensible. Young people, in particular, communicate electronically these days&#151;not least with financial institutions&#151;and find paper an alien media. Young parents would take up the system outlined in Amendment No. 31. It would work to their advantage and, in the longer run, to the advantage of the Revenue as well.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-27_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I must first declare an interest as chairman of the Children's Mutual. I hope that that declaration can last for the whole of this Committee sitting. Secondly, the Committee will notice that I have tabled an amendment that is marginally more succinct than the one tabled by my colleagues on the Front Bench.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para14"></a>The reason that I have tabled the amendment&#151;or, rather, that I pinched their original amendment, to be totally honest&#151;is that, even at the launch of the child trust fund, we are dealing with an 18-year period, albeit that Amendment No. 34 may find favour with the Minister. We do not know whether or not it will but, even if it does, we are nevertheless talking about a timespan in which governments are not too used to operating. The voucher as such might well disappear at some point. Who is to know over an 18-year period?
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para15"></a>Since we&#151;that is, the Children's Mutual&#151;were engaged in discussions with officials about the original structure, from the start we were fully supportive of the concept of a voucher. I reiterate that. It is an excellent method to ensure that parents/guardians are aware that they have something of value that has come from the government of the day, which will provide information about their choices. In short, it is an excellent way to engage and potentially encourage people to save for their children. That is the whole principle of the child trust fund.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para16"></a>However, we currently differ with Her Majesty's Government, although one is ever hopeful, in that we thought that the Government were all enthused about a system where paper did not have to be transferred, and where an electronic means was to be the way forward. In fact, there are many government consultation documents which indicate that that is the way forward. Indeed, there are some of us who are a little slow at picking up the electronic means of communication, although I hasten to say that I am taking a crash course from my beloved wife. We are making progress. Before long, we shall be totally versatile with electronic means. But at this moment, as an ex pilot, I suppose that I have taken my initial flight and I am still doing circuits and bumps. Be that as it may.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para17"></a>We do not think that a voucher physically needs to be presented to the parent or guardian in every case. I think that the Minister will accept that we are hoping to encourage people to open accounts whenever possible. Therefore, on the assumption that both parents are working, the two most likely means that they will use are the telephone or the Internet. If that is so, should we&#151;all of us who believe in child trust funds&#151;say to them, "Once you have gone through that process, you have still got to remember to stick the voucher in the post"?
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para18"></a>It may surprise the Minister, but our experience is that most people do not keep stamps at home. Those days are gone. Everyone kept stamps at home 10 to 15 years ago. But younger married couples do not have stamps at home because they communicate electronically. Occasionally, they may go out to buy a stamp or a book of stamps, but they do not keep them at home. That is a deterrent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-27_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Woolmer of Leeds: </B>   Does the noble Lord know that stamps can now be bought on the Internet from the Royal Mail? Stamps can be acquired and used electronically.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I am delighted to hear that. As I said, I have only just graduated to that. But in itself that is a second transaction. Presumably, one would have to access the Royal Mail. We forget. The noble Lord is a similar age to myself. I suspect that he has got grandchildren. We are not kept up all night. We transfer them back when it gets to around bedtime or beyond. Occasionally, we baby-sit and pray that they do not wake up. For a busy couple with a rotten child who keeps them awake all night, the last thing that they would want to do is a double entry on the Internet to determine how to get a stamp. I do not think that that is terribly helpful, is it?
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para19"></a>My noble friend who leads us today alluded to my second issue. In the Children's Mutual, we have experience that is nothing to do with the child trust fund. Our experience is with the baby bond, which I accept does not have the same incentive as the child trust fund. I wish that it did. I wish someone would index link the amount of the contribution for tax exempt policies and perhaps at some time the Treasury would listen to that. That is probably marginally out of order, but it is on the record now.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para20"></a>Be that as it may, the basic point&#151;it is important&#151;is that in our experience people want to save. Those at the margin who are not totally committed&#151;who are very busy, have five kids or whatever&#151;take all the trouble to communicate electronically or by telephone and, at the moment, we have to send them back a policy application that they have to sign. That is all they have to do, just sign it. A stamped addressed envelope&#151;nothing else. They do not have to apply on the net for a stamp. That is another deterrent but I shall leave that aside. Even so, half the people who have made the request themselves&#151;they have not contacted us at our request&#151;cannot be fagged to go through with it. I want the child trust fund to succeed, <P>


<a name="column_GC268"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC268</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>but the requirement by the Inland Revenue that a voucher has to be transmitted from A to B is a deterrent.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para21"></a>My noble friend indicated clearly what is the financial exposure to the Treasury at this point in time. Is it really likely that someone will carry out a major money-laundering activity based on £250 over 18 years? It is fairly unlikely. In any case, we have the unique reference number on each voucher. That in itself is a double check. There is no reason why one cannot transfer the unique number by telephone or by electronic means, which is itself a fundamental check. Therefore, the Government are putting a constraint on the success of the CTF.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para22"></a>The Minister may say that the whole thing will be reviewed in two years' time. However, I am a marketing man and he is a market research man and both of us know in our heart of hearts that the launch is crucial. It is jolly difficult to relaunch or to give something an added impetus. One has to make something as successful as one possibly can&#151;or as big a failure as one possibly can if one is Coca-Cola. One needs to get the message over from the start. That is a hurdle, not put up by the Treasury but by the Inland Revenue. Someone in the Inland Revenue does not understand how electronic communication and telephone applications work today.
<P>

<a name="40323-27_para23"></a>I have just applied to go and see my son in Warsaw. I have certain bonus points&#151;I do not wish to advertise&#151;on my American Express British Airways credit card. The whole of that transaction, which costs about £150 a ticket, has been carried out electronically. I have not had to send my statement from American Express that says that I have "X" number of bonus points exclusive to me, with my number on it. I have not had to do any of that. The whole thing was done over the telephone.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-28_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I could finish. That is one problem. The other one is that we are simply adding to the costs of providers. If any of the providers has to provide money there, that is money taken away from presenting the child trust fund to the general public.

<P>
<A NAME="40323-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The amendments have been accurately described. They would remove the need for a paper voucher to be produced before an account can be opened. Of course, there is nothing to stop providers handling the administration of child trust fund accounts, either electronically or by telephone, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, acknowledged. Regarding another point that she <P>


<a name="column_GC269"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC269</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>made, it is also possible for the storage of the accounts to be carried out electronically. But we do, indeed, insist that there should be a paper voucher produced, either by post or in person, before an account is opened and there are good reasons for that.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para1"></a>First, a paper voucher plays a part in financial education, particularly for those who do not have any experience of dealing in financial products, who would not think of approaching providers by telephone or online. Parents will have a physical reminder of the amount that their child is entitled to and the handing over of the voucher emphasises the choice that they have made and the reasons that they have had for doing so.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para2"></a>It is not true that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, suggested, this paper voucher will be archaic. It will contain vital information in the form of a barcode or microline comparable to the information on the bottom of cheques that will allow providers to scan the vouchers and put the information directly into their database. I would be surprised if many providers have the sort of objection described by the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, as coming from the Children's Mutual. This system would eliminate keying errors. It may not be well known, but 30 per cent of cases of incorrect combinations of ISAs are due to such errors. Clearly this is important because we can pay contributions only when providers' claims reconcile with the Inland Revenue's child trust fund database.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para3"></a>I agree that fraud on a large scale is hardly likely with these relatively small amounts of money. However, there is a role in reducing fraud. Sophisticated fraudsters can produce a copy of any document, but the voucher will be designed in a way to make copying difficult for less sophisticated people, so the providers will have a certain degree of confidence that the voucher accompanying the application to open the CTF is genuine. The electronic process would not provide that degree of certainty because it would be open to the possibility of Internet hackers opening multiple accounts. It is costly for both the Revenue and providers to unravel invalid or fraudulent CTF accounts and it costs less to prevent this happening in the first place. Vouchers can do that in a way that Internet or phone applications cannot. Providers will not have the burden of evaluating the information that they have been provided with against what they are required to ask for.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Naseby, suggested that we are requiring things to be done twice. However, any application on the Internet has to be followed by proof of identity which would have to be sent by post.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para5"></a>We have gone some way to satisfying the concerns raised by these amendments. We amended the Bill in the House of Commons to include the requirement to obtain the voucher in regulations, because that gives us the flexibility to change the system in future if we need to. That also deals with the issue raised in Amendment No. 34 about an independent review. The Financial Secretary specifically said on Report in the Commons that the collection of the voucher would be set out in regulations to allow the flexibility to change the <P>


<a name="column_GC270"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC270</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>requirement if that seemed appropriate. She said that it would be monitored to see whether it is indeed necessary to the smooth operation of the CTF. Bearing in mind that, following the review and monitoring that will take place, we will be able to change the system by regulation if we need to, I suggest that we leave the Bill as it is.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-28_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Newby, for the Liberal Democrats' support for Amendment No. 31. I listened with interest to my noble friend Lord Naseby speaking, as he does, so eloquently and practically on behalf of the Children's Mutual. I also listened to the Minister's reply and smiled somewhat, because this is a modern Government and the cumbersome and slightly troublesome method that we will be using will produce double handling, but there we are.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para6"></a>I was interested to hear that the voucher itself will be able to be scanned&#151;which I had not realised&#151;and to be reminded that the Government are prepared to change the system in the future if need be. I am sorry that the Minister will not harden that up a bit by including a report after two years' operation. However, this is the best that we are going to get, so I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-28_spmin2"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  Yes, certainly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-28_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I am most grateful. Perhaps the Minister can clarify one point. He said that the vouchers could be stored electronically. Does that mean that, once a voucher is stored electronically, the paper voucher can be destroyed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   No, it just means that interrogation of the contents of the voucher will be electronic. The voucher itself will remain with the parent. Oh! I am wrong; they can be destroyed. There we have it: instant success.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-28_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I am most grateful for the forthcoming manner in which the Minister was able to offer that to providers. I think that that will help all of them.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para10"></a>Is it not the case that the Minister is not quite right in suggesting that providers must have proof of identity, when of course every provider will communicate with whoever has applied and the child? An automatic means of communication will take place, so it is not an added burden or something new.
<P>


<a name="column_GC271"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC271</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para11"></a>Secondly, the Minister might think that the Children's Mutual is out on a limb and is the only provider that believes what I have said. Although I cannot claim to have spoken to every potential provider, all those to which I have spoken who expect to be the dominant providers are of the same view as we are. Far from the Children's Mutual being a minority provider, the Minister will find that the vast majority of other providers share the view that I have expressed today.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para12"></a>The Minister said that 30 per cent of ISAs had keying-in errors. If I had 3 per cent keying-in errors at Children's Mutual, someone would look at it. The figure of 30 per cent keying-in errors is huge. Any percentage amount of keying-in errors in double figures is unacceptable, so I hope that the Minister will not use that as one reason why we cannot have electronic means.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para13"></a>The Minister told us about the Internet hackers producing multiple errors. That is fantasy, is it not? The real point, as my noble friend who leads for the Opposition said, is that we understood that this modern Government wanted to communicate electronically; the providers that have backed the child trust fund want to provide and to communicate electronically. Sadly, Her Majesty's Government and this Minister in particular&#151;I do not mean to be personal, but he is taking the Bill through&#151;are throwing out a wonderful opportunity.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para14"></a>This is the point that surprises me: the Minister is saying, "I will not even agree to a formal two-year review; I will put it in the regulations". I accept and recognise that the Minister is moving it from the Bill to the regulations, for which I thank him. But what problem is there with a formal two-year review? It is in Parliament's interest. Things may have to be changed either way, but if it is just left, that does not suggest to me that people are really focusing on the issues. Other issues will interfere, and some other scheme or issue will take the time of the Inland Revenue or the Treasury&#151;perhaps we will be in the middle of a general election or whatever.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para15"></a>I urge the Minister to think hard about Report, perhaps not this afternoon, and to see whether we cannot get on to the statute book at least a formal two-year review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I have responded, I think, to the main points, but I will be happy to respond to some additional ones. First, I did not suggest that the Children's Mutual was on its own and that nobody else had objected. I do not know the collective view of providers or whether they have expressed one. I certainly accept that the people to whom the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, has spoken agree with him. I would never doubt that.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para16"></a>Secondly, I did not say that 30 per cent of ISAs had errors; I said that 30 per cent of the cases of incorrect combinations of ISAs were due to keying-in errors. That is not the same thing.
<P>


<a name="column_GC272"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC272</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para17"></a>Thirdly, I come back to the issue of whether we are being "archaic", as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, said. We are going to have microline on the vouchers, and we will have the possibility of automatic transcription of the essential features of a CTF voucher. Therefore, all the later work done by providers can be carried out electronically. For reasons of recognition by parents, particularly those who are not used to financial transactions and do not have access to electronic means of communications, it is useful to have a paper voucher at the beginning. Furthermore&#151;although I do not make too much of this point&#151;the possibility of fraud is reduced.
<P>

<a name="40323-28_para18"></a>My fundamental point is that it is impossible to conceive that the child trust fund will not be crawled over. It will be crawled over by the Treasury Committee. It will be crawled over by the National Audit Office. Even if we did not want to have reviews and to consider the views of Parliament, on many occasions as we proceed with this new venture we will be obliged to do so. A formal two-year review might actually reduce the amount of scrutiny rather than increase it.

<a name="40323-29_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment brings us back to an issue that we debated in our first day in Committee&#151;the Government's view that the equity-based child trust fund is a superior vehicle in all circumstances. The purpose of this amendment is to give the Government discretion to invest child trust fund money in accounts other than equity-based stakeholder accounts if the circumstances are such that that makes best financial sense.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para8"></a>We have already had a debate about the fact that equities have outperformed deposits in every 18-year period over the past 100 years. However, I should like to take a slightly different case. The Government are not just going to be putting funds into child trust funds at age zero; they will also be putting funds into child trust funds at age seven. With the plans for "lifestyling", the balance of the fund will in any event shift in the later years out of equities and no doubt into bonds. So if one puts money into an equity-based trust fund at age seven, that fund will not be wholly in equities for 18 years. It will not even be held in equities for 11 years. It will be in equities for a significantly shorter period. Over such a shorter period, my contention is that it is reasonable to suppose that some people will do very badly.
<P>


<a name="column_GC273"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC273</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para9"></a>The example I should like to use is the hypothetical one of the Government having established this process in 1993 and put in a top-up in January 2000. In January 2000, the FTSE 100 index stood at about 6,700. Four years later, it stood, broadly speaking, at 4,500. It had diminished by about 50 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para10"></a>In January 2004, the child who was seven years old when the money was put into the fund would be aged 11 and, as I understand it, would be within a year or two of the lifestyling provision coming into force. Obviously, we do not know what will happen to the FTSE index over the next year or two. But I do not know anyone who believes that over the next two years the index will go from 4,500 to 6,700, which is the point at which it stood when the money would have been put in in my hypothetical case.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para11"></a>My contention is that only a foolhardy investor would have put money into an equity-based product in January 2000. For the Revenue to be forced to put money into an equity-based product at every point in the stock market cycle, even when there is widespread acceptance that we are at the top of a bubble, seems to be foolhardy. At the very least, the Government should give themselves the flexibility in legislation to direct those funds that they are establishing away from equities into a deposit-based child trust fund when market circumstances suggest that investing in equities is foolish. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am not in a position to query the particular example given by the noble Lord, Lord Newby. Clearly he has done his homework. But he is talking about a rather extreme case, of the difference between ages seven and 11. He then said that there would be two years before the lifestyling provisions came into force when the child was 13. For the sake of argument, I shall accept his figures, but that does not deny the fact that the final judgment would be taken only at age 18. Most of the money will be invested at the beginning or spread out over the whole of the 18-year period. With a little ingenuity, if one can find one exception to the rule, that does not really cast very much doubt on the principle behind it; namely, that we want to provide the best possible value to all consumers.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para12"></a>The proposals follow the way in which we have introduced stakeholder investment products. Of course, more money can be put into equity ISAs than can be put into cash or insurance ISAs. Generally, I think that all parties have accepted that that is the right way to encourage equity investment.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para13"></a>Even in the particular case raised by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, it is a bit much to describe the investor as foolhardy. The investor might have been mistaken, but we have all done it. We are all in that position. I would rather be called mistaken than foolhardy because I did not anticipate what, in fact, no one anticipated.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-29_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   The Minister is too modest. He will have reflected that the providers operating in this market will, one hopes, have recognised the situation in January 2000 and moved into high-yielding equities <P>


<a name="column_GC274"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC274</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which by any yardstick would have been better than a deposit account at the time of about&#151;I do not remember&#151;1 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-29_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful for that support. And I am not usually called too modest. The point is that the stakeholder account has been selected as the most appropriate type to open for children where the Revenue needs to open an account for them. That is the important point. This is an amendment to Clause 5, which is a particular subset of child trust fund accounts.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para14"></a>Under the amendment, the Revenue&#151;not the parent or responsible adult&#151;would have to make a decision about which account to open. On what basis would the Revenue be making a decision? One can see the basis on which parents or responsible adults can make different decisions, but I cannot quite see what criteria would apply. It could mean that very different types of accounts are opened for children about whom the Revenue, by definition, knows nothing.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para15"></a>So the allocation of accounts by the Revenue is done by selecting the next provider of these accounts in rotation from the list. Providing for these children to have very different kinds of accounts opened for them by the Revenue by rotating through the providers and the types of accounts being offered would turn the whole thing into a lottery. I do not think that that is what the noble Lord, Lord Newby, would want.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para16"></a>I suggest that, in the light of the potential for children to be provided with less tightly specified accounts and the questions that arise over their potential to deliver the best returns over the long term, thus providing good value for money if they are not subject to the charge cap, means that I hope that the amendment will not be pressed today and, further, will not be brought back.

<A NAME="40323-29_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for that detailed reply. He has outlined a fascinating concept. Parents with varying degrees of financial literacy will be able to exercise judgment, but the Revenue will not be able to do so. That is a new one on me. I can only assume that what the Government really have in mind here is the fourth of their requirements for child trust funds; namely, that they will help to finance the education of the children involved, who may well find that their funds are worth significantly less than they might have envisaged. In effect, this may prove to be a costly demonstration of the fact that equities may go up and, equally, they sometimes go down. I shall not press the amendment, but beg leave to withdraw it.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-29_para20"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 40 I shall speak also to Amendment No. 41. The purpose of these amendments is to probe how <P>


<a name="column_GC275"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC275</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>accounts are opened for the children of those aged 18 years and under. This links with the amendments we discussed earlier in relation to Clause 5, and applications made by those who are aged 18 and under.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para21"></a>The amendments are probing in nature and are designed to find out how accounts will be opened for the children of children. They are alternative amendments dealing with the position of parents who are "responsible persons" aged under 16 years and under 18 years respectively. I believe that, under Clause 6, the Inland Revenue must wait until one year has passed before an account is opened for the child of a child. That is how Clause 6(5) appears to be constructed. I can see no reason for the one-year delay and the loss of compound return because, according to the regulations, it is impossible for a child responsible for a child to open the account. They have to rely on the Inland Revenue.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para22"></a>The amendments would require the Revenue to open the account without waiting for one year. I believe that the Government have accepted that 16 and 17 year-old parents can open accounts&#151;we discussed that point on our previous day in Committee. However, there appears to be no alternative for under-age parents to open an account other than by waiting for one year. In that case, I hope that Amendment No. 40 will commend itself to the Government. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-29_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The first amendment would require the Inland Revenue to open a child trust fund account where the child is under 16 and the person with parental responsibility is also under 16. In fact, the Bill already provides in Clause 6(5)(b) for the Revenue to open a child trust fund account for a child whose parents are aged under 16. That is because a person aged under 16 cannot act as a responsible person for the child trust fund. The amendment, therefore, is already covered by the provisions in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para23"></a>The Revenue cannot open an account for children with parents aged under 16 automatically, which is what the amendment would require, because it will not know from child benefit claimant details whether or not there is a person who can act as a responsible person for the child's account. Where there is a person who is able to exercise the parental responsibility in this way, we want that person rather than the Revenue to have the opportunity to take an active role in the choice and management of the child trust fund account. In other words, if a grandparent can assume the role, that can be done; or it can be done by the Revenue. However, we can deal with this on a case-by-case basis. The amendment would prevent us from doing so. But if there is no one who can act as a responsible adult, parents can contact the Inland Revenue when they receive a voucher so that the account can be opened for the child as soon as possible&#151;again, there is no question of having to wait for a year.

<a name="40323-29_para24"></a>The information pack will make it clear that when there is no one with parental responsibility aged 16 or above, all that will be required is a simple telephone call to the Inland Revenue to arrange for an account to be opened. Parents under 16 will be able to change the account type or the account provider, if that is what they desire, as soon as they turn 16.
<P>

<a name="40323-29_para25"></a>The second amendment would require the Inland Revenue to open a child trust fund account where the child is under 16 and the parents are under 18. I do not understand why we need the intervention of the Inland Revenue here, because parents of 16 and over are able to open a child trust fund account for their child. That is covered in Clause 3(10). I really do not understand why the two amendments are tabled together. I trust that on that basis the amendments will not be pressed.

<P>
<A NAME="40323-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   There is just one point I wish to raise. Let us assume for a moment that the mother is 14 and therefore is some way off from being 16. Let us also assume that it takes some time to find a responsible person. What is the position of the child when the voucher is eventually issued? Is it backdated to the birth of the child or is the operational date that at which one has discovered who will vouch for the child?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-30_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The child trust fund voucher is always issued from the date of birth.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-30_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox </B>   moved Amendment No. 42:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 5, line 10, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-30_para4"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"( ) Regulations under subsection (1) shall include provisions about the circumstances in which the agreement of the person with the authority to manage a child trust fund is required."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-30_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 7 focuses on the circumstances when a child trust fund may be transferred from one account provider to another. Clause 7, as currently drafted, is very brief. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Regulations may make provision about the circumstances in which-
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-30_para6"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) a child trust fund which is an account of one of the descriptions prescribed by regulations may become an account of another of those descriptions, and
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-30_para7"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) a child trust fund held with one account provider may be transferred to another".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-30_para8"></a><P>

<a name="40323-30_para9"></a>It is certainly necessary to have a clause in the Bill which allows for a transfer of a CTF from one provider to another. That would allow the responsible person managing the CTF to decide to change the type of CTF account and that right should always be available. However, there is an alternative situation which could be envisaged&#151;one where a CTF provider is taken over, goes bust, merges or perhaps just <P>


<a name="column_GC277"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC277</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>changes the services on offer and wishes to discontinue the provision of CTF accounts. In such circumstances and as provided for by clause 7, as I read it, the provider could transfer the child trust funds under their management to another provider without the consent of the responsible person. Presumably the responsible person could subsequently move their CTF to another provider as is their right at any time, but they would be in a situation where a decision had been made already about their CTF account without anyone informing them until after the event.
<P>

<a name="40323-30_para10"></a>That seems to be an unsatisfactory situation and we have tabled our amendment accordingly to probe the point. I appreciate that not all CTFs will have a parent as the responsible person and in some situations the Inland Revenue will have to act for the child in decisions affecting their CTFs. The amendment provides flexibility by allowing regulations to set out circumstances where it is thought appropriate for transfers not to be carried out without the agreement of the person who manages that fund. We do not envisage the creation of a loophole by which a responsible person could block the winding up of a provider because they could refuse to agree to transfer the CTF to another provider.
<P>

<a name="40323-30_para11"></a>All we are seeking is some reassurance that, wherever possible, those responsible for managing CTFs will be told when it is necessary for account providers to transfer their CTF to an alternative provider. In such circumstances, the responsible person could make an informed decision about which provider they will move to. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-30_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I think I can give that assurance. I agree that Clause 7 is not the easiest to read. However, the Explanatory Notes make it clear that the clause gives the Treasury power to make regulations allowing a responsible person to change the type of CTF account, for example, from a cash to a stakeholder CTF account and to move a CTF account from one provider to a different provider.
<P>

<a name="40323-30_para12"></a>So that is what Clause 7 does. It requires that instructions on the management of the account can be given to the provider only by the person with authority. The instructions will cover matters such as whether the account is a stakeholder or non-stakeholder account; what investments will be bought, sold and held in the account; and whether the account will be transferred to another provider. The provider has no authority to act except in accordance with those instructions. If it did, the FSA and the Inland Revenue would want to know why.
<P>

<a name="40323-30_para13"></a>I think the concern is that the child trust fund account could be transferred without the agreement of the person with authority. However, the draft regulations allow accounts to be transferred only at the request of the registered contact, who is that person.
<P>

<a name="40323-30_para14"></a>As to the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, there may be circumstances where, to avoid disadvantaging a child, we would want to provide for a transfer without the responsible person's authority&#151;for example, as she said, where a provider ceases to conduct child trust fund business. In these cases, <P>


<a name="column_GC278"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC278</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>providers contact the people managing accounts to let them know what is happening. However, the Inland Revenue's experience in running the ISA scheme is that some people will not reply. In those exceptional circumstances, the Revenue will use its care and management powers to arrange for the account to be transferred to ensure that the child is not disadvantaged.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-30_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I thank the Minister for that clarification. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40323-30_para15"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<a name="40323-30_para16"></a>Clause 7 agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-30_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox </B>   moved Amendment No. 43:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 7, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-30_para17"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "REPORT ON READINESS OF THE INLAND REVENUE
<br>
(1) The Chancellor of the Exchequer shall lay before each House of Parliament a report on the readiness of the Inland Revenue to carry out its functions under this Act.
<br>
(2) The report under subsection (1) shall not be laid before each House of Parliament until such time as the Chancellor of the Exchequer is satisfied that vouchers will be distributed in respect of all eligible children born before the date on which the first order is made under section 27 and no later than two months after the date of the order."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-30_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 43, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 88 and 90. The focus of the amendments is to ensure that no order is made under Clause 27, which is the commencement order, until the Chancellor of the Exchequer has laid before both Houses of Parliament a report setting out that the Inland Revenue is suitably prepared. We have laid down some criteria here in subsection (2) of our new clause. This states that the Chancellor should be satisfied that vouchers will be sent out to all eligible children born before the date the commencement order is laid, within a two-month period from the date of that same order.
<P>

<a name="40323-30_para19"></a>Our aim here is to tease out further details on whether the Inland Revenue is adequately prepared to take on the burden of administering CTFs. We are talking here about resources, capacity and, specifically, the IT systems. Here I must declare a previous interest. For three years in the 1990s, I was on the board of the Inland Revenue when we brought in self-assessment. I saw at first hand how unprepared we were and how difficult, complicated and, at some stages, disastrous the IT systems were. We need to be sure that there is no risk that the Inland Revenue will be, as it was then, overburdened. Is it too much to ask the Chancellor to guarantee that by laying a report before Parliament? In discussion in the other place, the Minister emphasised that the Inland Revenue was prepared and that she was having ongoing meetings with it to ensure that that was the case.
<P>

<a name="40323-30_para20"></a>We are, however, talking about a massive commitment of public money. It would be a nightmare if the IT systems were not sufficiently ready and there was an administrative crisis. In our amendment we draw attention in particular to the backlog of CTFs which will have to be processed. Can the Minister assure us that the Inland Revenue can guarantee that those funds will be set up within two months of the <P>


<a name="column_GC279"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC279</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>date of the commencement order? We have a new system coming into force which is essentially untried and untested. We know that account providers have had severe doubts about how the new voucher system will function and about how the timing of the backlog of CTFs will work.
<P>

<a name="40323-30_para21"></a>It would be highly inadvisable to have a commencement order for CTFs unless the Chancellor were convinced that the Inland Revenue was sufficiently prepared and could lay a report before both Houses of Parliament to that effect. Fears have been voiced by many providers about how the administrative detail will work in conjunction with the Inland Revenue, and we know that the FSA is consulting on its sales regime until October this year.
<P>

<a name="40323-30_para22"></a>If I were to be cynical, I might say that the Government were rushing to push for commencement in April 2005 as a prelude to the general election. We on these Benches see no justification for commencement until we are certain that the systems are in place within the Inland Revenue to deal with the massive amount of work which the initiation of such a scheme will entail. To do anything else would be irresponsible. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-30_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I support my noble friend, particularly the point that she made about two thirds of the way through her remarks, which basically recorded that the FSA will itself not be ready at the beginning of October. The most recent letter that I have seen from the FSA was dated 2 March, when it said that it did not expect to be ready or to have the final rules by the end of October. I think that I have already given a copy of the letter to the Minister, but I am happy to give him another one. The person who writes from the FSA, Mr Norman Digance in business standards, to my chief executive, goes on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I appreciate that the timing is somewhat tight given the Government's expectation that firms will be in a position to open accounts for those born since September 2002 from January 2005 in readiness for accepting money into them from April".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-30_para23"></a><P>

<a name="40323-30_para24"></a>What my noble friend questions seems entirely valid. There would be nothing worse for the Government and those who support the whole concept than to have it fouled up because the Revenue is not ready. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us with robustness on the amendment.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Baroness said that she might be cynical; I have never known her be cynical. If I were to be cynical, I might suggest that when she was on the board of the Inland Revenue and there were difficulties with introducing self-assessment in 1990, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer probably assured Parliament that everything was all right. I bet he did; I bet he was required to do so.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para0"></a>Of course it is important that the Revenue be ready and that everyone can assure themselves that that is the case. The Revenue has undertaken a full review of the risks to the CTF delivery schedule between now and April 2005 and has taken steps to reduce the likelihood <P>


<a name="column_GC280"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC280</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of difficulties occurring. The progress made in preparing for the launch of the child trust fund is tracked at a series of fortnightly and monthly meetings, and I am happy to say that the Revenue is fully on schedule with all activities to date. The Government are confident that the child trust fund can be delivered on time.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para1"></a>The amendments refer in particular to the proposed phasing in of vouchers to children born before 2005, and certainly there is here a peak which will have to be dealt with. The Opposition is concerned that this could be a burden on providers. In fact, the contrary is the case. As with other aspects of the child trust fund, this has been discussed in informal consultation with the providers as a way of managing a potentially high peak of work in April 2005. Providers have supported the measure, seeing it as an opportunity to spread their workload over months rather than days.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para2"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Naseby, raised the issue of the FSA publication on the sales regime. As I think I said at Second Reading, the FSA is planning to publish its consultation paper on the sales regime towards the end of April; that is, in just over a month. Thus the outline of what is being proposed, subject to consultation, will be known at that time. Following that will be a three-month consultation period to give people an opportunity to make their comments. Time must also be allowed for an analysis of those responses. That is the reason why the final document will not be published until October 2004.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para3"></a>At that point, firms in the industry will be able to begin applying to the Revenue to be approved and registered as child trust fund providers. It is not a final deadline for them. A number of months will still be available to them after October 2004. I hope that that is reassuring.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I understand entirely what the Minister has said. The draft regulations from the FSA will be available at the end of April and a three-month consultation will take place during May, June and July. Given that the FSA, the Treasury and the Inland Revenue have been working extensively on this, it is difficult to understand why it will take them another three months to come to firm conclusions, particularly when the application date is set at the beginning of October. I fail to understand why the Government cannot ensure that the two are synchronised, which would certainly make it easier for the providers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The idea is that they will be very closely synchronised. I agree that the opening date will be 1 October 2004 and that the final rules will be published in that month.

<A NAME="40323-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   In the month of October&#151;I did not understand it to be at the end of that month. I shall convey the views of the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, to the appropriate quarters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-31_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister for doing that, but the letter states specifically that the final rules will be published by the end of October. I do not know whether that might mean the middle of the month. But, either way, I hope that the Minister will be able to put pressure on all parties to ensure that all this happens by 1 October.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-31_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   The Minister is aware that we support this Bill and these amendments were designed to do just that; that is, to try to bring this proposal to fruition safely, in good time and without embarrassment.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-31_para6"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "PAYMENTS AT AGE OF MAJORITY
<br>
(1) Where the eligible child has been on the child protection register within the two year period up to the date of attaining the age of majority, the Inland Revenue shall request payment advice from the relevant local authority.
<br>
(2) The relevant local authority shall undertake a comprehensive assessment of the risk of significant harm the payment presents to the eligible child.
<br>
(3) Based on the assessment in subsection (2) the relevant local authority shall provide payment advice to the Inland Revenue.
<br>
(4) If the payment advice is that the payment presents a risk of significant harm, the local authority shall&#151;
<br>
(a) undertake to provide a package of social care to the eligible child, in order for payment to be made without it presenting a risk, or
<br>
(b) hold the fund on trust for the eligible child until age 24 or, if sooner, until the payment presents no further risk.
<br>
(5) Proof of identity shall be sufficient proof for receipt of payment.
<br>
(6) Regulations may stipulate what would constitute sufficient proof of identity and what form notification of entitlement by the Inland Revenue shall take.
<br>
(7) Where the eligible child lacks the appropriate capacity to deal with their financial affairs at the age of majority, the provisions of the mental incapacity legislation in force at that time will apply."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-31_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: During our first sitting in Committee we spent a certain amount of time discussing the extent to which it might be possible to prevent young people spending their child trust fund in a wasteful manner. This amendment seeks to deal with rather more difficult circumstances; namely, where, for one reason or another, vulnerable young people find that the child trust fund money is used in ways that are positively harmful.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para8"></a>I have tabled the amendment following discussions with representatives of the NSPCC, which is very concerned about this matter. Perhaps I may detail two sets of circumstances that exemplify the situations which are of concern to the NSPCC and myself.
<P>


<a name="column_GC282"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC282</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para9"></a>The first circumstance concerns a vulnerable young adult aged 18 in local authority care with drug problems. On turning 18, he is about to leave the safety net of the care home, at which point the young person is also suddenly given the windfall of a child trust fund. One can easily imagine, in those circumstances, that it would be accepted with gratitude since it would provide a means of feeding the drug habit. Another possible scenario is that of children involved in prostitution. They would be forced to hand over their child trust fund money to a pimp.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para10"></a>I realise that while it is relatively easy to cite such difficult examples, it is much more difficult to provide the solutions. I do not claim that this amendment is perfect, but perhaps I may explain briefly what it seeks to do.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para11"></a>Basically, for all children who have been registered on the child protection register for a period of two years up to their reaching the age of 18, the relevant local authority would be required to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"undertake a comprehensive assessment of the risk of significant harm which the payment of the child trust fund presents to the eligible child".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-31_para12"></a>On the basis of that assessment, the local authority would provide advice to the Inland Revenue. If the advice suggests that payment would present a risk, the local authority should undertake to provide a package of social care while the fund itself is held in trust until either the child is deemed by the local authority no longer to be at risk or when the child reaches the age of 24.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para13"></a>I accept that this amendment may not be perfect, but I think that there is a serious issue to be addressed. The NSPCC has made the point that if child trust funds were seen to be spent in ways that are positively harmful to young people, that would severely damage the concept of the trust fund itself. I certainly agree with that view.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para14"></a>While I would be delighted if it were possible for the whole amendment to be adopted by the Government, the broader question of local authorities providing risk assessments and support for a child specifically in relation to that child receiving child trust fund money is an extremely important and serious one. I should be most grateful for any assurance that the Minister is able to give me on this. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-31_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I make nothing of the drafting because it is important that we discuss the issues raised by the amendment. Since we are in Grand Committee, we can deal with issues of drafting at a later stage if that is necessary.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para15"></a>However, I have both principled and practical problems with the thrust of the amendment. The problem of principle is well known. When a child reaches the age of 18, he or she becomes an adult. To take away the property of the 18 year-old would raise serious issues with the Human Rights Act. All the money in a child trust fund belongs to the child from the day that it is put into the account. What is being suggested here is that we should take away the property of a person who is, by the age of 18 years, an adult in the eyes of the law.
<P>


<a name="column_GC283"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC283</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para16"></a>We have been through the arguments about the age of majority for different purposes, such as serving in the Army, getting married, voting and so forth, but the age of 18 for these purposes&#151;and for most other purposes&#151;is the age at which a child becomes an adult. There is no basis for intervention by the Inland Revenue or any other body. Indeed, the role of the Inland Revenue and local authorities in the Bill is limited very much to ensuring that all eligible children get a child trust fund account. It does not envisage administering the account in any way.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para17"></a>The amendment talks about the circumstances where a child has been on the child protection register within the two-year period up to the date of attaining the age of majority. It is a well thought-out way of getting a local authority to investigate whether there is a risk of significant harm to the child. I have two points to make. First, many vulnerable 18 year-olds will never have been on the child protection register. Secondly, many people who have been on the child protection register, even in the previous two years, will be no longer at risk. In many cases, there will be a very poor match between being on the child protection register and being vulnerable in the way that the amendment anticipates.
<P>

<a name="40323-31_para18"></a>Local authorities should not automatically withdraw help from young adults who have reached 18, although that is the age at which all children are de-registered from the child protection register. We must rely on local authorities and oblige them to take continuing responsibility. That, I suggest, is the best way of dealing with young adults at risk, within the law as it stands and the provisions of the Human Rights Act.

"( ) If the Inland Revenue make the payment referred to in subsection (1) after 30 days from the latest of the receipt of the information referred to in paragraph (a) and the receipt of a valid claim referred to in paragraph (b), the payment shall include an additional amount calculated in accordance with regulations."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-32_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 52 and 60. All the amendments require the Inland Revenue to make an additional payment if it is late in paying what it should pay. That will compensate the child trust fund for loss of return on the funds that could have been invested earlier. Amendment No. 47 applies to the payment of initial contributions by the Inland Revenue under Clause 8; Amendment No. 52 applies to Clause 9, which deals with supplementary contribution payments; and Amendment No. 60 applies to the further contributions that may or may not be made under Clause 10.
<P>

<a name="40323-32_para5"></a>Each amendment allows the Inland Revenue 30 days to make the payment, which seems reasonable in the light of payment policies generally. It is, I believe, a period found in other Inland Revenue legislation. The amendments refer to an additional amount rather than interest, because I believe that the Inland Revenue is averse to paying interest as such. It would be for the Government to decide in regulations what rate should be paid and how it should be calculated. I hope that the Government will regard that as reasonable. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   There are two issues. One is potential delay; the other is interest. The system proposed in the Bill has been worked out by the Revenue with the providers to produce a system that will get money into children's accounts quickly and therefore start to earn interest. That is why, for instance, child trust fund providers are required to make fortnightly returns of claims received. The system is designed to automatically check and pay claims. When the information supplied by a provider reconciles with the information held on the CPS system, the claim will be paid automatically. That will normally be done through the bank clearing system, so there will be up to 14 days plus however many days the money takes to go through BACS.
<P>

<a name="40323-32_para6"></a>There should be delay only when the information does not reconcile and further information is needed to process the claim. Again, if providers provide accurate information quickly, delay should be minimal with the claim being paid on receipt of the provider's next claim&#151;in other words, well within the 30 days time scale proposed by the amendment. Of course, there could also be delay because of suspected fraud. There should be very few instances where a valid claim is paid late, and so late that it significantly affects the income and growth of the child trust fund.
<P>

<a name="40323-32_para7"></a>No one can deny that things can and will go wrong. However, we do not think that further regulations are necessarily the best way to address those problems because&#151;this is my answer to the second point&#151;the Revenue already has a compensation scheme to deal with such delays. It would add to the costs of administering the child trust fund to create another compensation scheme especially for that purpose.

"( ) The amount prescribed for the purposes of subsection (2) shall be not less than the amount prescribed for the purposes of section 8(1)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-32_para16"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment simply probes Clause 9, which provides for supplementary contributions to be paid to children in families on lower incomes. Our amendment requires the amount of the supplementary contributions under Clause 9 to be not less than the basic contribution under Clause 8.
<P>

<a name="40323-32_para17"></a>The Explanatory Notes state, at paragraph 38, that the amount payable under Clause 9 "will be £250". I am aware that the draft regulations prescribe £250. However, nothing in the Bill prevents a government prescribing a lesser amount at a late stage. The Government have said that they are concerned about poorer children, but they have not protected them in the Bill, which is what my amendment seeks to do. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-32_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   This Government have committed themselves to the Bill; the Conservative Party has committed itself to the Bill; only a Liberal Democrat government would withdraw the whole thing, so we are reasonably secure.
<P>

<a name="40323-32_para18"></a>Of course it is difficult for people on lower incomes to save, because they very often need to spend every penny that they have. That is why we have an additional endowment&#151;the supplementary contribution&#151;for children in low-income families, to help their accounts get off to a good start. We have made eligibility as straightforward as we can. Children will be eligible for the supplementary contribution if they are part of a household receiving child tax credit with an income below the child tax credit threshold, which is currently £13,230 but will go up under the Budget to £13,480 for 2004&#150;05. The amount of the supplementary payment will be £250 on top of the initial payment of £250.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-32_para19"></a>The amendment would commit this and future governments to the amount of the supplementary contribution being at least the value of the initial contribution. That would give any government, present or future, less flexibility. It would deny them the flexibility they might need to determine the value. We believe that it would be unwise to put this kind of rule on the face of the Bill. We want to give future governments full flexibility to manage the child trust fund in the light of future developments, needs and opportunities, rather than tying their hands indefinitely. The limit will be kept under review in the light of the progress of the child trust fund.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-32_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I listened carefully to the Minister's answer and I was somewhat surprised by it. We are of course dealing with a Bill, which will become an Act, which will last for 18 years for a child. As the Minister rightly said, the two major political parties have committed themselves to this.
<P>

<a name="40323-32_para20"></a>The only scenario that immediately comes to mind of where the Government have changed their mind is on ISAs. Many people, when they entered into the ISA regime, thought, perhaps foolishly, that the equity ISA would be stuck at £7,000. People may have hoped that it would be upgraded with inflation but they never conceived that it would be cut back; that savings would be disallowed and that people would be put off saving. They certainly never believed that the cash ISA would be cut back.
<P>

<a name="40323-32_para21"></a>I am surprised that the Minister does not recognise that problem. We are not dealing with adults here; we are dealing with the children of the nation. The vast majority of Members of Parliament in the other place and Members of this House support the Bill; they support the children and future children of our country.
<P>

<a name="40323-32_para22"></a>The sum of £250 is not a fortune, but it is significant. Is the Minister really saying that the present Labour Government are not prepared to put on the face of the Bill the fact that it will be at least £250? It will be up to them and, indeed, future Conservative governments to upgrade it if they so wish. I am not on the Front Bench, but I shall certainly petition my Front Bench if anyone suggests that the subsequent amount should be reduced below £250. I cannot see where the Minister is coming from unless, like the ISA, the sum is to be cut.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-32_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I would love to engage with the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, in a debate about ISAs. It has always been recognised that the effect of tax-free investment schemes is cumulative. If you go on with them for many years, at some stage something has to be done to stop matters getting out of hand. But that is not the subject of the Bill, and it would be quite wrong of me to rise to the temptation to debate it.
<P>

<a name="40323-32_para23"></a>I am following the principle that, where possible, we should avoid committing future governments to specific figures. That is why, for example, when you introduce a custodial sentence or a fine, you do not lay it out in figures; you say that the fine is on such and such a scale and then future governments and future Parliaments can change it. That is the principle behind <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>what we are doing here. We have no more intention than the Opposition of reneging on a commitment that we have made in public. It is merely that it is not appropriate for it to be on the face of the Bill.

<A NAME="40323-33_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I am disappointed with the Minister's response. I cannot express the position any better than my noble friend Lord Naseby did. So, disappointed, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40323-33_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox </B>   moved Amendment No. 53:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 5, line 35, leave out "entitled to" and insert "eligible for"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-33_para2"></a><P>

<a name="40323-33_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 54. For the convenience of the Committee, I have grouped with these amendments our opposition to the Question whether Clause 9 should stand part of the Bill. Each addresses means testing, which is at the heart of the supplementary contribution proposed in Clause 9. We are concerned with the increasing level of means testing that the Government have introduced since 1997.
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para4"></a>I shall deal first with the two amendments specifically, before turning to means testing more generally. Amendment No. 53 challenges why a parent must have established a claim for child tax credit before his or her child can have the supplementary contribution. Parents may not want to claim child tax credit. Not all parents want to submit to the indignity of claiming benefits, even if they are called credits. What take-up of child tax credits do the Government expect? How many children will that exclude from the supplementary amount? The Minister will be aware that take-up rates of other means-tested benefits can fall as low as 20 per cent, as in the case of the short-lived baby tax credits.
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para5"></a>The second amendment would remove the second leg of the conditions provided for in Clause 9(5). Not only must the parent have claimed child tax credit; the parent's income must be lower than the threshold of £13,230. Child tax credit is payable in reducing amounts to parents whose incomes are higher than £13,230. But there is a cliff edge for the purpose of the supplementary child trust fund payment. An additional £1 income for a parent means £250 less for the child. Does the Minister really think that that is fair?
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para6"></a>Those are the technical points, but behind all of this is the intruder state. The Financial Secretary told the Standing Committee in another place that 40 per cent of children will be eligible for the supplementary contribution. So we will be starting the lives of four in 10 children born each year with the personal stigma of being means tested. That will be added to the stigma of those who receive free school meals. Children are starting life with a disadvantage imposed by the Government. We are concerned about that, and we are not alone, as the Child Poverty Action Group shares our concerns.
<P>


<a name="column_GC288"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC288</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para7"></a>The Government will start 40 per cent of people's lives on means testing, and by the time they retire around 60 per cent will be on means-tested pension credit. We find that a disturbing trend. The Government will justify that by saying that they are trying to help poor people, and may even claim that making them dependent on means testing for their child trust fund will magically make them asset owners and savers. But they seem blind to the increasing way in which they are taking money in tax and national insurance, even from the poor, in order to give it back on condition that they specifically claim it and subject themselves to a means test. That is not our way. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am puzzled by the contrast between this group of amendments and that which we have just debated. In the debate on the previous amendment, the Conservative Party was keen to ensure that a supplementary payment would be not less than the original payment; in other words, not less than £250. Now it is being said, certainly by opposing the Question whether Clause 9 should stand part of the Bill, that there should be no progressive payment at all. That is what Clause 9 does. If you remove that clause, there will be nothing left.
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para8"></a>I assume that the intention of replacing "entitled to" with "eligible for" is to make eligible the children whose parents have not claimed child tax credit but would be eligible to do so. One must still know whether or not they are eligible, so one still has what the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, calls a means test. I am puzzled by the amendments. Child tax credit is an enormous success as regards take-up. The threshold brings 40 per cent of all children into the higher rate endowment. Five and a half million children live in households with an income of less than £13,230. To remove the threshold completely would bring in 430,000 children, some of whom would be in families of very reasonable incomes&#151;up to £55,000&#151;and that does not seem defensible. The child tax credit is being taken up very successfully. By January 2004, the numbers who had taken it up since April 2003 were already 100 per cent of what we expected at the end of a full year. The amendments do not get rid of a means test. They simply ensure that those with fewer needs should get the supplementary payment. That is then contradicted by the proposal to take out Clause 9.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-33_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   The Minister does a disservice to my noble friend. She made it clear that in this Committee she is probing the Minister for his response. The Minister's response was pretty woolly in relation to child trust credit. He said that basically after nine months the Government have hit their one-year target; that the whole thing is running smoothly and swimmingly; and that it is an enormous success.
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para9"></a>My noble friend asked what percentage of people eligible for child tax credit are not taking it up. What happens to those children? That was her question. I would expect the Minister to have that answer to hand. <P>


<a name="column_GC289"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC289</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The matter was raised at Second Reading, so it is not a new question. I am disappointed that he was unable to give an answer, but perhaps he overlooked it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-33_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I can say that 6 million children are benefiting from the child tax credit. If I can add anything further, I shall do so in writing to the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and the noble Lord, Lord Naseby.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   This is an important dimension. It is the children who are eligible in the families not claiming about whom we should be concerned. That is the issue that on Report I shall want to follow further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   It is a little more complicated than that. The effect of the amendment would be that the Revenue should spend a great deal of time trying to contact parents who have not made themselves known by claiming the allowances to which they are entitled. No government have given high priority to that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-33_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I thank my noble friend Lord Naseby very much for emphasising the question that I asked. I am sorry that the Minister is unable to answer today. Perhaps he will write to me with that answer because we are talking about people who will not claim; people who cannot bear to do so and therefore would disadvantage their own children. I await the Minister's reply in writing. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 9, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-33_para13"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS BY INLAND REVENUE FOR CHILDREN IN CARE
<br>
(1) If this section applies to a child, the Inland Revenue must inform the account provider with whom a child trust fund is held by the child that this section applies to the child.
<br>
(2) If the account provider makes a claim to the Inland Revenue in accordance with regulations, the Inland Revenue must pay to the account provider such amount as prescribed by regulations.
<br>
(3) The amount prescribed by regulations under subsection (2) shall be calculated so as to represent a percentage of the average value of subscriptions to child trust funds made during the preceding financial year.
<br>
(4) On receipt of payment the account provider must credit the child trust fund with the amount of the payment.
<br>
(5) This section applies to a child if&#151;
<br>
(a) a child trust fund is held by the child, and
<br>
(b) the child was first an eligible child by virtue of section 2(1)(b)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-33_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 55 would insert a new clause after Clause 9. The other amendments in this group are consequential. We return to the topic of children in care, which we have debated a little in connection with earlier amendments. The one thing that we know about children in care is that they start their adult life disadvantaged. Currently, they have extremely low educational <P>


<a name="column_GC290"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC290</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>achievements. Barely more than one half of those children have one GCSE compared with 95 per cent of all other children. The position is not improving: the Government have even dropped their own modest target of increasing basic educational achievements.
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para15"></a>Children in care are less likely to be in higher education or in employment when they leave school. Sadly, they are more likely to be on the wrong side of the criminal law. A looked-after child will qualify for a higher amount of £500 when his child trust fund is opened&#151;at least, that is what the draft regulations provide. That does not appear to be required under the Bill. Perhaps the Minister would state the long-term intention of the Government for payments to the child trust funds of looked-after children. Would he also state why the entitlement to a higher or supplementary amount for looked-after children is not in the Bill?
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para16"></a>The child is unlikely to have any further contributions paid into his account if he remains in care. Of course, some children move in and out of care and it may be that the children's parents or other relatives will contribute something, but we should not expect this to be the norm.
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para17"></a>Our new clause would require the Inland Revenue to pay into the looked-after child's trust fund an amount which will equate to the average amount paid into all children's trust funds. If the scheme is successful overall and the average annual contribution to child trust funds is, say, £500, the Government would have to specify what percentage of that amount should be paid to the child trust funds of looked-after children. I hope that they would specify at least 100 per cent so that looked-after children benefit rateably with other children in society.
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para18"></a>At the Report stage in another place the Financial Secretary said little more than that in the next 15 years or so the position of looked-after children would be examined further. But if child trust funds are to accumulate to any significant amount to help a young person leaving care, extra contributions need to be made throughout the 18 years, preferably as early as possible so that the amount can accumulate.
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para19"></a>We should remember that, with no family behind them, the transition of a looked-after child into independent adulthood is a particularly testing time. Pathway plans and the like are all very well, but if there is one group of children that needs a proper financial start in adult life, it is this.
<P>

<a name="40323-33_para20"></a>At this stage, my amendment is a probing one, which I am sure can be improved technically. For example, I am not certain how best to deal with children who move in and out of care. The amendment does not tackle this, but I assume that further regulation-making powers could do the trick. Can the Minister clarify the situation for such children? I beg to move.

<A NAME="40323-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Again, I make nothing of the drafting; it is not important. I am grateful that the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, shows concern for looked-after children who, I agree, are among the most disadvantaged children in our society. We are certainly <P>


<a name="column_GC291"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC291</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>committed to making special arrangements to ensure that they are fully included in the child trust fund, but we shall do so by regulations. This is how I think I can give the assurance that the noble Baroness seeks.
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para0"></a>I am pleased to say that the draft regulations provide for looked-after children who cannot receive a child trust fund through a child benefit award to have an account opened for them and to automatically receive a government endowment representing both the initial endowments, which all children will get, and the supplementary government endowments that will go to children in lower income families.
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para1"></a>Again, all children who are being looked after at the age of seven&#151;I agree that there are issues about children moving in and out of care&#151;will also automatically receive the government endowments that other children will receive at that age. They will receive a sum amounting to both the endowment that all children will receive and the additional endowment that children from lower income families will receive.
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para2"></a>So the Bill is a foundation on which to build for all looked-after children as well as all other children. It allows subscriptions into the child trust fund to be paid by anyone&#151;family, friends, godparents, local authorities or the child himself or herself.
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para3"></a>The amendments seek to boost the funds in the child trust fund accounts of a minority of looked-after children whose accounts have been opened by the Inland Revenue in the absence of a child benefit claim having been made on their behalf. It is true that these children may be among the most disadvantaged while they are being looked after, but the vast majority move out of care and will have families to care for them and to contribute to their child trust fund account in the same way as other children. As I said, while they are being looked after there is nothing to stop grandparents and other relatives or friends from contributing to their accounts.
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para4"></a>I do not believe that further government payments for these children are the best way of helping them. Children move in and out of care and any government payment would be rather hit and miss. But we recognise that it is important that the pathway plan which local authorities develop with children leaving care should consider the child trust fund account. Financial issues are already taken into account in the pathway plan and we will ensure that specific consideration is given to the child trust fund account.
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para5"></a>We are aware of some local authorities who have already taken financial education seriously. Warwickshire County Council has introduced a scheme where a savings account is opened for a foster child to help make them aware of the value of money as building up savings. But most financial education will be delivered in the school curriculum and that is the best place for it because it reaches all children.
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para6"></a>Over the coming months and years we will consult with various bodies and organisations about financial education. As part of that, we want to address the particular needs that there may be for looked-after children and, if possible, include some looked-after <P>

<A NAME="40323-34_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox </B>   moved Amendment No. 56:
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40323-34_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak briefly. Amendment No. 56 is designed to probe the drafting of Clause 10(l) and was suggested to us by the Law Society for Scotland. Clause 10 deals with the further contributions that the Government intend to make to children at the age of seven. As currently drafted, subsection (1) states that regulations may make provision for the Inland Revenue to make payments of certain amounts prescribed by regulations to account providers of CTFs held by:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(a) eligible children, or
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-34_para11"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) any description of eligible children".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-34_para12"></a>
The Explanatory Notes state:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subsection (1) provides for those children to be eligible children as defined in this Bill (or a description of those children specified in the regulations)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-34_para13"></a>
I find the drafting slightly confusing. Eligibility is already defined in the Bill regarding CTFs, initial contributions and supplementary contributions. The mention of a subsequent and further "description of eligible children" for the secondary contributions at age seven muddies the waters. What is the "description" of eligibility contained in regulations likely to look like? Will it merely reproduce what is already made clear on the face of the Bill as regards eligibility?
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para14"></a>We have followed recommendation of the Law Society for Scotland that paragraph (b) should read:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any category of eligible children".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-34_para15"></a>
The word "description" seems ambiguous and unclear, while "category" would at least involve some criteria that the regulations would prescribe. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-34_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am grateful for that but I do not believe that the amendment would make any difference. There is nothing sinister about it&#151;it is simply the drafting style that parliamentary counsel has used for a sub-set of eligible children. The term "description" is used throughout the Bill. For example, Clause 3 refers to "descriptions" of accounts where another draftsman might have used a different term. But in the example that I want to give, Clause 10 allows the Government to make further payments to CTF accounts held by eligible children or a sub-set of those children such as the sub-set already announced of children on their seventh birthday.

"( ) The amount prescribed for the purpose of subsection (1) shall be not less than the amount prescribed at that time for the purpose of payments under section 8."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-34_para21"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment is designed to probe the Government to see whether they have any further thoughts about the amount they intend to contribute under the provisions of Clause 10 covering the contribution to be made, as I understand it, at the age of seven. We know that the initial contributions are to be £250 under Clause 8 and a £250 supplementary contribution for low income families under Clause 9. The Explanatory Notes confirm that the payments will be made at the age of seven, but that the amounts themselves will be published nearer the time. We have no estimates at all of what they will be. What sort of figures are we talking about?
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para22"></a>I imagine that the Minister will tell us that the amount to be contributed at the secondary stage&#151;that is, in 2009&#151;cannot be announced yet because it is such a long way off. Our amendment proposes that the contribution from the Government at seven will be prescribed in regulation but will not be any less than the initial government contribution under Clause 8(1).
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para23"></a>I imagine that many people will have their own views about the secondary amount to be contributed. We wish to raise the issue now with this probing amendment to ascertain the Minister's view on what sort of amount the Government envisage. The issue cropped up here and there during debate in another place, and again in our debates in Committee, but we have not yet had a hint from the Minister about what he envisages. Rumours were floating around of £50 at seven, with £100 as a supplementary, but there was no confirmation of that.
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para24"></a>Our amendment would have the second instalment on a par with the first. That allows some flexibility because it does not insist on a specific amount. We know that the initial contributions under Clauses 8(1) and 9(2) can be changed from the £250 and £500 currently proposed by regulation and subject to affirmative procedure. We simply propose that the second contributions mirror the first, whatever those are, in 2009. They may not continue to be £250 and £500 as at present.
<P>

<a name="40323-34_para25"></a>Our amendment is intended only to probe. If the Minister is unhappy with a second contribution equal to the initial one, perhaps he will allow a different <P>


<a name="column_GC294"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC294</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>percentage&#151;perhaps half of the initial contribution. I believe it makes sense to specify the secondary contribution as a percentage of the first so that we all have some idea about what amounts we are talking about. This is not being prescriptive, but it is fleshing out the detail of the scheme as it moves into the future. I do not believe that this ties the hands of future governments. If there is a shortfall in money available, then both amounts will be reduced&#151;the initial one and the secondary contribution. Where is the harm in having the same ratio between the two as a constant? I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40323-35_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I rise briefly to support my noble friend. This amendment is absolutely hitting the nail on the head and prising out of the Government their current thoughts on the issue. It seems to me that Sandler's view&#151;although I would not want to take his name in vain&#151;is that there should be nothing. He does not believe in incentives to save. He says that they do not work. If he had his way, it would be nothing. That, of course, would be a travesty of the whole concept of child trust funds.
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para0"></a>My noble friend's proposal that the percentage should be matched does not commit the Government to a specific figure. However, she is certainly seeking from the Minister a statement of commitment to the future of the child trust fund, rather than their treating it as a short-term measure. I do not believe that either the Minister or the Government are treating it as such. However, we await his response with great interest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I do not know that I have anything much to add to what I said on virtually the same amendment earlier. I have exhausted myself and bored the Committee already on this subject.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-35_spnew2"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   No!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   The Minister may be exhausted, but he has certainly not bored any of us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Surely the issue is very straightforward. Neither of the major political parties that support the Bill could afford to play fast and loose with it, even in 2009. There is a public commitment to a significant payment and to significant supplementary payments, and there is a public commitment&#151;which is not on the face of the Bill except in the possibility of regulations&#151;for further payments at age seven. It would be utterly inappropriate for us to commit future governments on the amount. We will be held to account by the people of this country, to put it pompously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-35_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I have spoken to people about the proposition and the fact that we in the Conservative Party support it. When I say, "If your baby was born by the end of August 2002, you're going to get £250", that sounds good and quite exciting. Then I say, "At seven you'll get some more". "The same?", I am asked, to which I reply, "No". Then I am asked, "How much?", and I reply that we do not know. "What do <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>you mean?", I am asked. "You know what you're going to give us now but not what you're going to give us when the child is seven? It seems very odd".
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para1"></a>The Government cannot tell us that we should not seek some sort of certainty and expectation. If we are to encourage people to save&#151;to look forward to the future&#151;I would have thought that putting something in this area would have been a good idea. Our amendment would have been an awfully good idea and I wish the Government had taken it up. However, I see that the Minister is determined not to do so. At least I now know for certain that he will not do so and, as such, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) The circumstances referred to in subsection (1) shall not include any error or mistake which is attributable solely to acts or omissions of the Inland Revenue."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-35_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 61, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 62, both of which deal with the issue of Inland Revenue error. Clause 11 allows the Inland Revenue to recoup contributions made under Clauses 8, 9 and 10 in the almost limitless circumstances to be prescribed in the ubiquitous regulations. That is fine where the children's parents or an account provider have given incorrect information, but there could be other circumstances, for example, where the Inland Revenue has incorrectly interpreted whether the provisions in Clause 9 or the regulations yet to come under Clause 10 are met.
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para8"></a>The purpose of the amendments is to probe whether the Inland Revenue should be able to recover money even where the only fault lay with the Inland Revenue&#151;an entirely plausible scenario. Amendment No. 61 would not allow any recovery where the Inland Revenue's acts or omissions were solely to blame, while Amendment No. 62 would allow recovery of the capital amount but not any income or gains made in the interim. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-35_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am tempted to see whether there are any bankers around and to ask whether banks do not attempt to recover any money that they have paid incorrectly. My understanding is that they do, quite reasonably.
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para9"></a>The amendment would prevent the Revenue recovering a payment in a situation where it has made one into a child trust fund account in error. The amendment assumes that the provisions of Clause 11 are broad enough for the Revenue to recoup any payment, including money paid incorrectly by the Revenue, into an account. But our legal advice is that Clause 11(2) contains the assumption that payments should not have been made in the first place. Therefore the circumstances in which we are intending to use the power in Clause 11 are where fraud or negligence by the investor or the provider has been involved.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para10"></a>But where an erroneous payment has been made by the Revenue, it will be recovered under the provisions of general law. This comes back to "Bank error in your favour. Collect £200". You do not. The Revenue would recover any excess payments, together with any income or gains which have arisen on those funds. Although the Revenue acts to eliminate errors, it is unrealistic to assume that they will not happen. Although we expect them to be rare, it is likely in a scheme of this size that payments could be made in error. It is only right in those circumstances that the money should be recovered.
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para11"></a>In virtually all cases of such a nature, the payment and the income or gains arising from it will still be in the child trust fund account and will be recovered from the account. Not to recover money paid in error would be unfair to others and an improper use of government money. It would mean that children would benefit from funds to which they were not entitled, putting them in a better position than other children and, logically, putting the other children in a worse position.

I have served on the board of the Inland Revenue, and seen how difficult life can be for it sometimes. I have also seen how much error is made. It seems to me that the Inland Revenue is in a win-win situation whereas the rest of us are not. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40323-35_para16"></a><P>

<a name="40323-35_para17"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 64 raises the question of why shares and securities may not be used when making contributions to a child trust fund. Clause 12(1) states that subscriptions to a child trust fund may be made only by way of a monetary contribution. Amendment No. 64 seeks to extend that to allow marketable securities.
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para18"></a>I do not believe that all child trust fund providers should be compelled to take marketable securities but it would be a useful facility for some contributors to be able to transfer shares or other securities. The need to stick within the monetary limit as well as the practicality of running a child trust fund itself dictates that only marketable securities should be involved. I believe that the ISA rule allows for this and that it operates without difficulty.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para19"></a>When this issue was discussed in Standing Committee in another place, the only substantive objection raised by the Financial Secretary was in relation to unlisted shares. My amendment avoids that pitfall. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-35_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The key to this is to keep the operation of child trust funds as simple as possible. After all, we have put a cap on the charges and we are talking about relatively small amounts of money, although of course it is all new business. If we were to allow for the acceptance of shares and other investments, even marketable securities, that would mean that a provider would have to arrange for a valuation. I admit that that is straightforward for quoted shares but the Revenue would have to agree a valuation for unquoted shares.
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para20"></a>Valuation is not a simple process and it would be difficult for the provider to keep track of the annual limit. If the limit were exceeded once the valuation was agreed, either because it was higher than expected or because other contributions had been made to the account as well, contributions would need to be returned to whoever made them. That would incur additional administrative costs. Securities may not always remain marketable, and that also would add to costs.
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para21"></a>There is another issue that needs to be considered in regard to the acceptance of non-monetary contributions: the stakeholder account is risk controlled and the provider is required to maintain a diverse portfolio of investments. In addition, as the account moves closer to maturity, the provider is required to move investments into lower risk areas. Accepting bundles of shares or gilts would be inconsistent with this approach and the value of shares and securities could easily be manipulated for avoidance purposes. If we were to allow contributions in the form of securities, we would need complex anti-avoidance rules specifically to prevent abuse. Again, that would increase the administrative burden and therefore the costs.
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para22"></a>Providers are required to value child trust fund accounts annually. Non-monetary contributions would have to be valued not only once but every year. So the initial additional flexibility offered by the amendment would be outweighed by the extra administrative cost. A small minority of people might be disappointed that contributions of securities could not be accepted, but the reason for this is to keep account charges low.
<P>

<a name="40323-35_para23"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, referred to ISAs. The transfer of securities into ISAs is allowed in very limited circumstances&#151;that is, in transfers from employee share schemes only.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-36_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   Is that so? I speak on behalf of myself and my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale to Amendment No. 65&#151;but of course I am moving it on my own behalf. I shall speak also to the other amendments in the group, again tabled in my name. They all concern the maximum amount that can be contributed to a child trust fund.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para3"></a>Amendment No. 65 would insert a form of words into Clause 12(2) so that the maximum amount is an amount paid in respect of one year and not simply in a year. This would allow unused contribution limits in one year to be carried over to the following year.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para4"></a>Not all parents can contribute the same amount every year. Perhaps a parent has a period of unemployment or the family has other financial commitments. However, when funds are more plentiful in following years, parents would like to make up the contributions that were missed. If the Government are serious about encouraging savings through the medium of the child trust fund, this amendment would allow a more diverse set of saving patterns to emerge.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para5"></a>Amendment No. 66 is a probing amendment to establish the Government's intentions as regards the maximum contribution. We have heard the Minister's reply on that. This is set at £1,200 in the draft regulations. My amendment would ensure that later regulations could not reduce that amount. The Minister will be aware that the reduction in the annual ISA contribution limit has been much criticised. It would be odd if this new vehicle, one designed to increase savings, was also savaged in that way. People need to be reassured that the Government will be consistent in their approach.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para6"></a>Amendment No. 67 is a variation on that theme as it requires the regulations to provide for the annual uprating of the contribution limit by the rate of inflation. My amendment uses the retail prices index, but to be trendy I should have used the consumer prices index. However, that seems likely to produce a considerably lower figure at all times.

<a name="40323-36_para7"></a>Finally, I turn to Amendment No. 70. This is a probing amendment to clarify whether amounts paid under the terms of Clauses 9 and 10 could be construed as contributions, thus restricting the amounts capable of being contributed by parents and others. I hope that the Minister can reassure me on this point. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-36_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   For the avoidance of doubt, none of these amendments is a Skelmersdale amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-36_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I was teasing. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, raised the issue of why there should be a limit of £1,200 and these amendments concern that limit, although I acknowledge that they have a different thrust.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para8"></a>It is important to the concept of the child trust fund that family, friends, or children themselves can make additional contributions to the fund. As has been said, if no additional contributions are made, after 18 years the fund is likely to be in three figures rather than a more significant amount.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para9"></a>The purpose of the government endowments is to encourage people to save for a child's future. Additional savings by family and friends could significantly increase the amount that children receive at the age of 18. The fund intends to encourage a partnership between government and families to build on existing positive attitudes to saving for children.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para10"></a>However, we believe it unwise to put rules into the Bill&#151;such as the subscription limit not falling below £1,200, as proposed in Amendment No. 66, and increasing with RPI, as proposed in Amendment No. 67&#151;rather than give future governments full flexibility to manage the child trust fund in the light of future developments, needs and opportunities. This subscription limit must be kept under review in light of the progress of the child trust fund.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para11"></a>A further amendment in this group, Amendment No. 70, is unnecessary as it seeks to ensure that the government contributions will not count towards the maximum subscription limit. That has already been specified in the regulations, which have been published.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para12"></a>We are not certain about the reason for Amendment No. 65. We assume that, by inserting "in respect of" into Clause 12, the amendment would allow unused contributions from one year to be carried forward to the next. I am afraid that that would make the fund more complicated for providers to administer, and difficult for child trust fund account holders and their families to get to grips with. There would have to be enhancements to the IT systems, which might not be popular with providers, especially small ones who are dealing with more modest savers. Such providers believe that a regular annual limit on a simple basis encourages regular saving and provides well for the modest contributor who will form the vast majority in child trust funds.

<A NAME="40323-36_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   This provision discriminates against children. The Minister will be aware of government index-linked gilts. The Government recognise that people in the professional financial world buy index-linked gilts because they act as a hedge against inflation going up. Furthermore, National Savings offers index-linked products. As I understand it, the Minister is saying, "That's all very well for people who buy those securities, but our country's children will not have anything that protects them against inflation. The maximum limit will be fixed at £1,200, and that is it. The children themselves, a couple of years down the track, will be limited to £1,200, as well as those starting in April 2005".
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para14"></a>If that is the Government's philosophy, it is strange because they upgraded the original £250 for those born after September 2002. There is a certain inconsistency in the Government's approach and we should reconsider the matter on Report. All governments want flexibility, but the nation's children are the last people who should be used in such a way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-36_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is not the Government's philosophy and we are not imposing any restriction of that kind. We are simply saying that future governments will decide the limit. The noble Lord, Lord Naseby, is making a false analogy with index-linked gilts and so forth. Of course, the terms on which people are lent money survive throughout the period of the loan, but this is nothing to do with lending someone money. This provision limits how much can be invested. When the investment is made, normal financial conditions will apply to the interest.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-36_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I am sorry that we will not get close to what we sought to achieve with Amendment No. 66, because of the disappointment that ISAs have been and the worry that surrounds them. The Minister mentioned "flexibility" again and again in relation to how much the second-stage payment would be and he said that flexibility was required so that governments of whatever kind in the future would not be bound, yet there seems to be no flexibility of any other kind in this discussion. This takes me back to the days when I was chairman of the National Consumer Council: this is a classic case of something being process-driven and not consumer-led. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-36_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment 69 would restrict the regulations under Clause 11 on the methods of payment into a child trust fund so that they may not require the account provider to accept cash, credit card or debit card. The draft regulations which define a stakeholder account require the account provider to accept all of those methods as well as cheques, direct debits, standing orders or direct credits. Fortunately, those restrictions do not appear to apply to non-stakeholder accounts, which the account provider may also offer&#151;perhaps the Minister would confirm that.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para20"></a>The potential providers of stakeholder child trust funds will have to live within the charge cap of 1.5 per cent, which we have already debated. If a provider had to accept all the methods of payment listed in the schedule to the regulations, it would find it very difficult to make money. For example, credit card commissions will exceed 1.5 per cent. Some providers are also concerned about the administration costs of dealing with cheques or standing orders, although I have not included these for the purposes of today's debate.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para21"></a>The amendment also states that cash must not be prescribed. Cash handling will doubtless provide no problem for those organisations with an existing infrastructure, such as building societies. But others, such as the Children's Mutual, do not have that infrastructure. That may drive providers out of the market by itself. Those who look at what it will cost them to make arrangements to take cash themselves or through agencies may conclude that the costs are prohibitive within the 1.5 per cent cap.
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para22"></a>I have a technical point to put to the Minister. Concern has been expressed that the FSA's client money regulations will not allow independent financial advisers to offer child trust funds to their clients. Will the Minister comment on that?
<P>

<a name="40323-36_para23"></a>A better amendment would be to leave providers free to say what payment methods they want to provide, but for today's debate I have not been so radical or, perhaps I should say, so sensible. I beg to move.

I do not want to curtail debate&#151;I do, actually, but that is not the point&#151;but I should point out that we have been discussing these issues further with providers. We recognise the concerns expressed in the amendment. There have been persuasive arguments against providing the full range of the methods of payments. Current stakeholder pension regulations require cheque, direct debit, standing order and direct credit as methods of payment. We shall consider the industry's concerns and suggestions for keeping the CTS account regulations in line with stakeholder pension regulations.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Before Clause 15, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-37_para4"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "ANNUAL REPORT
<br>
 The Treasury shall lay before each House of Parliament every year a report on the operation of child trust funds, including&#151;
<br>
(a) the amounts paid under sections 8, 9 and 10;
<br>
(b) the additional amounts paid into child trust funds under section 12;
<br>
(c) any practical difficulties that have been encountered by the Inland Revenue;
<br>
(d) the results of any research carried out into the effect of child trust funds on savings behaviour or any other matters."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40323-37_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 71 seeks to insert a new clause before Clause 15. When we reach a clause asking for an annual report, we know that there is light at the end of the Committee tunnel, although this is not quite the final amendment.
<P>

<a name="40323-37_para6"></a>The proposed new clause requires the Treasury to lay a report each year before the Houses of Parliament on how child trust funds are operating. There is very little evidence underpinning this policy, and the Government are setting no targets, for example, on the amount of savings the policy is expected to generate. My honourable friend in another place, Mr George Osborne, made a telling point in Standing Committee when he said that, if another department had come to the Treasury during the spending round and asked for £250 million a year for a policy underpinned by little research and unaccompanied by any output targets, it would be sent away with a flea in its ear.
<P>

<a name="40323-37_para7"></a>Over time, problems may well emerge. One thing that concerns many of us is the potential dissipation of the proceeds of a child trust fund at its maturity. Providers have a number of concerns about how the stakeholder element will work in practice and how the voucher scheme will operate. There will be a need for basic data on how much is being contributed to child trust funds under the various routes for that. The Government say that they are concerned about financial education, but how will they measure that and report to Parliament?
<P>

<a name="40323-37_para8"></a>The amendment asks for an annual report so that it can provide an opportunity for either House to debate the way in which the policy is unfolding. I hope that the Chancellor will be curious to find out what he is getting for his money. That may be a vain hope, but the rest of us want to know what we are getting for our money&#151;because it is taxpayers' money that is being used, not the Government's or the Chancellor's.
<P>

<a name="40323-37_para9"></a>I hope that the Minister, who is so enthusiastic about this policy, will welcome the opportunity to show each year how well it is going. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   I rise briefly to support this amendment. The part of the amendment that could be particularly valuable is subsection (b), covering,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the additional amounts paid into child trust funds under section 12".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-37_para10"></a>
On the first day in Grand Committee we debated the question of varying the way in which the charge cap might operate to enable child trust funds to be marketed more efficiently and effectively than might otherwise be the case. An annual report on the lines proposed in the amendment would provide the means to cast an investigative light on how the additional payments are working.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I hope that I can do better than the amendment by offering more. The new clause focuses on limited aspects of the child trust fund: the level of savings into the account; practical difficulties encountered by the Inland Revenue; the results of research carried out on savings behaviour and other matters. We are also concerned with helping people to understand the benefits of saving and investing, encouraging the saving of even small amounts, ensuring that in future all children have a financial asset at the start of adult life, and building on financial education to help people make better financial choices throughout their lives. All these are matters that Parliament ought to know about.
<P>

<a name="40323-37_para11"></a>Most of the information asked for here will be available on the Internet. The Division Bell has sounded. I do not think that I will be able to finish my remarks.

<A NAME="40323-37_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I started by saying that I hoped we could do better than the amendment does and pointed out the other things on which we ought to report. We shall report in two ways. First, we will publish annual statistics for the child trust fund, from 2007 onwards. The statistics will provide more information than is being sought here. They will include the level of take-up of the child trust fund; the number of revenue-allocated accounts; the level of assets accumulating in the accounts; and, in due course, the income distribution across which contributions are made.
<P>

<a name="40323-37_para13"></a>We are also developing a detailed evaluation plan identifying key success criteria associated with the policy objectives. Those might include, for example: parents' understanding of the child trust fund and how it works; the number of cash deposits in equity-based accounts; the extent to which it has increased savings for children compared with now and in the longer term; and the level of financial awareness among children and parents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-37_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   That all sounds very fine, but will all the information be put into one annual report? It was not made clear.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-37_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   No, we will publish annual statistics, but the evaluation that we are talking about could take place at irregular intervals. I am sure that something will be published each year, but, in order to get a proper evaluation, one must look at things over a period. I would not like to be tied down by frequency of publication, except in the sense of annual statistics.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-37_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister for giving way. He is quite right; it is quite difficult to tie him down. Would it not be normal for evaluation to be left to the National Audit Office? That is the area in which one expects an independent body to carry out an evaluation. I sat for some 10 years on the Public Accounts Committee, which analyses the government policy of the day and reports impartially. The Minister raises two issues. The first is the annual statistics. If he thinks further about what my noble friend says, I think that he will be tempted to pull all that information together into an annual report. Secondly, there is the separate issue of evaluation of the policy. With the greatest respect to any political party&#151;it applies to my own above any of us&#151;we would all prefer the National Audit Office to evaluate the policy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-37_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   That is indeed a non-political point. I think that the Comptroller and Auditor General would say that there are too many occasions when his staff are occupied in finding out why things have gone wrong. We are concerned to keep adequate records and to interpret and analyse them in such a way as to make it unnecessary for the National Audit Office to look at things that have gone wrong. Of course the National Audit Office is always free to investigate anything that it wishes. Nothing that we do would make that less possible.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-37_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for giving way once again. It is not a question of what the National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor General wishes; it is laid down in statute that they must audit the accounts, so it is not an option. The Minister may wish to think about the matter further. I accept that we have not discussed the matter in any detail. He may want to return on Report when he has clarified his own mind on the matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-37_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am sorry; there has been a misunderstanding. Of course there will be an audit of the fund every year&#151;nothing takes away from that. I am talking about going further, as the amendment would, by looking at the reasons that things happen. That is in addition to the audit function of the National Audit Office. I assumed that the noble Lord was talking about its value-for-money studies.

<FONT SIZE=3>but we have said many times that the initiative is new and different. An annual report would give the Government a way of celebrating, educating and bringing matters together.

<P>
<A NAME="40323-37_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox </B>   moved Amendment No. 72:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 9, line 2, at end insert "but the regulations may not require the provision of information by account providers more frequently than monthly"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-37_para17"></a><P>

<a name="40323-37_para18"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 72 adds to Clause 15, which deals with information from account providers, the requirement that information must not be required more frequently than monthly. The draft regulations require providers to put in claim and financial returns fortnightly. The Association of British Insurers has described that as "excessively bureaucratic". It has pointed out that the draft regulations do not require fortnightly but bi-monthly returns, which may well be difficult to achieve with existing IT systems. In total, the draft regulations require 61 separate returns, which the ABI believes should be streamlined to 12 integrated monthly returns and possibly an annual one in addition.
<P>

<a name="40323-37_para19"></a>I know that the Government have argued that the so-called fortnightly returns will speed up the crediting of government contributions to the child trust funds and thus maximise the returns. This is probably de minimis, but in any event the ABI tells us that many providers will credit the voucher as soon as they receive it, as insurers currently do for life assurance premium relief.
<P>

<a name="40323-37_para20"></a>I hope that the Government will be prepared to look again at the administrative burden on the providers. A point will come at which the camel's back will be broken and the Government should listen to those real concerns from providers if they wish to see a significant number enter the child trust fund market. I beg to move.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, says that the Government argue that the fortnightly returns will speed up the money for an account&#151;indeed, we do argue that. What happens is that the information is provided, the account is opened&#151;please pay. If the money is paid in straight away or on a fortnightly basis, interest starts to be accrued from that date. I am glad to hear of the ABI's comments about paying the money in straight away, but that is not a legal requirement, as I understand it.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para0"></a>The amendment says that the regulations may not require providers to provide the Inland Revenue with information more frequently than monthly. The noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, made clear that it refers to the draft regulations, which we published on 2 February. It does not work in that sense, because several other clauses in the Bill impact in this area&#151;for example Clause 5(5)(b) allows for regulations requiring the provider to inform the Revenue when an account is <P>


<a name="column_GC306"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC306</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opened using a voucher. The amendment would not prevent fortnightly returns, but would remove some of the important information we need from those returns.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para1"></a>Our intention is that providers should notify the Revenue within two weeks of opening an account, and of other important changes in the account, such as if the account has been closed or has been transferred to another provider. The reason for the two-week period rather than longer is that we want to put the money into the child's account as quickly as is practicable once the parents have decided which CTF provider's account to open, so that the child can gain maximum growth from it.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para2"></a>The fortnightly exchange of information will be via the Internet and that will be an automated process with very little human intervention. There will be a specified electronic format that will encrypt information and use a password that is specific to the provider. If the provider's return is correct, the Government contributions will be paid automatically to the relevant account. If the provider's return is incorrect it will be automatically returned to the provider to rectify.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para3"></a>As it is an automated process, it is not envisaged that fortnightly reporting will add significantly to the workload of providers and it will enable Government contributions to reach CTFs at the earliest possible time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-38_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   I do not disagree with what the Minister said, but does that mean that there will be 26 returns a year?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-38_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   Fortnightly seems onerous, and I am interested to hear that payments would be made via the Internet. There is the electronic application about which we started to talk as early as Amendment No. 31.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   But if the noble Baroness will permit me to say so, we are talking about a return between the Government and the provider. It is not for the parent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-38_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I fully understand exactly what the Minister is saying, but it is nice to hear him use the words "via the Internet". However, I am sorry that the process is fortnightly, which seems onerous. If anything, it will prevent people entering the child trust fund market. We do not want to limit it if we can avoid it; I am sure that the Minister does not either. For the moment, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>and the parent remarries, when the child wants to change their name. Then it happens again and they want to change their name again, and they then may want to change it back to what it originally was. It is an experience that some of my noble friends have when they change their names on arriving in the House. It is at best tedious, and often very lengthy. Is there a process on the information from account providers that simplifies the whole issue?

<A NAME="40323-38_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox </B>   moved Amendment No. 73:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 9, line 34, leave out subsection (2).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-38_para9"></a><P>

<a name="40323-38_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: I shall speak to Amendments Nos. 73 and 74. In order for the system of CTFs proposed by the Bill to work well, the Inland Revenue needs the power given to it in Clause 15 to require information and documentation from any relevant person&#151;that is, those responsible for a CTF and the account providers. Those details are to be contained in regulations. Our concerns, however, centre round Clause 17, which makes provision for the use to which that information, once gathered, can be used.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para11"></a>Subsection (1) states that the information held by the Revenue,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"may be used, or supplied to any person providing services to the Inland Revenue, for the purposes of, or for any purposes connected with, the exercise of",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-38_para12"></a>
functions relating to CTFs. That is all well and good&#151;there needs to be effective interaction between all parties who work together and co-operate to allow CTF schemes to work.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para13"></a>We are concerned about subsections (2) and (3), however. Subsection (2) would allow information held by the Inland Revenue or by a person providing services to it, for any purpose relating to CTFs, to be used or supplied to any person providing any services whatever to it for the exercise of any other function which it undertakes. Subsection (3) would do the opposite and allow any information held by the Inland Revenue, for any other purpose unconnected with CTFs, to be used and supplied to it or to any person providing services to it to exercise its functions regarding CTFs.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para14"></a>Our amendments leave out subsections (2) and (3) on a probing basis. The powers are broad-ranging. I do not doubt that the intention of the Government is to encourage co-operation between different departments within the Inland Revenue. Mention has been made of the need to allow a third party to collate statistical data to examine how well the scheme is working. That might require sharing of personal information about CTFs. We have also heard mention of sharing information with IT contractors and so on. However, that is not what the Bill currently says&#151;it <P>


<a name="column_GC308"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC308</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>says that any information which the Inland Revenue has acquired in the process of administering CTFs can be shared with any third party, not for purposes connected with the exercise of the Inland Revenue's functions within this Bill, but for an altogether different purpose.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para15"></a>I am always wary of the issue of data protection. Personal information should not be shared unless it is strictly necessary for the purpose of administering CTFs. That is already covered by Clause 17(1). Can the Minister explain how he justifies extending this information sharing to parties unconnected with CTFs? The powers currently set out in subsections (2) and (3) are broad. We would feel happier if the regulations provided for the circumstances in which information could be made available by the Inland Revenue to other Inland Revenue departments and outside providers not directly related to CTFs. As it is, the Bill gives a free rein without any of the specific examples to which the Minister in another place referred. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40323-38_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I think that we are at cross purposes. It may be the wording of the clause that is causing the trouble. The phrase "person providing services" is the key. The person providing services referred to in the Bill is always the IT contractor&#151;and only the IT contractor. There is nothing in the clause that means that information will be shared with anyone else who conceivably might have an interest.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para16"></a>What is largely meant by information sharing is enabling computer systems and databases to talk to each other so that information held in one part of government can be used by another. There is plenty of precedent here. It is a standard provision that formalises for new work taken on by the Inland Revenue the existing convention that information received by the Inland Revenue for one purpose can be used for other purposes. We have the same provision, for example, in the new tax credits legislation.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para17"></a>The first amendment proposes that subsection (2) be left out. If accepted, it would not be possible, for instance, for the Inland Revenue to use information about child trust funds for evidence-based policy making. For example, we would not be able to produce the annual report, which the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, wanted in the previous amendment. As part of the evaluation of child trust funds, it might be worthwhile to follow a particular group of children and show how their child trust funds develop. We might want to consider differences in the use of child trust funds between children who start work at age 16 and those who go on to higher education If we left out subsection (2), we would not be able to do that.
<P>

<a name="40323-38_para18"></a>Subsection (3) allows the Revenue to use information held for other purposes for the child trust fund. It allows the award of child benefit to be used to determine eligibility for child trust funds and details of child tax credit awards to be used in assessing whether a child is eligible for the higher rate of government <P>

<A NAME="40323-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   I am sorry that I was unable to be present earlier in the debate. I intended to ask the Minister if he could indicate precedence for this, which he has just done. However, one point arises from his response. While I fully accept the need for a clause along these lines, the Minister said that subsection (2) would be applied only for IT services. But that is not what the Bill states. It uses the words, "supplied to any person". Is the normal precedent "to any person" when it is meant to be confined to particular services?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   The phrase is "any person providing services". My advice is that that is to be interpreted as IT contractors and no one else. It sounds counter-intuitive to me as well, but I think that there is precedent for it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market: </B>   I am sure that stationers supply services to the Inland Revenue. Probably caterers also supply services. The Minister says that his interpretation is correct, but it seems a very broad phrase indeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-39_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   When I read it, it sounds broad as well. I shall write to everyone concerned about this.

<A NAME="40323-39_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I thank the Minister for that. These were probing amendments, and we have had a useful debate. I should be grateful if the Minister would write to us on the matter. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 11, line 3, leave out "may" and insert "shall"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-39_para5"></a><P>

<a name="40323-39_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 75 is also probing. Clause 19 states that the Inland Revenue "may" make a payment to the personal representatives of the child. This concerns child trust fund contributions that had not been paid over before a child's death.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para7"></a>The amendment seeks to ascertain why, if the conditions in subsection (3) have been met, the Inland Revenue should have any discretion as to this payment. The issue was debated a little in Standing Committee in another place, where the only example given was of a parent who had murdered the child. I want to challenge that. The clause requires a payment to be made to the child's personal representatives, not the parents. I may be mistaken, but if a parent has murdered a child, he or she would not be eligible to receive anything from the child's estate, so the fact that the child had been murdered should not be relevant. In <P>


<a name="column_GC310"></a>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC310</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any event, it is not something that the Inland Revenue should opine upon, as it is a matter for the criminal law.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para8"></a>So I return to the basic question of why discretion has been given to the Inland Revenue, and on what basis it intends to exercise it. The Minister will see that this is not the usual "may" or "shall" debate, but raises issues of real substance. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-39_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Clause 19 is quite specific. The amendment is concerned with cases where the child dies. In such circumstances, the child trust fund will form part of the child's estate and be passed to personal representatives. Clause 19 deals with cases where children die before the Inland Revenue has made child trust fund payments which would be otherwise due. It also deals with cases where a child trust fund payment has been paid but has not been credited to an account before the death of the child.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para9"></a>There will be no need for parents to make an additional claim to receive any outstanding payments due. These will be sent to the parents automatically, accompanied by an appropriate letter.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para10"></a>In case the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, or others think that this may be restrictive, it may help if I explain why the Inland Revenue will make payments to personal representatives only if the child benefit has been claimed. Where they so wish, parents can claim child benefit even though a child has died. Child benefit is paid for eight weeks in those circumstances. I understand the circumstances in which some parents do not wish to do so; I also understand that some parents wish to occupy their minds in sad circumstances by seeing to it that they get for their children the rights that they have. Where parents do not claim the child benefit, I think it is wise to assume that they do not wish to be contacted to have their eligibility assessed. We believe that that is the least intrusive approach.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para11"></a>The amendment refers to subsection (1) of Clause 19, which states that the Inland Revenue "may" make a payment after the death of the child to personal representatives. The clause stops short of saying that a payment "shall" be made. That provides the Revenue with the power not to make a payment if it would be inappropriate to do so&#151;in other words, if it appears that communication would be intrusive.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para12"></a>Turning to the issue of murder, personal representatives responsible for the unlawful death of a child would not receive a child trust fund payment. In practice, the Revenue would wait until another personal representative was able to receive the money. In these difficult circumstances, it is best to include that degree of discretion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-39_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   I said that it was a probing amendment, and it is. I thank the Minister for his reply. I have nothing more to say at this stage. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="40323-39_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox </B>   moved Amendment No. 76:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 11, line 4, after "representatives" insert "or executors"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-39_para14"></a><P>

<a name="40323-39_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: Finally, I rise to speak to Amendments Nos. 76 and 92, unless I respond to the government amendment which follows.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para16"></a>We are drawing to the close of our discussions in Grand Committee. Clause 19 deals with payments made by the Inland Revenue after the death of a child. Subsection (1) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Where a relevant child dies, the Inland Revenue may make a payment to the personal representatives of the child".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40323-39_para17"></a>Amendment No 76 is a strictly technical amendment. We have been advised by the Law Society for Scotland that Clause 19 does not make correct reference to the Scottish terminology for personal representatives. As the Bill is intended to extend to Scotland, the term "executor" should be used in addition to "personal representatives" to avoid causing any possible confusion to those in Scotland affected by the legislation.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para18"></a>Amendment No. 92 has a slightly different focus. It would provide for a regulation to enable sums of money to be paid into a deceased child's trust fund without requiring the confirmation of a personal representative or executor. This amendment was also recommended to us by the Law Society for Scotland. I am not sure whether the drafting is correct, but there is a significant point to be made here, so it will serve its purpose at this stage.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para19"></a>Clause 19 enables any payments that the Inland Revenue should have made to the child trust fund before the child dies to be paid to the child's personal representatives. It is quite possible that the sums to be paid into the child trust fund are unlikely to exceed £1,000. On the basis that this claim would normally be the only asset of the estate, apart from any money already paid into the child trust fund, it would mean that the child's father, mother or sibling would require to be confirmed as executor under the small estates procedure.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para20"></a>Where other payments are due by the Government to a deceased person at the time of death, there are government regulations enabling the particular government office to release moneys under, for example, Section 5(1)(g) and (q) of the Social Security Administration Act 1992. Although Clause 28 provides for regulations to be made under the Bill, there does not appear to be any provision enabling a regulation to be made relating to payments due under Clause 19. This amendment seeks to address that omission. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40323-39_spnew9"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I should love to find the Law Society for Scotland right, as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, claimed when she introduced the first of their amendments, but I am advised that neither of these amendments is necessary.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para21"></a>Payments made under this clause will go to the deceased child's estate. "Personal representatives" is the conventional legal expression covering both executors and administrators on an intestacy. It applies throughout the United Kingdom.
<P>

<B>23 Mar 2004 : Column GC312</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para22"></a>Amendment No. 92 seeks to amend Clause 28 so that regulations could be made allowing the parents of a deceased child to claim the child trust fund more simply than would normally be the case. I have already explained that child benefit claims will be the normal gateway to CTF, and this will be the case when children die early in life. Child benefit will act as a secure and clear pathway.
<P>

<a name="40323-39_para23"></a>The Revenue has developed this procedure to handle these difficult issues sensitively and sympathetically. There is no need for further regulations.

<P>

<a name="40323-40_para21"></a>Improving fine enforcement performance is an important part of maintaining public confidence in the criminal justice system. Justice must be done, and must be seen to be done.

<a name="40323-40_para22"></a>To this end, we are launching a national initiative to target those who have defaulted on criminal penalties imposed by the courts. The initiative, called Operation Payback, will see magistrates' courts across England and Wales conducting blitzes against serious fines defaulters in their areas.
<P>

<a name="40323-40_para23"></a>The operation means that money owed to the court, and therefore the taxpayer, and compensation owed to victims, is collected. The Government are sending a clear message to those who have been fined that payment is not optional and that penalties must be paid.
<P>

<a name="40323-40_para24"></a>The national operation is being co-ordinated by the Department for Constitutional Affairs with support from the police and the Department for Work and Pensions.

The Talk to Frank website highlights the risks of using steroids. The use and misuse of all drugs, including steroids, is covered under substance misuse programmes in schools.

<A NAME="40323w01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland:  </B>  Specialist physical education (PE) teachers have a crucial role to play in the delivery of high quality PE and school sport for our young people. The Government's PE, school sport and club links strategy complements and runs alongside the school workforce reform agenda. The Department for Education and Skills has secured 300 additional initial teacher training places in PE for the three years from 2003&#150;04. This, along with healthy levels of PE teacher recruitment and retention, will ensure that sufficient trained specialist PE teachers are available to help deliver the Government's commitment to increase access to high quality PE and school sport.

A number of the case studies published as part of the investigation are designed to help schools address health issues including providing physical education for obese or overweight pupils. In addition, all modules within the professional development work strand of the national strategy seek to promote inclusion and the differentiation of provision to meet the individual needs of pupils.

<A NAME="40323w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport   (Lord McIntosh of Haringey): </B>  I understand from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that a decision to apply to become a passport-issuing organisation is a commercial and operational matter for the organisation making the application. VAT registration was not specifically considered during the consultation exercise carried out regarding the proposal to extend passports to all horses, nor was it raised in any of the responses to that consultation.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40323w02_para1"></a>In respect of VAT there are two issues: the supplier of the passports and the horse owner. For the supplier, Customs and Excise's Public Notice 700 paragraph 4.4 explains what is meant by a supply of goods for VAT purposes. Paragraph 4.5 of that notice explains what is meant by a supply of services. Issuing a horse passport is regarded as a supply of services for VAT purposes. Long-standing formal agreements with our European partners allow us to keep our zero rates as they currently stand but do not allow us to extend them or introduce new ones. Article 13 of the sixth VAT Directive lays down mandatory exemptions and does not permit exemption for this type of supply. We are therefore unable to introduce any new VAT relief either for the issuing of horse passports or for the materials used in their production.
<P>

<a name="40323w02_para2"></a>For horse owners these European agreements also mean that VAT incurred on purchases can only be reclaimed when it relates to taxable business activities. Private owners will therefore be unable to reclaim any VAT incurred in purchasing a horse passport.
