First, are the Government satisfied that their fiscal stimulus package, announced in the Pre-Budget Report, and their quantitative easing policy are working effectively? Secondly, is there adequate take-up of their schemes to help businesses through bank lending, notably the enterprise finance guarantee and working capital schemes and the capital for enterprise fund?</p>

In response to his direct questions about UK government action and whether it is having an effect, yes, I believe that it is. There is not just the fiscal stimulus but a whole range of issues: financial support to the banking industry and banking recapitalisation; the Pre-Budget Report fiscal stimulus, helping businesses, consumers and individuals; the home owner mortgage support scheme, with mortgage repossessions now half the rate that they were in previous recessions; 350,000 new apprenticeships; the business finance package, including the items that the noble Lord suggested, which I believe are having an effect; other measures to support the car industry; and extra resources for Jobcentre Plus.</p>

That is why not only are we ensuring that the generality of the support system is available for young people, but currently, after six months of unemployment, young people can enter the mandatory New Deal to get extra support. More recently, we have introduced the young person&#146;s guarantee, which is that within the first 12 months of someone under 24 being on JSA they have the guaranteed offer of a job, work-focused training or meaningful activity. I believe that that is the right way to support young people in these challenging times, in contrast to times gone by, when they were just left on the scrapheap.</p>

That is because of changes to the lone parent obligations. The noble Lord will be aware of the thrust of the reforms in place, which is progressively to move lone parents on to an active benefit.

The fact that any person who wishes to seek employment is unemployed is unacceptable and we should recognise the human tragedy in all this.

Accordingly, we are in a position to do precisely what we are doing, which is supporting the economy and providing real help now to British businesses and families.

Following the 2007 gift aid consultation exercise, we introduced a wide-ranging package of simplification measures, and at Budget 2009, we announced new research into the effect of charitable tax relief on donors to inform thinking on gift aid.

Is he aware that the latest HMRC figures for repayments of tax under the gift aid scheme indicate that were it not for the transitional relief, the amount of money charities would have earned under the gift aid scheme would have fallen in the previous financial year? The figures seem to indicate a fall of something of the order of &#163;53 million. Transitional relief is running only until 2011. The sector is very worried and keen to ensure that income under gift aid is protected. Will the Government look again at the sector&#146;s proposal for an accounts-based system, which would help smaller charities access gift aid and those charities already running a gift aid scheme?</p>

The value of gift aid to charities has increased from &#163;135 million in 1996-97 to &#163;891 million in 2008-09. The Government introduced transitional relief to ensure that charities were not affected as a consequence of the reduction we announced in the basic rate of taxation. We have also announced a number of other measures to support charities, in particular in the area of gift aid, including simplified forms and technology to facilitate use of gift aid by smaller charities. I will not anticipate at this stage the thinking of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which will clearly be informed by the research to be published in the autumn.

It is also evident that gifts of a non-monetary nature can create serious problems and issues, as experience in the United States and Canada has recently shown. I can assure my noble friend that the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport regularly keep the issues under review.</p>

<p><a name="qnpa_3"></a>To ask Her Majesty&#146;s Government why Samantha Orobator has not been repatriated from Laos to the United Kingdom, as Mr Bill Rammell, the then Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, informed the All-Party Group of the Abolition of the Death Penalty that she would be by the middle of June.</p>

We have proposed to the Lao authorities a memorandum of understanding to enable the transfer before the UK/Lao prisoner transfer agreement is formally ratified. However, it is unclear whether the Lao authorities will agree the transfer prior to payment of the $70,000 fine imposed on  Ms Orobator in addition to her life sentence.</p>

This case has considerable implications for other prisoners in other countries. In this case, the treaty that the Minister mentioned, signed on 7 May, was a general one. I understand that the application for Ms Orobator&#146;s transfer was forwarded on 17 June. A month has gone by and there is the problem of the last date by which she may be allowed to fly back by an airline. Bearing in mind that to facilitate this transfer she has revoked her right to appeal and any suggestion that she might have been raped in prison, has the Minister any hope that this may be speeded up?</p>

Time is running out; 12 August is thought to be the last date by which she could travel. We have had regular consular contact with her, most recently at the end of last week. I am pleased to say that she and the unborn child are in good health. They have been visited by a doctor attached to the Australian embassy in Laos. The issue is that the Laotian authorities want the fine imposed on her paid before she can leave. This is a difficult issue. It is not something that the UK Government feel able to pay and yet she is a woman of limited means. Unless they are willing to waive that or others are willing to pay, this will remain a real obstacle to her early return.</p>

While I appreciate that the Government cannot themselves provide the money to pay the $70,000, or whatever it is, in this case, or any future fines that may be imposed on people as a condition of their being allowed to invoke the repatriation agreement, would the Minister at least indicate that the Government will give their blessing to any independent fund established for the payment of this fine and any others that may enable people to be repatriated?</p>

<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1170"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have set out a comprehensive plan for carbon across every sector&#151;energy, homes, transport, agriculture and business.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09071563000061"></a>A decade ago the carbon impact of most policies was not even measured. Last year, this House passed legislation for legally binding carbon budgets, measurable caps on carbon. This was a dramatic change in approach. But we need to go further because every part of government needs to be responsible for meeting these budgets.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09071563000062"></a>So I can announce that not just the country as a whole, and not just the biggest departments, but from today, every department has its own carbon budget. Having been the first country in the world to set legally binding carbon budgets, we are now the first country in the world to assign every department a carbon budget alongside its financial budget.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09071563000063"></a>The plan sets out how we will meet the carbon budgets set out by the Chancellor for an 18 per cent reduction in today&#146;s levels by 2020, or 34 per cent compared to 1990, part of the necessary steps we have to make to get a global deal this December. Let me announce to the House how we make the 459 million tonnes of carbon savings to meet our carbon budgets. In agriculture and waste, there will be a 6 per cent cut in emissions&#151;20 million tonnes&#151;by the budget period centred on 2020, made possible by new policies on waste and new commitments on farming. In the transport sector, there will be savings of 14 per cent by 2020, or 85 million tonnes, as set out in my right honourable friend&#146;s sustainable transport strategy published today. This includes plans for electrification of rail, tougher car and van emission standards, and the new &#163;30 million fund to get low-carbon buses on the road in the next two years.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09071563000064"></a>We are also doing more to bring about the transition to electric cars, with new funding making possible a recharging infrastructure in up to six cities. And across business and the workplace, we show how we can make 41 million tonnes of savings, or 13 per cent on today, including with the carbon reduction commitment being introduced next year.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="09071563000065"></a>The most important reductions to meet our carbon budgets come in the way we generate and use energy. In the power and heavy industry sector, we show how emissions will be reduced by 22 per cent, or 248 million tonnes. With North Sea gas production declining, if we carried on with business as usual, over the next decade our imports of gas would double. On the basis of the low-carbon choices I announce today, our forecast is that, rather than double our gas imports, they are kept down to 2010 levels for the whole of the following decade. So with more low carbon, home-grown energy, we avoid an ever-increasing dependence on imports.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09071563000066"></a>I have listened to representations on renewable energy and I have concluded that for reasons of energy security and climate change, it is right to go ahead with plans for 15 per cent domestic renewable energy by 2020. In the final decisions of the Government&#146;s renewable energy strategy that I have published today, we show how we can secure around 30 per cent of electricity from wind, marine and other renewable sources. We are also publishing the shortlist of Severn tidal schemes.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1171"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09071563000067"></a>I believe it is right to go ahead with our plans for new nuclear power stations. We will publish our national policy statements on nuclear and other energy issues in the autumn, and the industry is planning at least 12.4 gigawatts of new stations, more than current existing capacity.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09071563000068"></a>Alongside the most environmentally stringent coal conditions in the world, the Government have proposed up to four carbon capture and storage projects and we have proposed legislation in the next Session of Parliament to make it happen.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09071563000069"></a>Let me be clear. I believe that when it comes to the future of energy in Britain, clean coal has an essential role to play. Renewables, nuclear, clean fossil fuels, as this plan sets out, are the trinity of low carbon and the future of energy in Britain. What would be fatal is to pick and choose between them. All of them should be part of our future energy mix. In total, our plans show we will get 40 per cent of our electricity from low carbon energy by 2020 and more in the years afterwards. To deliver the changes in our energy supplies between now and 2020, we must make it easier for investors to turn low carbon projects into reality. Having tackled rules on planning, I believe we now need to do more to address the issue of grid connection.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09071563000070"></a>So I am today announcing that I will exercise the reserve powers provided under the Energy Act 2008 for government, rather than the regulator, to set the grid access regime. The new rules should be in place within 12 months and, instead of waiting for over a decade for grid connection, as can happen now, we can get the fast access to the grid that renewable projects need. We also know that as we generate power in a cleaner way, we also need to use energy in a smarter way in our homes. In total, in the plan, we show how cleaner sources of heat and better use of energy can cut emissions from our homes by one quarter compared to today and save 57 million tonnes.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09071563000071"></a>We must transform the information on energy use available to all of us. So, as well as putting in place new funding today for smart grids, we are proposing to roll out smart meters to 26 million homes by 2020. We need new incentives, as well as better information. The plan makes clear that, on energy efficiency, we need a house-by-house, street-by-street transformation, like the transition from town gas to North Sea gas in the 1970s. Over the next decade, our plan sees families not having to pay up front but being able to spread the costs over many years, paid for out of the savings on their energy bills. Today, we take the first steps with the first pilots of the new pay-as-you-save scheme.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09071563000072"></a>As well as information for individuals and the right incentives, we know from the Transition Towns movement the power of community action to motivate people. So, we will provide &#163;500,000 each to fifteen areas of the country for people to come together to trial the newest technologies and be beacons for how other communities can cut their carbon emissions. From next April, I can confirm that individuals and communities alike will be able, for the first time, to generate their own renewable power and sell it back to the grid with guaranteed feed-in tariffs. The details of the rates and levels on which we are consulting are set out today.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1172"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09071563000073"></a>We need reforms not just in the way we produce energy and in how we use it, but also how it is regulated. In the energy world of today, unlike 20 years ago, the job of the regulator is to help deliver on our climate change commitments because failure to act on this now will store up greater cost later. So, I propose to make changes to Ofgem&#146;s principal objective. For the first time, reducing carbon emissions, as part of protecting the future consumer, will be explicitly set out in its guiding mission.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09071563000074"></a>Competition is essential but we know from the experience of prepayment meters that it has not delivered for all consumers. So I will also make it clearer in Ofgem&#146;s principal objective that, when competition does not deliver, it is Ofgem&#146;s duty proactively to stand up for consumers up and down this country. With greater expectations of the regulator should come greater powers when it needs them. So I also propose to legislate to provide Ofgem with new tough powers to take action where it believes there is anti-competitive practice in the generation of electricity.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09071563000075"></a>Strong regulation is all the more important given the upward pressure on energy prices in the coming years. Making the energy transition will have costs but, for households, they are significantly offset by savings on energy efficiency and reduced energy demand. Today&#146;s plan will not increase average household energy bills by 2015, compared to now. For households in 2020, the plans today will mean an average of 6 per cent on domestic bills, or &#163;75 a year, compared to today; and, including all previous policy announcements on climate change, the figure is 8 per cent.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09071563000076"></a>Given the costs of transition and the priority of tackling fuel poverty, I believe we need to do more to protect the most vulnerable consumers. So, today, I propose to reform the system of social tariffs. At the moment, more than 800,000 households receive discounts and other help with their energy bills. It is part of a voluntary agreement with the energy companies. I propose that after the voluntary agreement ends in 2011 discounts for the most vulnerable will continue not from a voluntary arrangement but through legislation for compulsory support from the energy companies. We will legislate to increase the amount spent and intend to target new resources at the most vulnerable consumers, particularly older, poorer pensioners.</p>

<a name="90715-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="09071563000077"></a>As we make the transition to low carbon, we must do so on the basis of energy security and fairness, and we must also seize the industrial opportunities using the money the Chancellor has allocated in the Budget. We have set out plans for the carbon capture and storage industry and, today, new investment in how Britain can lead in nuclear manufacturing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09071563000078"></a>In renewables, Britain has half the usable tidal energy in Europe. Today I am committing up to &#163;60 million to build our wave and tidal industries for testing new technologies, expanding port access and deployment in key parts of the country. We also need to nurture the offshore wind industry, where we have a unique resource. I am making available up to &#163;120 million to support the growth of a world-leading offshore wind industry in Britain. As well as supporting the demonstration and testing of offshore wind, the money will be used to attract offshore wind manufacturers to

We estimate that these investments will help nurture industries that can support hundreds of thousands of jobs&#151;investment we can make only today because, even in the tough times, we made the choice to invest in the economy of the future.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09071563000079"></a>Climate change is the moral issue of our time. In five months, the world must come together at Copenhagen and follow through on the commitment of world leaders last week to stop dangerous climate change. Today we show how Britain will play its part. Our transition plan is a route map to 2020. It strengthens our energy security. It seeks to be fair in the decisions we make. Above all, it rises to the moral challenge of climate change. This is a transition plan for Britain. I commend it to the House&#148;.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para2"></a>

It is a challenge to absorb its contents, but noble Lords will have also known much of it from the press coverage over the weekend and throughout the week, as well as the now-obligatory &#147;Today&#148; programme interview.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09071563000082"></a>We welcome the Statement as an important declaration of intent on the Government&#146;s part in tackling climate change and carbon emissions, as well as seeking to bring together something that could be tagged as an energy policy. That is long overdue, but when the Government have provided us with 15 Ministers in 12 years, it is not surprising that they have found it difficult to find a coherent voice in this key policy area. Do we not have the lowest percentage of energy generated from renewables within the EU?</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09071563000083"></a>We have no argument with the Government in seeking to reduce carbon emissions by 34 per cent by 2020&#151;or, if we take today&#146;s figures, by a more modest 18 per cent at current levels. It will be the minimum needed to be on course for the 2050 target of 80 per cent. I note the climate change committee&#146;s welcome, but point out that it is seven months since the committee published its report to which this is the Government&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09071563000084"></a>It is appropriate that the Statement starts with the Government&#146;s own role. The Sustainable Development Commission&#146;s 2008 report stated how variable the different departments are in achieving energy efficiency and performing to target. The Government should be taking an exemplary role in this matter, and they need to demonstrate that they are serious in their own endeavour if they expect business, households and consumers to do the same. There are too many areas where the message from the Government is mixed, or where they have failed to develop policies that reinforce this drive. The Minister will remember that, when discussing the climate change legislation, we wanted to include a provision that certain statutory instruments complied with the purposes of the Climate Change Act or furthered its purpose. This move was initially welcomed and accepted, the Minister in this House showing commitment to the cause, only for it later to be disregarded.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1174"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09071563000085"></a>The Statement promised 6 per cent cuts in emissions from agriculture and waste. Can the Minister further elaborate on how this will be done without passing greater burdens on to farmers, to whom we look to provide more of the nation&#146;s food? What funding stream do the Government intend to provide for this?</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09071563000086"></a>A substantial reduction of 14 per cent in transport emissions is likely to be heavily dependent on government funding. How will this be paid for? The Statement mentions electric cars. This simply illustrates one of the many commitments the Statement contains without declaring how it will be funded. Parliament and people are in the dark on public expenditure as, unprecedentedly, the Autumn Statement will not be delivered this year. It is not unreasonable to ask where the funding is coming from.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09071563000087"></a>I do not doubt the need for the Government to set these targets, but the delivery of any government strategy depends on an accurate assessment of the cost involved within the public sector and from businesses, households and consumers. Without this, the Statement is merely a statement of good intent, rather than a comprehensive programme of action.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09071563000088"></a>Of course, the Government are right to recognise the role of renewable energy. In a pre-Statement interview on the &#147;Today&#148; programme, the Secretary of State emphasised the need for land-based wind generation, and acknowledged that it was not enough simply to rely on offshore generation. How do the Government intend to use the planning system to deliver on this account? It has been estimated that the extra turbines will pass on a possible extra cost of &#163;200 per annum to households. It is also estimated that the current rate of construction of these turbines is one a week. Does the Minister appreciate the physical challenge that this presents? The Statement mentions the Severn tidal schemes. Have the Government worked out how to deliver tidal energy from the Severn estuary without damaging it? How dependent is this programme on the delivery of the strategy?</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09071563000089"></a>I hope the noble Lord will get the drift of my argument. Much of what the Statement contains is good and worthy stuff, but without the reassurance that the Government are prepared to deliver, it remains primarily aspirational and lacks the counterbalance of a full financial impact assessment. The Statement talks about building more nuclear power stations. However, we will have to wait until the autumn for the national policy statement on nuclear energy, although it is obviously a key part of the strategy. In the mean time, the Government still have no plan regarding what to do with existing nuclear waste. The strategy announced today can hardly be comprehensive if it does not include this.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09071563000090"></a>The Statement also announces that it will make changes in the energy supplies between now and 2020 to make it easier for investors to turn low-carbon projects into reality. How do the Government plan to do this? Will it involve further financial incentives or is it going to depend on an easing of planning restrictions.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09071563000091"></a>It would not do the Statement any injustice to suggest that it reads like a wish basket. For example, the noble Lord introduced the concept of smart meters into the Energy Act last year and it appears in this  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1175"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Statement. What progress is being made to develop this plan? How far have the Government got in discussing this with energy providers? Likewise, why have the Government resisted the concept of fixed feed-in tariffs? A debate in this House led from these Benches provided for this in the Energy Act when the Minister finally conceded the power of our argument.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09071563000092"></a>In short, while we welcome the Statement and the White Paper, for it aspires to be on the side of the angels, such virtue has a price and the Government in the Statement have been coy not only on how big the costs will be but, more critically, on where the funding is coming from and who will end up paying. Despite the Statement promising that there will be no increase in household fuel bills by 2015, I expect most people will be in a family household that will have to pick up the bill.</p>

I know the Government are keen to get on with the legislative programme of the House today, but given the importance of this subject, it was fitting that this Statement was heard, and I thank Ministers and the Official Opposition for allowing it to come forward.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09071563000094"></a>This is an important Statement. It moves from discussions on the Climate Change Bill to statements of intent, targets and ideas about legislation to taking action, although I note that the shortest chapter in the <I>Renewable Energy Strategy</I> is concerned with implementation, so perhaps there is a little more still to do there. Given the shift in thinking from considering carbon dioxide to assessing greenhouse gases as a whole&#151;in my opinion that is a correct shift&#151;it is interesting to note that the 34 per cent reduction comes down to 18 per cent, which is very manageable and is important to achieve, although many of the relevant reductions have already been achieved. In that sense much of the low-hanging fruit has already been taken.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09071563000095"></a>We are looking at this strategy up to 2020 in an environment of very tight public cash availability. Much of the investment will need to be private investment but we are still subject to a low carbon price. I have seen no reference to a carbon price in the documents or in the Statement, but clearly it will be one of the main drivers for the private sector. I do not think there is any real understanding of how we will ensure that those price signals are right to encourage the private sector to make the right decisions in this area. Indeed, I think that the ETS is mentioned in only one box in the accompanying papers.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09071563000096"></a>These Benches welcome much that is in the Statement and the strategy. The feed-in tariffs are to be implemented in April, but what about heat? The Statement mentions the grid in that connection but there is no mention of heat tariffs. I should be interested to hear about that. We welcome the strong focus on Ofgem reducing carbon emissions. However, on first reading the Statement, I was alarmed to note how uncompetitive the Government feel the electricity supply industry is, given that many years&#146; study have been devoted to that matter.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1176"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1176</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09071563000097"></a>We also welcome the measures concerning grid access. The fact that it can take 10 years to get connected to the grid, as the Statement says, is clearly unacceptable, and has been for some time. Do we not also need a smart grid to allow access for all the different types of electricity that will be available? What is the Government&#146;s view of the European supergrid, which will lead to much greater energy independence not just for us but for our European partners? Do the Government take a more favourable view of that now? I also welcome the introduction of departmental carbon budgets. This may not be the Minister&#146;s responsibility but it would be nice to see both Houses having their own carbon budgets. Perhaps that matter should be taken up elsewhere.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09071563000098"></a>However, we have a history of relative failure in this area. Sweden has already achieved a figure of about 30 per cent with regard to renewable energy. The figure for Germany&#151;a large economy&#151;is 10 per cent. We are still at 2 per cent, and are bottom of the league. As regards aspirations for manufacturing, noble Lords around the House agree that we want to stimulate a renewable energy industry in this country. However, we have a track record of recent closures in that regard. In terms of costs to consumers, I am pleased to see that social tariffs, which have worked only partly, will be overhauled. But surely with fuel poverty having gone up substantially and fuel prices going up under this regime, we should introduce something more radical whereby consumers pay less for lower consumption and more for greater consumption&#151;the opposite way round to the normal thinking on this issue.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09071563000099"></a>I have asked the Minister a number of Written Questions on skills needs. I am still unconvinced that we have sufficient staff with the relevant skills in the nuclear or the renewable industries. Smart meters are rather old news but I am glad to see that there is a commitment to implement them by the date set out.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09071563000100"></a>Insulation of the existing property stock clearly must be one of the most important areas. Although I accept that we need a programme that is similar to the North Sea gas conversion programme, the big difference is that households did not have to pay for that. They might have suffered inconvenience when someone changed their fittings or appliances, but they had no upfront costs to meet. Although there are various schemes to avoid cost, it would be dangerous to think that it will be quite as simple as that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09071563000101"></a>Beyond that, my questions for the Minister are as follows. The airline industry was not mentioned in the Statement, though there is a small reference to it in some of the supporting documentation. Is the airline industry included in these reduction figures? Will the carbon reduction commitment mentioned in the Statement at last discriminate between renewable and non-renewable electricity? Pre-payment meters are one of the greatest scandals of the energy supply industry and fuel poverty in this country, with pre-payment meter payers paying some &#163;95 more per year for their energy bills. Will that be solved more urgently than the smart meter programme? It is clearly an area of major social injustice. From these Benches, we welcome this Statement. It is now all about implementing it and making it happen.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, said that the Statement was long overdue. However, the Government have made a series of announcements over the last year or two, culminating in the transition plan, which sets out a coherent path for our transition to a low-carbon economy and deals with the critical issues that we face on energy policy. There have been announcements on new nuclear energy, coal CCS, our intention to hit the target on renewables of 15 per cent by 2020 and our focus on energy efficiency. These all represent a coherent approach to energy policy.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09071563000103"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, and the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, both spoke about where we stand on renewables. It is true that, in comparison with some European countries, our proportion of renewables is low. Much of that can be explained by other countries having made use of the natural resource of hydropower, which they have had for many years. My key point is that noble Lords should look at the increase that we have seen in the last few years. For instance, renewable electricity accounted for 2.3 per cent of electricity generated in 2003; that was up to 5.5 per cent by 2008. That suggests to me that we are making considerable progress, that we have a great deal of momentum in the system and that we can expect to see considerable increases in the future.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09071563000104"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Taylor talked about the variability of departments. I agree that departments need to set an example. He kindly did not mention the energy performance of my department&#146;s new building, which he will know is not the highest&#151;or, rather, the lowest. However, it is working with the Carbon Trust and has a commitment to increase its energy efficiency by 10 per cent over the next year. The department accepts the challenge to practise what it preaches. Of course, carbon budgets by themselves are important in driving policy change in different government departments. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, who knows a great deal about agriculture, asked whether a carbon budget would, as far as Defra is concerned, have a negative impact on agriculture. It need not. When I was at Defra, I took part briefly in discussions between the department and the agriculture and land sector on the best approach to reducing GHG emissions. I was encouraged by the positive view that was taken by people in the farming sector about their ability to do it. Of course, they will need encouragement, advice and support, but so far the discussions have been fruitful.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09071563000105"></a>As for the planning system, it was always disappointing that the noble Lord&#146;s party opposed key elements of our reform of the planning system. We think that the reform is very much in the national interest. Noble Lords will know that, historically, there have been delays in the planning system, particularly when it comes to renewables, but the same issues come up with other electricity generators. We will be publishing our national policy statements in the autumn. That was always the timetable. We think that that will be an important step along the way to a much more consistent and coherent planning system.</p>

Alongside this, the low-carbon industrial strategy sets out a range of actions that the Government are taking to support the UK supply chain industry. There is no reason why we cannot use the transition to a low-carbon economy as a way to grow the economy and grow high-quality jobs within the United Kingdom.</p>

An important part of the assessment is to deal with the issues that the noble Lord raised about the environmental assessment, the impact on the environment and what has to be made good under European legislation if one of the schemes is selected. We are very focused on those matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09071563000108"></a>As far as nuclear power is concerned, yes, it is very important that we make progress on publishing the national policy statement.

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09071563000109"></a>I was asked about financial incentives in relation to renewables. We will consult on increasing the financial incentives for offshore wind. On wave and tidal energy, we are prepared to look again at financial incentives if we receive evidence that suggests that we ought to do so. That is the basis on which we introduced the ROC banding system, which we debated only about nine months ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09071563000113"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, talked about tight cash and the scale of investment needed by the private sector. He is absolutely right. The best approach that we can take is to present a cohesive policy and stability and deal with issues of planning and access to the grid. In the White Paper, he will see that there is a chapter looking ahead to 2030 to 2050. We are doing further work analysing scenarios for that period, which we hope to publish next spring. We recognise that it is now and in the next few years that companies will make investment decisions that will impact, for instance, on energy supply going from 2030 to 2050, so I agree with his remarks on that.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09071563000114"></a>I know that companies are concerned about the low carbon price. There is to be a tightening of the EU ETS cap from 2013. I think that it must follow that, if there is a successful conclusion to Copenhagen, the EU will have an opportunity to look at its own targets again and potentially to tighten further the EU ETS cap.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09071563000115"></a>We always said that we thought that it would be 2011 before the renewable heat incentive could be brought in. The noble Lord will recall that this is a completely new policy. We need to get the work right and we hope to consult on it later in the year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09071563000116"></a>As for grid access, interim changes have been made introducing a system of connect and manage, which allows early access to the grid, but we must have permanent arrangements. Ofgem and the companies have not been able to reach agreement on this, which is why the Government are going to intervene. We will publish our deliberations in due course.</p>

<a name="90715-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09071563000117"></a>Finally, I understand the concerns of the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, about ensuring that we have the right skills in nuclear, renewables and, indeed, coal carbon capture and storage. We are very much committed to working with our partners in government and business to make sure that we do. The work of the National Skills Academy is one example of how we intend to do it.

Does he accept that there is another way to reduce CO2, which is to remove it from the atmosphere? Will he confirm that it is the Government&#146;s policy to increase the amount of woodland planted in England by 10,000 hectares a year for the next 10 years, thereby reducing the carbon emissions over this country by 50 million tonnes by 2050?

Further, when the Statement boasts that this is the first country in the world to set legally binding carbon budgets&#151;not to mention the departmental budgets&#151;is he aware that that is so only because there is not a single other country in the world that has the slightest intention of pursuing such a foolish and damaging policy?</p>

I certainly have been proved right on that. I do not agree with him at all. It is, in fact, a mistake to think that remaining as a high-carbon-emitting country is somehow an easier and cheaper option; nor do I accept his premise that the UK is alone in understanding that we need to move to a low-carbon world and that, to do so, decisions have to be taken. We believe that carbon budgets are the way in which to ensure that individual government departments develop their policies to ensure that they are consistent with a low-carbon economy.

I should also say to the noble Lord&#151;he will not like it when I mention the noble Lord, Lord Stern, because he does not agree with the noble Lord&#146;s analysis&#151;that the point that the noble Lord, Lord Stern, made is that the sooner this country gets on with moving to a low-carbon economy, the cheaper it will be.

Perhaps I may say as chairman of the Nuclear Industry Association that, although we are grateful for the warm words, we need rather more if the new power stations are to be connected to the grid. I am not quite sure what is meant in the White Paper when it states that later this year there will be,</p>

<p><a name="09071563000145"></a>That is an exercise in modern speak about which some of us are a bit cynical. Later this year, a statement will tell us that the national grid will be in step with the rest of the electricity industry in terms of planning for the future.

There are two issues. First, we have to ensure that the grid is fit for purpose in view of the enormous developments that will take place in electricity generation. I have already spoken about the Government&#146;s intention to intervene because of the disagreement between Ofgem and the companies, and we will do that. A smart grid is somewhat different but is very much linked to the idea of smart meters. It is about ensuring that we have a system that is as efficient as possible with regard to electricity transmission but which also links into smart meters. Such meters give householders and customers much more control in terms of information about their energy use and their ability to switch suppliers, and they will allow the generating system as a whole to be used in a much more efficient and effective way. The other point, which I did not answer earlier, was about the super grid, which is a proposal that has been put forward. We are interested, but it is very expensive. I have met the EU official who is leading work on that and I would be happy to provide more information on it in due course.</p>

However, I draw the Minister&#146;s attention to the somewhat dismissive way in which it deals with the value of such things as railway electrification, more or less saying that electricity has to come from somewhere and the railway does not carry much traffic. We know that small amounts of electrification of the railway will add considerably to the amount of use that can be made of the rest. Perhaps he would bring that to the attention of the Secretary of State. I also warn him that &#163;30 million spent on new buses is probably a waste of money if the people who let the contracts for the use of buses make it a condition that they emit less energy.</p>

The report was extremely helpful. I do not need much persuasion on the benefits of rail electrification. Any comments on the impact on the grid and electricity use should not be taken to mean that we do not support my noble friend Lord Adonis in his encouraging attempts to enhance the rail network as a whole. The importance of today&#146;s White Paper and the associated document produced by my noble friend Lord Adonis is to show the consistency of approach across Whitehall. That is where carbon budgets are so important. The Department for Transport has to accept responsibility for carbon emissions in its sector. That should drive the right policies and I am sure that the noble Lord would welcome what is a much more co-ordinated and holistic approach.</p>

Does the noble Lord agree with the figures that have been bandied about for the capital cost of construction of &#163;90 billion, plus &#163;10 billion for connection to the grid? Is that not a huge and uneconomic cost for plant with a load factor of only 30 per cent? It is the worst option of all the renewables options available.</p>

That is why it is so important. I know that the noble Lord is not convinced of the science. He is perhaps not alone in this House. I am certainly not unaware of those views, but the overwhelming scientific consensus&#151;the work of the IPCC&#151;is clear about the hugely negative impact that climate change is having and will have in future.

We are committed to 15 per cent renewable energy by 2020. We think it right to go down that route.

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09071563000136"></a>On the question of the cost of the proposed measures, there is an analytical annexe to the White Paper which has a number of tables about the cost of bills and takes account of energy efficiency. We should not knock the thought of energy efficiency, because the evidence is that such measures work. Essentially, Table 16 says that if you take account of the impact of all climate change policies, including some of the costs to which we have already referred in this Statement about renewables, but also the reduced costs through greater energy efficiency, an average householder&#146;s bill would increase by about 8 per cent, or &#163;92 per householder, in 2020.</p>

Indeed, the Government have committed to that. How are we going to ensure that people know that the Treasury will not just use the money for something else and that the Treasury is half way to agreeing the principle of hypothecation? Would my noble friend care to comment?</p>

Talking about Treasury hypothecation usually lands Ministers in trouble. There are two points to be made. First, as was debated during proceedings on the Energy Bill and the Climate Change Bill, it is important that there should be transparency. That is why we have been very clear about what we believe to be the additional costs that householders will have to pay as a result of all of the climate change policies that are taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09071563000140"></a>Equally, when it comes to price and tariffs, we have to ensure that the system is fair. That is why we are very keen to ensure that Ofgem has the powers to intervene where necessary. The other side of the coin is that we have to help householders to become more energy efficient, to give them support, and to have new mechanisms so that when it is expensive for them to take measures they can do it in an affordable way and with a payback period over the length of any loan that might have to be taken out.</p>

There are five government amendments that I wish to speak to briefly, and I will do my best to respond to the other amendments in this group later in the debate.</p>

<a name="90715-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09071565000002"></a>The first<b></b>government amendment, Amendment 187BA, provides that the deputy chair of the council should be appointed from the judicial members. The proposals in the Bill make clear that the chair of the council should be a member of the judiciary. This is simply to ensure that all levels of the judiciary can have confidence that the guidelines are created and issued with the endorsement of experienced judicial members. The one specific role of the deputy is to chair the council in the absence of the chairing member. On reflection, the Government consider that this function should also fall to a judicial member to ensure full confidence by the judiciary in the work of the council.</p>

<a name="90715-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09071565000003"></a>Amendment 187BB introduces greater flexibility in the appointment of the judicial members. The amendment removes the need for a set number of judicial members at each level of the judiciary and replaces it with a less restrictive requirement that there should be representation from each of the main levels of the judiciary. This amendment means that it is open to the Lord Chief Justice, in appointing the eight judicial members, to decide what the appropriate number for each level of the judiciary should be, subject to a requirement that there be at least one magistrate, one district judge and one circuit judge.</p>

<a name="90715-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09071565000004"></a>The last substantive government amendment, Amendment 188AA, creates a new post, that of president of the sentencing council. The president of the sentencing council will be, ex officio<I>, </I>the<I></I>Lord Chief Justice. The president is not a member of the council and does not chair the council. The Gage working group made clear that it considered that role too demanding on the time of the Lord Chief Justice. The Government recognise, however, that the Lord Chief Justice as the head of the judiciary in England and Wales and president of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division should be associated in some way with a body that produces guidance to all levels of the judiciary. This new role of president allows the Lord Chief Justice to be associated with the council and to attend and speak at the council, but does not require him to be involved in the day-to-day  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1185"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>running of the council. The nature of this amendment has necessitated some discussion with the Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge. While the policy aspects of legislative proposals are for Parliament to decide, the Lord Chief Justice has confirmed that he ought to undertake this role. Amendments 187AA and 188AB are consequential upon the main amendments. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_93"></a>
<a name="09071565000005"></a><b><a name="90715-0004.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="09071565000030"></a>Lord Henley:</b> I shall speak to Amendments 187AB and 187BC. Following on from the Minister&#146;s amendments, they are probing amendments relating to the composition of the Sentencing Council for England and Wales as set out in Schedule 13. I understand that there are other amendments in the group in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, and the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, to which we shall come later.</p>

<a name="90715-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09071565000006"></a>As I said, ours are purely probing amendments. The first is consequential on the second and suggests that four rather than two lay justices should sit on the council, therefore boosting the total number of judicial numbers to 10 compared with six non-judicial members. We have tabled these amendments after listening, with some sympathy, to representations from the Magistrates&#146; Association. It pointed out that as 95 per cent of all criminal matters appear in magistrates&#146; courts, inevitably any new sentencing guidelines will have the most widespread effect in those courts. The Magistrates&#146; Association has thus suggested, perhaps not unreasonably, that its representation should be boosted to recognise the special responsibility it will have in setting out any new guidelines. An added benefit would be to increase the majority of judicial members, who, after all, will be the people with the most direct experience of applying advice on sentencing.</p>

<a name="90715-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09071565000007"></a>It is possible that the Government have arrived at the perfect combination&#151;it is possible that they have not; we do not know&#151;and have put careful thought into selecting the appropriate proportion of judicial and non-judicial members of the council, but I hope that our amendments will at least provide an opportunity for the Government to explain the reasoning behind their numbering and the proportions that are before us.</p>

<p><a name="st_94"></a>
<a name="09071565000008"></a><b><a name="90715-0004.htm_spnew20"></a><a name="09071565000031"></a>Lord Dholakia:</b> My Amendment 188 is grouped with a number of others on the Marshalled List. The Minister will recall that when I spoke during Second Reading he welcomed our contribution on matters relating to the sentencing council, and I hope that he will look favourably at this modest amendment and respond positively.</p>

<a name="90715-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09071565000009"></a>The Sentencing Council for England and Wales, which the Bill establishes, will have eight judicial members and six lay members. Paragraph 4 of Schedule 13 sets out a number of areas in which the lay members will have experience. These include: criminal defence, criminal prosecution, policing, sentencing policy and the administration of justice, the promotion of the welfare of victims of crime, academic study or research relating to criminal law or criminology and the use of statistics. So far, so good, and we certainly welcome this. It is a logical list of areas in which members of the sentencing council might be expected to have expertise.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1186"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09071565000010"></a>However, there is one surprising omission: namely, the list does not include any mention of experience in the rehabilitation of offenders. I have repeatedly raised this issue in your Lordships&#146; Chamber. It is a very strange omission in view of the requirements in Clause 106(11)(d) that the sentencing council should have regard, among other things, to the,</p>
<ul><a name="09071565000025"></a>&#147;effectiveness of different sentences in preventing re-offending&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071565000023"></a>It is true that an academic criminologist could contribute knowledge to the sentencing council on this point, but it would surely be more helpful for the council to have input from a member or members with practical experience of preventing re-offending by rehabilitating offenders.</p>

<a name="90715-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09071565000011"></a>As to the other areas of expertise listed in the schedule, the implication is that lay members of the sentencing council will have had practical experience, not just academic knowledge, of policing, criminal defence, prosecution and the welfare of victims. The argument for the relevance of experience is at least equally strong in the re-education of offenders, particularly as it impacts on the likelihood of reoffending, which is such an important consideration for the welfare of society.</p>

<a name="90715-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09071565000012"></a>This is a modest amendment, and I am sure the Minister will look positively on the inclusion of the rehabilitation of offenders as part of the membership of this council.</p>

Some of these suggestions may be modest but the membership of the council will to a large extent determine not only what sort of council it will be but also whether the purposes of the council, which we discussed earlier on sentencing, are likely to be fully realised.</p>

<a name="90715-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09071565000014"></a>We fully support the Government&#146;s recommendations for the Lord Chief Justice to have a sort of hands-off role as president. It seems right and proper for the head of the judiciary to be in this position without being expected to be fully involved at all times. He will be a presence to be called on if it anyone ever judges it necessary. Yet we also support a balance between judicial and non-judicial members.</p>

<a name="90715-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09071565000015"></a>Sentencing councils in other parts of the world have a range of ways of being constituted, including those which are entirely non-judicial. The voices of non-judicial members who are clearly extremely expert and well informed in their particular fields are equally important in developing the sort of guidance sentencers should have. Their knowledge and direct contact with what is going on in the community and the wider fields of criminal justice will be essential in forming the sort of guidance that is likely to lead to effective sentencing that reduces reoffending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09071565000016"></a>I must declare that I am not a lawyer in any form. My experience as a sentencer was a few years as a magistrate in the Thames court in the 1980s and a further nine years in Scotland as a children&#146;s panel member until I came to your Lordships&#146; House. Having worked in various fields within criminal justice,   


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1187"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I believe that those skills and experiences relating to the criminal justice world are extremely important in informing the guidance that sentencers need.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09071565000017"></a>We have moved a long way from the exclusivity of sentencers and the monopoly of wisdom on the subject. Admittedly, it may feel uncomfortable to some of them to be consulting with other such non-experts. I well remember in the mid-80s when I arranged for a distinguished judge, Peter Pain&#151;some noble Lords presents may remember him&#151;to give a public lecture in the central area of Winchester Crown Court on sentencing. This caused a real frisson among some of his colleagues because in those days judges did not do things like coming out and talking to the great British public so publicly. Now it is relatively commonplace. For example, early on in his tenure as Lord Chief Justice, the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, gave a significant lecture at Oxford University on the importance of alternatives to custody and the relative pointlessness of short custodies&#151;one, I regret, that was not organised by myself. It was memorable both symbolically and in what he had to say.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09071565000018"></a>As sentencers move out into the wider world&#151;when they can, busy men and women that they are&#151;they are advised not only within their courts but from outside. We hope that, for example, the problem-solving courts will become a model for the future when judges are involved there and then when decisions on a particular judgment are put in place on the spot. Additionally, increasing work is being done to divert people in trouble away from the courts at all, particularly the most vulnerable, such as women, children and the mentally ill, because it is recognised that it is outwith court that their offending, and their needs underpinning their offending, will be better met, for the public to be freed from their reoffending. People who work at that interface and beyond, with other particular skill sets, have voices that must be heard within the council and in equal measure.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09071565000019"></a>For that reason, I warmly support my noble friend&#146;s amendment for the inclusion of someone with experience in the rehabilitation of offenders, which is not merely theoretical but practical. There is no substitute for first-hand knowledge of the realities and their relevance and usefulness to particular situations. Of course, the reality sometimes does not tally with what the theory might initially have suggested.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09071565000020"></a>It is extremely important that someone with experience of children and young people from the youth justice world is included. We have a terrible record in this country on how we deal with children and young people. It is a source of continuing shame that we, alone in the rest of Europe and many other parts of the world, actually lock up children as young as 12 in that part of the prison estate called secure training centres. Most of these children have a range of the most desperate situations and problems and are the most vulnerable in society; they also commit some shocking offences, but it is vital that their needs are met, first and foremost, as in Scotland through the children&#146;s panels, rather than through the punitive ethos of the STCs, whose effectiveness with regard to reoffending and public safety is the worst in the whole estate.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09071565000021"></a>I sincerely hope that no one in this House does not agree that how we deal with children, starting with our own, is simply not the same as it is for adults. In the world of offending, it needs real expertise and understanding, which goes far beyond those of us uninvolved in that world. We currently have more than 6,000 children and young people in prison, including the YOIs, whose offending may on occasions be awful, but whose circumstances are equally and desperately awful. I like to think that, with someone with the right knowledge and expertise on this council, we might have a chance to get things a little more right than we do at the moment.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09071565000022"></a>Lastly, my other amendment in this group may seem inappropriate to some, but it contains a serious suggestion, and I hope and expect that we will get some serious discussion on it from the Government. I suggest that a representative of the media should also be included in the non-judicial part of the council. The role of the media in the public perception of law and order, the state of our criminal justice system and the understanding of the work and effectiveness, or otherwise, of our judiciary, is a huge topic, which has consumed endless man and woman hours of discussion and miles of column inches&#151;too much for this part of our debate to really do justice to today, if noble Lords will excuse the pun.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09071566000001"></a>It is a given that neither people in the media nor the public at large have much confidence in our criminal justice system, and even less understanding, yet it is the one that informs the other more than any other means of communication. Confidence is rooted in understanding, which can only grow with knowledge. At the moment, the principal source of knowledge that most people have is through the press, radio and TV. I illustrate that with headlines such as &#147;Soft lives and crimes of the lenient judges&#148; in the <I>Sunday Times</I>, &#147;Shocking figures show judges are jailing fewer criminals&#148; in the <I>Daily Mail</I>, or &#147;Top cop gunning for &#145;soft&#146; judges&#148; in the <I>Sun</I>. Is it any wonder that there is not much informed confidence in what is happening in our courts? Perhaps I should also declare an interest as the wife of a journalist so that I can vouch for the fact that many journalists, including those on the <I>Sunday Times</I>, for which my husband worked for many years, are responsible and well informed people. Many in the Chamber may say, &#147;Some of my best friends are journalists&#148;.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09071566000002"></a>Many studies have shown that the public&#146;s perception of crime is that it is rising, so who, for example, would believe that levels of knife crime across the country have remained stable? They show the prevalence of the belief that sentences are too lenient, while at the same time substantially underestimating the proportion of convicted offenders who are sentenced to prison. Indeed, research on attitudes has shown that when the public are given the facts on specific cases with a range of sentencing options, including custody and alternatives, they invariably favour the more lenient ones. Politicians and policy-makers, who also read the <I>Daily Mail</I> as well as the <I>Sunday Times</I>, remain convinced that what the public require of them is to be tough. The current Lord Chancellor has declared himself proud of the fact that this Administration have increased the number of people sent to prison. He hopes that that will act as

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09071566000003"></a>I suggest that one media person on the council will not change all that overnight, but could make a seriously needed start in shifting some of these perceptions. It would also offer the opportunity of developing a greater openness and trust between the media and sentencers that could help with the community education role of the council, which I will come to when we discuss Clause 115.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09071566000004"></a>I believe that the amendment offers the much needed possibility for change, and I hope the Government will take it seriously.</p>

It seems to me that while making particular points relating to their amendment, both are very keen on the notion that there should be a combination of judicial and non-judicial members with various kinds of experience on the Sentencing Council. The range of experience on the Sentencing Council is of great importance in adding value to the experience of the trial judge whose final responsibility is to pronounce sentence&#151;subject, that is, to appeal. Like the Liberal Democrat Members, I very strongly agree with the broad thrust of the Government&#146;s proposals that the council should be composed of a mix of judicial and non-judicial members.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09071566000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, particularly wanted to add somebody with experience in the rehabilitation of offenders to the range of non-judicial members required in paragraph (4) of Schedule 4. Many years ago I was a member of the Parole Board for England and Wales. I remember distinctly one group of people who were always represented and of great value. They came from the Probation Service. They are specifically the people whom the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, will have in mind as being particularly experienced with the rehabilitation of offenders. I would welcome that.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09071566000007"></a>I am not quite so sure about the other amendment, and I think that the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, recognised that the media may cause difficulties. My main point in relation to youth offending and the media&#151;which the noble Baroness emphasised&#151;is that there are only to be six non-judicial members; the amendments do not seek to change that. Seven different levels of experience are already specifically mentioned in the schedule and we might have eight, nine or 10. There is nothing necessarily wrong with that because the choices can be made from among those. However, if I were to give a preference of adding or not adding, I would add, for the reasons I have mentioned, the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, but leave aside those recommended by the noble Baroness.</p>

I was a Lord Chief Justice who, unfortunately, had the burden of

I had great hopes for it and thought that it was one of the most positive things that had happened recently in the sentencing area. Equally, I accept that for the Lord Chief Justice to be a regular member and chair of the Sentencing Guidelines Council is not desirable. It takes up far too much of his time. I can well understand the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Bach, in that respect.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09071566000009"></a>We found that one of most difficult tasks that the Sentencing Guidelines Council had was to ensure that when the guidelines were issued, they were not immediately rubbished by the media. I can well remember the times that I tried to explain to the media that these guidelines were very sensible and were the product of a great deal of research and very hard work by the council, yet they were given a very rough reception. That damaged the ability of the guidelines to achieve their objective. Therefore, having someone who understood the workings of the media could be of value to the council. I do not say that you have to have someone with that experience but I certainly see nothing wrong with it being a factor that makes someone eligible to be a member of the council.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09071566000010"></a>The other two suggestions speak for themselves and my taking up time encouraging their inclusion is not needed.</p>

I commend the Government for the steps that they have taken to try to improve the criminal justice system in the way that it treats children and their endeavours to keep children out of the criminal justice system through <I>Care Matter</I><I>s</I><I>: Time for Change</I> and <I>Every Child Matters</I>.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09071566000012"></a>However, we start from an extraordinarily low base. UNICEF has identified us as the worst performing developed country in terms of the welfare of children. The Church of England&#146;s good childhood inquiry again identified how troubled many of our children are, particularly in this country, where there are  very high levels of family breakdown. So often we  are punishing our children because of their family backgrounds; because their parents are alcohol-dependent or drug-dependent; because they are bereaved and have lost a parent; because their parents have broken up; or because they belong to a generation-after-generation dysfunctional family.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09071566000013"></a>That is not to say that, for instance, those under 14 should not be treated firmly and made responsible for their actions, but we should take a more welfare-based approach to their needs. Most other countries have a minimum age of criminal responsibility above the age of 14. I am very concerned that many of these children, in particularly those under the age of 14, believe that it is their responsibility when their parents break up; when they feel unloved; when they see their parents fighting with one another. Working with children, I am so familiar with this. The child believes, &#147;It is my fault that my family is not working&#148;. That is the nature of being a child: one imagines that the world revolves around one and that one is responsible for these things. By branding them as criminals at the age

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09071566000014"></a>I strongly second what the noble Baroness has said about the overpunitive nature of our society. This is well reflected in the international surveys such as that done by UNICEF. If we just look at the care system in this country, which we all recognise has failed our most vulnerable children, and look in the mirror, we have to see that unfortunately, historically, we have not treated our vulnerable children with support and understanding but with a lack of understanding and an overpunitive approach.</p>

I declare an interest as patron of a secure unit, which does very good work and which many of the young people, boys and girls, do not want to leave. It is the only secure place that they have had in their entire lives. It is important that that aspect of sentencing should be in the forefront in the minds of the members of the sentencing council. I very much support it.</p>

He pointed out that, in the selection of people eligible for appointment as non-judicial members, not all the members from those disciplines have to be represented. It strikes me that people who have experience in the use of statistics, or are concerned with academic study or research relating to criminal law or criminology, are the sort of people who could give evidence to the Sentencing Council and help it in its task. I would have thought that that was much less significant in the formation of policy, providing that they were there as advisers, than having people with experience of rehabilitation of offenders, youth offending and the media. It would be highly desirable to try to tie in the media to what the Sentencing Council is doing, and to try to end the desperate division that currently exists between the media&#146;s perception of what happens in court and what actually happens.</p>

The noble Lord would not have had the benefit of seeing the government amendments to which I have spoken today, which were tabled at approximately the same time as his. They will remove the requirements for a set number of members at each level of the judiciary while ensuring that there is at least one magistrate, one district judge and one circuit judge.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09071566000018"></a>Of course, under our amendments it is open to the Lord Chief Justice to nominate the judicial members in the balance of numbers that he thinks is appropriate for the council. In this way, the overall membership of the council remains at 14 and the balance between the judicial and non-judicial membership&#151;8:6&#151;remains the same, with a small judicial majority.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09071566000019"></a>The Government are aware of the important role that lay magistrates play in our criminal justice system. Of course magistrates should be represented on the council. Under our amendments, there must be at least one magistrate, with an option open to the Lord Chief Justice to appoint more. We believe that conferring the discretion on the Lord Chief Justice is a better approach, on balance, than prescribing a set number of magistrates and judges at each level of the judiciary to sit on the council.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09071566000020"></a>Before I turn to the other amendments, I thank all noble Lords for their general support for the approach that we have adopted in this part of the Bill regarding the make-up of the council. Not least, I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, with his experience in this field for what he had to say about the role of the Lord Chief Justice in the sentencing council.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09071566000021"></a>What I am going to say is similar to what my noble friend Lord Borrie suggested a few minutes ago. We accept Amendment 188, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, which seeks to add to the skills that the Justice Secretary considers in appointing non-judicial members of the council experience of the rehabilitation of offenders. The importance of placing emphasis on the rehabilitation of offenders has been raised on both sides of the Committee, not least by the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, in our debates two days ago. The Government recognise the importance of rehabilitation and reducing reoffending and agree that skills in that field should be considered in the appointment of non-judicial members of the council. So we welcome and support Amendment 188.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09071566000022"></a>We are not unsympathetic to the other amendments, but we do not think that the case is really made in either of the two fields that the noble Baroness refers to. Let me try briefly to explain why. Amendment 188A would add to the skills non-judicial members&#146; experience of the media. While I recognise that it is important for a body such as the council to communicate well with the public and the media, we do not think it necessary to include a representative of the media among the non-judicial members of the council. There is a need for public debate on sentencing and how sentences are reported, but we are not persuaded that a media representative on the council is the way to address this. First, the council itself will need specialist media staff to deal with media interest in this field. Secondly, many of the non-judicial members in their own right, by virtue of their current positions, will have considerable media experience. So we do not feel it necessary to put that in the Bill.</p>

<a name="90715-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09071566000023"></a>As far as youth offending is concerned, no one doubts the importance of dealing with young offenders, but the list of skills of non-judicial members, as my noble friend indicated, already includes experience of youth offending. I will give two examples. The member with experience of policing will surely have experience of youth offending. Also, I would expect the member with experience of sentencing policy and the administration of justice to have experience of sentencing youths. While recognising the good intent behind the amendment, we do not think that it is necessary, given the range and depth of experience

Later, we shall debate amendments in the names of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, which seek to clarify what the courts must do. However, we must first consider what the sentencing council does. It will draw up guidelines for sentencing which&#151;even if we dispute that the courts must follow them and say instead that they should have regard to them&#151;will have a real impact on decisions made by judges and magistrates when handing down sentences. It is crucial, therefore, that the guidelines are drawn up in the interests of justice and not used as a back door for the Government to interfere with the discretion of the judiciary. That is why some of the provisions in Clause 106 have given us cause for concern.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09071566000033"></a>Subsection (11) sets out, as I said, the matters to which the council must have regard when setting sentencing guidelines. Paragraph (b), which is the first one that we wish to delete and would be removed by Amendment 188CA, says that the council must have regard to,</p>
<ul><a name="09071566000116"></a>&#147;the need to promote consistency in sentencing&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90715-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09071566000034"></a>At first glance, that seems entirely unobjectionable. It is a frequent complaint that sentences appear to make little sense or that there is wide disparity in the sentences handed down by different courts in different parts of the country as punishment for the same crime. However, a closer analysis would tell us what we already know: every crime is different; it involves different defendants, different victims, different motives and so on. It is to respond to those unavoidable differences that we rightly allow&#151;indeed, demand&#151;that the judiciary be flexible and exercise its discretion when sentencing. The same should apply to the council. While it may be acceptable for the council to set parameters within which judges can exercise their discretion, we would be entirely opposed to any attempt to try to straitjacket it by setting overly restrictive guidelines in a misguided attempt to achieve the impossible&#151;that is, uniform sentencing for a kaleidoscope of different circumstances. We need the Government to show that they are alert to the risk of interfering with judicial independence, however indirectly it might appear to be happening.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09071566000035"></a>The second amendment that I have tabled&#151;Amendment 188CC&#151;would remove paragraph (d), which the noble Baroness will also seek to remove but then reinsert in a slightly different manner in the form of two new paragraphs. We believe that the provision is an unacceptable attempt to shove problems that are properly the province of the Executive and the legislature into the field of the judiciary. Working out how much money is available is obviously a job for the Government, for which they need to seek the approval of Parliament.

Such a duty would oblige the council to have regard to this new factor alongside the others to which it must already have regard. I understand that the working group was divided as to the advantages and disadvantages of this proposal, but a majority was against. The report stated that those in the in the working group,</p>
<ul><a name="09071566000117"></a>&#147;who do not favour imposing this duty on the SGC believe that to do so would inevitably lead the SGC to consider matters of policy relating to resources, which are the province of Parliament. For instance, in the event that supply and demand appeared in danger of being out of balance, the SGC might have to consider ways in which the guidelines could be drawn up to take this into account ... They believe that leaving Government and Parliament to choose how to address this imbalance better fits the appropriate relationship between Government, Parliament, the SGC and the judiciary&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09071566000037"></a>The majority of the working group believed that the disadvantages of placing a duty on the SGC to have regard to resources outweighed the advantages. Accordingly, in its view, no such duty should be placed on the SGC. The report concludes in paragraph 9.16 that it would be inappropriate to place such a duty on the SGC and makes no such recommendation. We endorse that view. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09071566000039"></a>We believe that consistency is important even within the parameters of judicial discretion. In 2006, a total of 70,000 prisoners were sentenced to immediate custody for 12 months or less. In magistrates&#146; courts, the average sentence length for immediate custody was 2.5 months in 2007. This current overuse of custody with short sentences itself represents an inconsistency of practice in relation to government policy; namely, that the use of custody should be a last resort only for the most dangerous, violent and prolific offenders. It is also at odds with practice across most of Europe. It is inconsistent with the aim of effectiveness and with the goal of preventing reoffending, since we also know that almost half of all offenders will reoffend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09071566000040"></a>Short sentences, of all sentences, are recognised to be almost completely ineffective. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips, when he was Lord Chief Justice, was particularly eloquent on the wastefulness, in every sense, of short sentences. The level of custodial use, by comparison with so many other countries, would indicate

These inconsistencies are then compounded by the range of custody rates for similar offences across England and Wales, as published by the Ministry of Justice in 2006. These range from 6 to 16 per cent in magistrates&#146; courts and from 45 to 68 per cent in the Crown Courts. The variations were not well explained by differences in the kinds of cases being sentenced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09071566000041"></a>Sentencing differentials for children, in the data from the Youth Justice Board in 2007, also differed significantly between roughly comparable areas, reflecting differences in attitudes by sentencers. These ranged from Liverpool at the top end, with 11.8 per cent of all disposals being for custody, and Newcastle at the bottom, with 2.1 per cent of all disposals, with Birmingham being roughly in the middle with 8 per cent. Clearly, local conditions have a part to pay, but these are children&#146;s lives that are at issue and these levels of inconsistency are hard to justify. We must not forget that these inconsistencies, coupled with the negative perceptions of disparities, have fed the damaging lack of public confidence we have been considering and argue for a greater alignment of guidance and practice.</p>

I urge the Government not to amend either paragraph (b) or (d). In saying that, I urge that consistency is one of the most important aims and objectives of sentencing. Nothing can be more unjust than to have two persons who commit an offence in circumstances which are indistinguishable, where the backgrounds are indistinguishable, but they get different sentences. If you go to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division on any day of the week, I would think that your chances of hearing sentences being adjusted by that court to achieve consistency are very high.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09071566000045"></a>I hope it is now generally accepted that a short sentence of imprisonment is unconstructive and a very bad use of resources. On the other hand, I should have thought that it was general policy on the part of sentencers that where you can achieve what is desired by a non-custodial sentence, then that is what you should do, if you are sentencing well. I am afraid that if we remove subsection (11)(d), it will be taken as an indication that what I have just said is not the appropriate approach towards sentencing.

During the Second Reading debate, noble Lords on all sides of the House urged the Government to take into account the impact that sentencing has on the victims of crime. That is an important issue and we believe that our amendment will add to the factors to which the council must have regard when considering guidelines a need to consider,</p>

The requirement to consider these factors has not, to our knowledge, caused the Sentencing Guidelines Council any particular difficulty. I argue that the concepts are well understood. I go further and say that for the new sentencing council not to take those factors into account would be a severe backward step in the development of sentencing guidelines. As regards consistency, I would ask whether guidelines which do not promote consistency, and in that way justice, could be considered as guidelines at all.

We recognise the importance of assessing the cost effectiveness of sentencing disposals. We are not talking here about the cost of individual sentences in individual cases. The use of the phrase,</p>

Splitting the phrase into two changes the meaning in a way which, we believe, could lead to the council being required to consider inappropriate factors such as the availability of resources. This amendment would also remove&#151;presumably this is not the intention&#151;the current paragraph (c) and the encouragement of the council to promote public awareness of the operation and effect of guidelines.

I add a comment in support of the previous government amendment, because I want to have on the record an important implication of it. Amendment 188CB was to do with,</p>
<ul><a name="09071566000121"></a>&#147;the impact of sentencing decisions on victims of offences&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071566000082"></a>It goes without saying that as part of the sentencing guidelines the council must include the impact of sentencing decisions on the victims of offences. We have constantly restated that everything that prevents reoffending has a direct impact on the victim. The more that they and we can feel secure, the better it will be. That is principally through the use of effective and robust community sentences, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, the distinguished former Lord Chief Justice, just said. In fact, we would favour putting subsection (11)(d) at the top of the list of the council&#146;s considerations. In particular, it seems to us that it would also open the door to the greater use of restorative justice, something which has not been mentioned in this context, which probably has the most direct impact of all for a large number of victims. It is a subject that has been widely discussed, analysed, piloted and promoted&#151;most notably, of course, by the former chief constable of the Thames Valley Police, Sir Charles Pollard. The evidence for giving closure to victims following an offence is powerful, and the case for it generally is equally powerful.</p>

<a name="90715-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09071566000056"></a>However, it remains to be rolled out more generally and enthusiastically by the Government. I urge the Government to accept that as part of their responsibility for the future. Of course, it would require commitment and a certain amount of expenditure on training people, and so on, but I point out that it is part of the toolkit in many areas of the country, especially some police areas, in a relatively routine way, and has been surprisingly useful in schools and communities. If that were to be the outcome of the government amendment, it would be really significant and powerful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09071566000057"></a>I move to our amendment on effectiveness and cost. We believe that splitting the two is a small but significant amendment. Effectiveness in preventing reoffending, which we have already discussed at length, should be considered separately from cost, although one may reinforce the other. The same is true when it comes to the council promoting awareness more widely to treat the two elements of effectiveness and cost as distinct. It is helpful to consider what is meant by cost in this context. Is it simply financial or are we talking about social and human cost, and to what are they

I certainly do not agree with the Government that it is not just the availability of resources that they should require the council to consider.</p>

<a name="90715-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09071566000058"></a>The report of the New Economics Foundation last year, for example, considered women offenders and highlighted how the criminal justice system&#146;s focus on short-term control and narrow reoffending targets is actually costing us more in the long term. Prison costs much more than the community alternatives, which are much more likely to turn lives around. That report suggested that a body similar to NICE, which has helped to prioritise cost-effective treatment in the health service, could be applied to the criminal justice system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09071566000059"></a>The Corston report recommended setting up small secure units so that women can be nearer to home and family, as well as a network of support and supervision centres to administer community sentences. They may cost money initially, but in the long term they are not only cost-effective financially, but far cheaper in social and human terms, when contact with children can be maintained, as well as addressing the offending behaviour. For every pound invested in these effective alternatives, it has been calculated that society benefits by &#163;14. If reoffending were reduced by just 6 per cent, the saving to the state in one year would equal the cost of setting up the whole system. The human cost is, of course, difficult to measure, but 160,000 children lose a parent to prison each year and at a stroke they become more at risk of being sucked into the criminal justice system themselves. Some long-term investment in their mothers would pay dividends in savings to society.</p>

I imagine that this is not possible, but I would be interested to know how far some of the problems identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, in her report have been remedied. For instance, she identified clearly that women were being given harsher sentences than men for similar offences. The report also discovered that only 8 per cent of children remained in the same home when their mothers had been removed to custody. I believe that it was 8 per cent; it was certainly under 10 per cent. It really causes such an upheaval for children when their mothers are given custodial sentences. I have two questions.

Let me say, at the risk of repeating myself, that we agree with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, about the advantages of keeping these five matters in subsection (11) in their current order, not least because they are understood, having been used for a number of years. That does not, of course, mean that the council should not have regard to other matters, including those raised by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater. We recognise the importance of assessing the cost-effectiveness of sentencing disposals. I repeat that we are not talking about the cost of sentences in individual cases.</p>

<p><a name="st_129"></a>
<a name="09071566000068"></a><b><a name="90715-0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09071566000159"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> At Second Reading, we made it clear that the Government were willing to consider amendments, or table our own amendments, that improved and clarified these provisions. That is what these amendments, which relate to the format of sentencing guidelines, seek to do. The sentencing council provisions in this Bill sought to replicate the current practice of the Sentencing Guidelines Council in regard to the format of guidelines. In that way, the provisions reflected the fact that the current Sentencing Guidelines Council guidelines subdivide an offence guideline into levels of seriousness, so that, for example, in the guideline on robbery there are three sentencing levels based on the nature of the robbery offence.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09071566000069"></a>There has been some concern, however, that the Bill as drafted would require a set format for council guidelines. This, it has been argued, may lead to unforeseen difficulties if some less common offences do not lend themselves to this format. The Government sought to introduce flexibility in this regard in amendments tabled in the other place, but the further changes contained in Amendments 188E to 188X make the flexibility contained in Clause 107 clearer.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09071566000070"></a>This further flexibility starts with government Amendment 188E, which redrafts the first two subsections of Clause 107, emphasising that it is desirable, but not mandatory, that guidelines be formatted in the way set out in the rest of Clause 107. In this way, the amendments ensure a balance between the desirability of having guidelines that subdivide guidelines and provide starting points, because that format provides guidance to sentencers and transparency to victims and offenders, and the option for the council to opt out of this format if the nature of the offence is such that it is not reasonably practical to produce a guideline in this format.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09071566000071"></a>The Government&#146;s view is that this amendment ensures that the council will not be hampered in producing guidelines for the widest range of offences. This flexibility is also important when we come, a little later, to consider the duty on sentencers to follow guidelines. The other government amendments reflect this change to the beginning of Clause 107. For example, Amendments 188G, 188K and 188M replace the provision that the council &#147;must format guidelines&#148; with the less onerous &#147;should format guidelines&#148;.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09071566000072"></a>Government Amendment 188F allows the council to refer to factors other than the offender&#146;s culpability and the harm caused in describing different categories of offending in the guidelines. The offender&#146;s level of culpability and the harm caused are currently the main factors that determine the levels of seriousness of an offence in a guideline. The Government appreciate that it may be helpful for the council&#146;s guidelines, for the purpose of illustrating the different degrees of seriousness with which an offence has been committed, to be able to refer to other factors. These other features might also amount to aggravating or mitigating circumstances, so we have tabled Amendment 188F to allow for that possibility.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1204"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1204</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09071566000073"></a>Amendments 188Q and 188X also allow greater flexibility in the format of guidelines. Amendment 188Q creates new subsection (8A), which allows for different provisions in guidelines if there are different circumstances or cases involving the offence that the guideline covers. This amendment provides more flexibility where, for example, the guideline relates to the sentencing of juveniles, where different sentencing disposals exist.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09071566000074"></a>Amendments 188S and 188V clarify that the intention of the guidelines is to produce starting points within category ranges. Having identified a starting point, sentencers will then consider the individual factors of the particular case, such as aggravating or mitigating factors or guilty pleas, in order to determine the most appropriate sentence to impose on the offender after those factors are considered.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09071566000075"></a>The Government believe that this package of amendments to Clause 107 provides the council with a range of options for producing guidelines, stressing the desirability of having subdivided ranges with starting points but allowing for other formats for different types of offence.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09071566000076"></a>Finally in this group, Amendment 188Y clarifies the provisions of Clause 110 that deal with proposals for guidelines originating from the Lord Chancellor or the Court of Appeal. Clause 110 allows the Court of Appeal, if it is considering a relevant case, to propose to the council that it frames a new guideline or revises an existing guideline. This amendment makes it clear that this power does not prevent the Court of Appeal from continuing to issue guideline judgments.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09071566000077"></a>All these amendments provide more flexibility for the council to enable it to tailor guidelines to particular offences. I beg to move.</p>

It is now more than seven and a half years since the European Court of Human Rights found that the United Kingdom was in breach of the European convention in not allowing prisoners to vote. Those seven and a half years are in stark contrast to the speed with which, for instance, the Parliamentary Standards Bill has been rushed forward to this House and rushed through it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09071571000002"></a>Eighteen of our fellow European countries allow all prisoners to vote and eight ban some from voting. The United Kingdom is one of only nine which automatically disenfranchise all sentenced prisoners, including Armenia, Bulgaria, Estonia and Romania. However, it is interesting that two countries with far worse human rights records than those&#151;China and Iraq&#151;both allow prisoners to vote.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09071571000003"></a>One thing that has held up the Government from taking the sensible line&#151;this was also reinforced by the European court when the Government appealed against the original decision&#151;is the idea of passing to the sentencers the responsibility of deciding who should or should not have the vote while in prison. My amendment, therefore, is designed to follow the current procedure in France and Germany, where the courts have the power to impose loss of voting rights as an additional punishment. The proposed sentencing council would be exactly the right organisation to decide what guidelines should be issued to sentencers to help them decide, on the basis of the evidence that they have heard, whether or not a particular crime committed by a particular individual should carry with it the additional sentence of removal of the right to vote.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="09071571000004"></a>At present, we are in the middle of a second consultation on this issue which is purely around whether the length of sentence should be the determinate of whether or not people should have a vote. That is entirely illogical because, for example, currently a shoplifter who is sentenced to a community sentence is allowed to vote and a shoplifter who is sentenced to custody is not. The way out of this is to remove as many of the illogicalities as possible. Putting the onus on the sentencing council would remove the political concerns&#151;many of which are determined by fear of the media&#151;from something which the European courts have already determined we ought to do.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09071571000005"></a>The amendment is designed to suggest to the Government that they might like to consider this proposal as a sensible way out of a situation that has taken them so long to determine so that we can bring ourselves into line with the direction we have been given, possibly in time for the next general election.

It is a probing amendment. I admire him for continuously raising this issue and I am glad to be here to support him in doing so. As he said, this matter has been raised again and again and there is little new that can be said by either the Government or ourselves. However, I should like to mention one or two matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09071571000007"></a>First, there is something even more important than everyone&#146;s democratic right to vote, except where there is very good reason to deprive them of their voting rights, and that is the European rule of law. I have said&#151;this has been quoted against me by the Minister in the past&#151;that Britain has a fine record of abiding by the judgments in Strasbourg, and so it has, but this is a disgraceful and lamentable exception which has already exercised members of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to the point where they are threatening publicity and an interim resolution at Christmas.

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09071571000008"></a>The United Kingdom has an obligation under Article 41 of the convention to abide by the judgment in this case.

I do not expect everyone in the House to rejoice at the idea of prisoners getting anything at all, I am afraid, but there is a very good democratic reason why prisoners should be given the right to vote as the court has stipulated: that is, it makes politicians more sensitive to what is happening inside our prisons. If Ministers in the prison department understand that prisoners have a right to vote&#151;let us say by postal vote, as they have in Ireland, Hong Kong and Cyprus&#151;they may be more sensitive to the conditions within prisons and the needs of prisoners.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09071571000009"></a>It is wrong for prisoners to have their other civil rights taken away in addition to the deprivation of liberty except for very good cause. There is an argument for saying that those who are guilty of the most heinous crimes should have their civil rights taken away, especially on the recommendation of a court that has tried them&#151;that is part of what is behind the amendment&#151;and one can understand the need for a proportionate response, compatible with human rights, in that context. But to continue a blanket exclusion of any right to vote by any prisoner in custody for any crime whatever is completely unjustified. As the noble Lord said, we are in the minority in Europe in perpetuating that and, even worse, we are in breach of a clear judgment of the court. That is as bad as if it were a contempt of court in this country because Ministers of the Crown were disobeying the binding judgment of a domestic court.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09071571000010"></a>I have nothing to say in favour of the attitude that the Ministry of Justice and the Government as a whole have put forward. They are simply dragging their feet for as long as they possibly can, up to the next election, for fear of alienating the tabloid media that will attack them for being the prisoners&#146; friend. That is completely unjustifiable and it is time that this country brought our law into conformity with the binding judgment of the European Court. For those reasons, I support what is behind the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09071571000011"></a>I hope that Her Majesty&#146;s loyal Opposition will not give a knee-jerk reaction to what is proposed. I remind them that the European convention was supported in 1949 to 1950, not by Labour but by the Conservatives. It was Winston Churchill, Harold Macmillan, Maxwell Fyfe and John Foster, the former head of my chambers, who led the campaign in the European movement. It was the Conservative Government, not the Labour Government, who accepted the first optional protocol, which has voting rights within it. So it was not the work of Labour&#151;Labour sought to keep it out when they ratified the original convention. It was the Conservative Government who came to power in 1951 who accepted the first optional protocol.</p>

<a name="90715-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09071571000012"></a>The Conservative Party stands for the rule of law as part of a deep conservative tradition which quite transcends any populist ideas about prisoners&#146; rights. I very much hope that the Official Opposition will seek to persuade the Government to abide by their treaty obligation and by the court&#146;s judgment in this case.</p>

That is a case where the particular individual is being punished not only by the loss of liberty but by the loss of other civil rights including the right to vote because the trial judge who has listened to the facts of the case has decided that, in the particular circumstances, it is right to add that to the punishment. That I can understand. It is in a sense the approach of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in his amendment. He says it should be part of the sentencing guidelines. That is a proportionate response focusing on the particular individual. It is not a blanket view that no prisoner should have the right in custody to vote in any circumstances. I hope I have answered the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09071571000016"></a>I have always been somewhat bemused by why the Government have been so resistant to this ruling, so unprepared to see the link between participation in civic life and rehabilitation and, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, has explained, so dismissive in this case of their international human rights obligations. The decision of the European Court was not a weird aberration made by a group of people devoid of any common sense. Six out of eight of them in the original judgment came from countries to which democracy had returned only in the past 15 years. They may have had a particular view of the importance of democratic rights. It is not so outlandish to suggest that someone who is imprisoned, for example, for a short time, should still be able to vote. Research suggests that retention of such civic rights can be in a small way conducive to future rehabilitation.</p>

I quote from the European Court:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="09071571000050"></a>&#147;The United Kingdom Government had asserted that the voting restrictions on prisoners were designed to prevent crime and punish offenders and to enhance civil responsibility and respect for the rule of law&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09071571000018"></a>The inclusion of this matter within the work on guidelines would enable it to be considered thoughtfully, related to similar considerations about what should constitute the appropriate penalty for specific offences. It would enable the public to see that the matter had been given serious consideration over a range of cases rather than having been dealt with as a political football. I support the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09071571000022"></a>I admire the ingenuity of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in bringing this amendment forward. I warned the Government of this at Second Reading. If they insist on bringing forward these massive Home Office or Ministry of Justice Bills that cover every possible subject, they will find that every other possible subject can be added to them. That is why we have had debates on assisted suicide and all sorts of other matters that were not originally in the Government&#146;s plan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09071571000023"></a>On the amendment itself, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, rightly pointed out, it is now seven and a half years since the European Court of Human Rights case was decided. Since then we have had two consultations from the Government. They seem to be frozen like rabbits stuck in the headlights, unable to decide what to do. It is not for me to say what we will do at this stage because we are not yet the Government. That will come in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09071571000024"></a>I can give the Minister some reassurance that we on this side are unhappy with the idea of extending the franchise to offenders in prison. The Minister will be aware of what my honourable friend Dominic Grieve said on this matter:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="09071571000051"></a>&#147;Many people will question whether this is a sensible development&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071571000045"></a>One does not need to dismiss that, as the noble Lord, Lord Lester, did, as a knee-jerk reaction to the tabloid press. Often when people say something is a knee-jerk reaction to the tabloid press they are saying they do not like what the majority of the country thinks about these matters. This is a democracy and we have a chance to make up our minds about it. To continue to quote from what my honourable friend said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="09071571000052"></a>&#147;The principle that those who are in custody after conviction should not have the opportunity to vote is a perfectly rational one.

It would be possible to make some other adjustment, of the manner suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. We have asked for a proper debate on this matter. That is the right way of deciding these things. A Conservative Government, when they are in power, would then respond accordingly.</p>

The issue is not what the public would want or what tabloid editors would say, but whether we are going to be loyal to a determination of the European Court and to our treaty obligations. Vox populi is not vox parliamentari, and should not be so. The Government, for the basest of motives&#151;and I accept that over 12 years they have done many splendid things&#151;have kept this matter back. That goes for the Opposition as well.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09071571000028"></a>There is one argument, additional to that put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that we should bear in mind with regard to the rightness of the act of giving votes to persons in prison. Persons are sent to prison because they have acted in such a manner and their conduct is so intolerable that they have been placed outside the walls of society, but with the intention some day that they should come back to society as persons who have redeemed those offences. Those persons still remain citizens, and it is right and proper that they should be reminded not only that they have responsibilities as citizens but that they have rights as well. This is one way of driving that message home.</p>

Of course, we are not suggesting that all prisoners ought to be given the right to vote, but it seems plain that there is a strong argument that, for example, prisoners approaching the end of their sentences should be allowed to vote and consider the political issues facing him or her and the country when they become free again. Allowing them to vote in those circumstances could be part of their rehabilitation as citizens of the country. In those circumstances, I believe that there is absolutely no argument for saying that the present status quo of no prisoner ever being allowed to vote while being in prison should continue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09071571000033"></a>As the noble Lord has reminded us, his amendment seeks seek to repeal Section 3 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, and replace the current blanket ban on voting rights for convicted prisoners with a system by which a prisoner&#146;s right to vote is determined by the court that sentenced them. As the noble Lord has reminded the Committee, the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Hirst has ruled that the current statutory prohibition on voting by convicted prisoners was in breach of the convention rights. In response to the judgment, which was delivered in October 2005&#151;which by my estimation is not seven years ago&#151;the Government are undertaking a two-stage consultation on this difficult and sensitive issue. The responses to the first-stage consultation paper indicated that there was no great support for the option of allowing the sentencing court to decide on whether a prisoner retained his or her right to vote.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="09071571000034"></a>The Government are not entirely opposed to the principle of allowing the sentencing court to effectively judge each case on its own merits. Indeed, the fourth of the options in the second and current consultation is to allow judges some discretion in enfranchisement. However, this approach needs to be considered very carefully.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09071571000035"></a>As to the substantive issue, let me say a few words about the Government&#146;s approach as set out in the current consultation. Our approach to the possible enfranchisement of prisoners is based on the length of custodial sentence to which a prisoner has been sentenced. The Government consider that, in general, the more serious the offence that has been committed, the less right an individual should have to retain the right to vote when sentenced to imprisonment. Tying entitlement to vote to sentence length would have the benefit of establishing a clear relationship between the seriousness of the offence, or offences, and suspension of the right to vote. Therefore, in its second-stage consultation paper, the Government have proposed four policy options to determine a prisoner&#146;s entitlement to vote, all of which are based on the length of his custodial sentence as handed down, with one partial exception.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09071571000036"></a>Under our first three options, prisoners would automatically retain the right to vote when they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than one year, less than two years and less than four  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1212"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1212</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>years respectively. Under option 4, prisoners who have been sentenced to a period of less than two years&#146; imprisonment would automatically retain the right to vote. In addition, prisoners who have received sentences of more than two but less than four years could apply to be entitled to vote, but only where a judge grants permission in their specific case. This last option allows some element of judicial discretion in determining a prisoner&#146;s right to vote and, in this context, the need for sentencing guidelines to ensure consistency and fairness would remain paramount. This element would apply only to prisoners sentenced to between two and four years&#146; imprisonment.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09071571000037"></a>When the second consultation has concluded, in September this year, the Government will consider the next steps. It would be premature to introduce legislation before this second consultation has been completed, and before we have had the opportunity to give proper consideration to all the complex issues that an approach to enfranchisement based on sentence length throws up. There will be a need for a UK-wide approach to this issue, and the judiciary would need to be fully consulted, particularly where proposals are being made for judicial discretion in enfranchisement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="09071571000038"></a>I noted that the noble Lord said that this was a probing amendment. I thank him for raising it today and ask him to withdraw his amendment.</p>

He said that the consultation would end in September. Let us assume, hypothetically, that the next election is in May. It would be perfectly possible to use a remedial order to accomplish, as one sometimes does, full compliance with the judgment of the court without the need for primary legislation. If the Minister, having had two consultations and having consulted the judiciary, were then to lay a remedial order before both Houses, which would have to be debated and cleared by affirmative resolution, that would enable the matter to be resolved before the next general election. Would that be a matter that the Government would now consider? If they would not consider it, it would mean that it could not happen this side of a general election.</p>

I did not know that people voted by moral authority, and if moral authority was the reason I suspect that there would be many people other than prisoners who were denied the right.

If you are encouraging prisoners to rehabilitate and enhance their respect for the rule of law while doing so, it does not set a very good example if the Government are defying the rule of law in practising rehabilitation. I have always thought, in addition to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, that if the right to vote was there, prisoners would become constituents of MPs and MPs would have to take an interest in the rehabilitation of their constituents, which would raise their interest and involvement in the whole penal system.</p>

It has always been one of the functions of the Court of Appeal to provide guidelines wherever that has been thought desirable and necessary. However, the absence of a guideline  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1214"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1214</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>judgment has never meant that judges were, as it were, on their own&#151;far from it. We have always had, as any practitioner will know, Thomas on sentencing&#151;a loose-leaf work in four massive volumes&#151;in which the facts of all comparable cases are set out in great detail. In my view, the existence of Thomas on sentencing is by far the best way of ensuring consistency in sentencing, since it is the most complete record of all the decisions and it is always kept up to date.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09071574000002"></a>Criticism might be made that this is all very well; it is what the judges do for themselves, but it does not reflect the views of the public. That would not be so. From time to time, Parliament takes the view that the sentencing level in a particular type of offence is too low and it takes steps to correct the position. The example that I always give&#151;I am afraid that I have given it before in this House&#151;is causing death by dangerous driving. When I became a judge, the maximum sentence was two years; the maximum sentence is now 14 years. My view happens to be that 14 years is far too high when one compares that offence with other very serious offences, but that is neither here nor there. What matters is that, whenever Parliament has increased the maximum sentence, the judges have always followed suit. That has happened, I think, on every occasion.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09071574000003"></a>In 1998, we had the Sentencing Advisory Panel, whose purpose was to give judges independent advice as to the appropriate level of sentencing and, in 2003, as we all know, we had the Sentencing Guidelines Council. So the judges have not been wanting for outside guidance; we have always welcomed such guidance and we have always had regard to it. Now, for the first time, judges will be obliged to follow the guidelines unless the interests of justice require otherwise. That, to my mind, is a very different thing.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09071574000004"></a>Why are we being asked to change a test so soon after the existing test was approved and confirmed by Parliament in 2003? I remind the Committee of what Section 172 provides. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="09071574000049"></a>&#147;Every court must ... in sentencing an offender, have regard to any guidelines which are relevant to the offender&#146;s case&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071574000038"></a>What is wrong with that? That was the Government&#146;s view as recently as 2003 in bringing forward legislation, which was by no means noted for its liberality or, indeed, for letting judges get on with the job. That was their view then, so why has their view changed? What is the evidence that that existing test, set out so recently, is proving unsatisfactory? Or is there some other reason for making the change? I hope that the noble Lord will answer that question when he replies.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09071574000005"></a>Perhaps I may venture to suggest a possible explanation. The starting point was, I think, the review of the prison system in 2007 by the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles. It was difficult, the noble Lord said, to predict the number of prison places that would be required without a structured framework such as exists in the United States in Minnesota and in North Carolina. Only in that way, he thought, would it be possible to forecast the growth of the prison population.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09071574000006"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, reported in December 2007. The same month, the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice asked Lord Justice Gage to chair  a working party to consider the recommendations  of the noble Lord, Lord Carter. The working party  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1215"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1215</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>unanimously rejected the noble Lord&#146;s central recommendation that we should have a structured framework such as there is in Minnesota. In paragraph 4.24, it said that it would simply not be workable in the United Kingdom. Yet by a majority the working party favoured the stricter test, which is now proposed. In other words, it rejected the reasoning of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, but somehow accepted his conclusion. Why did it do that? It is difficult to say because its reasons are not given. All that it says is that the stricter test now proposed would provide the,</p>
<ul><a name="09071574000053"></a>&#147;necessary consistency, transparency and predictability&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071574000039"></a>I have already said something on the subject of consistency. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, is right when he says that consistency is a most important objective. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, is also right when he says that consistency is not incompatible with a degree of flexibility. In any event, as we all know, absolute consistency in sentencing is unobtainable. If we wanted a greater degree of consistency than we have, we ought to have gone the Minnesota route, which we have not done.</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09071574000007"></a>It is therefore difficult to see what reasons the minority, as it were, could have had, but let me take them one by one. I have already mentioned consistency. The next was transparency. I fail to understand how transparency is relevant at all in this connection, but perhaps that, too, will be explained. Finally, it said that this was &#147;necessary for predictability&#148;. In what sense is it &#147;necessary&#148;? Are the Government saying that it is necessary for the judges to be tied down in the way that is now proposed so that the Government may be able to predict the number of prison places that they may need in 2010, 2015 or 2020?</p>

<a name="90715-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09071574000008"></a>With regard to &#147;predictability&#148;, the working party says, in the next paragraph, that,</p>
<ul><a name="09071574000054"></a>&#147;it is not possible for guidelines to control the prison population, as the prison population will depend on a number of factors the most important being the number of offenders brought to justice and the profile of the crimes they commit&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071574000040"></a>I would add to that that the number of prison places needed will depend to a even greater extent on how much new criminal legislation is brought forward by the Government, how many new offences are created and things such as the indeterminate sentence for the protection of the public, which, by its very nature, is unpredictable.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90715-0009.htm"/>


<a name="90715-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09071574000009"></a>Perhaps the Minister will, in his reply, give an estimate of the extent to which the new test that is now proposed will add in any way to the predictability of prison population compared with these other matters. It appears that predictability was the reason why all this started. It is rather like trying to predict the inflow of water through a broken sea valve when the ship is sinking. In the mean time, I respectfully suggest that we stick with the test that we have under the 2003 Act until we have been given some better reason for changing it. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09071574000011"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, has said, and the noble and learned Lord, Lloyd of Berwick, picked up, consistency is not incompatible with flexibility.

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09071574000012"></a>Perhaps I might be forgiven if I tell just one anecdote from a north London magistrates&#146; court, in which I appeared very many years ago. I was representing a company whose employee had deliberately disobeyed the rules and had been caught; there was an absolute liability. I was hoping to say to the magistrates that this was not the company&#146;s fault and that there should be an absolute discharge. I walked in and the warrant officer, who knew me, said, &#147;Morning, Madam. It&#146;s &#163;10 today&#148;. My goodness me, it was. I sat there and every single case was &#163;10, including that of my company, which had done absolutely everything to prevent their drivers from doing what this driver did.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09071574000013"></a>We have moved on from every case being &#163;10 in the magistrates&#146; court. Magistrates have very good training on sentencing, among other things. However, like judges, they need to have the opportunity to fit the sentence to the person; they need not only to have the opportunity to recognise the importance of consistency, as magistrates of course do, but also not to be put in a straitjacket. What they feel, and what I want to say on their behalf, is that having the word &#147;follow&#148; instead of &#147;have regard to&#148; will put them, as they see it&#151;and I respectfully agree with them&#151;into a straitjacket. It will not do. I strongly support what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, has said.</p>

My noble friend Lord Tenby introduced me to members of the Magistrates&#146; Association in the run-up to this Bill. It is as a result of that conversation that I speak now.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09071574000015"></a>I am concerned that Her Majesty&#146;s Government sometimes, with the best of intentions, too narrowly prescribe the range of actions of professionals on the front line. I am thinking of teachers, social workers and, in this case, magistrates. This micromanagement, as it is commonly termed, has a mournful effect on the morale of professionals and contributes to poorer outcomes and the disillusionment of practitioners. In Amendment 189, I seek to prevent such overprescription. I welcome the Minister&#146;s intentions to ensure that there is a consistency of sentencing, which is something that we all desire. However, as has been mentioned, the clause proposed in the Bill obliges uniformity of sentence, something quite different from consistency and unwelcome.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09071574000016"></a>As my noble and learned friend Lord Lloyd of Berwick has asked, what is the Minister&#146;s evidence for proposing this change to the statute book? The number of short-term custodial sentences&#151;sentences of under six months&#151;has decreased in recent years. Since a peak of 4.9 per cent in 2001, there has been a reduction  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1217"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1217</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to 3.9 per cent in 2007. This is a drop in real terms of 25 per cent, despite the number of offenders sentenced increasing by 4.6 per cent. New sentencing guidelines came into effect on 1 August 2008 and magistrates have been most positive in ensuring consistent adherence to them. Since October 2008, the quarterly figures have shown a continued decrease each month on the same period 12 months earlier of between 8 per cent and 15 per cent in the number of prisoners serving short-term custodial sentences. This is despite the number of sentences remaining constant.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09071574000017"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, said, what is the basis for changing the law? Paragraph 4.14 of the Gage report, which has been referred to, points out that no information is being collected on the numbers of departures from guidelines or the reasons for the departures. Are we being asked to legislate on the basis of simple anecdote and speculation? The summary of the report notes that many respondents saw,</p>
<ul><a name="09071574000055"></a>&#147;a need for a period of stability avoiding further changes to sentencing and a concern that structured sentencing would lead to a fettering of judicial discretion and independence and ultimately to injustice&#148;.</ul>
<a name="90715-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09071574000018"></a>The &#147;interests of justice&#148; test does not reassure me, as, in my view, everything that the Bench does is in the interests of justice and full reasons are always expected to be given for whatever sentences are imposed. Unsurprisingly, the Magistrates&#146; Association describes this current clause as an insult to the integrity of magistrates. It is strongly concerned that it will frustrate magistrates&#146; imperative to apply the rule of law in each individual case.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09071574000019"></a>I respect the Minister&#146;s intentions. However, I am concerned that this clause will unintentionally undermine the outcome that we all wish to see. The Government are keen to recruit new magistrates and young professionals, but how will people be encouraged to participate in this decision-making if, as it seems, they will have little input as a result of their decision-making being so tightly prescribed? I look to the Minister for reassurance in his response.</p>

<a name="09071574000020"></a><b><a name="90715-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09071574000065"></a>Baroness Stern:</b> I support those who have put their names to the amendment. I have not, in the past&#151;I have to admit&#151;been an avid reader of sentencing guidelines. However, lately, it is an activity that I have taken up. Most lately, I have read the definitive guideline, <I>Breach of an Anti-Social Behaviour Order</I>. I want to make a few comments on it in order, I hope, to elicit from the Minister an idea of how he sees the guidelines working in practice in everyday life in a courtroom.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09071574000021"></a>When looking at this guideline, I had before me the image of an old, alcoholic man with an ASBO, which says that he must not go into the city centre where the pubs are, and where his presence has been found to be unpalatable. I had that image before me because a number of press reports have come my way of such people breaching their ASBOs. This man wanders into the city centre and is therefore arrested and brought to court for breach. The court then has to deal with him and, to do so properly, as I understand it&#151;I look to the Minister to correct me if I have not understood&#151;the court must follow a 19-page document explaining the  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1218"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1218</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>law, the meaning of it and the stages that the court has to go through. Under the heading &#147;The decision making process&#148;, the document says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_44"></a><a name="09071574000050"></a>&#147;The process set out below is intended to show that the sentencing approach for the offence of breach of an anti-social behaviour order is fluid and requires the structured exercise of discretion&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071574000041"></a>There follow seven headings. But that is not quite all, because there is another section called, &#147;Factors to be taken into consideration&#148;, which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_45"></a><a name="09071574000051"></a>&#147;Aggravating and mitigating factors specifically relevant to sentencing for breach of an ASBO are included in the guideline. Care needs to be taken to ensure that there is no double counting where an element of the breach determines the level of seriousness where it might in other circumstances be an aggravating factor. When assessing the seriousness of an offence, the court must always refer to the full list of aggravating and mitigating factors in the Council guideline on Seriousness (see Annex B)&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071574000042"></a>So people have to read another document as well. Then, as I understand it, according to the grid that I studied, the old alcoholic who broke his ABSO will get a fine, band B&#151;which I assume he will not be able to pay, because if he had any money he would have spent it on drink. Alternatively, he will get a &#147;community order (medium)&#148;, which I assume he will not turn up for.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09071574000022"></a>In the light of the amendment, my question to the Minister is whether this is a good way of using judicial brains and resources, as well as the resources of the criminal justice system. Does the end result serve communities and solve the problems of alcoholic old men on the streets, or are we becoming slightly too framework-bound and determined to put everything into a grid? Is there no room for a little more flexibility, fluidity and looseness in dealing with the many human problems that courts come up against every day?</p>

We are becoming tick-box obsessed. That may be at the root of Part 4. In the years that I served as a recorder and circuit judge it never occurred to me that there was a dearth of good advice on sentencing. In addition to the list that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, properly referred to, one could have added the fact that about 20 years ago, if I remember rightly, we had an excellent institution of sentencing reports, as full and complete as one could possibly wish for. There was an amplitude of good material at the disposal of the intelligent and conscientious sentencer.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09071574000024"></a>Now all sentencers of every rank are in a situation of abject horror at the effect of this provision. There are no doubt many things about Part 4 that are quite laudable. There was probably a case for extending the Sentencing Guidelines Council&#146;s remit in so many regards to some extent. But the sovereign nature of the guidelines now brought about by Clause 111 is utterly objectionable. Those words mean what they seem to mean: &#147;must follow&#148;. They are peremptory and mandatory. They cannot be anything else. The consequence is that sentencers will be placed in a straitjacket, will be enslaved, and will be mere ciphers and robots in a tick-box system. That goes to the very root of the administration of criminal justice in our country. I have the gravest doubts as to what the Government&#146;s motivation was. I appreciate the genesis  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1219"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1219</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of this. It started with the report of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, in December 2007 and the problem of prison overcrowding. He pointed to two possible solutions: massive building, which has been accepted by the Government, and the setting up of the Gage committee.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09071574000025"></a>That committee looked with great conscientiousness at the whole situation, but its recommendations are not exactly being brought into legislation by the Bill. Indeed, on the main matter, there was indecision in that committee. The committee&#146;s decision was to reject the Minnesota and North Carolina strictness and to opt for a somewhat less harsh regime. That regime is nevertheless utterly mechanistic, unimaginative and non-human, as far as the sentencer is concerned, in its approach. It is therefore a cancer that grows to the very root of the administration of justice and must not be allowed to persist.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09071574000026"></a>There is constitutional point that nobody has mentioned until now in these discussions. The wording of Clause 111 comes directly from New Zealand&#146;s Sentencing Act 2002. This is the second time in two days that we have been discussing legislation that has been culled completely from a New Zealand statute. The anonymity of witnesses provisions of the Bill are another instance. However, in New Zealand, the point is taken that so much authority is given to a sentencing council or commission that it is effectively making new law. Because it is making new law, it must pass, by way of order, through the New Zealand legislature.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09071574000027"></a>That point was raised at Second Reading in another place. The Secretary of State for Justice said that he had some sympathy with that view, but the Bill is totally silent on the matter. If it is sovereign and mandatory, as it is, I have no doubt that it is bound to have the effect of making new law that does not pass through Parliament. I have no real idea what the Home Secretary&#146;s intention was in this matter. He said that the,</p>
<ul><a name="09071574000056"></a>&#147;suggestion that the proposal is driven by a desire to reduce the prison population is completely untrue&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 26/1/09; col. 47.]</ul>
<p><a name="09071574000043"></a>At a later stage of the Bill he outlined the intentions on the independence of judges:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_46"></a><a name="09071574000052"></a>&#147;First, and above all, the Government are trying to ensure respect and proper protection for the independence and autonomy of sentencers when they pass their sentences. That is critical: we need to provide considerable discretion, but we must also ensure that that discretion is exercised in a structured way that the public and other sentencers can understand. We are not fettering the judiciary, but we are saying that there should be a carefully moderated body of guidance&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 24/3/09; col. 241.]</p>

<p><a name="09071574000044"></a>I am glad to hear that they are not fettering the judiciary. If they were, what they would have done would have been utterly frightening over and beyond what would be achieved by Clause 111.</p>

The reason why the present Sentencing Guidelines Council, which will continue to exist until this legislation is passed, was presided over by the Lord Chief Justice was to try to indicate to the judiciary as a whole the importance of following the guidelines.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09071574000030"></a>The experience in the United States is that if you have a grid, the judiciary find their hands are bound in a way which it regards as being unacceptable. Therefore, it resorts to devices in order to avoid that effect in a case where they feel the grid produces injustice. No doubt those on the committee who recommended the current drafting were conscious of that and concerned about it and, therefore, included in their recommendation the important words at the end of subsection (1) of Clause 111,</p>
<ul><a name="09071574000057"></a>&#147;unless the court is satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071574000045"></a>I do not know how those words are going to be interpreted but I would point out that the present test, which requires the judiciary to &#147;have regard to&#148;, is working perfectly satisfactorily.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09071574000031"></a>In addition to the other matters relied on by noble and learned Lords who have addressed this issue, I would suggest that there is a grave disadvantage to adopting this new formula. If I was a judge and I was in a situation where I wanted to disapply the guidelines, I must confess that I would not find any difficulty in doing so. I hope I never passed a sentence when I was a sentencing judge which I did not consider at the time was in the interests of justice to pass. If that be so, presumably, if I was faced by a guideline which was inconsistent with what I wanted to do, I would say that I was satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice for me to pass any other sentence than the sentence I wanted.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09071574000032"></a>It therefore seems to me, with greatest respect, that giving these words the natural meaning, far from reducing the discretion of the judge, in fact increases it. I do not know whether that is what is intended, but if so, perhaps we are getting unduly alarmed by the present subsection. I ask the Minister to indicate whether the interpretation I have speculated on is the one which the Government are urging on the judiciary. If it is, I do not think we want to be too concerned about the present language of Clause 111(1). My concerns are, however, that those distinguished lawyers who have anteceded me in addressing the Committee on this clause apparently were taking a different view from my interpretation. Therefore, I have reservations as to whether I am right. But to me, this does not look like a straitjacket; it looks like almost no jacket at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09071574000035"></a>It is a convention in this House that we can put down only four names to any amendment. However, my late noble friend and I so much wanted to support this amendment in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, and the other noble Lords who have spoken, that we added our own Amendment 189A, which amends the second paragraph and changes &#147;follow&#148; to &#147;have regard to&#148;. I do not need to add much to what they said other than to say that we very much support it. The question is how we should take it from now on. The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, questioned the Government&#146;s motivation in using the words &#147;must follow&#148; rather than &#147;must have regard to&#148;. For once I am going to be kind to the Government and suggest it might be inadvertence on this occasion rather than malice that has brought them to put this forward.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09071574000036"></a>I suggest to the noble and learned Lord that it might not be appropriate to divide the Committee on this matter tonight. We now have a long summer ahead of us&#151;one of these recesses the Government give us that seem to go on for ever. That will give the Government an opportunity to re-examine the clause and come back with improvements. We hope that the Government will agree with the fundamental principles that have been put forward by those who support this amendment and will draft their own amendments along the lines that have been suggested by the noble and learned Lord. It will not take much tweaking to remedy this and get it right.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09071574000037"></a>I have one other question. There are four amendments in this group&#151;one in the name of the noble and learned Lord, one in my name and two government amendments. Before any decision is made, we obviously need a proper explanation from the Government as to what their amendments are about because I cannot quite understand them. It may be that, in the myriad of letters that have been pouring out of the Ministry of Justice over the past few months, there was one letter dealing with these amendments. If so, it is probably in the wrong tray on my desk and I cannot find it. But no doubt the Minister will give us an explanation which all those who have spoken will want to consider carefully before deciding what to do. Again, now is not necessarily the moment to press this, but the Government need to come forward with something better before Report. For once, rather than the usual two weeks, they have something like three months to consider this. That should be enough time even for the Ministry of Justice. We can then make up our minds come October as to what to do about it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09071580000002"></a>Twenty years ago at a judicial studies conference the question was asked: how can we have consistent sentencing all over the country? I recall I proposed that, instead of having the Court of Appeal decide sentencing appeals, three circuit judges from different circuits should go round the country deciding sentencing  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1222"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1222</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>appeals and we would thereby achieve some sort of consistency. I recall that my proposal was voted down by 60 votes to two. The other day I spoke to the person who supported me on that occasion. He had completely forgotten about it but I have not&#151;it is burnt into my soul. On the other hand, we are not used to winning on this side, so it does not worry me too much.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09071580000003"></a>I was a member of the Gage committee until I resigned because I felt that it was too political and that it was not appropriate that I should continue. One of the concerns of the Gage committee was the effect of the grid system that had been examined in Minnesota and South Carolina. The members of that committee were concerned that it had increased sentences significantly, the use of a formula was not satisfactory and that it just increased prison places. Your Lordships may recall that, possibly at Second Reading of the Bill but certainly fairly recently, I pointed out that if we were to sentence in accordance with the average sentences passed throughout the European Community, to which we belong, instead of having 80,000 people in prison we would have 58,000 and there would be ample prison places. Therefore, I approach the Bill with suspicion. When I see that a member of the Sentencing Council is to be a statistician, I question why that is so. What does a statistician know about justice, sentencing and what exactly happens in the courts? Clause 113 is headed, &#147;Resource implications of guidelines&#148;. It states that where the council publishes draft guidelines or issues guidelines as definitive guidelines, it must publish a resource assessment of,</p>
<ul><a name="09071580000098"></a>&#147;the likely effect of the guidelines on&#151;</ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_47"></a><a name="09071580000082"></a>(a) the demand for prison places,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_48"></a><a name="09071580000083"></a>(b) the resources required for probation provision, and</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="09071580000084"></a>(c) the resources required for the provision of youth justice services&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071580000076"></a>That is fine. Perhaps the Minister can put me right, but I do not think that the current Sentencing Guidelines Council has the job of trying to assess how many prison places are required as a result of what it is putting forward.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09071580000004"></a>I recall another sentencing conference in Wales addressed by Lord Justice Tasker Watkins VC, who said, &#147;Don&#146;t you worry about prison places; you pass the sentences you think are right and it&#146;s for the Government to find those places&#148;. If the council must take resource implications into account when it publishes its guidelines, and judges did not follow those guidelines, it might knock its assessments about a bit, and its assessments of prison places might not be neat and tidy and accord with what the Home Office wants. We are not concerned with prison places as such. We are not concerned with units. I think that I mentioned on Monday my opposition to having prisoners appear in court on television screens, as that depersonalises them. I sometimes feel that the Wizard of Oz in the Home Office, who is full of knowledge about everything, sees prisoners not as people but as units to be slotted in, and that we have to ensure that we have enough places into which we can slot them.</p>

<a name="90715-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09071580000005"></a>To my mind this simply takes away from the judiciary its traditional role in a democratic society. I keep on emphasising that because sometimes you hear Ministers, such as former Home Secretaries, suggesting that judges  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1223"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1223</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are unelected and therefore one must not have any regard for what they say. Judges are part of our democracy and have a function. Part of their function is to ensure that people who come before them have their just deserts. If it means locking them up for the rest of their lives, so be it. Each individual is not a unit to be slotted in. I am very suspicious about the fact that the proposed guidelines council will have to produce an assessment of prison places, and that judges must follow the guidelines that the council lays down so that the places and the units slot together.</p>

That idea was firmly rejected at an early stage by the independent working group chaired by Lord Justice Gage.

The wording of the Bill is that the courts must have regard to the guidelines, but there is also the important caveat,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="09071580000086"></a>&#145;unless the court is satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so&#146;.</p>

I therefore welcome the provisions for the new Sentencing Council&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 18/5/09; col. 1285.]</p>

It is not. Judges&#146; discretion is, because of the caveat, every bit as great as it has always been.</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09071580000012"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, asked a couple of relevant questions. How has &#147;the interests of justice&#148; been interpreted? I will do my best with this. It has been used in sentencing-related legislation&#151;as the noble and learned Lord will know much better than me&#151;to enable courts to deal with circumstances which are exceptional and particular to a case. I repeat: exceptional and particular to a case. The words can be interpreted by the courts and then incorporated in guidelines. We believe that the Court of Appeal is likely to provide guidance in the interpretation of the &#147;interests of justice&#148; test.</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09071580000013"></a>We have adopted the recommendation of the majority of the working group that there should be a more robust duty to follow guidelines, subject to an &#147;interests of justice&#148; test. We believe that this gives wide discretion to sentencers to depart from guidelines where, in the interests of justice, it would not be appropriate to follow them. This means that a sentencer can depart from the guidelines where, for example, there are compelling mitigating factors&#151;mercy killings would be one example of this&#151;or indeed where the aggravating factors are so serious that the sentencer feels the need, in the interests of justice, to impose a more severe sentence than is set out in the guidelines.</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09071580000014"></a>I indicated at Second Reading that the Government would be receptive to ways to ensure that the right balance was struck between the duty on sentencers to follow guidelines and the need to exercise discretion in individual cases. Thus the two government amendments in this group&#151;Amendments 189B and 189C&#151;are designed to achieve that balance. Amendment 189C does two things. First, Clause 111 has been redrafted to make it clearer that the duty to follow guidelines does not mean that a sentencer has to sentence within  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1225"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1225</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a narrow category; rather, the sentencer is required to sentence only within the entire guidelines range for the offence, unless it is in the interests of justice to depart from the entire guidance. Secondly, the amendment seeks to clarify the duty on sentencers&#151;where there is a guideline that identifies categories of offending behaviour&#151;to identify the category that most resembles the case before them. This amendment means that the duty of the court to decide which category most resembles the facts of a particular case does not apply if there is not a sufficient resemblance. There is already a wide range of discretion for the sentencer, and we hope that these government amendments make that discretion even clearer.</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09071580000015"></a>Let me illustrate this with a practical example. If we take an offence such as robbery, we see that there is an existing guideline issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. That guideline is formatted in a way which subdivides the offence into three levels of seriousness. That is the preferred format but, as our earlier group of amendments made clear, it is not mandatory. Assuming that robbery guidelines are subdivided, the duty on the sentencer to follow guidelines is to sentence within the whole offence range&#151;that is, the range for the entire guideline. For the current guideline the offence range goes from a custodial sentence of no years to 12 years&#146; custody. This amendment makes it very clear that the duty does not force the court to stay within the subdivided range known as the &#147;category range&#148;. However, the Committee should note that there is sufficient flexibility to have as many or as few categories within a subdivided offence-specific guideline as appear to the council to be appropriate, given the nature of the offence. Again, we should not forget that this duty to follow the guideline&#151;to sentence within that range of 0 to 12 years&#151;does not apply if it is not in the interests of justice to do so.</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09071580000016"></a>Furthermore, Clause 111 makes it clear that where there is a subdivided guideline which has starting points and ranges for each category, there is a duty on a sentencer to identify the category that most resembles the case before them. Amendment 189C provides further clarification that this part of the duty does not apply when the sentencer considers that the case they have before them does not sufficiently resemble any of the categories. In other words, a sentencer is not required to try to shoehorn a case into a guideline category. I argue that the government amendments make very clear the wide discretion that exists within this duty to follow guidelines. There is no requirement on a sentencer to sentence within a narrowly defined range. It is not, in our view, correct to say that this duty is unduly restrictive, that it fetters judicial discretion or that it stops the sentencer from doing justice in an individual case. That power of a sentencer, be it a magistrate or a High Court judge, remains as it always has.</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09071580000017"></a>It is important that we have properly constituted guidelines and that these guidelines be followed. It has been said from all sides in this debate that guidelines assist sentencers; they help to provide consistency, which earlier in today&#146;s proceedings was considered to be an absolute sine qua non, if I may use the expression. Consistency is what sentencing should be about. Guidelines can also increase public confidence in

Is he saying that, up to now, many sentences have been misconceived; and were inconsistent because the wrong approach was adopted by the court? If so, can the Minister give any indication of whether Her Majesty&#146;s Government made any calculation of what percentage of sentences that was? Was it minuscule, substantial or massive? Secondly, can I put a point that I raised two nights ago very late at night? I did not then expect the Minister to reply. That concerned what the Court of Appeal decided in 2007 in relation to the whole question of guidelines in the case of R v Martin. The court said that guidelines are guidelines&#151;no more and no less. It seems to me that, in light of what the Minister is now saying, guidelines will be something much more than mere guidelines.</p>

<a name="09071580000019"></a><b><a name="90715-0010.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09071580000115"></a>Lord Bach:</b> It will be expected that the guidelines are followed unless it is not in the interests of justice as far as the individual judge who is sentencing is concerned. The noble Lord asked for examples; I will give one. It comes from the Gage report and I do not make great claims for it, but the noble Lord asked me and I give it to him. I do not claim that it is systematic or that it proves anything in itself. The Gage working group surveyed sentencing decisions in 10 Crown Courts. In that survey, in 46 per cent of cases, sentencers sentencing for the offence of burglary passed a sentence that was outside the guideline range. That may well have been justified in the circumstances of those 46 per cent; on the other hand, it may have been a rather high percentage that was outside the range.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09071580000020"></a>It must have been&#151;I was going to say anecdotes&#151;evidence, whatever you want to call it, like that that made the majority of the working group, a distinguished working group, under a very distinguished judge, argue, on a majority:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="09071580000091"></a>&#147;The application of guidelines should be sufficiently robust to provide the necessary consistency&#148;&#151;</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09071580000022"></a>This argues for a presumption that the guidelines have to be applied, following the New Zealand model in the New Zealand Sentencing Act 2002. I will just read what that Act says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="09071580000092"></a>&#147;A court must impose a sentence that is consistent with any sentencing guidelines that are relevant to the offender&#146;s case, unless the court is satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so.&#148;</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09071580000023"></a>That is what we are attempting to do in the Bill, following the majority view of the Gage working group.</p>

That is our view and I think it was probably the view&#151;although how dare I speak for them?&#151;of the members of the Gage working group. They had before them various choices. They had the United States experience, which they rejected out of hand&#151;I think everyone here agrees that that was the right thing to do. They had the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which has been praised by noble Lords this evening in a way I do not think I have ever heard that Act praised before in this House. They also had the New Zealand Sentencing Act 2002. They had these three before them; I have no doubt that they may have had others in mind too. On a majority, they favoured the phrasing that was used in the New Zealand Sentencing Act 2002. The Government, too, in their turn, following the Gage recommendation&#151;and it was a recommendation&#151;think that that is an appropriate way of phrasing this issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09071580000026"></a>The &#147;interests of justice&#148; phrase is the most significant phrase in all this, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, was arguing. It means that a judge can pass the sentence that he or she wants to pass. That is why I find it hard to see what the objection is to the use of the word &#147;must&#148;, as far as the guidelines are concerned, as opposed to the words in the 2003 Act.</p>

Is he concerned, as I am, given the response of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, that others may misunderstand the Government&#146;s intentions and, far from making the guidelines slightly more strict, it might have the opposite effect and the judiciary might treat the guidance with less respect and more freely?

What the guidelines do&#151;and to this extent, I do not believe that they differ from the previous guidelines&#151;is to set down what you, as a judge, in the normal way, should regard as the appropriate sentence. However, if there are circumstances that mean that you do not feel it would be just to apply the guidelines and you are satisfied as to that, you can depart from them. The previous test was framed differently. The previous test said that you must have regard to the guidelines, but it also went beyond that, because, as the Minister indicated, if you were going to depart from the guidelines, the judge had to give reasons for departing from the guidelines.</p>

The reason we are seeking to change the law in this regard is because the Gage working party thought there was a need to be slightly more robust and it thought that this phraseology was more robust than the existing one. They were concerned with consistency. As for predictability, that is important because we need to plan for prison places and probation resources. That does not mean that sentencing is determined by resources, but it is key to the Gage report recommendations. We need to improve predictability, because we do not want a sentencing grid.</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09071580000033"></a>The Gage report, at paragraph 4.14, says that there is, at present, no information on departures, but it goes on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_58"></a><a name="09071580000093"></a>&#147;In our view this represents another defect in the present system&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09071580000034"></a>I am asked why transparency is relevant. It is relevant so that the public and victims of crime have some understanding of the range of sentences that are likely to be imposed for a given offence. I put it as broadly as that. It is also important, of course, to defendants, so that they know what they might expect if they commit, or have committed, a crime, and, of course, for lawyers who represent them.</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09071580000035"></a>I am conscious that I have been on my feet for some time. I hope I have put the Government&#146;s case on this. I think the complaint that this is somehow going to restrict judges&#146; independence of action on sentencing to an extent whereby they become mere ciphers and just do what the state wants is hugely misplaced. It is for those reasons that I am going to move the government amendments in due course and I ask the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, to withdraw his amendment.</p>

It has not been pointed out to me what benefit there is in changing the test. The only one appears to be consistency, but I am not clear how it will help consistency in any way. As for the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, I am bound to say that I disagree with him when he says that these two tests will be treated as being the same. I do not think that they will be. As a matter of common sense, judges all over the country will see this as being, and as having been intended to be, a stricter test than that which they already apply. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

They are aimed at helping households permanently to cut their energy bills and contributing to permanent CO2 reductions. Both orders have been developed closely with stakeholders and were warmly received and supported through formal public consultation.</p>

<a name="90715-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09071580000038"></a>I shall speak to the CERT order first. CERT is a programme that, alongside its predecessor&#151;the energy efficiency commitment&#151;has already demonstrated its effectiveness. Over 6 million households have been helped with energy-saving measures such as insulation since 2002, with around 1 million households assisted in the past year alone. However, we need to keep increasing our efforts if we are to help the most vulnerable in society and to meet our security of supply and climate change goals. As part of this, we consulted earlier on a proposal to increase the CERT obligation on energy suppliers.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200809/ldhansrd/text/90715-0011.htm"/>


<a name="90715-0011.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09071580000039"></a>This consultation received substantial support for an increase, and the order gives effect to this by increasing the suppliers&#146; target by 20 per cent&#151;from  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1230"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1230</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>154 million lifetime tonnes of CO2 to 185 million tonnes&#151;which will mean making annual savings of more than 5.6 million tonnes of CO2 by 2011. This makes it the biggest household carbon-saving programme by some distance. The effect of this will be that an extra &#163;600 million is likely to be invested by energy suppliers in helping households to install energy-efficiency measures, bringing total support under the programme between 2008 and 2011 to an estimated &#163;3.2 billion. Of this, we estimate that around &#163;1.9 billion will be directed at vulnerable households in the priority group of customers who are 70 years and over, and those on qualifying benefits.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09071580000040"></a>Alongside the increased target, we consulted on a number of specific changes to the design of the scheme. We consulted on the principle of including behavioural measures, namely home energy advice and real-time displays, as eligible measures within the scheme. This will help people better to understand their energy use and, we hope, empower consumers to take informed decisions on reducing their energy use.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09071580000041"></a>We received many responses on this point&#151;not all of the same view&#151;but on balance we have decided to include these measures within CERT. We have recognised the risks raised by some stakeholders that, as real-time displays are novel, long-term studies of the carbon-saving effects are not yet available. However, we believe that we should use behavioural measures and that they will reinforce the take-up of traditional measures. Given that they are new measures, suppliers will be able only to promote behavioural measures of up to 2 per cent of their carbon-saving target.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09071580000042"></a>We proposed in the consultation to curtail the number of compact fluorescent lamps directly mailed to households, in recognition of the high number of high-efficiency lights distributed early in CERT. Many households have been able to save energy with CFLs, and while we recognise the risks of non-use from continuing such high levels of distribution, we are, therefore, working with Ofgem to ensure that a broad range of bulbs are promoted by suppliers, whereby consumer choice is respected as far as possible in terms of the light fitting, lamp design and wattage output promoted. We have also decided that, as from 1 January 2010, only those schemes which result in a direct purchase of a CFL through a retail outlet will be eligible under CERT&#151;thus excluding direct mail and other &#147;give away&#148; schemes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09071580000043"></a>I now turn to the community energy saving programme. This order places a new carbon-reduction obligation on energy suppliers and, for the first time, on electricity generators, to deliver an estimated &#163;350 million of energy-efficiency measures to homes. These measures will reduce CO2 emissions and permanently reduce fuel bills. CESP places a carbon-reduction target on obligated energy companies, which they discharge by delivering carbon-abatement measures in homes. They will achieve this by offering a range of energy-efficiency measures, similar to CERT, which count towards their targets.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09071580000044"></a>The distinction between CESP and CERT is, first, that CESP will aim wherever possible to provide a package of several different energy-efficiency measures  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1231"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1231</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to each home that it targets, with a particular focus on some of the more expensive measures, such as solid wall insulation, geared towards hard-to-treat homes. CESP should, therefore, make a significant difference to the carbon emissions, and the fuel bills, of the homes it targets.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09071580000045"></a>Another important difference is the community approach which CESP will deliver in deprived areas. It is an ambitious and innovative programme. We expect it to make a big impact in the areas which it supports. The aim is to deliver up to 100 schemes, benefiting some 90,000 households across Great Britain and, by December 2012, delivering measures which will save nearly 2.9 million tonnes of CO2. We estimate that CESP will deliver lifetime fuel bill savings in excess of &#163;600 million. However, CESP will also be important in informing the longer-term strategy on energy efficiency. It will provide evidence on the benefits of using a community-based approach to deliver energy-efficiency measures, particularly in hard-to-treat homes. This community approach is one of the key features of CESP. Energy suppliers and generators also will benefit from working in partnership with local authorities and community organisations to help promote and deliver measures.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09071580000046"></a>This approach is important to enable CESP to be implemented in a way that is best suited to individual communities, bringing people and groups together to deliver shared objectives. It is also, importantly, specifically designed to deliver whole-house packages of measures in individual homes, with the aim of improving energy efficiency and lowering energy consumption for each household. This will enable householders to make a single decision about which measures are installed.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09071580000047"></a>It is important to note that we expect these measures generally to be free to householders. This, coupled with the fact that CESP will specifically incentivise high-cost measures, such as solid wall insulation, will therefore have a major impact not only on a household&#146;s carbon emissions but on its future fuel bills.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09071580000048"></a>I am grateful to the Merits Committee for its helpful consideration of both orders. I assure noble Lords that the orders are fair, complement each other, and form part of a cohesive approach.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09071580000049"></a>The consultation was very positive towards CESP, but we have made some changes. We have expanded the list of eligible measures to include draught-proofing and high-efficiency glazing, to strengthen CESP&#146;s whole-house approach. Also, in response to consultation, some respondents raised concerns that independent electricity generators would bear disproportionate costs when compared to energy suppliers&#151;particularly where they had no experience of delivering CERT. We recognised through the consultation that the costs for these companies might be particularly uncertain.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09071580000050"></a>To address these concerns, many consultees believed that obligated parties should be able to trade up to 100 per cent of their obligation and not just the 75 per cent that was proposed in the consultation. They argued that this would assist independent electricity generators and other new parties under CESP by enabling them to trade their obligation to companies whom they believed could potentially achieve the same carbon saving more easily and cost effectively. This

On the basis of these views, we have decided that all parties with obligations under CESP will be able to trade up to 100 per cent of their obligation.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09071580000051"></a>Consultation has demonstrated considerable support for the amendments to CERT and encouragingly for the new CESP scheme. I commend the orders to the House and look forward to the debate. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09071580000052"></a><b><a name="90715-0011.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09071580000127"></a>Lord Reay:</b> My Lords, the measures contained in these orders, whatever their merits&#151;I certainly would not wish to assert that they have no merits&#151;will add substantially to the costs of electricity users. If I follow the report of the Statutory Instruments Committee correctly, the 20 per cent CERT increase will cost &#163;1.1 billion, which, as it happens, is about the same amount as electricity consumers pay today on an annual basis for the ROC subsidy to wind-farm operators. According to paragraph 4 of the committee&#146;s report, the CERT &#163;1.1 billion is accounted for by a &#163;363 million cost to householders to part-pay for measures&#151;presumably capital costs&#151;and &#163;582 million to energy suppliers who will, of course, as they are explicitly permitted to do, pass it on to consumers and a &#163;160 million cost to local authorities and social landlords. How much of these costs will be recurring, how much are one-off costs and over how long a period will they be spread? To ward off criticism, the Government in their impact assessment have introduced an enormous figure which they simply assert will be the financial long-term benefit of the measure over its lifetime. In this case they have picked the figure of &#163;3,523,000,000.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09071580000053"></a>The Government hope that the improvement in the standards of energy efficiency, which the CESP order seeks to promote, will bring a reduction in the number of households classified as being in fuel poverty. It seems to me highly probable that that could be more than offset by the number pushed into fuel poverty by the increase in their bills due to companies passing on their costs. That possibility is mentioned also by the Statutory Instruments Committee.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09071580000054"></a>In recent years, the number of households classified as being in fuel poverty has been increasing. The Government have been moving away from, not towards, their fuel poverty targets. The community energy saving programme is directed at the lowest income households in an attempt to deal with the fuel poverty problem. That will only add to the costs which the companies will have to recover from all other consumers and, as the Statutory Instruments Committee report points out, there will be very few beneficiaries in rural areas, only payers. Therefore, issues of fairness arise, as the committee points out, as well as affordability.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09071580000055"></a>Of course, not all increases in electricity bills are necessarily attributable to climate change legislation such as this. In my submission, the consumer should be informed of the contribution that he is making towards meeting the Government&#146;s climate change targets. The Government are always singing the virtues of transparency in other contexts, so why do they not oblige electricity suppliers to inform their customers, private and business, on their bills of how much is attributable to each relevant piece of climate change

Would that not be in the interests of transparency? Would it not also give consumers the moral satisfaction and, to some extent, the kudos of knowing how substantial their contribution was to meeting what the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, only this afternoon called the moral challenge of our time, or are the Government afraid that if consumers knew what they were paying, that would spell the end of any chance of the Government meeting their fanciful renewable energy targets?</p>

I wish to make two points on the community energy saving programme and two points on the carbon emissions reduction order. Today has been a big day for energy news and doubtless there will be much commentary on what has been said&#151;my noble friend has just alluded to some of it. It is reasonable to relate these orders to a couple of the bigger issues and the broader picture before I go on to my four points.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09071580000057"></a>A certain amount in the orders relates to wind. Sadly, by the end of July, we shall have no major domestic wind systems manufacturer in this country as the Vestas plant is being shut down on the Isle of Wight and on the mainland in Southampton, with the loss of 600 jobs. I am very concerned about capacity. I shall not labour the point because doubtless it was dealt with this afternoon on the Statement.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09071580000058"></a>I am also concerned about the consumer, as my noble friend was in his formidable expose. Yesterday and today, the First Secretary has been very busy recalibrating, to use a delicate phrase, the Government&#146;s approach to cuts in spending, in effect, saying that the Government should be much more straightforward about the problems that they would face if they continue in government. It is important that the Minister lets the House know whether all additional costs on consumers which may come from these two orders are built into the figure of the average cost laid on consumers across the country of &#163;90 or &#163;92 given by the Secretary of State in another place. Have those costs been rolled in? I happen to think&#151;I do not know what my noble friend thinks&#151;that the suggestion that it is a mere &#163;90 is rather strange and that the actual burden will be much closer to &#163;250, as experts have been saying during the course of the day.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09071580000059"></a>In a spirit of inquiry, I would love to know the answers to those questions. It has always been enjoyable inquiring of the Minister, as he and I used to debate in the council chamber of the City of Oxford. He has always been lucid and straightforward in what he has said. At the time, the town clerk in his wig passed a comment on the pair of us saying that we showed some promise if only we concentrated a bit more. Look where we ended up.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09071580000060"></a>Turning to the orders, on the community energy saving programme order, I am concerned about the geography of the areas that will benefit from the quite interesting experiments which will be carried out and monitored between now and 2012. Unfortunately, a lot of deserving communities in low-income areas will not benefit. A walk over a few hundred yards from the City of London, where I work during the day, into the  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1234"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1234</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>East End means crossing a gross-domestic-product-per-head fault line. It is like falling off a cliff of higher incomes to lower incomes. I do not think that the people in that area will benefit, although I am happy to be corrected on that. Will the Minister undertake that he and his officials will consider the fairness of the geography of the scheme when evaluating it up to 2012?</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09071580000061"></a>Is the Minister really convinced that the community energy saving programme order can be delivered by energy suppliers and electricity generators for as little as &#163;350 million? I think that is an underestimate. Are not these estimates often overoptimistic&#151;just as is, it seems to me, the estimate given by the Secretary of State in another place today on the costs likely to be laid on consumers following the package that he has announced? Consumers have every reason to be worried, as my noble friend Lord Reay pointed out.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09071580000062"></a>I turn to the two points that I wish to make about the carbon emissions reduction order, which is trying to help with the 20 per cent increase in the carbon emission reduction target. There has been a lot of consultation about that and some sensible responses to the consultation by the Government, notably in reaction to providing carbon-saving uplifts to both do-it-yourself and professionally installed loft insulation. I welcome the Government&#146;s positive response to representations made. There have also been a few daftnesses&#151;if that is a word; doubtless <I>Hansard</I> will correct me if it is not&#151;in past policies, such as allowing direct-mailed high-efficiency light bulbs to be qualifying measures. I never thought that that was sensible. Why do we have to wait until the beginning of 2010 to stop that direct-mailing practice, with HECA- tudes of bulbs piling up in some peoples homes where they are not used? Why can it not be stopped immediately, or at least as soon as the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2009?</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="09071580000063"></a>My second point is again on what may be termed gimmicky ideas. I appreciate that trying to introduce some of the things that the noble Lord has spoken about&#151;taking up real-time displays, for example, and smart metering&#151;require not just money but considerable changes in what doubtless professionals in the trade call consumer behaviour. That means, so we are told in the order, that there will be an awful lot of home energy advice. Home energy advice is not adequately costed. It is referred to more than once. Is any of the so-called home energy advice to persuade consumers to change their behaviour, take up real-time displays, to indulge in smart metering, and all the rest of it, to be a public cost, in whole or in part? Putting it in shorthand, is there an advertising budget for that with which HMG are concerned?</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="09071580000064"></a>Following the First Secretary&#146;s rightful remarks over the past two days that the Government should really come out and say what they are spending and what they are cutting, it is best to be open about those costs. I rely on the Minister to do just that.</p>

First, they are fairly complex instruments and fairly difficult to understand. I am not sure that, for the size of the task, they are the right tool. To put

Where does this get us in terms of that stock, 80 per cent of which will still be around in 2050?</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="09071580000066"></a>These two measures, although commendable to a certain degree, are fairly small in their effect on the overall picture. In fact, I believe that the CESP is expected to affect 90,000 households, which is about 0.5 per cent of the total housing stock, yet we require something like a 29 per cent cut in carbon emissions in the sector, as we heard earlier.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="09071580000067"></a>One thing that I find fundamentally flawed about this&#151;I am slightly off piste in terms of my party on this point&#151;is whether the energy companies are really the right people to deliver the programme. I was interested in the evidence base in paragraph 3, which stated that household energy suppliers are well placed to deliver carbon dioxide savings from their customers. It states that they are well placed to inform them of the potential measures to save money&#151;to save energy. The key thing for an energy company is to produce efficient energy and to sell it to its consumers. To get them to concentrate in this area is a bit like putting the editor of the <I>News of the World</I> in charge of phone-tapping policy.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="09071580000068"></a>If we sat on the board of one of those energy companies&#151;perhaps some people here do, I do not know&#151;I cannot imagine that high up on the agenda of their key performance indicators is carbon emissions and energy saving targets. Clearly, they will be making sure that they comply with government targets, and the orders increase them, but I think that it is an area of delivery that is bound to fail.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="09071580000069"></a>I want to ask the Minister two questions. Normally, when we go through these orders, we all ask about 10 questions. Usually, the Official Opposition get about half of them answered; the Lib Dems about 25 per cent. I shall stick to two questions. We talked earlier this afternoon, in the debate about the White Paper on moving to a low-carbon economy, about the North Sea gas transition programme, which is the big game, the big opportunity. I know that the orders are included in the White Paper as part of that overall reduction, but, for me, that is key: the street-by-street conversion policy that goes through UK plc. It may be very difficult to do, but that is the big game. To me, this seems like a sideshow. How do those two come together?</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="09071580000070"></a>At the other end of the scale, do the orders really tackle the issue of the poor consumer in fuel poverty in the north-east of England&#151;an example I was asked to give by one of my colleagues&#151;who is elderly, a tenant and whose landlord is not interested in any of this, but just collecting a rent, who is on a prepayment meter, which are still being installed throughout the country? Do the orders help that citizen to get out of their fuel poverty and get their landlord to put in proper energy-saving measures that ensure that they can live securely and warmly in their environment?</p>

I know for sure that the question of the noble Lord, Lord Reay, about the cost to the consumer, particularly the disadvantaged consumer&#151;a point taken up by the noble Lord, Lord Teverson&#151;is valid. We know that the Government are a little slow on getting round to tackling fuel poverty. They have been very slow, and they are not getting any faster.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="09071580000072"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked one or two questions that I had written down, which I shall not repeat because he has already asked them. Perhaps I may just whistle through one or two. We support the carbon emissions reduction target and the sentiment behind the community energy saving programme, but we are concerned about the implementation, aware that the Government recently spent, as we heard, &#163;16 million on the Warm Front scheme, distributing energy-saving light bulbs to every household. I am delighted to hear that the Government have realised that that was a complete waste of time and that they will not do it again.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="09071580000073"></a>The community energy saving programme includes home energy advice as a measure that can be offered where experts will visit householders and audit current energy, allowing households to take simple, easy steps to reduce energy consumption and cut their fuel bills. I, too, find that difficult to visualise happening in some houses. Given that there are already many energy assessors out of work, I ask whether they will be fulfilling the role of the home energy advisers.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="09071580000074"></a>The Government have estimated that 60 pert cent of the total funding available under the community energy saving programme will go to low-income and elderly householders, who will receive free or substantially discounted energy-saving improvements such as insulation. Will the Minister clarify whether this will be in addition to the support already available to those vulnerable households?</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="09071580000075"></a>I have listened, as we all have, to some of the Government&#146;s good ideas on CESP and CERT, so the Minister might like to listen to a good idea from this side and see whether he agrees with it. One of our policies is to grant an entitlement to householders to approved home energy-efficiency works up to the value of &#163;6,500. The cost would then be recovered automatically through the household energy bill over a period of up to 25 years, but with a payback period, in terms of reduced fuel consumption, that is substantially shorter. This will be in addition to CERT. Does the Minister think that that is a good idea and would he like to add it to the list of measures that he thinks will tackle these two problems?</p>

I preferred the noble Baroness&#146;s initial assessment of the orders to her later revision.

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="09071586000002"></a>The noble Baroness referred at the end of her speech to her party&#146;s proposed loan guarantee of &#163;6,500 per household. I am slightly puzzled by it, because, by my reckoning, the implication of its being  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1237"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1237</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>a loan guarantee is that a Conservative Government would be guaranteeing what could be up to &#163;200 billion of loan. I am confused because I had understood that the Conservative Party was concerned about both personal debt and national debt. I am not quite sure how the two mix together. It is clear, as was pointed out earlier today, that we have many households where energy-saving provisions will be expensive, which is why we announced in the White Paper proposals to try out schemes which recognise that, in order for householders to be willing to pay or to take out loans, there has to be a realistic possibility of there being a payback provision over a reasonable time. That is the key to unlocking the door of many of those homes where the cost of the various energy-saving devices that can be taken is very high. As I said earlier today, it is one of the biggest issues that we need to crack.</p>

<a name="90715-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="09071586000003"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, was of course right to raise the more general and fundamental issue of energy saving. In a sense, I have just answered that point. I have no doubt that what we are proposing in CESP and CERT is part of a cohesive approach. Although the noble Lord may be disappointed by the numbers covered, it is none the less an important contribution. However, I also accept, as I have already said, that there are many homes where the costs will be considerably higher than could be covered under these programmes, and it is vital that we tackle that. The transition to a low-carbon Britain will not be able to be successful unless we can really tackle the requirement for energy saving in homes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="09071586000005"></a>The noble Lord was right to raise fuel poverty among tenants. He will know that it is not always easy to deliver support to the private rented sector given the condition of that sector and the motivation of some private-sector landlords. CESP should be able to make some difference. In particular, the community-partnership approach with local authorities and the incentive for companies to tackle all homes in an area should, we hope, reach the sometimes-difficult-to-reach consumers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="09071586000006"></a>After Oxford, I moved to Birmingham and was a local authority councillor there for a time. One of the most imaginative schemes that I have seen was called &#147;enveloping&#148;, which was concerned not with energy but with the inner-city parts of Birmingham. A whole street, whether it comprised owner occupation or private landlords, would be refurbished outside and in. It was an outstandingly successful approach. It was of course expensive as well, but it saved the inner city. In a sense, this is what we need in relation to energy saving as well. The numbers involved in CESP are significant and they are a start. We shall see how it works and I hope that, if it is successful, we can begin to build on it.</p>

In that sense, I was not disappointed. He was right to raise the cost of these measures and of what might be described as other climate change measures, how that pans out in bills and what the consumer will have to pay. The figures that he referred to were right, but these costs are one-off, and the benefits will be ongoing for the life of the measures. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Patten, that these costs are built into the figures generally in the White Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="09071586000009"></a>Let us return to costs&#151;a point was raised about the particular problems of the fuel-poor and the impact on them of the measures. We do not have any choice in this matter. It is not a choice between high-cost, low-carbon energy and low-cost, high-carbon energy. We are set on a course to mitigate climate change to 2 degrees centigrade. We have to move to a low-carbon economy and are committed to doing so. That has certain implications in relation to cost. I know that noble Lords disagree with the Government&#146;s assessment of the overall cost. Taking account of all existing climate change policies and those that we announced today, we reckoned in the White Paper that the cost would by 2020 be about 8 per cent higher, or &#163;92 per household. I know that some commentators think that it is higher, but the Government are confident of their own figures, which take account of energy-saving estimates as well&#151;in other words, it is a net cost&#151;but that is not unreasonable since we are committed to a large programme of energy-saving measures. At the end of the day, I pray in aid the noble Lord, Lord Stern, in this regard, whose clear advice to the Government was that delaying action would in the end cost much more than taking action now.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="09071586000010"></a>I accept that, in making decisions which will have an impact on the prices paid by consumers, there is a strong obligation on the Government to make sure that this is done in the most cost-effective way and in a fair way, and I accept the noble Lord&#146;s comments about the particular challenge of the fuel-poor at the moment because of the rise in prices. We had been very successful in reducing the numbers of fuel poor, but in recent years the cost of energy has unfortunately led to an increase. We are ever mindful of the need to ensure that tariffs are fair and that we have regard to the consequence for the fuel poor. That is why today we announced mandatory powers in relation to the social tariff, building on the already successful voluntary scheme exercised by the companies.</p>

Reverting to the figure of &#163;92 by 2020, the extra burden from these measures laid on the average household: that is 10 years away. The figure of &#163;92 is very precise. Does the noble Lord really have complete confidence in the forecasting ability of any Government, whether Labour, Liberal or Conservative, to say that in 10 or 11 years the sum is going to be exactly &#163;92? I think that it will be in the area of &#163;200 to &#163;250, but that is another argument, and that is a broad-brush approach. Are the Government really wise to suggest that it will be &#163;92, not a penny more, not a penny less?</p>

No doubt this House will finally have been reformed by 2020, but if we are still here then we might be able to debate the question of whether I got that figure right or not. It is the best estimate that we have, and we expect that, for the next four or five years, the increase will be minimal. The cost will rise in the latter part of the next decade. I know that there is a disagreement about these costs, and I suspect that the costs to which the noble Lord refers probably do not take account of the potential impact of energy-saving measures. It could be that that is the reason for that discrepancy. I will be happy to discuss this with him to see if we can at least reach agreement on the methodology, as this is a very important matter.</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="09071586000013"></a>I fully understand the point that the noble Lord, Lord Reay, makes about energy bills showing what households are paying towards energy efficiency schemes. He may recall that we debated this very fully last autumn, although I forget whether we were debating the Energy Bill or the Climate Change Bill. We continue to explore with suppliers the best way to strengthen consumers&#146; awareness of these issues. I have no disagreement with him in terms of the principle. The Government have made it quite explicit today that there will be a cost issue for consumers, and although noble Lords disagree about the figure, I hope they will agree that it is very good to have this in the public domain. I agree with the noble Lord that it is very important that this is understood. It is why, incidentally, we are very keen about home energy advice. I noted the concerns and questions that the noble Lord, Lord Patten, and the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, raised. We see this is as one of a range of energy efficiency measures that suppliers can promote. Suppliers have discretion about how they market, and costs will fall to suppliers, although we have already accepted that this can be passed on in customers&#146; bills. It is the same point about transparency. The more information we can give the consumer, the better. That is why it is important that we have introduced behavioural measures through the scheme.</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="09071586000014"></a>This is also a very good introduction to smart meters. A number of noble Lords are passionate about the impact that smart meters can have. I accept that advice standards need to be of a high quality. My understanding is that only qualified personnel will be allowed to give advice, that Ofgem will require that all advisers have had a CRB check and character references, that suppliers must also provide advice on a specific set of behavioural issues, and these behaviours will obviously come within the kind of framework of regulation which I have suggested. I accept that there must be integrity in this process.</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="09071586000015"></a>I refer to the question of rurality. In the consultation we received many conflicting views about how the programme should be targeted. We consulted on the basis that CESP should use the lower income domain of the indices of multiple deprivation to target activity. These areas are in the lowest 10 per cent of income deprivation in England, and the lowest 15 per cent in Scotland and Wales. This will cover more than 2.5 million households in around 4,500 defined areas. The majority of responders agreed that the indices represented transparent objectives and a simple approach. There

However, if CESP is to have its maximum value, it is important that it should foster a reasonable spread of different types of project in different types of location. The Government therefore expect obligated companies seriously to consider targeting action at a variety of areas around the country, including rural areas. We will facilitate contacts where this would be helpful. We will monitor and evaluate all schemes to ensure that any lessons relevant to rural delivery are considered in future policy development.</p>

The noble Lord expressed concern about whether the energy supply companies were the best people to do this. I understand his concerns but, on the other hand, the companies are there and have current experience. It is our job as a Government to make sure that it is done effectively. The revision that we are making in relation to the CESP order is surely an indication that we do look at how this is working and have made changes where we do not think that it is working effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="09071586000019"></a>I now come to light bulbs. Before the reshuffle four weeks ago, I also had responsibility in Defra, where I was Minister for light bulbs. I understand the reasons why noble Lords are concerned. I, too, heard stories about millions of light bulbs being given out that were not used. I understand the point that the noble Lord made about direct mail. That is why we have made the changes. However, I defend the previous policy. It is a no-brainer that energy efficient light bulbs are a good thing to have. Lots of customers have taken them and now use them, but we have learnt from experience and have come up with what is probably the right way forward.</p>

The amendment may seem unnecessary, but it may be more necessary than at first appears. The reason for this is the experience that the United States has had in relation to sentencing guidelines of this kind.</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="09071586000022"></a>The United States has had sentencing guidelines for many years&#151;since 1984, I think&#151;but not long ago, in about 2002, the Prospect Act, I think it was called, was passed, under which it was possible for Congress to monitor the performance of certain courts in the United States to see whether they were consistently sentencing within the guidelines or whether some courts were sentencing consistently below the guidelines. That is very similar to what is proposed in the clause that we are now discussing.</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="09071586000023"></a>Certain remarks were made by a great United States judge, Chief Justice Rehnquist, drawing attention to the inherent danger in this approach to sentencing. I shall read two or three passages from the remarks that he made on 5 May 2003, which he repeated in his last end-of-year report to Congress in 2004. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="09071586000037"></a>&#147;The second topic I would like to address is the recent efforts by some in Congress to look into downward departures in sentencing by federal judges, in particular our colleague Judge James Rosenbaum. We can all recognise that Congress has a legitimate interest in obtaining information which will assist in the legislative process&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071586000032"></a>We all agree with that. He continued:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="09071586000038"></a>&#147;But the efforts to obtain information may not threaten judicial independence or the established principle that a judge&#146;s judicial acts cannot serve as a basis for his removal from office&#148;.</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="09071586000024"></a>Later he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="09071586000039"></a>&#147;The new law&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09071586000033"></a>the Prospect Act, although I cannot remember its exact name&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09071586000041"></a>&#147;also provides for the collection of information about sentencing practices employed by federal judges throughout the country. This, too, is a legitimate sphere of congressional inquiry, in aid of its legislative authority. But one portion of the law provides for the collection of such information on an individualized, judge-by-judge basis. This, it seems to me, is more troubling&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071586000034"></a>Finally, he said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="09071586000040"></a>&#147;There can be no doubt that collecting information about how the sentencing guidelines, including downward departures, are applied in practice could aid Congress in making decisions about whether to legislate on these issues. There can also be no doubt

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="09071586000025"></a>In an age when one can obtain information about almost anything either under the Freedom of Information Act or through other means, it worries me that it might become possible for statistics to be created about how individual judges have performed&#151;whether above or, normally, below the guidelines. If that became possible, it would be a serious interference with the independence of judges. It would intimidate them from performing the function that they are there to perform. That is the danger. The purpose of this amendment is, so far as it is possible, to obviate that. I beg to move.</p>
<a name="time_35"></a>
<a name="90715-0012.htm_time3"></a><h5><a name="09071586000045"></a>8.45 pm</h5>

<a name="09071586000026"></a><b><a name="90715-0012.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09071586000056"></a>Baroness Butler-Sloss:</b> I agree with the amendment put forward by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. I am concerned that one of these days the sentencing council might be under some pressure, particularly from press reporting. It might have to respond to that in a way that is similar to the problem that Chief Justice Rehnquist pointed out in that important passage read by the noble and learned Lord.</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="09071586000027"></a>Amendment 191 is mixed with this. We spent some time before the Dinner Break on consistency and its importance. Here is an area of obvious inconsistency: the non-judicial disposal of cases, ones that used to go to the magistrates&#146; court and are now being dealt with by the police and prosecutors and never get to court. It is estimated that anything up to 55 per cent of all cases are not ever getting to court. There is a real danger of lack of consistency between police forces or prosecutors in different parts of the country.</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="09071586000028"></a>Amendment 191, in my name and the names of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and the noble Viscount, Lord Tenby, proposes that the council should be able to monitor what is going on on the ground in creating out-of-court disposals, fixed penalty notices, penalty notices for disorder and conditional cautions. At the end of the day, somebody who accepts one of these has a criminal mark against them for the rest of their lives, particularly for certain circumstances such as dealing with children. I suspect a conditional caution would be enough to come within the vulnerable persons legislation for being on the register.</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="09071586000029"></a>It is important that there should be some review of the way in which the police and prosecutors&#151;the CPS&#151;deal with people who never actually get to court. There should be some recognition that this is going on to such a large degree and there should be some monitoring. The only organisation that could properly monitor it would be the sentencing council. I appreciate that this might give it a fairly large extra duty, but it is highly desirable that the police and prosecutors should know that the way in which they are working in one part of the country may be wholly different from the way in which they are working in another part. As the Government are so rightly concerned with consistency in court, they ought also to be concerned with non-judicial disposal out of court.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="09071588000093"></a>&#147;For courts to work in the interests of communities, the justice they dispense must be open and visible&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071588000086"></a>All sentences imposed are open to public scrutiny and a matter of public record. However, there is an increasing trend for the police and prosecution to use out-of-court disposals, as my noble and learned friend has said. Data collected by the Magistrates&#146; Association show that there is serious inconsistency in the use of such disposals, a lack of proper recording and misuse for inappropriate offences. These disposals are not subject to public, judicial or any other type of scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="09071588000002"></a>The Justice Secretary has also said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="09071588000094"></a>&#147;Open, visible justice, is therefore a means of ensuring judicial accountability through professional and public scrutiny. It gives legitimacy to public institutions; increasing understanding and dispelling myths about the ways in which they operate&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071588000087"></a>The police and Crown Prosecution Service are such public institutions, and should be subject to proper record and scrutiny of how they use these disposals. I therefore look forward to the Minister&#146;s response.</p>

<a name="09071588000003"></a><b><a name="90715-0012.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09071588000142"></a>Baroness Linklater of Butterstone:</b> I shall speak to other amendments in the group, Amendments 191ZE to 191ZG. Amendments 191ZE and 191ZG are essentially probing amendments. We wondered why &#147;demand&#148; was used in relation to prison places and &#147;resources required&#148; in relation to probation provision and youth justice services. The former sounds more imperious and as if it is more likely to be provided. Indeed, that is the expectation, as we have never reached a position in which our prison places have been officially declared as full, however much we may have been above the certified normal accommodation. There is a far greater need for resources for probation and youth justice services, for which the demand is great and the provision far below what is needed. Is there an assumption that, whatever the demand, prison places will be met and the rest can go hang? If that is the case, it is exactly the opposite of what it should be, in terms both of need and of justice. Will the Government be so kind as to explain what is meant in that subsection?</p>

<a name="90715-0012.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="09071588000004"></a>Amendment 191ZF is another probing amendment. Clause 118(1) says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71"></a><a name="09071588000095"></a>&#147;This section applies where the Lord Chancellor refers to the Council any government policy proposal, or government proposal for legislation, which the Lord Chancellor considers may have a significant effect on one or more of the following&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071588000088"></a>This is followed by the list including,</p>
<ul><a name="09071588000135"></a>&#147;demand for prison places ... resources required for probation provision ... resources required for ... youth justice services&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071588000089"></a>The clause does not make it a duty for the Lord Chancellor to refer such matters to the sentencing council. It does not even make it a permissive power, by saying, &#147;it may refer&#148;. Why was it drafted in this way and what effect will it have on the actions of the Lord Chancellor in referring such matters to the council? This is interesting, in that potentially it implies challenges to government proposals for legislation in relation to effectiveness and a connection between proposals for legislation and how they may work, which would be a most constructive departure.</p>

I agree fully with the noble and learned Lord and with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. It seems rather worrying that the council might be able to move on and comment on individual judges. I am sure that the Minister will be able to assure us that we have missed something in the Bill that makes it clear that they cannot comment on such things. I look forward to an assurance from him that that is the case.</p>

These functions are contained in Clauses 113 to 118.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="09071588000007"></a>The Government believe that these functions are an important development. The Gage working group identified a key role for the council in making these independent assessments to improve clarity and understanding about sentencing and to assist the Government in their planning to meet the demand for prison places, probation and youth justice services.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="09071588000008"></a>We believe that an independent scrutiny of the impact of sentencing guidelines and of government policies and legislation is an important development in the way we deal with penal policy. It is a role designed to increase transparency around the impact of changes in criminal justice policy and legislation.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="09071588000009"></a>On Monday when we considered whether the council needs statutory purposes, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, suggested that we might not need Clauses 113 to 115. With the greatest respect to her, we disagree. We believe that the new duties are so important that the Bill should spell out exactly what is required and avoid any confusion between the respective roles of the council, government and Parliament.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="09071588000010"></a>Amendment 190, of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, supported by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, deals with the council&#146;s duty to monitor the operation of sentencing guidelines. The amendment seeks to ensure that the monitoring duty does not entitle the council to make comments on individual sentencing decisions. I understand the intent but we do not believe that this amendment is necessary, following changes already made to Clause 114 in the other place. The provisions of Clause 114 do not refer to individual sentencing decisions. They refer to the operation of guidelines and to the frequency with which courts depart from guidelines, not to the decisions in individual cases.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="09071588000011"></a>It is clear that the consideration of the legitimacy of a sentencing decision is for the Court of Appeal and not for the sentencing council. I have no doubt that the sentencing council, the majority of which will be made up of judicial members including members of the Court of Appeal, will have no difficulty in recognising the division of functions between monitoring the frequency of departures from guidelines and the legitimacy

I hope that that will reassure those who support that amendment. Our belief is that it is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="09071588000012"></a>Amendment 191 was spoken to by the noble Earl and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss. It seeks to<b></b>add to Clause 114 an additional duty on the council to monitor the operation of, and comment on, the use of out-of-court disposals, such as penalty notices for disorder and conditional cautions. I cannot accept the amendment. Let me explain why. First, Clause 114 relates to the monitoring of &#147;sentencing&#148; guidelines. Out-of-court disposals are by their very nature not sentencing decisions. Indeed, penalty notices involve no admission or finding of guilt and fall outside the functions conferred by this Bill on the sentencing council. That is why they are not covered by sentencing guidelines.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="09071588000013"></a>Secondly, and with slightly more comfort to the noble Earl, I suggest that the clause is unnecessary. This is because Clause 117 already places a duty on the council to consider and report on non-sentencing factors, some of which are included in the Bill, which could have a significant effect on the resources needed to give effect to sentences imposed by the courts. Although this would be a matter for the council, I suggest that changes in the use of non-court diversions could be a factor and indeed are likely to be a factor that the council would wish to consider in its report under Clause 117.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="09071588000014"></a>On the amendments spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, I can, I hope, please her to some extent. Without making any promises, it seems to me worth looking again at the wording she objects to in Amendment 191ZE, and the parallel wording 191ZG. Without making any promises at all, if the noble Baroness withdraws her amendments tonight, I am prepared to take them away and look at them again. It may be that we think that we have the best form of words already. However, she has persuaded me that it is worth looking at again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="09071588000015"></a>She has not persuaded me, alas, on Amendment 191ZF, which would convert the discretion conferred on the Justice Secretary to refer particular policies and legislation to the council into a duty to do so, so that he must refer any policy or legislation that could have a significant impact on resources. The committee will be only too aware of the volume of legislation that Parliament considers. Most legislative changes are unlikely to have a significant impact on correctional services. We have to ensure that the council is not overburdened in carrying out unnecessary assessments.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="09071588000016"></a>The discretion of the Justice Secretary to refer some policy and legislative proposals to the council is meant to allow this new duty for the council to be as practical as possible. That is why the Justice Secretary acts as a single point of reference for the whole of the Government and why he exercises his discretion only to refer policies and legislation that is likely, from the information he has, to have an impact on prison and probation resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="09071588000017"></a>Government departments will continue to make impact assessments of policies throughout the policy development process. Those assessments will inform the Justice Secretary in deciding whether a policy is likely to merit reference to the council either because it will clearly have a significant impact or where those assessments have highlighted potential difficulties in making accurate assessments of what the impact will be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="09071588000018"></a>I hope that it will reassure the noble Baroness if I also point out that there is nothing to stop the council reporting on policies and legislative changes under Clauses 116 and 117 when it makes assessments of the impact of sentencing and non-sentencing factors.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="09071588000022"></a>Amendment 191ZD and the provision that we wish to insert, which we originally discussed under the third purpose of the Bill, is outlined here in the briefing. The role of the council must not only be to promote awareness. The council should have a new duty to extend and develop its role to go beyond simply providing and publishing information when it sees fit. It should have a specific educational, as well as informative, role, which would involve active engagement with the public. This has real possibilities for closing the gap between the system and the public for the first time, and enormous potential for and importance in demystifying and communicating the realities of the sentencing process, as well as promoting the Government&#146;s desire for transparency. This is much more than just producing the occasional report which is likely to be destined to lie on a shelf. It involves reaching out to the community.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="09071588000023"></a>We have already discussed how the public are systemically misinformed about sentencing practices and believe that the courts are much more lenient than they actually are; that sentencers are too soft; that judges and magistrates are out of touch in their courtrooms; that courts are unlikely to use prison for  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1247"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1247</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>serious crimes such as burglary, robbery, rape and so on. Inaccurate media representations of sentencing, such as I read out earlier, feed into public misconceptions.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="09071588000024"></a>The amendment offers a real opportunity to correct these misconceptions. For this to come from the council itself would carry with it the authority that it uniquely has about what it does and how it does it. This role is not totally unique, as other councils have held it in other parts of the world, but it would be quite new to us.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="09071588000025"></a>They key thing is the element of real engagement with the outside world, which could take a number of forms but would essentially involve representatives of the council&#151;or council members themselves, which would be best of all&#151;going out and about in the community and holding, for example, &#147;Any Questions?&#148;-style meetings, seminars or town hall events to communicate what they actually do, while getting feedback from the public. It would involve developing and implementing a public information and education strategy, targeting all sectors of the population and the mass media. It would, of course, be a challenging task, but commensurate with the importance and significance of the opportunity.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="09071588000026"></a>I have had the experience of organising a comparable series of meetings around England between sentencers and other agencies, notably the Probation Service and other providers of programmes for offenders. This was during the course of the Rethinking Crime and Punishment initiative that I chaired for seven years. All I can tell your Lordships is that the results were like an epiphany&#151;in this case for both the judges and those that they met and talked to. It opened their eyes&#151;and these were largely professionals&#151;to the realities of what was available as disposal to them in their own patch on the one hand, and gave insights into how the judges thought and worked on the other. It offered a chance to discuss the issues of common concern and did much to promote understanding and confidence all around.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="09071588000027"></a>This proposal offers something not dissimilar for the wider public: to hear from sentencers and have their eyes opened. Another, similar programme now runs all over the country, organised by the Magistrates&#146; Association, in which magistrates and probation officers do regular presentations to local groups about what they do inside and outside court, using real-life examples. It is called Local Crime, Community Sentence and, for the first time, the public get a real insight into what is being done in their name and the name of justice. They are also invited to participate in the decision-making exercises. This was also started as part of my Rethinking Crime and Punishment initiative; I promise Members of the Committee that there was and is a lot of rethinking. It is now so well established that there are regular award schemes among the different areas each year, run by the Magistrates&#146; Association, for the best groups. It is really impressive.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="09071588000028"></a>I have expectations that the council members would be able to do something similar and equally well. It has now become a necessity. I do not need to explain to the Committee that, with public misunderstanding so extensive and confidence in the criminal justice system as low as it is, something urgently needs to be

The sentencing council will be uniquely well placed to start a process of communication and education for its own, as well as for the community&#146;s, sake. I really hope that on this occasion the Government have ears to hear. I entreat them to take the amendment seriously. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="09071588000029"></a><b><a name="90715-0013.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09071588000148"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> This group of amendments relates to the duty on the council to promote an awareness of matters relating to sentencing. Amendment 191ZA<b></b>changes the requirement on the council so that it &#147;must&#148; promote awareness rather than that it &#147;may&#148; do so. It is worth noting that there is a distinction between subsections (1) and (2) of Clause 115. The duty on the council in Clause 115(1) means the council &#147;must&#148; publish information on sentencing whereas Clause 115(2) provides that the council &#147;may,&#148; promote awareness of matters relating to sentencing. This difference is deliberate. The first is a straightforward duty to publish sentencing data. The promotion of awareness is, however, a much more abstract concept and it is, in our view, less appropriate to tie an independent body to such a statutory duty.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="09071588000030"></a>The Government recognise the importance of promoting an awareness of sentencing issues. We also recognise, however, that the council&#146;s central function is to produce guidelines and to make assessments of the impacts of those guidelines. This will be a significant piece of work. The primary role of the council in setting guidelines means that there is&#151;in fact, there has to be&#151;a significant judicial membership of the council. We should not seek to compromise the independence of those judicial members by placing them in a position where they could be considered to be, or even perceived to be, undertaking a political role. I have in mind, for example, difficulties that might arise if the council&#146;s role is considered to be to promote one kind of sentence over another or to suggest to the public alternatives to custody. It seems to me sensible, therefore, to give the council some discretion as to how it promotes awareness, respecting the role of the Government in setting out penal policy and the resources assigned to correctional services, and the role of Parliament in setting the sentencing framework.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="09071588000031"></a>Amendment 191ZB<b></b>amends the illustrative list of information the council may use to promote awareness to read &#147;custodial and non-custodial sentences&#148; rather than just &#147;sentences&#148;. I do not think this is a necessary clarification for the council. Given its membership, I am sure it will appreciate that &#147;sentences&#148; includes the entire range of sentences from absolute discharges via fines and community orders to life imprisonment.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="09071588000032"></a>Finally, Amendment 191ZD<b></b>makes suggestions about how the council should go about promoting<b></b>awareness, including programmes of education and making grants to bodies to carry out educational programmes. There are many ways in which the council may promote awareness, including the ways set out in this amendment, but the Government do not believe that it is necessary to spell these out as the council already has discretion to undertake these types of activities. The Government do not want to discourage the council from promoting an awareness of sentencing. We want the council to undertake this role&#151;in fact, we actively encourage

What we are concerned about, however, is that this particular role is tying the council to a duty that it may consider inappropriate and impossible to deliver, which would negate any benefits to be gained from the duty. That is why we think the council needs discretion in this particular regard. I hope that in the light of this explanation, the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, will agree to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I hope that he will read what I have said and follow up the evidence. We have lots of evidence with which to illustrate our case. There is no question of members of the council claiming that one sentence is preferable over another. Their role is educational, not political.

I am quite surprised to find myself moving this amendment because my practice when I was a barrister was entirely in the civil field and not at all in the criminal field. However, I became interested in this point when, in September of last year, a report on indeterminate sentences was published by the Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Chief Inspector of Probation. It is one of the most devastating reports that I have ever read.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="09071588000037"></a>I do not know the Chief Inspector of Probation but I have known the Chief Inspector of Prisons, Dame Anne Owers, for many years. I worked with her for a number of years when she was the director of Justice and I was the chair of its executive committee. People generally have the highest regard for her. I have absolute confidence that anything she writes is the truth.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="09071588000038"></a>The Criminal Justice Act 2003 created the indeterminate sentence for public protection, or IPP. It also created a similar sentence of detention for public protection, or DPP, which could be imposed on young people under the age of 18. These two types of sentence are very similar and, for convenience, I will mainly refer to both as IPP. The purpose of an IPP is to enable the courts to override the normal sentencing powers and impose an unlimited or indeterminate sentence on criminals who have been convicted of serious offences&#151;mainly violent or sexual ones&#151;and who appear, or are thought, to pose significant risk of serious harm in the future.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="09071588000039"></a>Ninety-five different offences were included in the list of potentially serious offences, conviction for which could trigger an IPP. The IPP can, however, be applied only if the criminal has at least one previous conviction,  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1251"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1251</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>but that previous conviction could be for one of 153 different offences&#151;not just the 95 that could trigger the IPP, but 58 lesser offences, including affray or criminal damage. Any such previous conviction creates a presumption that there is a serious risk of future harm. An IPP sentence contains a tariff which sets out the minimum time that must be served by the prisoner. The prisoner&#146;s release, however, is dependent not only on their having served their tariff, but on satisfying the Parole Board that they have reduced the risk that they present to the public. If release is granted, it is on licence. An IPP is therefore, in many ways, similar to a life sentence.</p>

<a name="90715-0013.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="09071588000040"></a>IPPs came into effect in April 2005. By the end of 2006, more than 2,000 prisoners had received IPPs. By the end of 2007, 3,700 prisoners were IPP prisoners. It is estimated that 13 per cent&#151;nearly 500&#151;of these prisoners were by then beyond their minimum tariff. It is estimated that the number of IPP prisoners is increasing by 150 per month. As of February of this year, according to figures published by the Criminal Justice Alliance, there were more than 5,000 IPP prisoners. Some 1,487 were already beyond their minimum tariff, but as of four weeks earlier, only 47 of these prisoners had been released on licence. That amounts to only 3 per cent of those who had already passed beyond their tariff.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="09071588000041"></a>In September 2008 the report of the two chief inspectors was published. It points out the fundamental defects of the IPP system. First, the report pointed out that it is essential, if justice is to be done, for the court&#151;before it sentences a prisoner&#151;to have before it accurate reports assessing the extent of the serious risk of harm. The report concluded that many of the assessments were too high and that the courts had not been given sufficient information to guide their decisions. The part of the report on probation input states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79"></a><a name="09071588000103"></a>&#147;Inspectors examined a sample of 48 cases of adult men, young adults and women sentenced to IPPs, to see whether pre-sentence reports (PSRs) properly addressed risk in order to assist the sentencing court. There had been little guidance to probation staff in carrying out this role. Inspectors found ... Of the 45 cases with pre-sentence reports, fewer than half were informed by a full and accurately completed assessment of current and previous offending behaviour ... Of those cases, 31 (over two-thirds) had at least one diverse need, such as mental health, substance misuse, ethnicity or learning difficulties. In only 14 cases did the report demonstrate an understanding of the relevance of the need to the offending or future risk ... Of the 40 cases which had a risk of harm analysis, only half were judged to have given sufficient consideration to risk issues. Inspectors disagreed with the classification in 17 cases, judging it to be inflated in 16 (40% of cases) ... Overall, the quality of the risk of harm assessment was not sufficient to assist the courts adequately in deciding whether to impose an IPP sentence&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071588000090"></a>There is a lot more material which is equally condemning of the machinery by which IPPs are administered.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="09071588000042"></a>Once IPP has been imposed, the Parole Board will expect prisoners to have undergone relevant offender behaviour programmes before they can be released on licence. The arrangement for training is hopelessly inadequate, especially in local prisons, where no relevant training is available and which house hundreds of IPP prisoners. The size of the case load of the Parole Board increased by one-third in the first two years of IPP. That leads to great delays in listing and hearing, not least because, according to the report, only 38 per cent of dossiers arrive on time.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1252"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column 1252</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="09071588000043"></a>The report of the inspectors does not propose that IPP and DPP should be abolished. However, it is impossible to read that report without coming to the conclusion that abolition must be seriously considered. IPP has turned out to be both extremely expensive to the state and unjust to many prisoners, keeping prisoners in jail beyond the tariff period because release is delayed by inaccurate pre-sentencing reports, by the absence of proper training and by delays in access to the Parole Board. It is plainly a waste of public money and unjust to the prisoners, but the cost of remedying the defects would be enormous. It would need thorough and effective pre-sentencing reports on risks presented by those who are potentially subject to IPP. It would need proper offender behaviour programmes for all IPP prisoners and ensuring that all such prisoners should be allocated to prisons where the programmes are available.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="09071588000044"></a>The status quo is simply not acceptable, but I do not believe that, at a time of cutbacks in public spending, we would be justified in spending many millions on improvements to a scheme which might well not succeed in reducing crime at all. We should recognise that IPP and DPP are costing the Ministry of Justice money which would be better spent elsewhere and are keeping prisoners in jail who should not be there. IPP and DPP are experiments that have failed and should be brought to an end. For those already serving IPP and DPP sentences, those sentences should be replaced by the maximum sentence for the offence for which they have been convicted. The minimum tariff period would continue to be the same as at present.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="09071588000045"></a>This is a serious condemnation of our prison system and the time has come for us seriously to consider abolition. The Government should abolish the indeterminate sentence now and keep it abolished. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="09071588000047"></a>As the noble Lord said, the report that she and the Chief Inspector of Probation produced is an absolutely devastating indictment of an appallingly ill-thought-through, ill-considered, expensive and inefficient introduction, which resulted in a grossly overstated, knee-jerk reaction to what was alleged to be a problem. What the noble Lord did not mention was that at about the same time another devastating indictment of IPP was published by the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, which reported in great detail on the results of the imposition of IPP sentences on people, not least on their families, who looked up what an IPP meant on the internet and saw that it meant a sentence of not less than 96 years. How stupid can we be? The only stupider sentence that I have come across was in the Cayman Islands, where I found a man who had been sentenced to life plus 56 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="09071588000048"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has quite rightly run through the figures. When this IPP was suggested, it was felt that it would apply to a few people&#151;hundreds at the very most. The fact that the policy was not thought through was proved almost immediately by the acceleration of the figures to a level that is now totally and utterly unmanageable. What has always seemed totally extraordinary in a grossly overcrowded and under-resourced prison system is that the Prison Service and the Ministers responsible for it have not asked themselves what the cost of this is in terms of their budget.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="09071588000049"></a>There are thousands of prisoners who have been in prison for far longer than they should, and because of the nature of their alleged offence, they are held in the highest security prisons, at a cost of &#163;65,000 a year each. Surely it stands to reason that if you do not have resources, you should look at the problem and decide what in your structure you can afford to cut and, therefore, produce the money that you need to do what has to be done with prisoners who have to be in prison.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="09071588000050"></a>Prisoners have already successfully taken the Ministry of Justice to court because they have not been provided with the courses to enable them to qualify to go to probation to be released and, therefore, there is a sort of revolving circle inside a revolving door. When is it going to come to an end? If you cannot prove that you can be released, you will be there for ever. If more and more IPP prisoners are added, and there are less and less resources to deal with them, you are totally unnecessarily choking the system.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="09071588000051"></a>The only way out of this IPP problem is to acknowledge that it was a hideous mistake and that before the IPP was introduced checks and balances existed in the system whereby if a prisoner was sentenced to life imprisonment&#151;whatever the tariff was&#151;the risk that they represented determined the time of their release. The people who really need to be kept away from the public can be assessed in the way that the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, recognised and can be monitored by the prison authorities to make certain that they are released only when that risk is such that release is warranted. There should not be more than 5,000 people in the prison system whose risk is sufficiently serious to warrant the sort of procedures that are currently being applied to some people whose sentences are as short as 38 days. How can you have an indeterminate sentence based on a 38-day sentence? It is ludicrous.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="09071588000052"></a>If the Government really are serious about rehabilitating prisoners, they should make certain that the resources are there to do it and are not wasted on a system which is costing money for no good purpose and with no outcome for the prisoners in the system. I could not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, more strongly.</p>

Indeterminacy is a particularly difficult sentence for a person to deal with.

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="09071588000054"></a>A number of people serving such sentences, or their relatives, write to me, as I am sure they write to other noble Lords. None of them argues about serving a punishment for the crime, whatever the crime was. All the letters are about the second proviso: you cannot get out until you show us you have changed and you are no longer likely to do it again. How are they to do that? Our method is to require prisoners to attend certain psychologically based courses. I make no comment at all on the method that we have chosen but the courses are not available in the numbers required and for them to be available would require considerable resources. The courts have found that unacceptable. It is also unacceptable as a way of administering justice to individuals who are told that their length of time in prison will be decided by certain methods but that those methods are not available to them.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="09071588000055"></a>The effect of such sentences on the prison system has also been highly undesirable. As time is short, I shall quote only two inspectorate reports. The effect on women should be mentioned. The latest inspectorate report on Downview prison says that there were five such prisoners there and each had met her offender supervisor but little else had happened. None of the offender supervisors had received any training about the sentence. At Gartree prison, prisoners given indeterminate sentences were now competing with ordinary lifers for scarce rehabilitative resources, leaving both populations frustrated. The problems with lack of programmes meant that the waiting list for enhanced thinking skills was up to a year, for healthy relationships was between one and two years, for cognitive self-change was for up to two years, and for CALM was between two and three years. The programmes could not be expanded because they had neither the staff nor the accommodation.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="09071588000056"></a>Prisoners, particularly IPP prisoners, frequently described to the inspectors frustration levels so high that they felt that the only way to be heard or to get a move was to resort to violence. Such findings are very common in inspectorate reports. These sentences have been very destabilising on the prisons which are already the most difficult prisons to run and they are very expensive. I wholeheartedly support the amendment.</p>

The initial concept of crime and punishment was that people should be punished for what they had done, that they should be locked up for a period of time and that they should learn a lesson. Then it occurred to everyone that the sensible thing to do when they were locked up was to try to rehabilitate them so that, when they came out, they were not just given a postal order and let loose on the world without any resources at all, but that they had something behind them. Attempts have been made to rehabilitate.</p>

It is impossible to see where they could ever get the resources to carry out such an ambitious programme. We are left with an intellectual construct that it would be a good idea to manage risk and not to let people out until we are quite sure they have ticked the boxes and gone through the necessary courses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="09071588000059"></a>I have experience of prisoners as people and I think it would be difficult to see some of them sitting in a cognitive improvement course, or whatever the name of the course is. I cannot see that that would do them a great deal of good. It would be far better to teach them to read, to write, to count and to give them some skills, rather than put them in front of a psychologist and tell them to behave themselves in future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="09071588000060"></a>I understand how ambitious the scheme was, but the resources have simply not gone into it. It is a failure, and the Government should recognise that, unless they are prepared to make that investment and put in the resources that such an ambitious programme requires. As a result of it, an awful lot of people are now locked up, frustrated because the courses are not provided, frustrated because the boxes cannot be ticked and staying in prison long beyond the period that the judge who sentenced them thought was reasonable. We are building up a cauldron inside those prisons with these IPPs&#151;5,000, at the moment. If the trend continues, it will get worse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="09071588000061"></a>The Government should go back to basics and get back to the concept of a sentence that lasts for a finite time, so that people know when they are coming out and they can be provided with the necessary courses and skills.

As the Committee knows, those sentences were introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and commenced for offences committed on or after 5 April 2005. Under the 2003 Act, originally, the courts were obliged to pass such sentences on offenders who committed a serious sexual or violent offence&#151;that is one carrying a maximum of 10 years&#146; imprisonment or more&#151;if the court considered them to be dangerous. In this context, an offender might be assumed to be dangerous if they had committed a previous relevant sexual or violent offence.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="09071588000063"></a>The danger that the courts were, and are, required to assess is whether the offender poses a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm by committing further specified sexual or violent offences. The sentences are similar to a life sentence in the way that they operate: the judge sets a minimum period to be served&#151;the tariff&#151;for the purposes of punishment. Once the prisoner has served the tariff, he will be released only if the Parole Board considers him safe to be released into the community.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="09071588000064"></a>I suspect that the amendment has been partly prompted by the difficulties that have been encountered by the high number of public protection sentences imposed with short tariffs.

As the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, just reminded us, we responded by legislating in the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 to confer judicial discretion in the imposition of IPPs and DPPs. The 2008 Act also removed the option of passing a public protection sentence for offences for which the appropriate tariff was less than two years in most circumstances. Those changes to the regime focus it on those offenders from whom the public needs most protection.</p>

However, the individual prisoner is responsible for his own future. The Judicial Committee of this House has confirmed that the Secretary of State has no common law duty to individual prisoners to provide specific courses for IPP prisoners and that detention post-tariff was lawful.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="09071588000069"></a>The Government placed public protection at the centre of their sentencing reforms. The new sentences introduced in the 2003 Act for dangerous sexual and violent offenders are designed to ensure that they are not released until their risks are considered by the Parole Board to be manageable in the community. Those offenders whose risk decreases with time will be released subject to the recommendation of the Parole Board, but it is surely right that we do not release one-time dangerous offenders until it is safe to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="09071588000070"></a>However, the amendment would revert to the position where there was a lack of sufficient sentencing options for offenders who had committed offences which do not carry life but who nevertheless had a high risk of committing a further offence that would cause serious harm to the public. The amendment goes further by providing for the automatic release of prisoners currently serving public protection sentences once they have served the maximum sentence for the offence committed unless they have been released earlier. No consideration would be taken of the risk they might still pose to the public. Is that really acceptable?</p>

In the first six months of 2008, 850 offenders were given an IPP sentence, an average of 141 per month. In the last six months of 2008, following the implementation of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act, 420 offenders were given an IPP sentence, which is an average of 70 per month. So the number of offenders given such a sentence was reduced by one-half as soon as the 2008 legislation came into force.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="09071588000072"></a>We are seeing the impact of changes to the system for managing the indeterminate-sentence prisoners and of changes in categorisation, but this will take some time to have its full impact. By May 2008, the database showed 14 per cent of the IPP population in category C prisons, an increase on the 3 per cent in January of the same year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_315"></a><a name="09071588000073"></a>NOMS has increased provision of accredited programmes, and in excess of &#163;21 million is invested in the delivery of drug treatment programmes in custody. Overall, 64 per cent of IPP prisoners in custody have attended at least one programme in July 2009, compared to a figure of 52 per cent in June 2008 and 65 per cent in March 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="09071588000074"></a>I do not intend at this stage to talk about Clauses 124 and 125. I invite the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, to withdraw his amendment.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Bach, has made out a case which is basically fair enough on the assumption, which I believe is entirely false, that everything is going well. If things were going well, it would be understandable, although still unsatisfactory in many respects. However, the question of significant risk would be justified only if significant risk could be identified with any real prospect of success, which it simply cannot.</p>

<a name="90715-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="09071588000076"></a>In the past, the risk of offences being committed by a criminal in the future was always dealt by the possibility of imposing anything up to the maximum sentence for that crime. The provision for lengthy determinate sentences has always existed, and has worked reasonably well because past criminal record is an important, central feature in determining the length of the sentence. The Minister&#146;s statistics do not satisfy me that we have got anywhere near a satisfactory answer to all of the problems that have arisen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="09071588000077"></a>In the circumstances, I will withdraw the amendment, but I am very grateful for the support that I have received from the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, the noble Baroness, Lady Stern, and my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford. The present situation is a disgrace to the British penal system. Although I withdraw the amendment now, I may seek to bring it back on Report. I beg leave to withdraw Amendment 191A.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="09071588000080"></a>The error does not mean that no order can be made. There is a power under Section 11 of the 1968 Act for the Court of Appeal to,</p>
<ul><a name="09071588000136"></a>&#147;make such an order as the sentencing court would have had the power to make&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09071588000081"></a>and the court could use that power to make a substitute order by reference to the correct regulations, but there is concern that the burden of doing so in a significant number of cases might lead to unacceptable delays in hearing other, perhaps more important, appeals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="09071588000082"></a>The amendment to Section 11 of the Criminal Appeal Act would therefore give the Court of Appeal the power to remit cases to the Crown Court, where a confiscation order is quashed as a result of a successful appeal by the defence.

For brevity, I shall refer to them respectively as the carers order and the exceptions order.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000004"></a>I will say at the outset how much we welcome the broad agreement that exists on conferring on the National Assembly for Wales the powers set out in the draft carers order, and for making the sensible, technical changes set out in the draft exceptions order. The content of the orders was previously set out in a single proposed order that was subject to pre-legislative scrutiny by a committee of the National Assembly in Cardiff Bay, by this House&#146;s Constitution Committee and by the Welsh Affairs Committee in the other place. The Government are grateful to these committees for the scrutiny that they undertook.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000005"></a>Following comments made by this House&#146;s Constitution Committee, the Government and the Welsh Assembly Government decided to separate the previously single order, which covered both carers and the technical changes being made to exceptions, into the two draft orders before us today. These orders, taken together, differ little in content from their single, unified predecessor. The National Assembly for Wales approved them both on 23 June this year.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC244"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC244</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000006"></a>I shall deal first with the draft order on carers. This order forms part of the legislative programme set out by the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government, the right honourable Rhodri Morgan AM, on 15 July last year. It inserts a single matter&#151;matter 15.9&#151;into field 15 of Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006. Field 15 covers the area of social welfare. The competence conferred by this order will enable the National Assembly to legislate to support the provision of care by carers and to promote their well-being. Many noble Lords have taken a keen interest in this subject, and I am sure that we would all acknowledge the vital role that carers undertake not only in Wales but across the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000007"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government wish to bring forward legislation&#151;an Assembly measure&#151;to strengthen support for carers, not as an add-on but as something that goes to the heart of sustainable health and social care services in Wales. They believe that better ways need to be found to identify carers, for example, including young carers, and for the NHS in Wales to work more effectively with carers as partners in the provision of care.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000008"></a>The Committee may be aware that yesterday the First Minister, Rhodri Morgan, announced the third year of the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s legislative programme. It includes a proposal to bring forward an Assembly measure using the powers conferred through this LCO, subject to its successful passage in this House and the other place. I am pleased to say that the Welsh Affairs Committee and the Committee of the Welsh Assembly, which each scrutinised the proposed order, supported the principles and policy that underpin the approach taken towards carers, and recommended that only technical and definitional changes should be made to the content and scope of the order. The Welsh Ministers have also made some minor drafting changes to the earlier order.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000009"></a>The draft order also includes a minor technical change to matter 15.1, which deals with domiciliary care. The matter enables the Welsh Assembly to legislate on the charging for social services that are covered by a direct payments arrangement. The change is needed as the Health and Social Care Act 2008 amended the relevant legislation on direct payments to include a wider range of payment recipients in situations in which an individual lacks the capacity to agree to and manage a direct payments arrangement themselves. This change to the Assembly&#146;s legislative competence therefore reflects the broadening of Welsh Ministers&#146; executive competence that was brought about by the 2008 Act, and is further explained at paragraph 7.14 of the accompanying Explanatory Memorandum.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000010"></a>The National Assembly for Wales (Legislative Competence) (Exceptions to Matters) Order 2009 makes a technical change to the way in which exceptions apply to matters in Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006 by making any exceptions to the legislative competence set out in Part 2 of the schedule apply to all matters in that schedule. There will still be occasions when an exception is included in the text of the matter and is thus matter-specific.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000011"></a>Exceptions are currently listed against specific matters in tables at the end of each field in Schedule 5. The onus is to ensure that each matter has all the relevant  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC245"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC245</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>exceptions applied to it when it is inserted into Schedule 5, which runs the risk that an exception might not be applied to a matter when it is relevant to it. The change will make Schedule 5 clearer and easier to understand by ensuring that exceptions apply in all cases where they are relevant. To put it another way, the onus will be to disapply an exception if it should not be applied to a matter. This is a sensible change that further safeguards both UK government and Welsh Assembly government interests. Exceptions usually apply to areas of policy that are not devolved. Applying these exceptions to all matters in Schedule 5 means that the Government no longer need to decide whether each exception should apply to a new matter.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000012"></a>This Government are firmly committed to devolving legislative competence to the National Assembly, thereby enabling the Welsh Assembly Government to fulfil their commitments to the people of Wales. That commitment is demonstrated once again by the draft orders before us today. It shows that the process of conferring competence on the Assembly by means of Orders in Council&#151;or legislative competence orders, as they are otherwise known&#151;is working well and is being developed and improved.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000013"></a>I commend these orders to the Committee, and I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000014"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09071577000286"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> Before I respond to the Minister, I congratulate him on joining the Wales Office and welcome him to it. I hope that he will have a happy and enjoyable time there, and I assure him that all the usual suspects from this House who take part in Welsh affairs are assembled in the Moses Room. I hope he will appreciate the value of their attendance on many occasions. They all have considerably more experience than I have. Having gone that far, however, I will say a few things about the orders in the same order in which the Minister took them.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000015"></a>The first time I read the Explanatory Note on the National Assembly for Wales (Legislative Competence) (Exceptions to Matters) Order 2009, I wondered where I was. It made absolutely no sense to me at all. I read both the order and the Explanatory Note several times and finally found my way through it, but I congratulate the Minister and his officials on simplifying it for us all. Although we are dealing with them as one, the Government separated one order into two pieces, which makes it much easier to understand and much clearer.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000016"></a>As the Minister has said, the order will amend the Government of Wales Act 2006 by inserting a new matter, matter 15.9, into field 15. The new matter would give the Assembly Government legislative competence to support the provision of care by carers and to promote the well-being of carers, and I join the Minister in wishing all carers well and thanking them for their great work in looking after those of us who need carers and are less able.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000017"></a>The report of the Welsh Affairs Select Committee, which conducted pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposed order, points out, as indeed is pointed out in the Explanatory Memorandum, that Wales has a higher proportion of carers than any region of England or Scotland, together with the highest proportion of people  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC246"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC246</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>suffering from long-term illness, permanent sickness and disability among the economically inactive population. It is worth noting here that under the present crisis the economy of Wales is probably very close to being the worst, if not the worst, in the United Kingdom. That of north-east Scotland may be a little worse but, for the population, Wales is in a poor way, and I am sure that as time goes on its carers will be badly needed.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000018"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government already have a significant level of devolved secondary competence in respect of social welfare. It might be said, therefore, that the proposed order is a logical extension of the existing devolved competence. However, I feel it appropriate to draw attention to the criticism contained in the Select Committee&#146;s report that greater use could have been made of existing powers already vested in the Assembly Government. This is one of the matters that we are concerned about: the Assembly is gaining competence but we are not always happy that it makes best use of it. For example, the Assembly Government have issued no guidance under the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, whereas in England such guidance was issued within 12 months of the engagement of that legislation.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000019"></a>The Assembly Government should not be seeking primary competence where existing secondary competence has not been utilised. Indeed, the Select Committee criticised the Assembly Government for their failure to make full use of their existing power in that regard. The Select Committee did, however, point out that the Government did not act on their commitment to introduce secondary legislation providing for duties to be placed on the National Health Service to provide for the needs of carers. It is regrettable that this was not done, and I notice that it is the intention of the Assembly Government to introduce such provisions consequent upon the making of the legislative competence order.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000020"></a>Some matters arise on which I would appreciate clarification. First, any Assembly measures passed after the making of the order will potentially result in additional obligations being placed on local authorities. Can the Minister say whether, from his discussions with the Assembly Government, it is intended that those local authorities will be compensated by way of increased financial support for the cost of complying with those duties?</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000021"></a>Secondly, the Select Committee drew attention to the cross-border implications of any legislation that may flow from the making of the legislative competence order. It is not impossible&#151;indeed, it is highly likely, especially in the case of north-east Wales&#151;that the carers and the cared-for may live on different sides of the border. What discussions has the Minister had with his colleagues in the Welsh Assembly and the Secretary of State for Health as to how these cross-border issues will be dealt with when measures are brought forward? Subject to what I have just said, I have no further comments to make on this order.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000022"></a>I turn to the National Assembly for Wales (Legislative Competence) (Exceptions to Matters) Order, which I found more complicated to work through. This is really a tidying-up order and is, I believe, a very sound move and one that I welcome. It tidies up what is in  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC247"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC247</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>fact a very messy way of maintaining exceptions to devolved matters where legislative competence for a matter is transferred to the Assembly but that matter would otherwise include a function which was not exercisable by Welsh Ministers and therefore could not be devolved back to the Assembly.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000023"></a>When the Assembly was given legislative competence with respect to vulnerable children, a specific exclusion had to be made to cover the use of motor vehicles, road traffic offences and various other non-devolved areas, which resulted in a table consisting of 25 repetitive lines. The proposed order would create a general exception for non-devolved highways and transport and social welfare functions. This is a positive step, although it was not envisaged at the time of the passage of the Bill that the legislative competence order process would be utilised in this manner. Nevertheless, it has the effect of making the schedule not only look different, but it reads better without changing the substance of the powers devolved. To that extent, it is a good proposal and we welcome it.</p>
<h5><a name="09071577000258"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09071577000024"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09071577000287"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> Perhaps I may take this opportunity to welcome the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, to the Front Bench. I know that from time to time he has enjoyed himself very much at the Millennium Stadium, and I hope that that will continue to be the case.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000025"></a>I turn first to the legislative competence order on social welfare. Did I hear the Minister correctly when he said that the First Minister actually dealt with this order on 15 July &#147;last year&#148;? It is now 15 July 2009, so the process has taken a whole year. I should say to the Committee that I am not a fan of the process and stated that clearly during the Government of Wales Bill in 2006. I said that we would face administrative problems as a result. The time that has been taken accounts for some of the delay that was mentioned earlier by the noble Lord who spoke for the Official Opposition.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000026"></a>The provision of care for carers which is set out in this order is extremely important. As has already been said, carers need care, and warm tributes have already been paid to them for the work that they do. However, their well-being is affected by their responsibilities, and the provision set out in this LCO to provide social care services for helpers is important, particularly in relation to non-residential care services. The 11 exceptions, including the Children&#146;s Commissioner and child benefit, are welcome, while the provision that,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000244"></a>&#147;any person may secure social care services on their behalf&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000206"></a>is also welcome. Account appears to have been taken of the Children and Young Persons Act 2008. The Welsh Assembly Government can give guidance to local authorities and indeed carry out inspections and make regulations, but it has been noted that there are still gaps in service provision which, it is hoped, this legislation will put right.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000027"></a>The importance of identifying carers, particularly young carers, has been set out. I came across many young carers and the difficulties they face when I was a Member of the other place, so the provision of correct information is important. Cross-border  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC248"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC248</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>co-operation is absolutely vital, as is the synergy between the National Health Service and social care provision in local authorities. When, for example, carers have to go from Llandrindod to Hereford, a distance of 40 miles, to accompany someone in their care, it is a whole-day operation. Because of my former direct involvement in Powys, I want to point something out. The border between Wales and England is 132 miles long, therefore even longer than the border between Scotland and England. As there is no district general hospital in Powys, people have to go to one in Oswestry, Shrewsbury, Hereford, Newport, Cardiff, Abergavenny, Swansea, Carmarthen, Neath or Aberystwyth. That is the situation in the most sparsely populated county south of the Highland line in Scotland. It is unacceptable in terms of service provision, but, of course, social services cross the border. Indeed, in places like Presteigne, English people living on the English side of the border utilise Welsh social provision as well; those parts of Herefordshire and Shropshire are very remote in England. We have to be careful about these aspects.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000028"></a>The Welsh Affairs Committee&#146;s report on cross-border provision for health services pointed out&#151;I shall not read from it&#151;that there are totally different funding principles at stake between England and Wales, which caused both confusion and difficulties with the delivery of service. I point that out only as a principle, because I could talk about that sort of thing for a very long time.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000029"></a>The exceptions to the matters that the LCO will look at have already been covered thoroughly. That is a logical provision that addresses the limitations to Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act 2006. It may be controversial in terms of the logicality of the legislation because it includes restrictions as well, but the main point is that it is a technical amendment, and it is welcome because it makes clear what the provisions are and what specifically defines the agreement between the UK Government and the Welsh Assembly Government about where responsibilities and legislative compentency lie. In that respect particularly, I welcome the latter LCO.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000030"></a>I welcome the other LCO regarding social welfare. It needs a lot of work and application by both the Assembly and the UK Government to make matters better.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000031"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09071577000288"></a>Lord Rowlands:</b> I am a member of the Constitution Committee and will therefore confine my remarks entirely to those matters that engaged the committee when the original draft order first arose.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000032"></a>The orders were of some considerable constitutional significance. First, in a letter from the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, our chairman, we asked the Secretary of State for Wales whether there was a compelling case for remodelling the way in which exceptions were going to be reported in Schedule 5. My noble friend used the word &#147;technical&#148; on numerous occasions in his opening remarks. I remind him of our observation on that very word in paragraph 17 of our report:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000230"></a>&#147;We do not regard the proposed new method as being merely &#145;technical&#146;. The Government of Wales Act 2006 is, in effect, a written constitution for the governance of Wales. There is an onus to explain with care and to justify why changes to this constitutional code are necessary and desirable&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000207"></a>So it is not just a technical matter.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC249"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC249</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000033"></a>The second concern that the committee had about the original draft order was whether it was constitutionally acceptable that a change could be made to the 2006 Act by a legislative competence order rather than by amending the primary Act. That is what we are doing in the second order; we are amending the 2006 Act. It is therefore not a minor technical matter&#151;it is something on which we need to constitutionally satisfy ourselves that we can use this competence order to amend the Act. That is a serious and important point to clarify.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000034"></a>As the committee repeatedly reminds those who read the report, the 2006 Act is a written constitution and to amend it is therefore a serious issue. Having said that, after a number of exchanges with our wonderful legal adviser, Mr Le Sueur&#151;who, sadly, has retired today after three and a half years in the committee&#151;we satisfied ourselves that it was acceptable that Section 95 of the 2006 Act could be amended by a competence order in the way that was being proposed.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000035"></a>We noticed one point in the original order that was obvious even to a layman like me&#151;I did not need a legal adviser to worry about the contents. Articles 1 and 2 were fine; they dealt with social welfare. Suddenly, however, we found in paragraph 3 of the original order, which deals with social care, a reference to:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000231"></a>&#147;Regulation of the use of motor vehicles on roads, their construction and equipment and conditions under which they may be so used ... Road traffic offences ... Harbours, docks, piers and boatslips&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000208"></a>All those were rolled into an order that seemed to be concerned exclusively with social welfare. It is that which led the committee perhaps to dig in its heels and recommend that the Government&#151;I am grateful they have accepted it&#151;should not, in this case or the future, roll these things together. A social welfare order of this kind should not include a lot of exceptions that are totally unrelated.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000036"></a>I also draw my noble friend&#146;s attention to the conclusions in our report. First, we express great satisfaction at the result of the exchanges and the fact that we now have two orders: the exceptions order, which amends the Schedule 5 arrangements; and the serious matters in the social welfare order, a subject which I will not develop but to which other noble Lords have spoken.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000037"></a>I also ask my noble friend to think about our recommendation in paragraph 15 of the report. It states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000232"></a>&#147;In future, LCOs should avoid rolling up specific provision on a subject and &#145;exceptions to matters&#146; on a completely unrelated subject&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000209"></a>In other words, we never want a repeat of that kind of original draft social order. The paragraph continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000233"></a>&#147;We are concerned that &#145;omnibus LCOs&#146;, covering a disparate range of subjects, are less easily scrutinised by Parliament, the National Assembly, and the public&#148;.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000038"></a>I hope that my noble friend will be able to offer us an assurance that the lessons from the evolution of this social welfare draft order, and the constitutional implications which arose from it, have been well and truly learnt; that in future we will have the very kind of things that we have got today&#151;an order which deals specifically with social welfare; and that if you want to

The Constitution Committee supports these orders but would welcome an assurance that in future we will have consistency and clarity in the way that such orders are brought forward.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000039"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09071577000289"></a>Lord Roberts of Conwy:</b> I, too, welcome the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, to his new office and to this gathering in particular. We are very grateful for the very detailed thought and work that has gone into the preparation of these orders relating to the legislative competence of the Assembly. I intend to comment briefly on the form and content of the orders, and I begin by affirming that special care must be taken with carers because the legislative regimes that deal with care arrangements, especially charges, differ in different countries within the United Kingdom. Of course, carers are becoming increasingly important to us as the population becomes more elderly and in greater need of care and carers.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000040"></a>They are particularly important to us in Wales because, as the 2001 census revealed, we have a higher proportion of carers than any English region.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000041"></a>As my noble friend Lord Glentoran pointed out, 11.7 per cent of the population&#151;341,000 people&#151;are carers, for the very good reason that we have a higher proportion of people with limiting long-term illness, chronic sickness and disability, as explained in paragraph 7 of the Explanatory Memorandum. I therefore understand the Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s anxiety to have legislative competence in this field to support regular carers in the ways described in the Explanatory Note to the social welfare order.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000042"></a>Such is the legislative competence conferred that any cross-border issues that arise can, as I understand it, be amicably resolved by close liaison between the relevant authorities. Yesterday the Government published their Green Paper, <I>Shaping the Future of Care Together</I>. I hope that that togetherness embraces the National Assembly and that they will take account of the contents of the Green Paper before and as they legislate.</p>

I am not quite sure that I fully understand it, but I am sure that with further study and consideration I shall probably get my head round it. One should also commend Carwyn Jones, the Consul General, who has put his name to the Explanatory Memorandum on the second order.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000044"></a>The order brings precisely the order required to an area in which chaos was threatening. The table of exceptions has been replaced by a list, and it is clear that,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000245"></a>&#147;a provision of an Assembly Measure is not within competence if it falls within any of the exceptions listed in that paragraph&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000210"></a>This avoids specifying exceptions, as I understand it, to every change to Schedule 5 following a legislative competence order. Quite a number of these orders come our way these days.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000045"></a>There are extensive differences between Schedule 5 in 2009 and the schedule as it appeared after the passage of the Act in 2006. A number of fields in the schedule have been amplified by the addition of specific matters, and the time is fast approaching when there will have to be some consolidation to clarify the areas in which the National Assembly has legislative competence. It would be interesting to know what Assembly measures have sprung from those competences. Ideally, a document should be produced in the course of, or at least at the end of, each Assembly&#146;s four-year term that consolidates the legislative competences that have been achieved up to that date. I certainly hope that the National Assembly and its Government will consider that suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000046"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09071577000290"></a>Lord Elystan-Morgan:</b> I, too, warmly congratulate the Minister on his appointment and, so far as this body can, I am sure that we will confer on him honorary Welsh citizenship.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000047"></a>I, too, very much welcome the orders, both generally and specifically. Generally, one tends to welcome all such legislation because it is part of a process that Part 3 was intended to allow to run, and to run regularly.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000048"></a>Secondly, every piece of such legislation, quite apart from its own individual merits, tends to strengthen the foundation for legislative possibilities that the Welsh Assembly has. It assists in building up a cadre of people who are well qualified in this field, and it is only by the greater and more constant evolution of this process that one will bring about that result. In addition, I think one can say that not only is Part 3 intended to transfer, bit by bit, authority to Wales to legislate in the same way as Acts of Parliament allow that to be done from time to time but it also forms what might be regarded as a pathway or bridge to Part 4. If we are ever to have a referendum&#151;I very much hope that we will and that it will be carried, although I know that that is not of necessity the view of everyone in this Committee&#151;then it is imperative that Part 3 will have been exploited to the fullest possible extent. Nothing will give Wales a better picture of what Part 4 could mean than the full exploitation of Part 3.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000049"></a>Having made those obvious points, I turn to the first of the two orders&#151;the one relating to social welfare. I welcome it. It is very necessary that the greatest attention is paid to this situation. The problems in Wales are not basically different from those in other parts of the United Kingdom but they affect Wales much more harshly and with more impact. The point has already been made by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, and other noble Lords that Wales scores very highly in many of the categories of disadvantage in this area. Indeed, we have a much greater dependence on carers. It is proper to remind ourselves that 70 per cent of all carers in the United Kingdom perform an unpaid service. The community is massively in their debt. Of course, this situation will develop much more acutely over the next few years. There are more disintegrated families and more dispersed families, and there are the very welcome tendencies against institutionalisation&#151;I hope that I have said that right; it is one of the most difficult words in the English language to pronounce. In addition, there is greater

If we put all those matters together, along with many others, it is clear that the need for carers will increase very sharply over the years.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000050"></a>Wales has a much higher rate of people suffering from long-term sickness and disabilities. Another feature is the age profile of the community. The age profile in Wales is very different from that in England and is getting more and more pronounced in relation to those over the age of 65, particularly in the rural areas. I declare an interest here. For my sins, I am the chairman of a working group reporting to the Welsh Assembly on rural health. One piece of evidence that we found had great impact was the fact that over the next 23 years an increase of at least 30 per cent is anticipated in the proportion of people in Wales over the age of 65. That trend is present in England but in Wales it is far more pronounced and is extremely germane to the issues raised today. That deals with the first order, which I greatly welcome, as does everyone else in this Committee.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000051"></a>Turning to the second order, I congratulate&#151;I was going to say &#147;my noble friend&#148;; indeed, we are friends&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, on his assiduity in spotting what I think was a fundamental flaw and one that unhappily cost 12 months&#146; progress of this draft order. The noble Lord is absolutely right to say that amending Schedule 5 is not a sin because every LCO that we pass makes amendments, but amending the main timbers of the 2006 Act is a serious matter. I congratulate him on being a constitutional eagle on this matter by discovering a weakness and very properly pointing to it.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000052"></a>On the exact way in which the mechanism operates, I am with the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, on this. Although I have been a lawyer of one sort or another for a long time, I found it difficult to understand the order, certainly on first reading it. It made me think of that story about a person standing on the quayside in Hong Kong seeing a huge packing case which has printed on it the words, &#147;The bottom of this case is labelled &#145;Top Uppermost&#146; in order to avoid confusion&#148;. Indeed, the more I read the order, the more confused I became, but I think I understand it by now, and I warmly welcome both orders.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000053"></a>One should remind oneself that these orders do not in themselves create new laws. They peg out an area of jurisdiction on which&#151;to use the idiom of a field&#151;the Welsh Assembly can build something worthwhile. Too little building is taking place at the moment and I hope that it will speed up in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000054"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09071577000291"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I congratulate my noble friend on his position in the Government and I thank him for his exemplary introduction of the orders. Surely no one would want to halt them. They are the progeny of the Westminster process and the Assembly in Wales has all the competence necessary to do good work with them. They will and should go through today, because certainly our carers in Wales do magnificent work.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000055"></a>Are these orders also pointers to the future governance of our country? I think that they are, and perhaps they are fingerposts on the Westminster parliamentary lanes that may point to more, not less, devolved government.  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC253"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC253</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>The Assembly in Wales has acquitted itself very well since its inception, and the handover from Whitehall to Cardiff was almost seamless, which was a bureaucratic miracle. It is a considerable achievement in modern governance. I took part as a Minister in the 1979 referendum, and in the subsequent referendum held in the 1990s, which helps one gain an overview and insight into the context of Wales&#146;s governance.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000056"></a>These orders conjure up a consideration of where the Government of Wales are travelling to, as does the now traditional opening, post the Wales general election, of the newly elected Assembly in Cardiff Bay by Her Majesty the Queen. To see Her Majesty, her consort, her heir and the Duchess of Cornwall seated in a line facing the Assembly Members in the graceful Assembly Chamber also concentrates the mind. The conclusion in any consideration of this is that the Assembly has certainly arrived.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000057"></a>These orders concentrate the mind on our governance in the principality, and they have convinced me that in the future there will be more, not less, devolved government in Wales. My guess is that via Calman, Scotland will gain more powers and that Wales will, at the very least, gain some of the powers Scotland will gain, or powers which Scotland already has. I think that there is a report outstanding about governance in Wales which may be published.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000058"></a>The orders prompt me to predict that in next year&#146;s general election, if it is next year, each of the major parties will have proposals in their manifestos for more devolved powers for Wales. Modest though they are, these orders are harbingers of change. I think that the national party leaders will be proposing more than legislative competence orders.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000059"></a>The context of these orders is that the Welsh Assembly is very much a body that is up and running. It is confident, and clearly it is organising and lobbying for considerably more authority than it has now. This context includes an astounding development in British governance; in Belfast, Edinburgh and Cardiff the nationalist parties are very much in power, or are sharing power, most positively with others.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000060"></a>I believe that soon after these two orders are well and truly used, the pre-election political manoeuvres will ensure proposals for more significant devolved measures. Where that will leave the position of our excellent Welsh Members of Parliament and the post of Secretary of State for Wales we do not yet know, but surely that is a subject for later debate. It is sufficient to say now that today we are heading towards a decisive moment in the constitutional history of the Celtic nations.</p>

I think that I shall come to love LCOs in due course, but I was as mystified by a first reading of the brief and the order, as were many of your Lordships.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000062"></a>It has been a fascinating and informative debate, and I have been heartened by the contributions that have been made to it for two reasons. First, there is a broad consensus, cutting across party lines, in favour of conferring competence on the National Assembly in respect of carers, as set out in the draft carers LCO, and for making the technical change to exceptions in Schedule 5 to the Government of Wales Act, as set out in the exceptions LCO.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000063"></a>Secondly, there is a great deal of knowledge and appreciation in this House, particularly among Members of the Committee here today, of the Welsh devolution settlement in general and the mechanisms of the Government of Wales Act in particular. That knowledge helps to ensure that the process of devolving legislative powers to the National Assembly for Wales runs smoothly, and it has certainly helped me today in enhancing my own previously sketchy knowledge; I now have a rather greater understanding of the devolution settlement as it applies to Wales.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000064"></a>I shall respond to a number of the questions that were put to me during the debate. The noble Lords, Lord Glentoran, Lord Roberts of Conwy and Lord Elystan-Morgan, referred to the need for special treatment for carers in Wales. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, referred to the fact that Wales has a higher proportion of carers than any region in England. It also has the highest proportion of people with limiting long-term illness and a level of permanent sickness and disability in the economically inactive population between 16 and 74 than any region in England. Those figures alone suggest that a different approach is needed in tackling the intensity of these issues in Wales.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000065"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked about compensation for public bodies and local authorities. The extent to which we decide to provide local authorities and the National Health Service with additional resources is a consideration for when the measure is developed. There is a track record which I hope will go some way to reassuring him. For example, we fully reimburse local authorities for changes that were made to the fairer charging guidance on non-residential social care in 2007.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000066"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, also asked about cross-border issues. The Assembly could legislate in relation to public authorities in Wales, but not in England, and it could legislate to support carers living in England but caring for someone who lives in Wales. It could also legislate to support carers who live in Wales but care for someone living in England. I understand that the Welsh Assembly Government intend to develop a protocol on cross-border services for carers, so this is essentially a matter for them. I also understand that a cross-border health service protocol is already successfully in operation.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000067"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, returned to a theme that I know he has pursued before in these debates, because I read what he said in the debate on 19 June on the red meat order. He believes that the whole LCO process is much too slow and he would like it to go much faster; he expressed similar sentiments on that  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC255"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC255</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>occasion as well. I do not think that he is being entirely fair. The process of conferring legislative competence on the National Assembly through LCOs and framework powers in UK Bills has so far delivered law-making powers in some 39 areas of policy. I agree with him that the start was a fairly slow one but, to begin with, it is inevitable that this process will take time. As more LCOs come forward&#151;others are being proposed now on which we shall deliberate in the autumn&#151;the process is picking up. I agree very much with the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, who looks forward to the day when more and more competences are transferred to the Welsh Assembly Government and the Welsh Assembly.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000068"></a>My noble friend Lord Rowlands chided me and the Government for having the temerity to describe the exceptions order as technical. I apologise to him for that. I did not mean that the order is technical; I meant to imply that the subject matter is pretty technical. I am delighted that a tribute, entirely deserved, has been paid to him for his work on the Constitution Committee, and to the other members of the committee. The noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, described him as a constitutional eagle, a badge which I think he will wish to wear in future. Section 95 of the Government of Wales Act states that a LCO can also amend that enactment itself. This matter was discussed with the legal adviser to the committee and the legal adviser was satisfied with the vires to make this particular LCO. However, I can certainly give him the assurance that the Government will give careful attention to all recommendations made as a result of pre-legislative scrutiny. We are always mindful of the need to avoid omnibus orders. He made a good point and it is one which we certainly take on board.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000069"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, asked what measures have sprung from the consolidation of matters at the end of each term. The answer is that the vulnerable children LCO has given rise to both the children and families measure and to the education measure currently being considered by the Assembly. Consideration of matters is, of course, an issue not for us in this House but for the Welsh Assembly Government.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000070"></a>I would like finally to say how much I agreed with what the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, and my noble friend Lord Jones said about the process in which we are engaged. The phrase used by my noble friend Lord Jones about these being pointers to the future government of Wales is very good. As I indicated at the beginning of my closing remarks, these are important stepping stones towards the implementation of the devolution settlement.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000071"></a>I am not able to answer the question about the future of Welsh Members of Parliament, nor of the Secretary of State, and I suspect that my noble friend did not expect me to.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000072"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09071577000293"></a>Lord Jones:</b> My noble friend the Minister might acknowledge that Members of Parliament themselves will have views on the nature of the powers that the Welsh Assembly shall have in future.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000074"></a>Finally, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, that one virtue of the process on which we have embarked is that we are building up a cadre of experts, in Cardiff and the Wales Office, which will be of lasting benefit as we proceed towards more devolutionary measures.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000075"></a>I hope that I have responded to the points made in our short debate. If I have missed anything, I know that my attention will be drawn to it and I will be happy to write to noble Lords. I commend the order to the Grand Committee.</p>

I thank the Commons committee for carefully considering and approving the draft order earlier this afternoon.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000078"></a>The Hallmarking Act makes it an offence, during the course of trade, to describe an unhallmarked article as being wholly or partly made of gold, silver or platinum, or to supply it with such a description attached. This order proposes to apply the Hallmarking Act to palladium in a similar manner. Palladium has  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC257"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC257</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>not hitherto been prescribed by the Hallmarking Act because manufacturing difficulties led to high costs and low demand. These difficulties have now been overcome and the market for palladium articles is expected to grow considerably.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000079"></a>Given the value of the metal, which is less valuable than platinum and gold but more valuable than silver, there is an increased danger of fraud. A consumer may not be able to tell by eye the difference between articles made from palladium and those made from cheaper precious metals such as silver and white gold, or from base metals. To protect consumers from fraud and counterfeiting, I propose that the Hallmarking Act should be applied to palladium.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000080"></a>Another reason why palladium should be prescribed in this way is that, under our obligations to the International Hallmarking Convention, of which we are a member, we shall shortly be required to recognise palladium articles stamped with the convention hallmark. This will be done under an amendment to existing legislation&#151;the Hallmarking (International Convention) Order 2002&#151;but we require the Hallmarking Act itself to apply to palladium to enable it to apply in a consistent manner to all precious metal articles affixed with the convention hallmark.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000081"></a>We conducted a full public consultation on this measure in autumn 2008. It is supported by all stakeholders, including the precious metals and jewellery industry, the British Hallmarking Council and all four UK assay offices.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000082"></a>The order will come into force on the day after it is made. I agreed this at the request of the precious metals industry to enable it to meet its Christmas rush, which peaks in September/October. I consulted the Sub-Committee on Productivity, Skills and Employment, which is part of the ministerial committee on economic development, and it agree with this decision not to apply a common commencement date.</p>
<h5><a name="09071577000263"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000083"></a>It will become an offence to apply to an unhallmarked item a description that it is wholly or partly made of palladium or to trade in such an item. This brings palladium into line with the same offence that covers gold, silver and platinum. The offence provision will apply to palladium with a fineness or purity not less than 500 parts per 1,000. This value of minimum fineness is common to the international hallmarking convention and those EU member states that prescribe palladium. Small palladium articles weighing less than 1 gram are exempt from hallmarking. Similar minimum-weight provisions apply to the other prescribed precious metals.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000084"></a>Hallmarking is not compulsory for any palladium article manufactured before 1 January 2010 but it will become an offence to trade in unhallmarked articles that are manufactured after that date. In the intervening period, manufacturers and traders may voluntarily have palladium articles hallmarked if they so wish. This delay in the offence provision is intended to give the trade time to prepare for the prescription of palladium. It mirrors the same procedure that was successfully introduced for platinum when that precious metal was first prescribed in 1973.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000085"></a>To avoid confusion and to protect the consumer, there are only three permitted fineness levels with which palladium may be hallmarked. These levels conform to the international convention requirements. As with the well known pictorial hallmarks&#151;for example, a lion or Britannia for silver&#151;the trade has requested an optional pictorial mark for palladium and has chosen the head of Pallas Athene, the Greek goddess of war, wisdom and crafts, after whom palladium was named.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000086"></a>Palladium is formally ranked as being more precious than silver but less precious than gold or platinum, to enable manufacturers to conform to coating or plating rules. A precious metal article may be coated only with the same precious metal having a greater fineness or by a precious metal that is more precious.</p>

I venture to suggest that to schedule for an order to be debated in both Chambers on the same day makes a mockery of parliamentary procedure; a proper gap between the respective debates allows the benefit of questions consequent upon the answers given by the Minister in the other place.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000089"></a>According to the Explanatory Memorandum:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000234"></a>&#147;A reasonable amount of public interest in this order is expected as this is the first precious metal to be added to the Act since it was enacted in 1973&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000211"></a>The very next paragraph implies that consultation has been completed and that the Government have responded. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me for saying that. A cynic might suggest that either there has been consultation or that public interest is expected. To say both is to imply that the public have not been fully consulted. I am sure the Minister can explain that satisfactorily.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000090"></a>We read that the United States does not have a hallmarking regime such as that in place here in the United Kingdom. The regulatory impact assessment suggests that the result of this is &#147;very significant levels&#148; of what it quaintly calls &#147;under-carating&#148;. Can the Minister elaborate on this? Specifically, what volume of US unhallmarked goods, gold and silver for example, have traditionally been imported into the United Kingdom? I ask this because the answer might mean that essentially some of the problems envisaged under the voluntary scheme option referred to in the regulatory impact assessment exist anyway and will not be resolved if there is any quantity of US stock washing around in our system here.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC259"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC259</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000091"></a>We are told that, within Europe, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia have prescribed palladium as a precious metal in broadly the same way as the provisions of this order. Can the Minister explain why other major European countries such as France, Germany, Italy and Spain are yet to take action, and whether this will give rise to problems analogous to the scenario I have envisaged in respect of US imports?</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000092"></a>The argument for including palladium in hallmarking regimes centres largely on an expectation of increased palladium jewellery sales, derived at least in part from advances in manufacturing techniques. The market price of palladium, however, has more than halved in the last 18 months, from a high of $579 in February 2008 to $250 at present. We must hope that this does not suggest that the commodity markets are not quite as optimistic about the future of palladium as the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000093"></a>Lastly, the department envisages a one-off cost to jewellery traders of &#163;10 for each information sign they must alter, under Section 11 of the 1973 Act, to list palladium as a precious metal. Can the Minister clarify the source of this estimate, which to us seems rather low?</p>

<p><a name="09071577000094"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09071577000300"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> I do not pretend to be an expert on this subject, but none the less I am fairly well briefed on it. The importance of this piece of legislation is that palladium will be included as a precious metal, and as we have heard, it will be third in ranking behind platinum and gold, with silver coming last. That is a significant development for palladium. The legislation applies to precious metal articles wholly or partly made of palladium and relates to the lack of consumer protection, which is very important. The order summarises the costs and benefits of adding palladium to the list of precious metals.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000095"></a>Interestingly, Her Majesty&#146;s Government estimate that sales in palladium jewellery could be worth &#163;5.4 million in five years&#146; time, and reach 15 per cent of the UK jewellery market in 10 years. I have a number of additional questions for the Minister in order to give some indication of what we are likely to experience as a result of this legislation.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000096"></a>Have the projected increases in the sale of palladium taken into account the recession? There was some indication from the Official Opposition Front Bench that this might be so. What impact might this have on the use of palladium in other areas, such as catalytic converters where it is commonly used? How many other countries have adopted some form of hallmarking for palladium? We have just heard what is happening in that area. What increase in taxation receipts do the Government anticipate from the increased sales of palladium which they predict will follow hallmarking? Finally, what experiences were learnt from platinum being added to the hallmarking regime in 1975 in terms of fraud prevention? This legislation sets out fairly clearly the differences between platinum and palladium.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000097"></a>In addition, do the Government expect hallmarking to boost the value of palladium? Around the year 2000, palladium was more valuable than platinum,  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC260"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>trading at $1,000 per ounce&#151;platinum was around $600&#151;due to shortages from Russia and demands from car manufacturers which needed it for catalytic converters. In response to those questions, perhaps the Minister will give us an indication of what is likely to occur as a result of this legislation.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000098"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09071577000301"></a>Lord Drayson:</b> I thank the noble Lords, Lord De Mauley and Lord Livsey of Talgarth, for their questions, which I will attempt to answer. The noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, asked: given that there was a public consultation, why do we expect there to be public interest in the hallmarking of palladium? Having been through the legal requirement of carrying out a consultation, we believe that the announcement of the hallmarking of palladium will be of interest, because this is the first time that a new metal has been hallmarked since 1973. It will bring the existence of palladium to the attention of the public and the consumer. It will have a positive effect because of palladium&#146;s relative potential as a lighter metal than some of the others that are usually used for jewellery. The use of palladium, a lighter metal, will make possible more modern designs for earrings, for example. That will cause some interest and be of marketing benefit to the trade.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000099"></a>The noble Lord is right in his comments about the United States. My understanding is that we do not have any data on the volume of imports of unmarked goods into the United Kingdom. I will look into whether the department has any further information. If we do, I will write to him. I should stress that US marks are not recognised in the United Kingdom and must be assayed on import into the UK.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000100"></a>As for other EU countries and hallmarking, the position is that some countries do and some countries do not. It is based on a country&#146;s own national legislation on hallmarking. I agree with noble Lords that that identifies a potential difficulty in terms of a common approach towards the hallmarking of jewellery and other goods across Europe.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000101"></a>As for imports into the United Kingdom, the hallmarks that the United Kingdom recognises as equivalent can be imported without further costs and without them being further assayed. The marks that are not recognised by the UK must be assayed. I will write to the noble Lord, Lord Livsey, to give him a full list of the countries that hallmark across the range of precious metals and those that do not.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000102"></a>As for the effect on the market, noble Lords have already highlighted the volatility of the price of palladium and of a number of other metal commodities over the past year. Our analysis of the market leads us to suggest that the current rapid increase in sales of palladium products will continue independently of the volatility of the price, for the reasons that I mentioned concerning its suitability for more modern jewellery. We believe that this change to the regulations is necessary because of the way in which we have seen the trade volumes move.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000103"></a>We have been given unofficial trade figures by manufacturers&#151;I stress that they are not government figures&#151;which indicate the number of kilograms of  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC261"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC261</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>palladium traded per month. They show an increase from 1 kilogram of palladium for July 2008 to 3 kilograms for July 2009, and then to 4.5 kilograms for August 2009. So we have seen a threefold increase in the trade volume of this material, which is why we believe that the order is necessary.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000104"></a>The impact on the market for catalytic converters is something that I will have to write to the noble Lord about when I have done some investigation. We do not envisage that this order will have a significant material impact on taxation receipts.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000105"></a>I believe that I have answered all the questions raised. If I have missed any, I will write to noble Lords. I thank noble Lords for the light that they have shed on this important issue through their questions. I am sure that the industry will welcome the development in the regulations for hallmarking and that consumers will see the benefit in the development of new and effective products. I commend the draft order to the Grand Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000108"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09071577000305"></a>The Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and Ministry of Defence (Lord Drayson):</b> We are debating today the Legislative Reform (Limited Partnerships) Order 2009. Limited partnerships were created by the Limited Partnerships Act 1907. The Act has remained substantially the same over the past 100 years. There are currently around 16,000 limited partnerships. They have been used for a wide variety of purposes, but most new limited partnerships are for investment funds, particularly private equity funds. In 2003, a Law Commission report made a set of recommendations for reforming limited partnership law, which the Government decided to accept. The recommended changes would not alter the nature of limited partnerships, but would comprehensively modernise and clarify the law. They are therefore appropriate for a legislative reform order.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC262"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC262</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000109"></a>We consulted last year on a comprehensive LRO. It would have repealed the 1907 Act entirely and replaced it by writing new sections into the Partnership Act 1890. The response showed that there was wide support for modernising and clarifying the law along the lines recommended by the Law Commission. It also showed that there was insufficient support for the draft order on which we had consulted. We therefore reconsulted informally on a proposal to proceed stepwise by introducing the reforms in a short series of LROs, beginning with the instrument under debate today. Some consultees were naturally disappointed that the full reform would be delayed, but in general they accepted that this would be a more certain way of proceeding. We plan to consult later in the summer on the forward programme of LROs.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000110"></a>The current order delivers two changes recommended by the Law Commission. The first provides clarity that a limited partnership comes into existence on the date shown on its certificate of registration and that the certificate is conclusive evidence of its formation. Practitioners have told us that the current vagueness about when a partnership comes into existence is a serious problem, as is the risk that if there is some fault in the application process, it might turn out later that none of the partners have limited liability. The first change in the order will resolve both of these problems.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000111"></a>Some consultees argued that this clarification would be of most value if Companies House offered a same-day registration for limited partnerships, as it does for companies. I am happy to tell the Committee that Companies House is planning to offer a same-day registration service for limited partnerships from 1 October this year. The second change delivered by the order is to require all new limited partnerships to choose a name that includes an indication of its status at the end. Each of these proposals was welcomed by all consultees who addressed them, and no consultee objected to either. I hope that your Lordships will also agree that they make a useful first step in our programme of reform. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000112"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="09071577000306"></a>Lord De Mauley:</b> Once again, I thank the Minister for introducing the order. Reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens on both the public and private sectors is a worthwhile aim that is supported on these Benches and, I am sure, around the House, so to that extent the order is welcome.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000113"></a>According to the Explanatory Memorandum, the Law Commission originally recommended these changes in 2003, so why has it taken the Government over five years to make them law? The Minister will understand that this does not reduce our scepticism on these Benches about quite how high a priority legislative reform is for the Government. I have to wonder, for example, how many venture capital funds have chosen to register under a different jurisdiction during this period. On a more positive note, while on that subject, the British Venture Capital Association had asked me to ask the Minister if he could do anything to arrange that from October Companies House would be able to offer same-day limited partnership registration, so I am grateful for his assurance in that regard.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000114"></a>On the policy section of www.labour.org.uk there is a small entry that states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000235"></a>&#147;In 2009, the administrative burden on business of regulation will be reduced by almost 20 per cent making it easier and cheaper for businesses of all sizes to grow&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000212"></a>That is quite a commitment. One has to ask how on earth, having dismissed tools such as regulatory budgets and sunset clauses, the Government intend to achieve that reduction. Six months into 2009, how much progress has been made?</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000115"></a>According to the noble Lord the First Secretary of State, the new better regulation sub-committee of the National Economic Council will scrutinise planned regulation. That was said over three months ago. Would it be possible to have a report on what the committee has achieved so far? How many legislative reform orders have been laid before Parliament this year, and how many regulations have been introduced in the same period?</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000116"></a>The most recent small-business survey found that health and safety regulations are the most burdensome regulation from the perspective of small businesses. What recent discussions have been had with the Minister&#146;s counterparts in the Department for Work and Pensions to ensure that the Health and Safety Executive vigorously sets about the task of removing unnecessary regulation in the same zealous fashion in which it introduces it? In the <I>Making it Simple Annual Review 2008</I>, the noble Lord, Lord Carter, states that the Government are on target to reduce the overall burden of regulation by 25 per cent. Is the Minister able to square this figure with the most recent Burdens Barometer produced by the British Chambers of Commerce, which found that the total cost of regulation to business since 1998 had risen to &#163;76.8 billion, an increase of &#163;10.8 billion on last year, and a recent CBI statement that government regulation of business had reached what it called a &#147;tipping point&#148;?</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000117"></a>In a recession, businesses need better, rather than more, regulation. I finish by drawing attention to the difference between effectively regulating the financial services sector and overburdening small firms with red tape.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000118"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09071577000307"></a>Lord Razzall:</b> I support the order before us today. As the Minister knows, limited partnerships&#151;not to be confused with limited liability partnerships&#151;have been used more and more in certain forms of fundraising. Following the advice of the Law Commission, it is extremely important that this structure is assisted by being burdened with, as the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, said, as little red tape as possible. The Minister has not heard me speak on these orders before and, although I am in danger of becoming a toady, perhaps I may again congratulate his department on the quality of the explanatory document, which is set out in an extremely clear and concise form.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000119"></a>This is not a Welsh order, so it will not take the amount of time that anything to do with Wales appears to take. I have only two questions. As we know, the Government withdrew the original order because they felt that the consultation had demonstrated that other items that were going to be set out in the order were highly controversial. When does the Minister think  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC264"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that that consultation exercise on the wider issues raised here will be completed and when will we therefore have the further order? Pressing him a little further, it seems that the major issue of concern was whether the certificate would be conclusive evidence not only of the existence of the limited partnership&#151;that is, the subject of the order that we have before us today&#151;but that all the requirements of the Act had been complied with. That seems to be the controversial issue. Do the Government have a view on that or will they simply wait for the consultation?</p>

<p><a name="09071577000120"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09071577000308"></a>Lord Drayson:</b> I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, for putting this change in regulation into the wider context. The points that he made are vital, and I am grateful for his welcome of the commitment by Companies House to move smartly to implement the change. I say to him directly that it should not have taken five years. That is far too long. We should do better and we need to do better in the future.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000121"></a>The noble Lord made a point about business reaching a tipping point. With regard to the over-regulatory burden, we are listening very carefully to what business is saying to us at the moment. The global financial downturn was a crisis that very nearly engulfed our financial services industry, and the call for stronger regulation which came out of that was, I think, valid. However, in recognising the need for more regulation in that area, there is a danger that we will fail to recognise the equal importance of putting the same effort into simplifying and reducing the regulatory burden on business. I accept his point that the regulatory burden is significant. Following the decision not to implement a regulatory budget, we are monitoring the numbers of new regulatory instruments and are collating them into an overall single picture, which we are now reviewing. It would be useful for us to be in a position to share the outcome of that in the near future.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000122"></a>The committee&#146;s reports on progress are indeed the mechanism for oversight, and I can tell the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, as a member of that committee that this issue was reviewed just a few days ago. It is at the front and centre of the Government&#146;s mind, and we take it very seriously. While making the necessary regulatory changes, we are committed to learning from what has happened to the financial services and to maintaining our focus on simplifying regulation. I will take his point about health and safety to my colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions. I share some of his concern about our need to avoid developing in this country a culture of risk avoidance at all costs and the department&#146;s need to develop an important role in ensuring sensible and effective health and safety regulation.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000123"></a>Questions were asked about the timing of the consultation. All the requirements of the Act are to be included in the certificate, which implies checks and inquiries that the register will not be equipped to make. I will write to the noble Lord about the timing of the completion of the consultation once I have made further inquiries in the department. We hope that it will be possible&#151;this is not a commitment&#151;to

I am sorry to learn that this will also be his swan-song as Minister, but at least we shall have the pleasure of hearing from him how far the Government and the Committee are singing in tune on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000127"></a>The report on access to documents comes at a time when openness in the legislature and Government are topical subjects nationally and at the European level. It relates to a Commission proposal of 30 April last year to recast with amendments an existing Regulation 1049 of 2001 governing public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. The regulation is the European equivalent of our Freedom of Information Act.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000128"></a>To inform its attitude to the proposal, which remains under scrutiny, Sub-Committee E undertook a short inquiry. We had the assistance, both in correspondence and orally, of the then Minister for Europe, Caroline Flint MP. By happy coincidence, the main European Union Select Committee was at the same time hearing extensive evidence on co-decision and its impact on national parliamentary scrutiny. There is a synergy between the subjects. Parliamentary scrutiny depends for its completeness and efficiency on access to information and documents. We were able in these two inquiries to examine the extent to which the terms and application of the existing and proposed regulation may restrict

Incidentally, the report on co-decision will be published next Tuesday.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000129"></a>Access to documents is a subject that arouses some passion. I should make it clear that we are talking not about truly sensitive documents, classified &#147;Tr&#233;s Secret&#148; or &#147;Confidentiel&#148;, which have their own special regime. With regard to other documents, the European Parliament has urged repeatedly that the other European institutions should operate with much greater transparency. The first article of the existing treaty sets out as an objective that the Union should take decisions as openly as possible. The European Court has in several judgments interpreted the existing regulation in a liberal sense, underlining the importance of transparency to build confidence in Europe, and the general need for claims to withhold disclosure to be considered on a document-by-document basis rather than a blanket one.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000130"></a>Sweden was a claimant in two cases. It is, along with other Nordic countries, a strong protagonist of more transparency. The current Swedish presidency, unsurprisingly, has announced its intention of reaching agreement on the present proposal this year. To date, there has been no first reading or common Council position; but it is evident that there are divisions among member states. Ironically, we found these published on the web in the form of a Czech presidency working document, accompanied by a commentary from Professor Steve Peers of Statewatch. Perhaps ungallantly, we asked the Minister whether she felt that such disclosures would, in the language of the regulation and the proposal,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000246"></a>&#147;seriously undermine the decision-making process&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000213"></a>through which the present proposal is going. She explained in no uncertain terms the United Kingdom Government&#146;s view that it would.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000131"></a>What would be the effect of the proposal? Commissioner Wallstrom, in a speech this year, said that,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000247"></a>&#147;the present Regulation has on the whole worked well&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000214"></a>She cited ever-increasing applications for access and ever-decreasing refusals. That trend was borne out by a Commission survey last October. However, she said that there was room for improvement, particularly for ordinary citizens as opposed to &#147;professionals of EU affairs&#148;. The survey showed that 30 per cent of access requests come from academics, which is a good way of bringing the affairs of the EU to wider public attention.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000132"></a>The commissioner also asserted that the proposal would not lead to any diminution in the level of access. However, our examination has revealed that, in some respects, the proposal could lead to some diminution in transparency. It also revealed that the Government, in at least two areas, are seeking further reductions in access. Of course, every change must be judged on its merits, and, in two respects in which the proposal would limit access, the committee saw merit in the suggestion.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000133"></a>I will deal briefly with the two respects. First, the proposal would exclude from the regulation documents in the institutions&#146; possession that have been submitted to courts by parties other than the institutions. The idea is that it should be for the relevant courts, European or national, to decide under their own rules whether  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC267"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC267</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and how such third-party documents should be made publicly accessible. The institutions&#146; own pleadings remain subject to the regulation. The institution can disclose them if it wishes, or it can seek to withhold them on a regulation ground: for example, because disclosure would undermine the public interest in court proceedings or the purpose of inspections and investigations. However, the Minister made it clear that the Government want to go further. They fear that the institutions&#146; pleadings might, if disclosed, refer to and disclose the Government&#146;s position. However, if that is a risk, it has existed under the current regulation for some time.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000134"></a>The second proposed restriction of access is a new blanket exclusion from the regulation of information obtained by one of the institutions from third parties in the framework of an investigation. This seems an appropriate protection of, for example, whistle-blowers in the context of a competition investigation.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000135"></a>Both the existing and the proposed regulation provide for disclosure to be withheld where it would undermine the protection of legal advice. In the case of Sweden v Turco, however, the Court of Justice thought that the general public interest in open administration positively required disclosure of a Commission legal opinion on the Community&#146;s competence. In that case, that was competence to regulate by directive access to the labour market by third-country nationals. The Government opposed that decision before the Court and still resists it. The Minister explained that they would like to see the relevant Article 4(2)(c) amended. The committee sees no reason to alter it. In the committee&#146;s view, the Court&#146;s decision in the Turco case does not mean that all legal advice will always be disclosable in a legislative context, let alone in the course of an investigation or legal proceedings.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000136"></a>Access to documents created in the context of legislative and other decision-making is the key area. The Commission, the Council and the European Parliament all participate in the process by which European legislation is formulated and agreed. In our report on the initiation of legislation, we concluded that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000236"></a>&#147;The Commission operates in a very open way, both in publishing information about its activities and in listening to views put to it&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000215"></a>The same can be said generally about the European Parliament. There is, however, a marked lack of transparency, first, regarding the Council and its meetings and, secondly, during the process of co-decision between the three institutions; that is, the process of private meetings and trialogues by which they interact, discuss and reach agreement informally on proposals. The Minister noted that the Council had, under the British presidency, introduced a system whereby the Council holds some meetings in public, but the real negotiations still occur as between member states, and as between the Council of Ministers, Parliament and the Commission behind the scenes.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000137"></a>This brings us to the divide between those who believe that European legislation can and should be a more open process, and those who point to a need for private space if there is to be frank discussion and advice. The Minister, while supporting the European Parliament&#146;s calls for greater transparency, was keen  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC268"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC268</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to maintain this space and to avoid a situation where negotiations were driven outside the formal meetings into the corridors and cafes of Brussels. She was also keen to draw a distinction between the nature and functions of the European Parliament and the Commission on the one hand and, on the other, of Ministers and heads of state representing their respective countries in the Council. She hinted at the tactical aspects that can lie behind individual member states&#146; negotiating positions and said that the discussions and stances of individual member states may be misunderstood if they were made public out of context and that it could undermine the Council&#146;s position vis- -vis the European Parliament if it had to disclose individual member states&#146; attitudes. Those are the battle lines between those who defend the status quo and those who believe that the Council, and the institutions when negotiating in co-decision, should act more like parliamentary Assemblies.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000138"></a>How does the new proposal impact on this debate? The first point to note is a new definition. This would limit disclosable documents to those,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000248"></a>&#147;drawn-up by an institution and formally transmitted to one or more recipients&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000216"></a>whatever that may mean&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000249"></a>&#147;or otherwise registered, or received by an institution&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000217"></a>On one view, depending on the force of the word &#147;formally&#148;, this addition has the potential to reduce significantly the right of access. However, the intention may be no more than to avoid disclosure of every draft or every single copy. Clarification is certainly required.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000139"></a>Apart from this, the proposal rephrases, but does not in text or terms significantly alter, the present legal position. In summary, under Article 4(3), documents relating to a matter on which a decision has not yet been taken are to be withheld,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000250"></a>&#147;if disclosure would seriously undermine an institution&#146;s decision-making process&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000218"></a>unless,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000251"></a>&#147;there is an over-riding public interest&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000219"></a>requiring their disclosure. After a decision has been taken, only opinions for internal use as part of deliberations and preliminary consultations within the institutions can be so withheld, again subject to the same provisos.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000140"></a>In practice, these provisions appear to be interpreted in a manner that corresponds with the Minister&#146;s wishes, and so would no doubt please her. In other words, in order to limit disclosure to Community institutions and national administrations, the notation &#147;Limit&#233;&#148; is regularly stamped&#151;largely, one may suspect, by Pavlovian reflex&#151;on documents reflecting individual member states&#146; views, on drafting proposals and on legal opinions. One-third of all refusals of access are, according to the survey last October, on these grounds.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000141"></a>It would be interesting to investigate whether the court&#146;s decision in the Sweden and Turco case has made any discernible difference. Although it concerns legal advice, the reasoning is capable of a potentially wider application. We understood the Minister to desire not only a reversal of the Turco decision but even greater protection of a permanent and blanket nature against any disclosure of member states&#146; statements  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC269"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of position, ever. That would go beyond the present and proposed regulation, which has careful limitations by reference to the concepts of seriously undermining the decision-making process and the overriding public interest, and we did not agree with her about that suggestion.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000142"></a>The notation &#147;Limit&#233;&#148; has hitherto had a considerable impact on UK parliamentary scrutiny. The view has been taken that it operates as a general bar to disclosure by the Government to Parliament, or so it may appear. The present inquiry and our co-decision inquiry have disclosed that this is not the case. Other parliaments&#151;Nordic, German, French&#151;regularly see &#147;Limit&#233;&#148; material. The Council&#146;s own legal view is that there is no problem about giving national parliaments automatic access to such documents, on the basis that such parliaments will comply with the restrictions involved. These are not onerous. The Minister indicated a welcome willingness to explore with Parliament how this avenue should be followed. We trust that her successor, with a European parliamentary background, will be equally enthusiastic about doing so.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000143"></a>I shall mention one other proposed extension of the grounds for withholding disclosure. This relates to documents submitted to institutions by member states acting other than in their legislative capacity&#151;examples would be an application for state aid clearance, or a letter or report giving information. In Sweden v Commission, the Court held that member states had no veto over the disclosure of such documents; they had to justify their withholding on a basis to be found in the regulation. The proposal would modify this by giving states an additional right to rely on their own national legislation. On the face of it, this might give effect to whatever document-withholding rights that member states chose to enact domestically, and it is not stated what should happen if the European and national grounds for withholding disclosure overlap. In this, as in some other respects identified in our report, the proposal is unclear.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000144"></a>We concluded our report by welcoming a new provision requiring legislative documents, and non-legislative documents of a general nature, to be made directly accessible to the public, where disclosable, without the previous impalpable qualification &#147;as far as possible&#148;. I have long felt that the problem in the United Kingdom is that Europe is not properly understood or explained in its aims, its operation or its impact, and that the value attached in Europe to the United Kingdom&#146;s engagement and our actual and potential influence in Europe are matters not sufficiently appreciated in the UK generally. Openness and accessibility to information are part of the key to addressing these problems.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000145"></a>It has been a great privilege to have been the last serving Law Lord in a long line to have chaired Sub-Committee E and sat on the European Union Select Committee. While I hope I have contributed, I feel that I have gained far more from the experience, from the insights that it gives into the workings of this place and of Government, and from the friendships made in the process. As we move across Parliament Square to take our leave of absence while we are serving Law Lords&#151;depending on future changes, who knows? Perhaps even for ever&#151;I also express my

I beg to move the Motion standing in my name.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000146"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09071577000311"></a>Lord Grenfell:</b> I congratulate the committee on an excellent report which I have read because I now have all the time in the world to read reports. In a previous incarnation, my perusal or close examination of these reports was normally done on a Monday or a Friday in the Eurostar, but this time I was able to read it at my leisure. I have only one point to make on the report which I will do in just a moment, but before that I want to seize the opportunity of this debate to record my thanks to the Law Lords in general and to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, in particular, who have made such an extraordinary contribution to the work of Sub-Committee E and the Select Committee. I have had the privilege of sitting alongside the noble and learned Lords, Lord Hope, Lord Scott, Lord Brown and then Lord Mance. How fortunate we and our predecessors have been and how greatly we will miss having a Law Lord chairing Sub-Committee E and contributing to the work of the Select Committee.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000147"></a>I am happy to note&#151;I hope it is true&#151;that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, will be immortalised in the painting commissioned from Sergei Pavlenko. It will depict, so we are told, the last judgments of the Law Lords, which has an awesome and biblical ring to it. I do not think that the Government will be able to tell us whether the Almighty&#146;s nihil obstat was sought and obtained. Through the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, perhaps I may offer my warmest thanks to all the noble and learned Lords who have given the committee the benefit of their incomparable wisdom and expertise and, I would add, their energy, patience and very good humour. On a more personal note, I will always treasure the central and inspiring role played by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, in the committee&#146;s delivery under his guidance of the crucial chapters in our Lisbon treaty impact assessment report. It was a quite extraordinary and exemplary piece of work which contributed hugely to the informing of the House as it debated the ratification of the treaty. I wish him well, along with all his fellow noble and learned Lords who are now to become Justices of the Supreme Court when they move across the road. Again, I thank him warmly.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000148"></a>I have but one observation on the report because the subject of access to EU documents has been of great interest to me throughout my chairmanship of the European Union Committee. Anybody who has been to any of the joint meetings of the Commission, the Parliament and national parliaments in Brussels will have heard questions put repeatedly to the Commissioners, particularly Commissioner Wallstrom, about how to get better access to EU documents. From the national parliament point of view, some considerable progress has been made, but this report approaches the subject in a much more detailed and important way. What I want to comment on is the part that relates to how much confidentiality is required for the conduct of legislative negotiation. As the noble  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC271"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC271</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord, Lord Roper, will know very well, this is of particular concern to the committee as the chairman deals with departmental Ministers all the time. It is an issue, and has been for some time. I note that some of our recent correspondence on this has been duly recorded and examined.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000149"></a>There appears to be a bit of a stand-off between the member states and the European Parliament which can only be accentuated by the extension of co-decision. Articles 4(3) and 4(4)&#151;perhaps this is an oversimplification because I am not a legal expert&#151;seem not fully to meet the requirements of either the former or the latter, with extensive protection favoured by the one and maximum transparency by the other. The report notes at paragraph 38 that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000237"></a>&#147;The Government appear to be seeking a particularly high level of protection for negotiating positions during the legislative process and that this is not reflected in the current wording of the proposal&#148;.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000150"></a>The committee concludes, very sensibly, that the current and proposed regulations are right to retain the qualification that disclosure may be required,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000252"></a>&#147;by reason of an overriding public interest&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000220"></a>That still begs the question of what constitutes &#147;an overriding public interest&#148;. It is not easy to decide. My plea to the Government is that they must be vigilant in ensuring that we do not get to the point where officials and Ministers feel compelled to put nothing in writing during the negotiating process. There will be huge and continuing pressure from the European Parliament on the issue of access to documents related to negotiations. The previous European Parliament was terrier-like on this issue and I have no reason to believe that the new Parliament will be any different. This is something that needs careful monitoring.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000151"></a>The committee made a very convincing argument in relation to legal advice given in the context of a legislative proposal. The report persuades me that the Government ought not to be seeking a higher level of protection for legal advice than is afforded by the present regulation, as interpreted by the European Court of Justice in the Sweden and Turco cases. These are delicate issues of balance and the committee&#146;s report will be very helpful to those seeking to achieve that balance. I am sure that the Government will take good note of its conclusions, and I hope that the other member states and the institutions of the European Union will do likewise. I very much support the report and congratulate the committee on its production.</p>

This would be the case particularly in relation to the two areas to which some time is devoted in the report&#151;I refer to the disclosure of legal advice and of documents used in the formulation of policy.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000154"></a>As regards the disclosure of legal advice, I, like the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, hope that the level of protection for legal advice, which we assume is given by the present regulation following the ECJ&#146;s judgments in the Sweden and Turco cases, will be given by any new regulation; but also that an appropriate distinction is drawn between legal advice given to parties in a dispute and legal advice that has been relied upon to establish legal competence.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000155"></a>As regards the disclosure of documents, the report supports the Government&#146;s efforts to establish a clear definition of documents in the regulation, and questions the unsatisfactory suggestion that the definition should in some way be linked to the method of transmission of the document. The report strikes a reasonable balance that allows advice and negotiating positions to remain confidential, subject to an overriding public interest. However, it is against the public interest to have a system that encourages too much informality&#151;a system where frank advice cannot be given and advice is not recorded for fear that it would leak into the public domain.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000156"></a>In the evidence session, I asked Mr Regan, first secretary to the United Kingdom Permanent Representation, how far the regulation would go in respect of preliminary thinking and advice. His answer was that the regulation would cover all documents held by the institution, including initial thoughts, early drafts and internal e-mails between officials of the commissions. I suggest that that would not be a useful outcome. It is essential that we seek to achieve the balance that Mr Regan referred to&#151;namely, that between the principle of transparency and the good functioning of the Administrations and the legislature.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000157"></a>As has already been said today, there is considerable transparency in the workings of the European Union&#151;perhaps more than in the workings of Westminster and Whitehall. Having said that, though, in my opinion the least transparent of all the institutions is the Council of Ministers. When the Council acts as a legislator, at the very least it should be the norm that the meetings are open to public scrutiny, as are those of all the other legislative bodies of the member states. It is also important that we pursue the matter raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, regarding Parliament&#146;s ability to see documents, and that some arrangements are come to along the lines of those achieved by other Governments, particularly in Scandinavia.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000158"></a>As a member of the sub-committee, I echo the sentiments expressed regretting the fact that it will no longer be possible for it to be chaired by a serving Lord of Appeal in Ordinary. Rather than &#147;ordinary&#148; in the ordinary sense of the word, the noble and learned Lords who have chaired the sub-committee have brought extraordinary expertise to the task, and the members of this sub-committee have been particularly fortunate in having the noble and learned Lord,

Under his leadership we have been present at meetings in Europe and taken an evidence session in Brussels&#151;something that I believe broke new ground for Sub-Committee E. Whatever the merits or otherwise of the establishment of the Supreme Court, the loss of the Law Lords, and of the noble and learned Lord in particular, is one of the least desirable consequences.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000159"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09071577000313"></a>Lord Roper:</b> The 15th report of this session of the European Union Sub-committee on access to documents, which we are considering today, is a valuable one. It is an example of one of our sub-committees preparing a report during the period in which co-decision between the Council and the Parliament is going on. It is important, particularly in view of the questions that have been raised already, that this document has been held under scrutiny. We will want further answers from the Government before the committee lifts its scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000160"></a>My purpose in intervening today is primarily similar to that of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, who was my predecessor as chairman of the committee and has already referred to the remarkable contribution made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, as chairman of Sub-Committee E and a member of the Select Committee. I echo that. He made a central contribution, as the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, said, in the preparation of our report on the impact appraisal of the Lisbon treaty.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000161"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, referred to the central contributions that came from Sub-Committee E, but I remember also the discussions in the full Select Committee when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, was frequently very helpful in finding language that would reflect these issues appropriately. He was also responsible for the preparation of the reports of his own sub-committee, and reference has already been made to one of those. The report that we debated in the House on the initiation of EU legislation is one that has had the most impact both inside and outside this House, and was a good example of a report that helped people to understand the processes and workings of the European Union.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000162"></a>I was interested to hear earlier this month from the senior adviser to the European Union Committee of the Czech Senate. When it needed advice on institutional matters, it would turn either to the judgments of the German constitutional court or to the reports of the House of Lords. The latter has benefited very greatly in recent years from the diligence and wisdom of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance. During the year that I have been chairman, I have very much appreciated the opportunity to work closely with a Law Lord and to realise the skills and talents that they have.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000163"></a>As has been said, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, is in fact the 12th Lord of Appeal in Ordinary to chair Sub-Committee E. Law Lords have provided the chair continuously since Lord Diplock held it from 1974 to 1977. They have made an absolutely invaluable contribution to the quality of the work of the House of Lords European Union Committee. As has already

<p><a name="09071577000164"></a>This is also, I think, the last occasion on which we shall see the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, at the Dispatch Box replying to a debate. Although Europe has not been at the centre of his responsibilities in the Foreign Office, he has frequently replied to the debates of the European Union Committee and we have very much appreciated the interest that he has shown in its work and reports. This is therefore a day of regrets at departures but, more importantly, of enormous gratitude for the contributions that have been made to our collective work.</p>
<h5><a name="09071577000271"></a>5.51 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09071577000165"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09071577000314"></a>Lord Dykes:</b> It is a great pleasure to follow the previous speakers in wholeheartedly supporting the commendations and thanks to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, for all the work that he has done. Although I have had less acquaintance with, and less direct knowledge of, that work compared with colleagues who have had more years of experience in that regard, I can testify to the huge contribution that he made, particularly in the latter stages of the European Union Select Committee. That was referred to by the noble Lords, Lord Roper and Lord Grenfell. Without his contribution, we could not have made the progress that we did on what was, thanks to the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, and other members of the committee, a very remarkable report. It is lengthy and profound, and it had a considerable impact on the progress of the Lisbon treaty Bill in the Commons. It was in the background; none the less, it played an important role.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000166"></a>I very much agree with most of what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, has said today, and so there is no need for me to be lengthy in my comments other than to commend the report from these Benches and to hope that the noble and learned Lord&#146;s Motion to consider will eventually be approved after further discussion.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000167"></a>We are now at an important stage with the start of the new European Parliament and the question of what will happen to the further ratification steps. We think mainly of the Irish referendum but other countries are still to put the final seal of approval on the ratification process. That usually happens with presidential signatures, but there is also the necessary and important&#151;presumably primary&#151;legislation to come in the Bundestag before the general election in September. It will be interesting to see the terms of the Bill when it is eventually published. I am not sure of the date because there is the summer holiday to contend with as well. Subject to that and to, I hope, the ratification process eventually being completed, with the Lisbon treaty starting to function in the European Union there will be the very important transparency priority for the future of the Union. There will be a new European Parliament with in many ways a different kind of membership and, we hope, more openness on the part of the other institutions. The Commission has tried to lead the way in these matters and it needs support and thanks for that.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000168"></a>Perhaps logically, the Council of Ministers remains slightly in the background in progress on these matters because of the early pre-legislative stages, which always make Governments very nervous. The then Minister for Europe, Caroline Flint, who left the Government for totally different reasons from those enunciated recently by the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown&#151;I do not make any comparison at all&#151;revealed in the Minutes of Evidence all the nervousness of government about the revelation of documents at the negotiation stage. I quote what she said from page 2 of the Minutes of Evidence:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000238"></a>&#147;I think in this debate that we need to be mindful about the difference in terms of the role and responsibilities of the Council and the ministers who are represented in those forums and the difference between the accountability of those individuals to their Member States in these negotiations and those of MEPs, who I think have an important role but a slightly different role&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000221"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, then put the question&#151;I hope he will forgive me for quoting it:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000239"></a>&#147;Is the broad answer to the question I put that the Government does think it would seriously undermine the decision making process to make any sort of public disclosure of negotiating documents?&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000222"></a>The Europe Minister&#146;s answer was:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000240"></a>&#147;I think it could contribute to that, yes. Inadvertently, it would lead to something that would not be very satisfactory and people would possibly find other ways to have these conversations and talks. It would not allow the candour that is necessary in these discussions and negotiations. I do not think that in itself would be helpful in terms of policy making&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000223"></a>That is undoubtedly the position not only of the UK Government&#151;this matter is still under scrutiny and has not been decided yet&#151;but of a number of other Governments.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000169"></a>If we accept the logic that this is really only a legislative stage, and an early legislative stage under the co-decision procedure which the European Union Select Committee is now felicitously examining closely, that is much more acceptable to member Governments. Governments then have the ability to reveal, if they so wish, other pre-legislative negotiating positions that are developing. They often brief the press in that way, and there is no reason why that should not be a happy outcome. However, I am not totally optimistic that this will work well. It remains to be seen what will happen during this different process.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000170"></a>There is an obvious need to modernise this regulation, as the report implies. It is not enough for us to rely on the terms of Article 255, although that article is adamant about the need for modernising the regulation and is encouraging as a background. The sub-committee&#146;s Recommendation 17 on page 8 says about the courts:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000241"></a>&#147;We consider it appropriate, in principle, for the question of disclosure of documents submitted to courts to be regulated by the courts themselves, where such courts have, or are likely to have, and operate appropriate mechanisms enabling third parties to apply for and obtain access where necessary&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000224"></a>That is a much easier matter for this Committee and other organs of examination to determine and, as far as I among many observers of these complicated matters can see, it is not producing much trial and tribulation at the moment.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000171"></a>I refer briefly to the exchanges on the relationship to the co-decision inquiry and the other matters that are dealt with in this report. Again, paragraph 61 on  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC276"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC276</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>page 16 endorses Article 255, which I think is generally accepted; and summing it all up with great force in paragraph 77 on page 18, the committee says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000242"></a>&#147;We support a firmer obligation on institutions to establish direct access to the public of their documents and believe that there is scope for more proactive dissemination of information&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000225"></a>One technical and technological suggestion is a subscription e-mail service. I imagine that other things could be tackled as well. Eventually, it may not be necessary for anyone to subscribe to it. I hope so, and the sooner the better.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000172"></a>Although the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, referred delicately and engagingly to a swan-song, I thought that I would go straight to Hollywood in total contrast and refer Members to the famous Cecil B DeMille definition of the ideal film: you start with an earthquake and build up to a real climax. No one would suggest that that would be appropriate for this committee report because it is&#151;I am sure the noble and learned Lord would not mind us laymen who are not legal experts using the term&#151;dry-as-dust stuff. None the less, it is very important for the background, and even if we get nowhere near to an earthquake in this matter, which would be totally inappropriate, we need Governments&#146; attitudes to change substantially and all the various institutions working together for the greater good to take a more adventurous approach. So much European legislation will depend on sensible consensus in the future rather than on perhaps some of the more classic manifestations of party political behaviour in the national Parliaments, although that can also play a role in the European Parliament between the different political groups.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000173"></a>I say that with some pleasure, reflecting as I do on the early 1970s when I was a Member, under the dual mandate system, of what was then a very weak European Parliament&#151;the European Assembly to most people&#151;with 184 Members and where sometimes the Commission did not even bother to attend, particularly towards the end of the week to what is now, having been created in Brussels mainly but also in Strasbourg, an increasingly powerful and important institution that I hope meets with the pleasure and approval of colleagues on this Committee. We see the genuine building-in of democracy at the European level and more effective liaison, we hope, with national Parliaments as their increased powers are built-in from the Lisbon treaty process. On that note, I hope very much that this Committee will support the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, that we approve this report.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000175"></a>I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, for explaining the background to this report and for the evidence that his sub-committee took. The report is a thorough and comprehensive analysis of the major issues of the European Commission&#146;s proposed reform regulation 1049/2001, which sets out the code for public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. We on my Benches support transparency within the EU, better access to documents and freedom of information. I therefore very much welcome all the recommendations that the Select Committee highlighted. I also acknowledge the difficult task that the Select Committee had in striking a balance between, on the one hand, protecting the need for privacy when formulating policy, particularly when set against the need for legislators to act transparently and, on the other hand, enabling the public to properly scrutinise the activities of the EU.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000176"></a>I agree with the principle that disclosure of documents submitted to courts by parties other than the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, referred to in the report as &#147;the institutions&#148;, should be excluded from the scope of the regulation altogether. This should be governed by the courts where,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000253"></a>&#147;such courts have, or are likely to have, and operate appropriate mechanisms enabling third parties to apply for and obtain access where necessary&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000226"></a>However, as the report points out, this provision needs to be further defined as to which courts this applies to. Does it apply to the European Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance exclusively or does it apply to any court anywhere in the world? If it is the latter, what would be the procedure if the court did not have mechanisms in place for granting access to documents?</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000177"></a>On 6 April, the Government acknowledged that problem in a letter from the right honourable Caroline Flint, the then Minister for Europe, to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance. Will the Minister update the Grand Committee on whether the Government feel that this issue has been clarified? Do the Government accept that, by failing to define which courts are being referred to in Article 2(5), we are in danger of sending to court appeals which might not have received a sufficiently robust appeals process?</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000178"></a>The application of Article 2(5) is limited to documents submitted to courts by parties other than the institutions. Does the Minister accept the report&#146;s argument that this is an &#147;obscure exception&#148;? How is it proposed that these documents would be treated if the exception remained?</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000179"></a>As the report points out, the wording of Article 3 of the proposal&#151;</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09071577000243"></a>&#147;The definition of a document accessible to the public would expressly cover retrievable information held in a database; but would otherwise be limited to documents &#145;drawn-up by an institution and formally transmitted to one or more recipients or otherwise registered, or received by an institution&#146;&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="09071577000227"></a>is open to a worryingly wide range of interpretations. In its current format, it &#147;would not be justifiable&#148;. Will the Minister reassure the Committee that this  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC278"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC278</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>part of the proposal will not become a vehicle for preventing the transparency that the EU so badly needs?</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000180"></a>The committee stated that, although it recognised the need for privacy of internal discussions,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000254"></a>&#147;Member States act as legislators when negotiating in the Council, and legislators normally act publicly&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000228"></a>In the light of that, how are the Government seeking to strike a balance in this area? What is their justification for,</p>
<ul><a name="09071577000255"></a>&#147;seeking a particularly high level of protection for negotiating positions during the legislative process&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="09071577000229"></a>when the European Parliament is of the opinion that all such legislative material and exchanges should become generally open to public scrutiny? The Select Committee also recommends that the proposed regulation is right to retain the qualification that disclosure may be required by reason of an overriding public interest.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000181"></a>The European Court of Justice found that there was no general need for confidentiality in respect of legal advice given to the Commission. Why are the Government again seeking greater protection and confidentiality, especially as the Select Committee found no need for it?</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000182"></a>I echo what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, and other noble Lords have said about the Minister. I have very much enjoyed my outings with him in debates and at Question Time; they have been a privilege. I wish him the very best for the future.</p>
<h5><a name="09071577000273"></a>6.08 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09071577000183"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09071577000316"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Malloch-Brown):</b> I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mance, for initiating this debate and for allowing the Government the opportunity to respond to the committee&#146;s report on the proposed recast of the access to EU documents regulation. To pick up his reference to swans with regard to Ministers and Law Lords, I note only that the fine swans-cum-Law-Lords of ours will find that their new pond is even closer to St James&#146;s Park and other fine birds. I wish that we still had Lewis Carroll to record this fine condition; I fear that no poet today will quite rise to the occasion.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000184"></a>I am grateful to the committee for its detailed consideration of the issues, and I am pleased to note that the Government share its view on a number of points. I am also grateful for the points that have been raised today. I hope that I can immediately dispose of three of the noble and learned Lord&#146;s concerns. The Government are not arguing for diminished transparency. Our position is based on the need for balance and allowing the institutions to function effectively.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000185"></a>Let me also say a word about the use of limit&#233; sanctions. We respect the Council&#146;s limit&#233; classification. However, the Government await the Lords&#146; EU Select Committee report on the scrutiny of co-decision dossiers; I understand that it will make a number of suggestions on the issue. My noble friend the Minister for Europe looks forward to receiving the report and will consider any recommendations made by the committee. I would also reassure the noble and learned Lord that, on the issue of whether the UK is arguing for the disclosure  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC279"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of third-party submissions, as the then Minister for Europe made clear in the committee&#146;s evidence session in March, negotiations continue at an early stage and member states&#146; negotiating positions will evolve as they proceed. As the committee recognises in the report, our concern is not against institutions&#146; pleadings per se, but that the substance of third-party pleadings can often be obtained from the content of institutions&#146; pleadings. Noble Lords know that we are keen to protect those third-party pleadings.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000186"></a>The broad argument I want to convey this afternoon is that the Government, like the committee, have long supported openness and transparency. While I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, that perhaps this is not earthquake territory, we hope that at least a brisk breeze of openness has blown through government information in recent years. I mention the Freedom of Information Act, the Data Protection Act and the environmental information regulations, which have transformed access to information in this country. At the EU level, the UK presidency in the second half of 2005 saw a number of measures proposed to promote transparency, including deliberations in Council of co-decision dossiers, the European transparency initiative and so forth. However, there is a need for balance, as I think noble Lords have acknowledged in the debate, to ensure the effective operation of the institutions and the EU decision-making process. That is why the Government continue to take a pragmatic view on each of the points raised in the review by championing those areas where we believe the proposals should go further to promote transparency and exercising caution where we believe they may impede the effective operation of the EU&#146;s policy-making.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000187"></a>The Government&#146;s position is guided primarily by our own freedom of information legislation debated in this House almost a decade ago. In that legislation, each request is dealt with on a case-by-case basis by subjecting most exemptions to a public interest test. It is this balance that has been the Government&#146;s basis for their position on the specific issues addressed by the Commission in its proposal and by the committee in its report. It is the question of balance that lies behind our wish to ensure a sufficient level of protection on negotiating positions and working papers in Council.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000188"></a>We recognise that the public may be interested in such documents; indeed, much information is already made public, such as Commission consultations on proposals or the Government&#146;s communications on our position when negotiating objectives and updates as negotiations proceed. However, we also think that it is in the public&#146;s interest that decision-making should be based on frank advice and that policies should be allowed to develop freely. We believe that if space to develop policy is not preserved, innovative thinking is likely to be stifled; I noted the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, in that area. We welcome the committee&#146;s recognition of this in its report.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000189"></a>We remain concerned that discussions between member states may be forced out into the corridors, away from the Council negotiating table. We would not necessarily want sofa government in the corridors of Brussels. The key stages of negotiations and the end result are  


<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC280"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column GC280</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of course publicly available, but it is not necessarily helpful that every stage of the steps in between could be open to scrutiny.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000190"></a>The committee advocates that the withholding of legal advice should be subject to a public interest test, but the Government are concerned that this may impede the effective operation of the institutions. The Council needs frank and open legal advice in order to make informed decisions. This requires a high level of confidentiality, and the regulation must give particular recognition to lawyer-client confidentiality. The High Court recently confirmed that the equivalent Freedom of Information Act exemption is heavily weighted in favour of protecting the confidentiality of legal advice. We would support a similar interpretation in the regulation.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000191"></a>I am assured that the Turco judgment, which has been referred to&#151;I speak hesitantly here in front of a Law Lord; I hope that I dare offer an opinion on this&#151;creates a presumption that certain legal advice will be disclosed routinely. We do not think that the ECJ judgment strikes the right balance and we agree with the committee&#146;s view that the Turco judgment went further than the provisions in the existing regulation. Greater clarity is therefore needed of the position of legal advice on the proposal.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000192"></a>Reference has already been made to the earlier hearings with my right honourable friend the then Minister for Europe. Those hearings were clearly lively. The committee raised a concern about the exclusion of court documents held by EU institutions and questioned whether that exclusion applied simply to the Court of First Instance in the ECJ or more widely. The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, returned to this very important point today. The Commission has since clarified that the exclusion would apply to documents held by the institutions from all courts, including courts of the EU but also others, such as the WTO court. The Government share this Committee&#146;s concern that, if this exemption were to apply to all courts, there would be a risk of a reduction in transparency. The Government are therefore considering their position on this aspect of the proposal, and my noble friend the Minister for Europe will keep the committee informed of progress.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000193"></a>The committee raised a concern about the exclusion of documents not formally transmitted or registered from the scope of the proposal. The Government share that concern and firmly believe that the broad definition of the term &#147;document&#148; should be retained and that the disclosure of drafts should be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000194"></a>Noble Lords will also be aware of the Government&#146;s concern about the potential disclosure of documents originating from member states and held by the institutions without the consent of the member state involved. This regulation is principally designed to provide access to the institution&#146;s own documents. Member states&#146; own freedom of information legislation should principally govern access to member state documents. If, for example, someone wants to see a UK document, they should apply using the UK&#146;s domestic legislation. This is consistent with the principle of subsidiarity, avoids conflict between national and EU law, and will

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000195"></a>However, under the current proposal, member states will not be able to rely on an assertion of whether or not to disclose without clear justification, and the applicant will be informed of the member state&#146;s reason for opposing disclosure. The applicant will then have recourse to challenge the reason before the courts. We think that this would bring the same ultimate outcome and, we hope, would satisfy the committee&#146;s concerns.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000196"></a>In conclusion, I thank noble Lords for their kind words about me. It has been a pleasure to appear in front of this Committee. I sometimes find such appearances rather daunting because I, along with the great British public, find some of these issues very hard to understand. The ratio of preparation to time in front of noble Lords is sufficiently high that, although it has been a great privilege to appear here, I confess to some relief that this is the last occasion on which I shall have to do so. I look forward to sinking back into my pond. May it be relaxing and not require the need to defend European directives in the future, important though they are.</p>

<p><a name="09071577000197"></a><b><a name="90715-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09071577000317"></a>Lord Mance:</b> I thank all speakers, in particular the Minister, for all the hard work that he has just assured us&#151;and shown us&#151;that he has done on the subject. I will also mention the noble Lord, Lord Roper, and the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, whose chairmanship of the European Union Select Committee, on which I had the privilege to serve, was inspiring, influential and knowledgeable. I thank noble Lords generally for their very kind words.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000198"></a>The Lisbon treaty was mentioned. That was a very co-operative effort, with huge and valuable assistance from the committee, legal team and staff. I am sorry that I will not be able to follow it up here, but I will be interested to see how accurate our predictions prove.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000199"></a>The theme of noble Lords&#146; speeches has been the need for a delicate balance&#151;something that the committee fully accepts. The noble Lords, Lord Grenfell and Lord Bowness, and the Minister, Lord Malloch-Brown, emphasised that.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000200"></a>It is clear that drafts&#151;the subject of the evidence mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Bowness&#151;come within the present regulation. They might fall outside the proposed regulation. However, their disclosure would not be required if it would seriously undermine the decision-making process, unless there was an overriding public interest. I stress that, as far as we ascertained, there was little to suggest that the present position has proved vexatious. Of course, in the past two years there have been a number of European Court decisions. The Turco decision some two years ago was one, and it may have wider implications, as I suggested when opening the debate.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000201"></a>I am particularly grateful for the questions put by the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, and for the Minister&#146;s response to a considerable number of questions.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000202"></a>I suggest that the present wording achieves a balance. As the Minister mentioned, the Freedom of Information Act requires case-by-case consideration. That was precisely the approach of the European Court of Justice in the Turco case. That is what the court said, and it was right to highlight the fact that hitherto there has been a blanket approach to the disclosure&#151;or non-disclosure&#151;of documentation. The antidote to be found in its decisions is a healthy one. I do not believe that the court would apply the principle to absurdity. We must trust the force of argument. The considerations that the Minister has mentioned are ones that can and would be advanced if disclosure was sought unreasonably, and one must believe that they would find force in the right quarters&#151;ultimately, even, in the Court of Justice. That applies in particular to legal advice. No one is suggesting that the Turco decision is a recipe for trawling through every conceivable piece of legal advice. In the case of disputes, as the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, said, that would be out of the question.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000203"></a>There is a strong argument that, on a matter as fundamental as European Union and Community competence, the public has an interest in knowing what the advice is. There are other contexts in which competence and legal advice are discussed, but this is a much less controversial one. The Turco decision, which we fully accept involved a liberal interpretation of the language, was one of which we approved. This applies also to the decision-making process. Again, one comes back to the question of drafts, which I have mentioned.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000204"></a>As for non-legislative documents, the Minister mentioned the proposed revision to allow member states to rely not only on regulation grounds but also on their national grounds for withholding documents. He suggests that that means that a UK document would have to be sought under UK freedom of information legislation if the UK Government relied upon that. As we have said in our report, while that may be a feasible line of argument, it does not seem to be clearly developed in the present draft, and the draft seems to have a rather muddled idea of how the invocation of national legislation would match and marry with the invocation of European legislation and who would decide what. It needs clarification.</p>

<a name="90715-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09071577000205"></a>I conclude by mentioning another anthropomorphic myth involving swans, and I hope your Lordships will forgive the pun. In one form or another, the heroes in &#147;Swan Lake&#148; and &#147;Lohengrin&#148; were transformed. Then, I am afraid, they swanned off into history, and so, as the Law Lords transmute into Justices of the Supreme Court, must we, with some sadness but in the hope of not losing all contacts.</p>

<p><i><a name="09071577000328"></a>Motion agreed.</i></p>

<p><i><a name="09071577000329"></a>Committee adjourned at 6.26 pm.</i></p>

On completion of their mobilisation procedures, the reservists will undertake a period of training and, where applicable, integration with their respective receiving units. The majority will serve on operations for six or so months. As part of this commitment, we expect up to 21 members of the sponsored reserves to be in theatre at any one time.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_103"></a><a name="09071575000108"></a>My honourable friend the Minister for the Armed Forces and I wish to make the latest in the series of quarterly Statements to the House about the inquests of service personnel and others who have died overseas. Our deepest condolences go, as ever, to the families of the service personnel who have lost their lives in the service of their country, and in particular to the 31 who have died since our last Statement.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_104"></a><a name="09071575000109"></a>All of the families whose loved ones have made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, or who have otherwise lost their lives in connection with the operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, remain very much in our thoughts.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_105"></a><a name="09071575000110"></a>Today, we are announcing the progress that has been made since the Written Ministerial Statement on 5 May 2009 (<I>Official Report</I>, col. 7WS), with information about the conduct of inquests by the Wiltshire and Swindon and other coroners. This Statement gives the position at 6 July.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="09071575000113"></a>At the time of the last Statement, we reported that, up to 27 April, 230 inquests had been held since June 2006: 216 into the overseas deaths of service personnel and 14 into the deaths of civilians in Iraq whose bodies were repatriated via RAF Brize Norton or RAF Lyneham.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="09071575000114"></a>Since 27 April, a further 11 inquests have been held into the deaths of service personnel who died in operations in Iraq or Afghanistan. This makes a total of 241 inquests held since June 2006.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a><a name="09071575000115"></a>Since operations commenced in 2001, there have been a total of 265 inquests into the deaths of service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan, including five service personnel who died in the UK of their injuries. In two further cases, no formal inquest was held, but the deaths were taken into consideration during inquest proceedings for those who died in the same incident.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_111"></a><a name="09071575000116"></a>We remain deeply grateful for the efforts of all of the coroners who are involved in conducting these inquests, and totally committed in our support for the independent coronial system.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_112"></a><a name="09071575000117"></a>Our departments continue to work closely together, and with the coroners, to review the way in which the system is working and to look for opportunities, prior to the implementation of the coroners legislation which is currently before Parliament in the Coroners and Justice Bill, to make improvements for the benefit of the bereaved families.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_115"></a><a name="09071575000120"></a>The Statement in May reported that there was one remaining inquest to be held into a death where the body was repatriated via RAF Brize Norton prior to 31 March 2007, into the death of Marine Wigley. That inquest has since been concluded and there are no outstanding pre-March 31 2007 inquests in the Oxfordshire coroner&#146;s district.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_117"></a><a name="09071575000122"></a>Since October 2007, additional resources have been provided by the Government to ensure that a backlog of inquests does not build up in the Wiltshire and Swindon district (since 1 April 2007 fatalities have been repatriated via RAF Lyneham). The coroner transfers inquests for service personnel to a coroner closer to the bereaved family, where possible. We are pleased that the district continues to benefit from the experience and expertise of David Masters, who retired as coroner on 31 March, following his appointment as an assistant deputy coroner by his successor, David Ridley.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_118"></a><a name="09071575000123"></a>There are 76 open inquests to be concluded into the deaths of service personnel who died in Iraq and Afghanistan whose bodies were repatriated after 1 April 2007 (36 involving deaths in the past six months). Of these, Mr Ridley has retained 41 inquests, whilst 35 inquests are being conducted by coroners closer to the next-of-kin. At 6 July two fatalities had been repatriated but inquests were yet to be opened, and four recent fatalities awaited repatriation. Hearing dates have been set in 22 of these cases.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="09071575000127"></a><b><a name="90715-wms0002.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09071575000323"></a>The Minister for International Defence and Security (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defence (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_122"></a><a name="09071575000128"></a>This important case arose from the tragic death of Private Jason Smith from heatstroke in Iraq in 2003 and was brought by Private Smith&#146;s mother. The Court of Appeal gave its judgment for the respondent on 18 May this year, whilst granting the Secretary of State permission to appeal to the House of Lords.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_123"></a><a name="09071575000129"></a>There is no longer any dispute over the question which initiated the case. The MoD has previously accepted that there are limited circumstances when Armed Forces personnel come within the UK&#146;s jurisdiction for the purposes of the European Convention on Human Rights when they are deployed overseas. These include the circumstances of Private Jason Smith&#146;s death, where Private Smith was at all times within a British Army camp and British Army hospital and no third party nationals were involved in his death. It has already been agreed that a new inquest should be held into the cause of Private Smith&#146;s death which will be fully compliant with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Jason Smith&#146;s death remains the source of great regret, and the MoD will continue to offer its whole-hearted support to the coronial process, and every possible sympathy and attention to Mrs Smith.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_124"></a><a name="09071575000130"></a>But the case as it has developed has raised issues of potentially very wide legal significance. These concern the extent to which actions under the Human Rights Act 1998 (which gave further effect to rights drawn from the European Convention on Human Rights) can be brought in cases involving military personnel deployed on operations outside the United Kingdom. Given the importance of the issues raised by the Court of Appeal&#146;s judgment to how we plan and conduct military operations and to the men and women of the Armed Forces, I have decided that the right course would be to appeal to the House of Lords in order to obtain as much clarity as possible on the legal framework applying to operations overseas. As at all stages of the case, the Government will bear the costs of both sides in the litigation, whatever the outcome.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_130"></a><a name="09071575000138"></a>The Office of the Third Sector has today published a <I>Social Investment Wholesale Bank</I> consultation which sets out the vision, the economic case and consults on proposals for the design and functions of a potential bank. This consultation was announced in Budget 2009 and will inform substantive proposals to be developed by the Office of the Third Sector.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_131"></a><a name="09071575000139"></a>The Government recognise the important role played by the third sector including social enterprises&#151;as sustainable businesses with a social or environmental mission they contribute significantly to stronger local economies and a fairer society. Yet access to appropriate funding and finance is often the biggest concern facing organisations driven by social or environmental purpose. A social investment wholesale bank could enable third sector organisations to access the finance they need to grow and become more sustainable.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_132"></a><a name="09071575000140"></a>More broadly, the bank could help increase investment in society, the environment and the economy at the same time, delivering against a &#145;triple bottom line&#146; of more effective interaction between greater economic growth, social cohesion and sustainable development.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_134"></a><a name="09071575000143"></a>My department, together with the Department for Energy and Climate Change, is today publishing the <I>UK Low Carbon Industrial Strategy</I>.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_135"></a><a name="09071575000144"></a>In parallel to this document, the Government are also publishing the<I> UK</I><I> Low Carbon Transition Plan, </I>the <I>UK Renewable Energy Strategy </I>and the<I> Carbon Reduction Strategy for Transport</I>.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_136"></a><a name="09071575000145"></a>Together these set out the policies which will help drive the transition to decarbonising our economy, and reflect how departments across government are working together to deliver the transition to a low carbon future.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_137"></a><a name="09071575000146"></a>The core objective of the <I>UK Low Carbon Industrial Strategy</I> is to ensure that British businesses and workers are equipped to maximise the economic opportunities and minimise the costs of the transition to a low carbon economy.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_138"></a><a name="09071575000147"></a>Building on the framework for supporting British business set out in <I>Building Britain&#146;s Future: New Industry, New Jobs</I>, its ambition is to ensure that the transition to low carbon is a source of quality jobs and business savings in Britain: from our rapidly developing civil nuclear industry and renewable energy sector, to energy saving in our smallest SMEs.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_139"></a><a name="09071575000148"></a>British firms will benefit from the low carbon transition both by catering to growing British and global markets for low carbon goods and services, and also by using energy and other resources more efficiently to reduce costs.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_140"></a><a name="09071575000149"></a>At the heart of the strategy are three basic principles for a positive environment for low carbon business:</p>
 first, a long-term strategic approach from government &#151;like the clear commitment we have made to nuclear and renewable energy, which will allow businesses to invest in greater confidence; secondly, a pragmatic recognition that intervention from government may be required in some areas to accelerate and enable the transition to low carbon&#151;in the case of the Low Carbon Industrial Strategy this means support for the research and development that will produce new low carbon technologies; finally, a recognition that government have a responsibility to ensure that British-based companies and people are equipped to compete for the new demand created by government climate change policies. This has implications for our skills policy, and the way we support the development of supply chains in this country, both issues addressed in this strategy. 
<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_141"></a><a name="09071575000150"></a>The strategy identifies a range of low carbon sectors in which the Government believe that the UK has potential for job creation and business savings. Where barriers to market or other obstacles are blocking the development of Britain&#146;s full potential in these areas, it sets out the Government&#146;s strategy for removing them.</p>




<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS86"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column WS86</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_142"></a><a name="09071575000151"></a>This includes the first investments from the  &#163;405 million for low carbon industries and advanced green manufacturing announced at Budget 2009. Key announcements include:</p>
 up to &#163;120 million to support the development of a British-based offshore wind industry;up to &#163;60 million to capitalise on Britain&#146;s wave and tidal sector strengths, including investment in Wave Hub&#151;the development of a significant demonstration and testing facility off the Cornish coast&#151;and other funding to make the South West Britain&#146;s first low carbon economic area;the Government will provide capital investment in order to establish a nuclear advanced manufacturing research centre consisting of a consortium of manufacturers from the UK nuclear supply chain and universities;up to &#163;10 million for the accelerated deployment of electric vehicle charging infrastructure; anda &#163;4 million expansion of the Manufacturing Advisory Service, to provide more specialist advice to manufacturers on competing for low carbon opportunities, including support for suppliers for the civil nuclear industry.
<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_143"></a><a name="09071575000152"></a>The strategy recognises that we need to build on local and regional strengths in order to make the most of the future economic benefits for Britain. For this reason, the strategy introduces the concept of low carbon economic areas, and announces the development of the first of these, located in the South West of England, focusing on the development of marine energy demonstration, servicing and manufacture.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_144"></a><a name="09071575000153"></a>It also announces the creation of the cross-Whitehall Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) to create a single body charged solely with making a success of the Government&#146;s strategy for low emission vehicles.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_145"></a><a name="09071575000154"></a>Finally, the Low Carbon Industrial Strategy recognises that this transition raises significant challenges for our industrial workforce and their families. As with previous structural changes to the economy, the move to a low carbon economy will affect each business, worker and family differently. Previous economic structural shifts have had huge social impacts, with some workers and communities being left behind as industries are restructured by change. The Government are committed to doing all it can to ensure this is a just transition.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_146"></a><a name="09071575000155"></a>For this reason, the Government will create a forum for considering these issues and advising government. The new Forum for a Just Transition will include representatives from central government, national, local and regional bodies, trade unions, business organisations, and third sector bodies.</p>

<notus-date day="15" month="7" year="2009" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS87"></a><b>15 July 2009 : Column WS87</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_148"></a><a name="09071575000158"></a>I would like to inform the House about progress on the FiReControl project&#151;part of our major programme of work to ensure that the Fire and Rescue Service is fully equipped to meet the challenges and demands of the modern world.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_149"></a><a name="09071575000159"></a>Recent events, in both Camberwell and Edinburgh, have reinforced the very real significance of doing all that we can to ensure the safety of the public and firefighters. FiReControl will provide the public and firefighters with very substantial safety benefits by establishing, for the first time, a linked national network of nine regional fire control centres across England. These will replace the current 46 stand-alone control rooms, operated in each Fire and Rescue Authority (FRA) area.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_150"></a><a name="09071575000160"></a>On a day-to-day basis, the new system will improve firefighter safety, the management of incidents and both the efficiency and responsiveness of the service. Firefighters will have access to safety information and incident details through mobile data terminals, and satellite navigation and automatic tracking of fire appliances will enable more efficient use of resources. Emergency calls from the public will be automatically located and managed using spatial data right down to property-level. Control rooms will share calls across the network to manage even the highest call volumes and thereby be more resilient in emergencies. The new network will also improve the country&#146;s ability to respond to terrorism, large-scale industrial accidents and natural disasters such as flooding.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_151"></a><a name="09071575000161"></a>FiReControl is a complex and demanding project that involves significant change to operating practices in the Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) as well as the development and installation of a major new national IT system. In November 2008 my predecessor informed the House that the project was being rescheduled due to slower than expected progress with development of the new IT, and that we would continue to monitor progress carefully as there could only be certainty on final timings once we had made progress through the earlier stages.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_152"></a><a name="09071575000162"></a>Good progress is being made on the building of the nine regional centres and the setting up of the local authority controlled companies that will manage the centres. The delivery and installation of equipment in local fire stations is also on track. However, in recent months it has become clear that technical problems with developing the IT system in a way which will meet all our and FRS requirements mean that further time is needed to complete the project.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_153"></a><a name="09071575000163"></a>I am proposing therefore to extend the delivery schedule by 10 months. This means that the first FRSs will switch over to the regional control centres in spring 2011 and the last will switch over by the end of 2012. We have discussed this in detail with the representatives of FRSs and local government, and we believe that this is a realistic timetable. Key Olympic authorities will switch over in time to prepare for the Games, and the network will provide robust fall-back arrangements for all FRSs over the Olympic period. I am today publishing a full revised schedule for switch over of all FRSs in all regions and copies will be placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_154"></a><a name="09071575000164"></a>To ensure consistent progress on this revised timescale, we have agreed with EADS, our main supplier, and with key stakeholders, a new approach to delivery to give greater assurance on short-term milestones and closer engagement with FRSs.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_155"></a><a name="09071575000165"></a>We remain committed to meeting all the upfront costs associated with the project and to the principle that no FRA will bear any additional cost as a result of FiReControl implementation. Once the new network is established, many FRAs are expected to make savings. These can be reinvested in local priorities and frontline services. We will be updating the cost figures contained in the FiReControl business case in due course to reflect today&#146;s rescheduling.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_156"></a><a name="09071575000166"></a>FiReControl continues to form an important part of the Fire and Resilience Programme, which has already delivered very substantial benefits for the FRS. The New Dimensions Project has given the FRS new vehicles, equipment, and training to respond to terrorism and natural disasters. The Firelink Project is delivering new digital communications technology, which is giving the FRS access to a world-class communications system. FiReControl will build on this successful delivery.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_161"></a><a name="09071575000172"></a>The amendments to the 2007 regulations replace existing prescribed forms for instruments intended to create a property and affairs LPA or a personal welfare LPA with new prescribed forms. The tiles of the new forms detour slightly from the terms used in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and are purely for presentational purposes. Property and affairs becomes property and financial affairs whilst personal welfare becomes health and welfare.

<a name="09071575000176"></a><b><a name="90715-wms0002.htm_spmin6"></a><a name="09071575000329"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> My honourable friend the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury (Sarah McCarthy-Fry) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_165"></a><a name="09071575000177"></a>Life assurance companies are in general taxed on profits as they are recognised and made available to shareholders. The tax system recognises that, for with-profits business, profits on income and gains sometimes have to be held back to achieve the smoothing of returns that is an integral part of the business. This treatment can also apply where a company writes business in a non-profit fund.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_166"></a><a name="09071575000178"></a>When profits are held back in this way there is an Exchequer cost, but this is largely a matter of timing, in that tax should be paid when the deferred profits are recognised and made available to shareholders.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_167"></a><a name="09071575000179"></a>Recently however HMRC has seen an example of manipulation of this tax treatment in relation to a non-profit fund. The manipulation is to change the mix of the non-profit business for tax purposes so that when the previously unrecognised profits of the non-profit fund are recognised they escape tax altogether. Many hundreds of millions of pounds of tax have been avoided in this way.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_168"></a><a name="09071575000180"></a>The Government will introduce legislation to prevent such manipulation in future. Companies will not be able to change the mix of business in their non-profit funds in order to reduce the incidence of tax on their profits that have not yet been recognised. The Government also propose that in the future profits of non-profit business will be taxed as they arise.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_169"></a><a name="09071575000181"></a>In order to ensure the new legislation is appropriately targeted HMRC will consult with the life assurance industry. The precise nature of the new legislation will emerge from that consultation, but the intention is that the potential tax due on unrecognised profits in a non-profit fund will be determined by reference to the appropriate mix of business in 2009. The tax will become due and will be collected as and when profits are recognised and made available to shareholders. After 2009, profits of non-profit business will be taxed as they arise.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_170"></a><a name="09071575000182"></a>The objective of the consultation is to allow the new legislation to be properly targeted. If companies attempt to manipulate their business mix in advance of the new legislation being finalised, for the purposes of avoiding tax, the Government will consider whether it is necessary to introduce retrospective legislation to remove the benefit of that manipulation.</p>

<a name="09071575000183"></a><b><a name="90715-wms0003.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="09071575000330"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Lord Darzi of Denham):</b> My honourable friend the Minster of State, Department of Health (Phil Hope) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_171"></a><a name="09071575000184"></a>The Government have made two commitments in recent years on the treatment of children and young people aged under 18 years of age on adult psychiatric wards. I wish to report to the House on the progress made on these commitments.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_172"></a><a name="09071575000185"></a>The first commitment, made in November 2006, was that within two years no child under the age of 16 would be treated on an adult psychiatric ward.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_173"></a><a name="09071575000186"></a>The second commitment is to commence Section 31(3) of the Mental Health Act 2007 in England by April 2010. This provision, which applies to voluntary (informal) patients as well as formal (detained under mental health legislation) patients, places a duty on hospital managers to ensure that patients aged under 18 are treated in an environment in hospital which is suitable having regard to their age (subject to their needs). The hospital manager has to consult with a person who appears to them to have knowledge or experience of cases involving patients who have not attained the age of 18.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_174"></a><a name="09071575000187"></a>In its twelfth biennial report the Mental Health Act Commission welcomed these commitments and commented that &#147;the ending of admissions of children and adolescents to unsuitable adult facilities is an ambitious undertaking&#148;.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_175"></a><a name="09071575000188"></a>In order to prepare for these two commitments &#163;31 million capital was made available in 2007-08 to 17 projects specifically designed to eliminate the inappropriate use of adult psychiatric wards by children and young people. I can report that five projects have been completed with further projects, which will provide 31 new beds, 35 refurbished beds, and 13 beds relocated to purpose-designed facilities, in various states of completion.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_176"></a><a name="09071575000189"></a>In addition the department commissioned the National Mental Health Development Unit (NMHDU) to work on children and young people&#146;s issues within the Mental Health Act 2007 Implementation Programme. One of the main objectives of this work has been to support local areas to prepare for Section 31(3) of the Mental Health Act 2007.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_193"></a><a name="09071575000206"></a>Year-on-year figures of bed days for under-18s show that consistent progress is being made. The number of bed days for under-16s and 16 to 17 year-olds on adult psychiatric wards has significantly reduced. In 2006-07, 12.2 per cent of bed days for under-18s were on adult psychiatric wards whereas the figure for 2008-09 was 8.1 per cent. I would like to congratulate strategic health authorities, commissioners, and providers on the progress made.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_194"></a><a name="09071575000207"></a>The bed day figures for under-16s on adult psychiatric wards dropped to zero in Q3 2008-09, meeting the Government&#146;s commitment. However, the latest quarterly figures (January-March 2009) for bed days for under-18 year-olds receiving mental health treatment in England show three instances of under-16 year-olds having been treated on adult psychiatric wards, each for one day only.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_195"></a><a name="09071575000208"></a>It is not acceptable for young people to be put in this situation and those few areas where these latest cases have arisen must take action to prevent this happening again. In all these cases action has been taken to investigate the circumstances leading to an under-16 year-old being placed on an adult psychiatric ward and to press those responsible to put arrangements in place to ensure that in future similar situations are

The appropriate place for vulnerable young children is in an environment which is designed for children and young people. In the case of under-16s our view is that the appropriate place is a CAMHS ward.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_196"></a><a name="09071575000209"></a>To conclude, over the past five years the Government have been committed to improving access for children and young people with mental health problems in universal and specialist settings. What these incidents highlight are the need for continued efforts to improve access to emergency and specialist age appropriate inpatient services for under-18s which are close to young people&#146;s homes, and services to maintain young people in the community when it is safe to do so, following the example in adult services of outreach and crisis teams. The Government remain committed to developing mental health services further.</p>

References to the OPG&#146;s responsibility for the Court of Protection&#146;s administrative functions have been removed, reflecting the move of the Court of Protection from the Office of the Public Guardian to Her Majesty&#146;s Court Service on the 1 April 2009. The document now also reflects the OPG&#146;s new clearer governance arrangements. This now consists of two boards&#151;the statutory Public Guardian Board and the OPG&#146;s Executive Board&#151;following the removal of the OPG Agency Board as a third board in the previous structure.</p>

<a name="09071575000267"></a><b><a name="90715-wms0003.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="09071575000333"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Bach):</b> The Legal Services Commission (LSC) will publish today a response to its consultation, published in February 2009, on prison law funding. The consultation focused on proposals to control the volume and cost of prison law cases and place funding on a sustainable basis for the future. Legal aid expenditure on prison law&#151;which includes advice to prisoners on their treatment, discipline and sentence, and legal representation for parole hearings&#151;has increased from &#163;1 million in 2001-02 to nearly &#163;22 million in 2008-09.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_252"></a><a name="09071575000268"></a>Following consultation, the LSC intends to implement a range of measures from July 2010 to control any further increase in prison law costs. The proposals, which will bring prison law funding arrangements in line with many other areas of legal aid, are:</p>
 a new fee scheme based on fixed and standard fees (amended in response to feedback from legal aid providers); a strengthened eligibility test, coupled with more clarity on the cases the LSC will and will not expect to fund in future; and a new quality requirement, based on 350 hours work annually, to ensure providers have sufficient experience and expertise in prison law. 
<a name="90715-wms0003.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_253"></a><a name="09071575000269"></a>In the light of consultation responses, the LSC has decided to assess the impact of these steps before introducing additional controls on the volume of cases or piloting alternative means of delivering prison law services, such as telephone advice.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_257"></a><a name="09071575000275"></a>It has become apparent in recent months that some local authorities are facing sudden and sharp increases in demand for primary pupil places.

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_263"></a><a name="09071575000282"></a>On 2 April 2009 I announced that the Middlesex Guildhall had been handed over to the Ministry of Justice. I am pleased to be able to report further significant progress on the Supreme Court implementation programme&#151;the programme remains on time and within budget.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_264"></a><a name="09071575000283"></a>First, I have received a written assurance from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, that the Law Lords are satisfied that the refurbished Middlesex Guildhall will meet the needs of the new Supreme Court. The refurbishment has been completed to the highest standards, respecting the heritage of this unique building. This is consistent with both the status of the court and the needs of the Supreme Court justices, court users and the public for modern accessible facilities. On this basis I have now signed the commencement order that will enable the court to come into being on 1 October 2009, as I am satisfied the court will be fully operational by that date.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_265"></a><a name="09071575000284"></a>Lord Phillips has made the rules that will underpin the workings of the court and these have been laid before Parliament. In making the rules Lord Phillips has taken into account his statutory duty to ensure that the rules are both simple and simply expressed and that they have a view to ensuring the court is accessible, fair and efficient. The rules have been widely supported on consultation.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_266"></a><a name="09071575000285"></a>In addition, the responses to public consultation on the fees payable in the court have been analysed. A summary of the responses to consultation and the Government&#146;s proposed way forward have now been published. Consultees were in general agreement with the course proposed, with the exception of fees for devolution cases. While consultees agreed that the fees for devolution cases should be brought into line with civil fees generally, they were concerned that to make this change in one step represented too steep an increase&#151;we have therefore decided to implement this change in stages.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_267"></a><a name="09071575000286"></a>The Fees Order for the court will be laid on this basis.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_268"></a><a name="09071575000287"></a>I previously announced that the anticipated running costs for the UK Supreme Court would be &#163;12.3 million. At present Her Majesty&#146;s Court Service pays &#163;1.2 million pension and national insurance contributions with respect to the Law Lords. For transparency this will be transferred to the UK Supreme Court from 1 October. This does not represent any additional cost to the public purse. For the first year we have provided an additional &#163;300,000 to cover transitional set-up costs, this is being met from within existing resources. The costs of some aspects of the court&#146;s operation, including security, remain to be finalised and so the anticipated running costs will continue to be refined and reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_269"></a><a name="09071575000289"></a>The Government are strongly committed to tackling terrorist finance. Just as there should be no hiding place for those who perpetrate terrorism, so there should be no hiding place for those who finance terrorism.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_270"></a><a name="09071575000290"></a>Global measures to freeze the assets of those suspected of involvement in terrorism are an important tool in suppressing terrorist finance. The global framework for freezing terrorist assets was established by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373, adopted unanimously on 28 September 2001. It is also set out in Special Recommendation III of the Financial Action Task Force, the international standard setting body for anti-money laundering and counter terrorist finance.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_271"></a><a name="09071575000291"></a>The United Kingdom gives effect to its international obligations to freeze terrorist assets through Orders in Council under the United Nations Act 1946. The Government report quarterly to Parliament on the operation of the UK&#146;s terrorist asset-freezing regime.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_272"></a><a name="09071575000292"></a>Consistent with our international obligations, the Government have put in place a robust and effective terrorist asset-freezing regime. As set out in today&#146;s quarterly report to Parliament, as of the end of June 2009, a total of 237 accounts containing &#163;607,661 of suspected terrorist funds were frozen in the UK. As our quarterly reports set out, the UK has an active approach to reviewing cases and to granting exemptions licences to ensure that the asset-freezing regime operates in a fair and proportionate way that is consistent with human rights.</p>

This Order in Council updates the UK&#146;s domestic framework for freezing the assets of suspected terrorists.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_275"></a><a name="09071575000295"></a>The overall objective of the changes is to tailor asset-freezing restrictions to ensure that the prohibitions are focused more closely on areas of genuine operational concern, in particular the access to, control and use of funds by designated persons; and to strengthen and make more explicit safeguards in how the regime is operated where this can be done without compromising its effectiveness.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_276"></a><a name="09071575000296"></a>The main changes set out in the new Order in Council are:</p>
 formally reflecting the Court of Appeal judgment in October last year which struck out the grounds for the Treasury to designate a person when the Treasury has reasonable grounds to suspect that they may be (as opposed to are) involved in terrorism;the introduction of a further safeguard that designations must be necessary for public protection; setting a renewable 12-month time limit on designations;modifying the prohibitions on making funds, economic resources and financial services available for the benefit of a designation person so that they only apply if the designated person obtains, or is able to obtain, a significant financial benefit. The prohibitions on making funds, economic resources and financial available directly to a designated person remain unchanged and are a blanket prohibition; modifying the prohibition on making economic resources available to a designated person by providing a defence for a person if they did not know and had no reasonable cause to suspect that economic resources which they provided to a designated person would be likely to be exchanged or used in exchange for funds, goods or services;modifying reporting provisions to bring obligations on money service businesses into line with other financial institutions; andclarifying and expanding information-gathering powers to ensure that the Treasury is able to request information from designated persons in all cases where this is necessary to ensure effective implementation of and compliance with the asset freeze. 
<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_277"></a><a name="09071575000297"></a>Overall, these changes will improve the operation of the asset-freezing regime, ensure that it remains fair and proportionate and help facilitate effective compliance by ensuring that prohibitions are more tailored and clearer in how they apply. The Terrorism (United Nations Measures) Order will come into effect on 10 August 2009.</p>

A key component of the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan, also published later today, this document sets out the actions we are taking to deliver reductions in transport emissions in line with our obligations under the UK&#146;s carbon budgets to 2022.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_291"></a><a name="09071575000313"></a>It puts us on a path towards a low carbon transport system, giving people and business more low carbon choices about when, where and how to travel or to transport goods.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_292"></a><a name="09071575000314"></a>We have already begun&#151;and will continue&#151;a strong programme of activity to tackle the climate change impact of transport.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_293"></a><a name="09071575000315"></a>In December 2008, we agreed a demanding framework with our European partners for reducing CO2 emissions from new cars. This alone is expected to save 7 million tonnes of CO2 in the UK in 2020. In January 2009, alongside our Statement on Britain&#146;s transport infrastructure, we set a pioneering target to reduce CO2 emissions from UK aviation to below 2005 levels by 2050, in so doing, posing a challenge to the aviation industry to innovate and adopt better fuel efficiency. We have also made securing international agreement to reducing CO2 emissions from aviation and shipping a key priority for the UN talks in Copenhagen at the end of this year.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_294"></a><a name="09071575000316"></a>In April, we made clear our intent to create a flourishing market for ultra-low emissions vehicles in the UK for both consumers and industry. This will be achieved through a combination of support for research

In May we announced that up to &#163;29 million was available for large urban areas across England to bid to become the country&#146;s first sustainable travel city.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_295"></a><a name="09071575000317"></a>In June and July, we announced a range of measures to promote new, greener technology on our roads. Up to 150 low emission and all-electric vans will be introduced to public sector fleets; over 340 ultra-low emissions cars are to be demonstrated around the UK through a &#163;25 million programme delivered by the Technology Strategy Board; and we launched a &#163;30 million scheme to encourage uptake of low emission buses. And on top of our existing commitment of &#163;140 million to support cycling, to improve the integration of greener travel modes, we also announced plans to radically improve station cycle storage at up to 10 major railway stations nationwide.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_296"></a><a name="09071575000318"></a>Alongside today&#146;s document, we confirm our commitment to working with our European partners to develop an ambitious and realistic mechanism to reduce CO2 emissions from new vans. With the freight and logistics industry, we have also launched a working group to develop a consistent carbon measurement and reporting method and standard for the logistics transport supply chain.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_297"></a><a name="09071575000319"></a>Our efforts will not stop here. In the coming weeks we will emphasise the importance of addressing CO2 from transport in the guidance we give to our local and regional partners as they begin to develop new local transport plans and longer-term transport solutions. Finally, we are shortly to announce our plans for further electrification of the rail network.</p>

<a name="90715-wms0004.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_298"></a><a name="09071575000320"></a>The measures set out in strategy will save an additional 85 millions tonnes of CO2 over the third carbon budget period from 2018-22. This strategy is a signal of our determination to build a low carbon future.</p>

The regulations have been updated to take account of the changes made by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 (the 2008 Act), specifically to the definition of embryo and the introduction of human admixed embryos. The regulations themselves do not introduce any new offences or new policy. The regulations are simply being remade in consequence of amendments made by the 2008 Act.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_93"></a><a name="09071576000106"></a>The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 Act prohibits storage of gametes and creating, keeping or using embryos without a licence. This key principle has been retained by changes made by the 2008 Act. There are two exceptions to this that were set out in the 1991 regulations. The same two exceptions have been retained in the updated regulations. The regulations do not remove the requirement for a licence to create or use and embryo.</p>

<a name="90715w0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_94"></a><a name="09071576000107"></a>The first exception relates to the keeping of gametes or embryos in connection with an investigation or proceedings relating to an offence under the 1990 Act. This power to provide for such an exception is set out on the face of the 1990 Act. It refers only to gametes and embryos, not human admixed embryos, so there is no scope for the regulations to provide for this. If such circumstances arose, the human admixed embryos could be kept as evidence at a centre that had a storage licence. It does not alter the principle that no person may create, keep or use a human admixed embryo

<p><a name="wa_stpa_95"></a><a name="09071576000108"></a>Earlier this year the department consulted on four sets of regulations in connection with the implementation of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008. However, the department did not consider it necessary to specifically consult on the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Special Exemption) Regulations 2009 as they do not represent a change in government policy. The changes made to these regulations were consequential to changes in the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008. There was extensive consultation, scrutiny and debate on the changes in the Bill leading to the 2008 Act, which these regulations reflect, during the passage of the Bill itself. However, we do regret that it was necessary to re-lay the draft special exemption regulations. We note the Merits Committee's acknowledgement that the department acted quickly to correct the draft regulations and we will look at any lessons learnt from the laying of these regulations.</p>

This limits the scope of the regulations to make provision in relation to the keeping and examination of gametes and embryos, and not human admixed embryos. It is a criminal offence to keep a human admixed embryo without a licence. If it were necessary for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to keep a human admixed embryo in connection with crime, it would need to be stored at a licensed premise.</p>

The cost of preparing and introducing a Bill is typically borne by several departments and can be difficult to disaggregate from parallel work to develop and implement related government policy. The cost of any given Bill will depend on many different factors, such as, for example, the time spent by civil servants, including Parliamentary Counsel and Ministers across government on developing the Bill as well as associated running costs. As the Civil Service and Ministers do not, in general, work by reference to billable units of time, the collection and disaggregation of that information to make this possible would impose very significant additional burdens on all departments.</p>

The department is now also working with National Health Service London and is in discussion with NHS North East about how best to support the work in that region; and is continuing to support delivery by funding projects that will enable the improved end-to-end services, full IT connectivity, and best practice in the clinical leadership of pathology services that were assumed in the potential savings identified by Lord Carter.

This was one of the principal objectives behind the recent financial restructuring of London and Continental Railways which the European Commission said would &#147;benefit competition and users in view of the forthcoming liberalisation of international passenger transport by rail in 2010&#148;.</p>

<a name="90715w0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_383"></a><a name="09071576000422"></a>Following this financial restructuring, it is the Government's intention, in due course, to sell a long-term concession for High Speed 1. This will incentivise and maximise usage of the line, and encourage the concessionaire to help train operators develop new international services. It will be for the future operator of High Speed 1 to market the railway and to agree terms of access with international train operators. We understand that High Speed 1 has had some preliminary discussions with potential operators.</p>

<a name="90715w0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_384"></a><a name="09071576000423"></a>The Government&#146;s interest in Eurostar is aimed at ensuring that Eurostar can continue to offer attractive service to passengers whilst also being able to compete with expected new train operators on a level playing field in the future. This was also recognised by the Commission in its approval of this support.</p>

<a name="90715w0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_385"></a><a name="09071576000424"></a>High Speed 1 is not the only infrastructure to be used by cross-Channel high-speed trains. The Government maintain their support for the European Commission in promoting policies that ensure the regulatory arrangements and charging structures of the other infrastructure operators do not act as a barrier to competition on Eurostar routes.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_392"></a><a name="09071576000435"></a>The department has already provided a range of tools to help schools make the most effective use of their resources including financial benchmarking, the strategic planning guide, the financial management standard in schools and the offer of a free one-day consultancy visit on improving value for money. The Education Procurement Centre is working with schools to carry out procurement health checks which help to identify where savings can be made. The e-procurement tool OPEN has been developed to help schools buy products online and compare prices of a range of suppliers.</p>

<a name="90715w0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_393"></a><a name="09071576000436"></a>The report supports our position on surplus school balances. It is sound financial management for schools to retain a small surplus from year to year, and revenue funding is intended to support the education of children in school now. It should not be necessary for it to be channelled into capital improvement projects given that separate and substantial capital funding has been made available.</p>

<a name="90715w0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_394"></a><a name="09071576000437"></a>Schools and authorities must work to reduce high balances over the next two years. If total revenue balances and the excessive balances held by individual schools do not reduce substantially by 2010-11, the Government will consult on further action from 2011-12 to bring the total down.</p>

<a name="90715w0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_395"></a><a name="09071576000438"></a>The department provides a reference document called <I>A Guide to the Law for Schools Governors</I> (the guide) to all schools and local authorities to inform them of the legal duties applicable to governing bodies of maintained schools. The guide includes information about the allocation of schools budgets and informs governors that there is a provision in the scheme for financing schools (the scheme) for the local authority to claw back excess surplus budgets. The scheme is issued by their local authority and sets out the financial relationship between the local authority and the maintained schools in their area. The scheme must include a mechanism on how the local authority will control excessive school balances, defined as greater than 5 per cent of the annual budget in secondary schools and 8 per cent in primary and special schools.</p>

<a name="90715w0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_396"></a><a name="09071576000439"></a>In accordance with paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 14 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 (the Act), the local authority must consult all the governing bodies and schools in its area if it proposes to make any revisions to the provision of its scheme.</p>

<a name="90715w0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_397"></a><a name="09071576000440"></a>Additionally we have commenced a survey of local authorities practice and experiences in clawing back and managing surplus balances, in partnership with the Local Government Association and the results of this survey will be used to inform possible further action or guidance.</p>
