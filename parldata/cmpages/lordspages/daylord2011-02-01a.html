Sir Freddie Viggers held the office of Black Rod for less than two years, and yet he is as firmly lodged in the House's affection and esteem as any of his equally accomplished predecessors. That feat alone almost says it all, but with the leave of the House, I will elaborate just a little.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_0"></a><a name="11020130000005"></a>Sir Freddie assumed the office of Black Rod in April 2009 following a distinguished career in the Army. He had served in Bosnia as part of the NATO implementation force in the 1990s and as senior British military representative in Iraq in the immediate aftermath of the conflict there in 2003. In the final years of his career, he was appointed Adjutant General.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="11020130000006"></a>Upon assuming the office of Black Rod he could have rested on his laurels, but that was not his way. Colleagues describe Sir Freddie as full of energy. Better still, he liked to "get things moving", said the Yeoman Usher, in whose lexicon this surely counts as the most fervent of tributes.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="11020130000007"></a>Although he held a grand and historic office, Sir Freddie had time for everyone-Members and staff, senior and junior. To paraphrase, he could walk with the Clerk of the Parliaments and not lose the common touch.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="11020130000008"></a>Sir Freddie's appointment coincided with the establishment of the new Department of Facilities, headed by the Director of Facilities, Carl Woodall. He and Mr Woodall worked closely and effectively to make a success of the new structures. The fact that they can now be taken for granted by his successor will be one of Sir Freddie's lasting legacies to this House.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="11020130000009"></a>I know I speak for the whole House when I say that Sir Freddie's sudden and serious illness last year was a great shock to us all.</p>

<p><a name="st_3"></a>
<a name="11020130000010"></a><b><a name="110201-0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="11020130000214"></a>Noble Lords:</b> Hear, hear.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="11020130000012"></a>Sir Freddie's decision to retire last autumn was no doubt a difficult one to reach. It merits our respect, much as it may be tinged with sadness that such a promising period of service to the House has been cut short. We wish him the very best for his continued recovery.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_6"></a><a name="11020130000013"></a>Your Lordships will be aware that in the months since Sir Freddie was taken ill, the Yeoman Usher, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Lloyd-Jukes, has stepped in to serve tirelessly and effectively as acting Black Rod. Ably supported by the team in Black Rod's Office-Joanne Fuller, Nicola Rivis and Paul Murphy-he took on the challenge of the ceremonies of the opening of Parliament and the State Opening at very short notice, and ensured their success. He also played a major role in ensuring that the visit to Parliament by His Holiness the Pope in September last year, held magnificently in Westminster Hall, was so memorable. He did all this while continuing to perform his own duties as Yeoman Usher and taking part in countless introduction ceremonies for new Peers. We are greatly indebted to him and are in a position to ensure that the new Black Rod-lest he were in any doubt-will have a formidable team at his disposal.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="11020130000014"></a>It only remains for me to welcome Lieutenant General David Leakey to the House, and to reiterate our thanks to the outgoing Black Rod, Sir Freddie Viggers, for the outstanding service that he has given to this House, to its Members and to Parliament as a whole.</p>

<a name="11020130000015"></a><b><a name="110201-0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="11020130000216"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> My Lords, days like this are always a mixture of sadness and pleasure-sadness at taking leave of an excellent servant of your Lordships' House, and pleasure at welcoming a successor who will, I am confident, give service to this House of the same order.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="11020130000016"></a>Before I speak of either the retiring Black Rod or the new Black Rod, I too should like to join the tribute to the acting Black Rod, the Yeoman Usher, who has carried out the duties of Black Rod extremely well in the interim period, which concludes today, and stepped into the breach when circumstances required it. This House has greatly benefited from the way that he picked up the torch and not only got on with the job but did so in a way that was clear, courteous and comprehensive. Of course, he will probably also go down in history as having the world record in introductions. He deserves our warm thanks for all that he has done, and our thanks, too, for carrying it out now, with his interrupted work as an excellent Yeoman Usher.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="11020130000017"></a>Today we formally lose Sir Freddie Viggers as Black Rod. We are all thankful that the medical problems that took him away from your Lordships' House have been addressed. He is, very sensibly, retiring. Following the remarks by the Leader of the House, I want to touch primarily on two points: first, on Sir Freddie's ceremonial duties; and, secondly, his help to this House during the difficult times that we have come through.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="11020130000018"></a>Ceremony is what the public mostly see about the work of Black Rod. Each year-although not this year-with the slow progression to the other House and the striking of the door to the House of Commons, the State Opening of Parliament is a key part of the work of Black Rod. Although Sir Freddie was responsible for just one State Opening of Parliament in his tenure in the role, his enactment of his role and the lead that he gave in the planning and preparation for the 2009 event was entirely in line with the faultless way that such events are carried out in your Lordships' House. That was, of course, my last State Opening as Leader, so for us both it was a very special occasion.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="11020130000019"></a>State Openings are a point in our calendars when the hidden wiring of the way in which these things are done in our country is both more apparent but at the same time entirely unseen. However, they are not the only ceremonial work for Black Rod. In his time in his role, Sir Freddie also organised with precision and great success the visit of Her Majesty the Queen to the Royal Gallery for the unveiling of the bust by Oscar Nemon.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="11020130000020"></a>In that kind of work, Black Rod is visibly in the centre of our ceremonial duties, but Sir Freddie has also been invaluable behind the scenes. This House has had to carry out some difficult duties over the past couple of years, including the suspension of Members of this House. The role of Black Rod is unsung in these matters, and no doubt it needs to remain that way. However, the way in which these things are done if they have to be done-the practicalities and the specifics-is enormously important. The sensitive and considerate way in which they have been done in this House has hugely benefited from the wisdom and the care that Sir Freddie brought to bear upon them.  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1298"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Indeed, across his role, Sir Freddie has brought to the job that impressive and admirable mixture of decisiveness and consideration, courteousness and care, wisdom and judgment, great effort and good humour, not to mention that wonderful twinkling of the eye. The fact that he has done all these things at the same time, and with unfailing cheerfulness, is both astounding and entirely like him.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="11020130000021"></a>He is a very hard act to follow; but I know that the leadership of the House, across all sides of the House, is wholly confident that in Lieutenant General David Leakey we have someone who will rise to that challenge and for whom the House, when it gets to know him, will have an equally warm regard. We welcome him to his new post as Black Rod. We are sad to let his predecessor go, but the House has, and will, benefit from the services of both.</p>

I endorse everything that has been said by my noble friend Lord Strathclyde, the Leader of the House, and the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon. Despite the many differences that have surfaced during the past few weeks, there is unanimity in your Lordships' House about our feelings for Sir Freddie. It is tragic that such a promising start to his role as Black Rod should be cut short by his illness. We wish him a speedy recovery so that he can enjoy his retirement for years to come.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="11020130000023"></a>Sir Freddie and I had one thing in common: both of us were often vertically challenged. However, hand on heart, I can say that, unlike many noble Lords, we could chat face to face. Although he performed ceremonial duties, he reflected a warm and friendly personality and a great sense of humour.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="11020130000024"></a>We take many issues for granted, including the sense of security felt by Members of your Lordships' House. Sir Freddie not only built sound relationships with the Serjeant at Arms and the Metropolitan Police but he also negotiated the security contract. We thank him for that. Sir Freddie also helped to resolve matters relating to parliamentary passes for MEPs and more liberal filming guidelines. We thank him for his service and he will long remain a friend to many of us for years to come.</p>

The sad business is saying goodbye to Sir Freddie Viggers who, in a relatively short span of time, endeared himself to us all. His cheery, smiling presence along the corridors, always good tempered and ready for a chat, quickly made him very popular with all of us. That brought added burdens, as we all felt that we could talk to him-we did so, sometimes at great length-and he never forgot the smallest query. All too often, he would pop his head round my office corner to tell me that he had arranged a pass in double-quick time or magicked seats for unexpected visitors or even bent the rules ever so slightly to allow refreshments in the Moses Room.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="11020130000027"></a>We now have an entirely happy story: the Yeoman Usher, who was catapulted into the Black Rodship, has done such a wonderful job. Utterly conscientious, always there, and undertaking hefty responsibilities, such as the last State Opening, apparently in his stride and with the greatest success. I understand that he spent several years as a logistics expert. In my small experience, logistics really means getting the right people, with the right stuff, to the right place at the right time. I certainly think he excelled in doing that in this House.</p>

To these three, and most of all to Ted, I offer my profound thanks on behalf of the Cross Benches and so hope that Ted can now relax and enjoy some untrammeled leisure.</p>

The time and effort he took over that was quite remarkable: patient, quality time with those about to go through their introduction. In my case, that was only three days before State Opening and the illness which struck him down. You would have thought that he had nothing on his mind about security or parliamentary procedures as he gave time to a neophyte bishop. We are all in his very considerable debt.</p>

I know that all the staff, be they cleaners or noble and gallant Lords, experienced that quality. I did not believe, after he was so tragically taken ill, that that would continue, but Ted Lloyd-Jukes continued that high standard. In welcoming his successor, I say that it will be a hard act to follow but I am certain that that can be achieved. To Sir Freddie and Ted, all the best for the future.</p>

I worked very closely with him on issues of security. What made that such a pleasure, even in the most difficult times, was that, from the moment he entered the House, he showed not only a deep affection for the House but an understanding of the need to balance his responsibilities for the safety of everybody on the Parliamentary Estate with Parliament's own commitment to keeping the institution open and accessible to the public whom we serve. It was because he understood those two dynamics that he was so exceptionally good at his job. Of course, like others, I wish him and Jane well and very much hope that we may have the opportunity to welcome him into the House again to say some personal and more informal thanks to him.</p>

Is there not something lacking when we cannot take firmer or more positive action in a bank in which we have 83 per cent of the shareholding? Does it not give the green light to the banks to carry on in the same way, while innocent people are losing their jobs because of the folly of the bankers, who are seen to be very close friends of this Government?

We remain confident that police forces can make the necessary savings through reductions in middle and back office functions, while retaining and enhancing their ability to protect and serve the public, with a particular focus on maintaining the front line.</p>

Can the Minister give the House an assurance that none of the approximately 2,000 full-time police officers already lost since the election was involved in those front-line police services?

I did not say there was no link; I said there was no simple link. It is very clear that there is no simple link. Numbers of police officers began to decline before this Government came into office and the level of crime continues to decline.

<a name="11020130000099"></a><b><a name="110201-0001.htm_spnew69"></a><a name="11020130000289"></a>Lord Rooker:</b> This is the first amendment I have moved on this Bill this year, for those who keep count of our proceedings. I kept clear of amendments relating to Part 2 of the Bill. I will not be long in speaking to this amendment. Neither the Electoral Commission nor anyone else, for that matter, has ever carried out an exercise across the United Kingdom to explain officially the mechanics of voting systems, whatever they may be. In this case, they are the alternative vote as proposed in the Bill and first past the post.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="11020130000100"></a>The Electoral Commission might decide to explain about the alternative vote and might need to indicate that there are at least three alternative vote systems, none of which is proportional. It might decide that it has to counteract the media referring to the alternative vote inaccurately-as, indeed, we in this House have agreed that the Deputy Prime Minister did when referring to it as a system guaranteeing that MPs would be elected by 50 per cent of the electorate, which of course is not what will happen under AV in the Bill. That simply cannot happen in every case.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="11020130000101"></a>It is true that I tabled this amendment a long time ago and that a lot of water has gone under the bridge. My noble friend Lord Lipsey has two amendments of substance in this group. My simple view is that it should not be left to the complete discretion of the Electoral Commission as to whether or what information it puts into the public domain. There should be some kind of constraint in the Bill, hence the modesty of my amendment and, indeed, the amendments of substance which my noble friend has tabled. He will go into those in much greater detail than I intend to do. I intend to be brief.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="11020130000102"></a>As I have said, I wanted to raise the issue about the discretion of the Electoral Commission over this enterprise which, I repeat, no official body has ever undertaken in the United Kingdom. It is fraught with some difficulty and, in some ways, excitement, as the project has never been undertaken. However, it is one where we in Parliament should say that the Bill should have a little more detail, rather than simply leaving it to whatever steps the commission might think are appropriate or inappropriate. I beg to move.</p>

Quite recently, although it actually feels like months ago, these matters came up at a reasonably early stage of the Committee, when the Minister jumped to his feet and said that they fell much more naturally to being discussed under Schedule 1 to the Bill. I do not know whether the Minister-he is not with us this afternoon-hoped then that by the time we got around to Schedule 1, we would have forgotten all about them and let them go. As the Committee knows, on this Bill we are, quite rightly, grinding extremely fine so here they are again.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="11020130000105"></a>The amendments concern the steps that the Electoral Commission must take to get the electorate informed. Perhaps I might recap on a debate that we were having  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1311"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1311</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>last night. The background to this is the very wide lack of understanding of the alternatives to be put before the British people in the referendum, whenever that may come. I illustrate this from a poll with a large sample taken by YouGov in September. It asked people whether they had heard of AV and, if so, whether they knew what it meant. To summarise, one-third said that they had heard of AV and had some idea of what it meant. They did not define what "some idea" meant and, if they were examined further, we might find that that was a rather optimistic interpretation of their true state of knowledge. One-third had heard of AV but had no idea of what it meant. One-third had not heard of AV; they also had no idea of what it meant, which is perhaps not surprising since they had never heard of it. That is a long way from where we would want to be when we get around to the referendum.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="11020130000106"></a>I am not using this to make a speech for AV or against it. My position is perfectly well known. I simply make the point that the better informed those participating in this referendum are, when it comes about, the more the result will have legitimacy and stability, because we will be able to have confidence that the people really have reached the verdict they wish to reach, on reflection, and that chance factors have not simply swayed it. This is not the job of the Electoral Commission only; it is the job of the campaign organisations on both sides, of our national media-I thought I might get a laugh for that-of politicians and of those who are not political in the party sense but who are interested in politics.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="11020130000107"></a>These are great issues for our future as a democracy and all those have a role to play, but the Electoral Commission has a role. It has been created to play a role and it is right that Parliament should give it some specific guidance on the minimum activity which we expect it to undertake in playing that role. If the referendum were to go ahead on 5 May-and I know there are those in this Committee and the government Front Benches who support that-there will be only some 10 weeks between the passage of the legislation and the day when the people deliver their verdict.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="11020130000108"></a>My two amendments are straightforward. First, they ask that the Electoral Commission prepares a leaflet that summarises the meaning of the question before people and what its implications would be. It summarises, in an impartial way-because the Electoral Commission owes its whole role to its impartiality-the arguments for and against AV and for and against first past the post, so that any elector wishing to study the matter can see a short summary of the arguments. That is then distributed to every household in the country so that everybody gets their chance to read it. A fairly straightforward proposition, you would think.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="11020130000109"></a>The second amendment is slightly tongue in cheek and says that the leaflet should be examined by the Plain English Campaign. Actually, from my own experience as a journalist on the <I>Economist</I>, I think that an <I>Economist</I> journalist would be an alternative because these are both groups of people who are very used to making sure that the language in which complicated ideas are expressed in order to communicate is clear. It is a serious purpose behind a tongue-in-cheek amendment because the number of people who have a

The number of people who understand the issues involved on voting reform is also quite small. To produce language which is generally comprehensible is quite complicated.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="11020130000110"></a>I know the Electoral Commission tries hard to get its language right. Indeed, it is contemplating producing a consultative document on a public information booklet-not exactly a leaflet but a booklet on the referendum. I have not studied it in detail but it is the kind of thing which could be done with an examination not just for the content but for the clarity of the language in which it is expressed.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="11020130000111"></a>It is perfectly true that there is this draft booklet; it is true that the Electoral Commission is of course planning information activities, and it would be wrong to suggest otherwise. But we, as parliamentarians, have a right to expect certain things of the Electoral Commission and to lay down in the Bill that it must perform certain functions. This is all going to be done in a terrific rush, and the commission may get into some sort of difficulty, as its resources are not very great for the task ahead of it, so something has to be dumped. If it is in the Bill, the thing that is dumped cannot be the exercise it mounts to make sure that the public are properly informed. In other words, it is right that the intention of the commission be underlined by Parliament and by provisions of the kind that I propose in this amendment, which is a companion amendment to the wider amendment so ably moved by my noble friend Lord Rooker.</p>

We have a costing for this referendum. It is not nil but some of us think that it is well worth it. Democracy comes with a price and it is a price that is very well worth paying. On an issue of this magnitude, the relatively small figures that would be involved in an exercise of this kind are part of that worthwhile price. </p>

That is a costly exercise by any stretch of the imagination.

On the latter point, these are not alternatives; they are designed to supplement each other, but a leaflet that can be studied at leisure and revisited has a different impact from that of a television programme, although I agree that they are complementary. As far as cost is concerned, we need to keep a sense of proportion. After all, every household gets a poll card. Nobody thinks, "Oh God, it is so expensive sending these poll cards. People don't need them to vote. Elections are so unimportant that we could avoid the cost of a poll card in future". Indeed, I believe that electoral law provides for the political parties to send one leaflet to every household in the country. The noble Lord, who knows much more about the House of Commons than I have ever known, will correct me if I am wrong but I believe that also takes place. We should not think that sending a leaflet to every household would mean great disproportionate expenditure. It is not a major logistical exercise of its kind and will not cause the budget deficit to soar where otherwise it would shrink.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="11020130000119"></a>On the previous exchange, which I had not expected, I am entirely on the side of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, because I am aware that there are endless examples of requirements or practices that ensure that information is delivered to all households in the country. I guess that the latest such example is the widespread circulation of leaflets on how to avoid flu during the winter, but there have certainly been electoral examples as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="11020130000120"></a>On the amendments, my feelings are mixed. I half sympathise with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker; I am worried about the first amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey-for reasons that I will come back to-but I support his second amendment very strongly because, whatever materials are produced, it would be helpful if they were looked over by someone who writes the kind of English that everybody can understand. One of our latest arrivals, the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, will recognise from our association some 30 years ago that I used to be driven to distraction by social security material being produced in a form that no normal person could understand. I seem to remember that we got the Plain English Campaign involved to try to help us improve things, and I think that they have improved. Some effort needs to be put into making sure that whatever goes out uses terms that can be understood.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="11020130000124"></a>I think that we need to rely on the good faith of the Electoral Commission, which clearly seeks to do everything in an unbiased and impartial way, but making that a statutory requirement would raise a lot of questions that we might not want to answer.</p>

If my memory serves me correctly, the last time that I discussed the matter with the Electoral Commission, it was talking about preparing a leaflet or pamphlet on this very issue. I think that the same issue came up on Second Reading, too. The difficulty is ensuring that the leaflet is right and unbiased. I phoned the Electoral Commission this morning to find out the latest position and, perhaps slightly worryingly, both the numbers that I normally use and get through on without any trouble were unobtainable. I am sure that there is a very good explanation and that I will be able to get through soon, but that means that I cannot tell the House where the Electoral Commission is up to on this important issue.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="11020130000126"></a>The amendments from the noble Lords, Lord Lipsey and Lord Rooker, spell out the right principle that we need material that says, in plain English, what an alternative voting slip will look like and so on. However, as soon as we get into explaining how the system works, we are in much more difficulty. It is very hard to write a leaflet on how a voting system works-particularly how it works in comparison to an existing system-without getting into a minefield of problems about possible outcomes or computations of the effect of one's vote. There is a lot in Amendment 109A, in the name of my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer, that if we are to go down this road, having the Speaker's committee involved in the Electoral Commission would be a good idea to provide some political insight. Otherwise, I can envisage that the leaflet that might come out could produce literally thousands of phone calls from political parties and their agents up and down the land saying, "This is biased". That is only a short step away from the courts. The same point might be made about the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury-we would get into an absolute minefield.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="11020130000127"></a>I hope that the Government will give this serious thought.

However, if we are to go down the road of requiring rather more detail on the effect, we have to look much more carefully at Amendment 109A in the name of my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer, which would at least provide for some political control. Without that, the Electoral Commission will, frankly, be hung out to dry and probably crucified as well.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="11020130000128"></a>I hope that the Government will give this important issue careful thought, given that, as my noble friend Lord Lipsey said, we have done so little on this and the changes will all come very suddenly. We must make a major effort to convey to the public the importance of this vote. On that point, my noble friend Lord Lipsey is absolutely right. The problem is what should be put into or left out of the leaflet.</p>

If all goes well-I nearly said "according to plan" but that would be giving a hostage to fortune-and the Bill gets through in time for the referendum to be held in May, there will be no time to lose. I think that every Member of the House concurs with the spirit that, if we are to have a referendum, we should ensure that it works as well as it possibly can and that as many as possible of our fellow countrymen and women take part in it.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="11020130000130"></a>I agree wholly with the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, which would remove the discretion by simply obliging the Electoral Commission to provide information about each of the two voting systems. If the Government accept Amendment 108 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, the first provision in Amendment 110ZZA, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, would be superfluous.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="11020130000131"></a>On the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Newton-he cast a fly in my direction, at which I leapt-micro legislation is indeed food for lawyers and I am all agin it. However, I consider that the more dangerous provision in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, in terms of "lawyerisation", is its second provision, which would require that the leaflet,</p>
<ul><a name="11020130000190"></a>"summarise the main arguments for and against first-pass-the-post and the alternative vote".</ul>
<p><a name="11020130000181"></a>There is much more room for lawyers to haggle over that before Her Majesty's courts than there is over the "impartial and unbiased" provision. However, I suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, should sleep on his amendment, given that its only essential provision-that is, the distribution to all households-should be taken care of by the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. If the Electoral Commission is required to provide information about each of the two systems, surely that means delivery of information to every house. If there is any doubt about that, a change can be brought forward at the next stage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="11020130000132"></a>I sympathise with the noble Lord, Lord Soley, because I did exactly as he did and had the same rather ghostly result. I tried three Electoral Commission numbers, which were all disconnected. However, I was informed a week ago by the commission that it is not disconnected and that it will definitely produce a leaflet that will be delivered to every household, so perhaps we can sleep soundly on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="11020130000144"></a>I very much support both my noble friends Lord Rooker and Lord Lipsey in the amendments they put forward and the initiatives they have taken, although I have a number of reservations about the wording of one amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, which I shall come to in a moment. I think they must have had the same reaction as I did when I read the Bill. There is a rather marked antithesis, and a slightly disturbing one, between paragraph 9(1) of Schedule 1:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1"></a><a name="11020130000187"></a>"The Electoral Commission must take whatever steps they think appropriate to promote public awareness about the referendum and how to vote in it",</p>

<p><a name="11020130000145"></a>and paragraph 9(2), which then states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="11020130000188"></a>"The Electoral Commission may take whatever steps they think appropriate to provide, for persons entitled to vote in the referendum, information about each of the two voting systems referred to in the referendum question".</p>

<p><a name="11020130000182"></a>Particularly coming straight after "must", "may" reads very weakly-it seems almost a sort of casual afterthought-and I do not think that is good enough. If we are to have a referendum in this country on quite a complex new constitutional issue, it is absolutely essential that members of the public have the opportunity to understand what it is all about. I therefore think it very reasonable that we should say "must" in paragraph 9(2) which, of course, is the effect of the amendment of my noble friend Lord Rooker.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="11020130000146"></a>I very much agree with my noble friend Lord Lipsey that it is right to produce a pamphlet on the subject. As one of his own amendments states, the information effort should include the publication of a pamphlet and does not exclude other things. I hope that the Electoral Commission will have a budget which can indeed be used, as the noble Lord, Lord Martin, has suggested, for television coverage of the issue as well, or even possibly local radio, as he suggested. That is highly desirable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="11020130000147"></a>I have to say, however, that my breath was slightly taken away by the phrase in the third sentence of my noble friend Lord Lipsey's Amendment 110ZZA:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="11020130000189"></a>"The leaflet shall be impartial and unbiased".</p>

<p><a name="11020130000183"></a>I found myself reading that two or three times and thinking carefully whether a leaflet could be "impartial and unbiased"-indeed, whether any opinion of this kind could be "impartial and unbiased". Of course, as a practical issue, we regularly expect certain people and certain functions to be impartial and unbiased-judges and juries would be an obvious example. However, they are being impartial and unbiased in relation to the establishment of a fact: whether so-and-so killed

I was hoping I was going to be the first in the debate to raise those particular solutions. However, he is perfectly right and I think, before the House accepts the words that would actually go in the Bill, it needs to think very carefully about putting a responsibility on any human being or set of human beings to produce an opinion on something which is impartial and unbiased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="11020130000150"></a>The House could have an interesting philosophical discussion about this during the afternoon. It might be a slightly esoteric discussion for a legislative assembly, but it would be intellectually stimulating. I do not intend to go into it for very long. Perhaps it would be fair to summarise, in a way that nobody will want to disagree with, that there are two strands of post-Enlightenment philosophy, the positivist and the anti-positivist. The anti-positivist tradition of Hegel and Heidegger-the post-modernists-would say that there is no such thing as objective reality, that no one's opinion is ever better than anybody else's and that you cannot meaningfully suggest that it is. That would dispense altogether with the idea of producing this definitive, impartial and unbiased opinion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="11020130000151"></a>Those in the positivist tradition would say that there is such a thing as objective reality and that one can apprehend it through sense impressions, so that it would be perfectly possible to say, if one were making a statement of fact, that it is impartial and unbiased. This is also the case with analytic statements that are true by definition: they, too, could be made impartially and in an unbiased fashion. However, it would be quite unreasonable to suggest that a normative statement-for example, about the strengths and weaknesses of a particular voting system-could ever be stated in a way that could be described as impartial or unbiased.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="11020130000152"></a>Leaving aside philosophy and turning to practical politics, I cannot imagine that anybody in the highly charged political debate over this referendum would ever credit the other side with a statement that they regarded as impartial and unbiased. If they disagreed with anything in a summary of the case for or against produced by the Electoral Commission or any other body, they would certainly denounce it as not being impartial or unbiased. That would tend to discredit the Electoral Commission if it was the originator of that summary or opinion. That is why I come back to

That seems to me to be a statement of fact: is that something that he would recommend for a leaflet?</p>

Of course, the way that a fact is stated immediately opens the author of the document to the charge that he or she has been selective and could equally well have set out the facts in an equally amusing or effective way that brought fire to bear on the other side of the question. My noble friend summarises brilliantly exactly the problems that will be encountered by anybody, however honest a man or woman he or she is, who sets out to produce something that will be characterised by the law of the land-by statute-as impartial and unbiased. That is probably asking something that no human being can do. None of us could produce an opinion that was genuinely unbiased and impartial. It is philosophically impossible and practically impossible in any political argument.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="11020130000156"></a>Therefore, while I totally agree with what my noble friend Lord Lipsey says, Parliament needs to place an obligation on the Electoral Commission to ensure that the public are properly informed about the choice that they must make, and about the characteristics of the two electoral systems. It is absolutely crucial that the Electoral Commission itself does not in any way risk its own credibility and integrity by putting its name to such a document. The suggestion that the Electoral Commission should distribute documents by the two campaigns would be a much better one as a result.</p>

I did not mean to interrupt him. I thought that he had got to the end of his remarks. Indeed, I am extremely grateful that he continued because I thought that, before he moved to the outer reaches of philosophy, he made a very strong point when he referred to the sharp antithesis between "must" and "may" in the clause. I thought that that point lent considerable additional weight to Amendment 108,

I got a bit more worried as the speech by the noble Lord, Lord Davies, continued because I was getting a message from my BrailleNote here that the battery was about to run out. I think there is just enough left for me to say that I rise briefly in support of this group of amendments. Amendment 109 is in my name and is substantially to the same effect as Amendment 108, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. Both require the Electoral Commission to provide information about each of the voting systems referred to in the referendum question. In conjunction with Amendment 110, which we discussed last night, these amendments place on the Electoral Commission a duty to take steps to ensure that disabled voters are able to access information and support to facilitate their understanding and participation in voting and elections.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="11020130000158"></a>I also welcome Amendment 110ZZA, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. All I would say is that steps need to be taken to ensure that the leaflet referred to in the amendment is made accessible to people who have difficulty in reading print. For example, the leaflet would need to advertise on it-in at least 14-point type, I would hope-the availability of other formats such as large print, Braille and audio, and a number to call to request these formats. Furthermore, alternative formats would have to be available at the same time as the print version, otherwise people who cannot read print would be put at a disadvantage compared to those who are able to read the printed leaflet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="11020130000159"></a>On Amendment 110ZZB, the requirement to seek the advice of the Plain English Campaign on information materials, although it might strike a blow at the legal profession, seems a sensible suggestion considering the complexity of explaining the rival voting systems and it could certainly help in making the material accessible to people with learning disabilities, who may have need of an EasyRead version. Therefore I support all the amendments in this group.</p>

My concept was that the individual elector would provide his or her own synthesis from the materials provided by the two campaigns. I totally agree with my noble friend, from a practical standpoint, that my suggestion will not work unless there are two clear campaigns run by some accepted umbrella organisation. It would, of course, be for the Electoral Commission to satisfy itself that those two campaigns were generally national umbrella organisations, accepted by all the groups within each particular side of the campaign. That worked in 1975, as my noble friend, who was also alive at the time, will recall, but it would not work if there were just a whole lot of different groups and multifarious and multifaceted voices of various kinds on both sides. That would be a very untidy and very difficult campaign. I hope that the rather more clear-cut choice, which the public were offered in 1975 on another important constitutional issue, could be replicated. It would be for the Electoral Commission to decide that point.</p>

I can imagine, on the other hand, a whole series of problems because if there were to be an umbrella organisation against the alternative vote,

There would be a great variety of views in that. To have a legitimate group on either side of the argument will prove extraordinarily difficult. Let us assume that eventually one can fund a group, an umbrella organisation, on both sides. Clearly, some of the arguments are likely to be omitted, hence the reason for the Electoral Commission to vet those drafts which have been put out by the other organisations. In seeking to be impartial, in seeking to reconcile and in seeking to bridge that gap and to be a Marxist synthesis following Hegel and Heidegger, clearly the Electoral Commission itself may have to play that role and seek to put forward a more objective middle way to the two groups if they can be found to work together.</p>

I do not doubt that it always welcomes the advice of my noble friend Lord Soley, but none the less, every now and again, it needs a respite. That is why I tend to favour Amendment 109 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston. He said that the words of his amendment are largely to the same effect as those of the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Rooker, but there is an important distinction. The noble Lord's amendment would not take out the words that the Electoral Commission,</p>
<ul><a name="11020130000191"></a>"may take whatever steps they think appropriate to".</ul>
<p><a name="11020130000184"></a>My noble friend Lord Rooker's amendment leads to the more prescriptive approach embodied in the amendment of my noble friend Lord Lipsey. I tend to side with the noble Lord, Lord Newton, on this: it may be wise to give a pretty large discretion to the Electoral Commission as to how it handles the matter.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="11020130000171"></a>In a way, the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Lipsey demonstrates the difficulty for the Electoral Commission in performing what would seem a pretty simple function of providing information to those who will be about to vote in the referendum. For example, we have already discussed the requirement in my noble friend Lord Lipsey's amendment that it should,</p>
<ul><a name="11020130000192"></a>"summarise the main arguments for and against first-past-the-post and the alternative vote".</ul>
<p><a name="11020130000185"></a>My noble friend Lord Davies of Stamford explained in some depth the reasons why that is not easy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="11020130000172"></a>Unlike my noble friends Lord Davies and Lord Anderson, I think it would be desirable to have a phase of information and education to enable electors, as far as possible, to understand from impartial sources the nature of the choice that they will be invited to make. Later, we get into the propaganda war and the clash of the campaigns. At that point, if people have been provided with neutral information, they may well be better able to assess for themselves the merits of the arguments put forward by the two sides in the campaign.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="11020130000173"></a>It is desirable that something such as my noble friend Lord Lipsey proposes should be achieved, but I do not doubt that it is exceedingly difficult to summarise those arguments objectively and in an "impartial and unbiased" fashion, as the amendment requires. If it is to be done, it will take time. That is one reason why it is so fortunate that the Committee previously accepted

As other noble Lords have said, if we are going to do this, we need to do it properly. It is too good an opportunity to waste. It is too important an issue to be rushed and muddled. If people are, in an extraordinarily rare opportunity, to have the chance to decide whether the existing electoral system should be retained or another put in its place, they need time to reflect carefully on the basis of a secure understanding of the issues. I think that it will be very difficult for that process of information, education and the gaining of understanding to be achieved in the very short interval that now remains before 5 May.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="11020130000174"></a>Also, if the arguments are to be set forth by the Electoral Commission in an impartial and unbiased way, as has been suggested earlier, there is the risk that people who are dissatisfied with the way in which the arguments on one side or another are set out will complain and might seek remedy by way of judicial review. The whole process could become very vexed. My noble friend's amendment demonstrates the extreme difficulty of the Electoral Commission doing that job but, none the less, it is a job that it would be good if it were done.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="11020130000175"></a>Another difficulty about achieving an impartial and unbiased explanation of the choices to be made is that academic evidence shows that the more people understand about the alternative vote system of election, the less they like it. If you have full information explaining how this system works, the consequence is that people become disposed to reject such a system. It might be claimed that in no circumstances could the explanation be regarded as unbiased. It is riddled with difficulties the more we think about it. There certainly should be unbiased information and clarity in the way the information is provided. These are highly desirable objectives. I do not know whether before tabling his second amendment, Amendment 110ZZB, my noble friend discovered whether the Plain English Campaign is willing to be co-opted, but I am sure it is because it has been a very good servant of us all, including benefits claimants.</p>

You could not get a more educated electorate than the one we have here. There were 603 Peers eligible to vote and 423 voted. There were 82 candidates. The successful candidate was chosen after the 42nd transfer of votes or recount, and I am told that one Peer voted from one to 82. I have no doubt that number 1 was a great friend of his, but I do not think 82 was a particular friend. I think that would be the best way to educate the public.</p>

It is given a discretion about whether it attempts to summarise the arguments on both sides. The reason it is given a discretion is because whether and to what extent it should inform people on those controversial matters depends on how much other information people are going to receive on both sides.

There was a meeting here two months ago in Committee Room 4, and Members from across the House attended that meeting with representatives from the Electoral Commission. During the course of the meeting it became very clear that they will do everything possible to avoid being involved in the actual debate that takes place. With that in mind, some of us are very worried about whether at some stage the public are going to be given factual information as to what the referendum is all about. That is a genuine worry. I am in favour of the referendum and I am in favour of electoral reform, but I am concerned because the debate will become very heated and, to put it bluntly, lots of lies will be told. Millions of leaflets will be sent out that, on both sides, will not reveal the truth. Someone, somewhere, has to set out the basis on which the referendum is taking place, the truth about the question, and its implications.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="11020132000013"></a>There is an additional problem, and that is that not every household in the country will receive yes and no leaflets. There will be large tracts of the United Kingdom where no leaflets at all will be dropped because the organisers of the campaigns will simply not have the resources to do that. In those circumstances-I understand that the Electoral Commission has already agreed that a leaflet will be going out-a leaflet has to be sent. My question is this: what will be in that leaflet?</p>

Does he not accept that it will not be just one leaflet because there need to be leaflets to explain this in Punjabi, Gujarati, Urdu, Mandarin Chinese and a whole range of languages, and particularly that there will need to be one in Welsh? He will remember that the noble Lord, Elystan-Morgan, said that the translation of the question came out as something like, "Do you believe in God or would you prefer a daffodil?". Somebody has got to explain it.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="11020132000018"></a>I go further than most Members who have intervened in the debate in terms of the information that I believe should be included in the leaflet. First, it should be set out by the Electoral Commission where it is used. My noble friend Lord Grocott intervened to pose the important question of where AV is used, and the public need to know. Secondly, the public need to be informed that it is not a proportional representation system. There will be a great deal of misrepresentation during the course of the campaign about whether or not this is PR. It is not proportional representation and the Electoral Commission should make that clear. Thirdly, there will be a great deal of misrepresentation over the proportion of the electorate that a candidate is required to have to secure election-in other words, the argument about 50 per cent. Leaflets which refer to the 50 per cent are already being distributed and politicians are going on television stating that there is a 50 per cent requirement. Indeed, Jane Kennedy, a former Member of the other House, has recently written to a number of people in the no campaign drawing attention to inaccurate information which has been put out by the yes campaign. This is only the start; how much more difficult will it get?</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="11020132000019"></a>There is a need to draw a distinction between the different AV systems because, with the media targeting the debate during the course of the campaign-as they inevitably will-they will draw on the distinctions between the three systems of AV, to which I have referred in previous debates. The Electoral Commission should make it clear exactly which one is being adopted but refer to the other two-one of which is the system used for the election of mayors in the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="11020132000020"></a>The Electoral Commission should also point in its leaflet to the relevance of the need to use all preferences during the course of the ballot that takes place under AV-again I refer to the distinction between the Australian Queensland system and the conventional system used in Australia in federal elections-and that can be done in fairly simple language.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="11020132000021"></a>It also needs to be pointed out-this is far more argumentative-that AV does not necessarily lead to coalitions. Factually, it does not necessarily lead to coalitions, and yet the no campaign is arguing that coalitions are the inevitable consequence of the introduction of the alternative vote. That is not the case. It does lead to coalitions in certain circumstances but not in others. There are many issues which my noble friend Lord Davies would argue indicate an element of bias but which I believe should be factually placed before the electorate to enable them to take a proper decision.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="11020132000022"></a>Finally, I return to the timing of the referendum, an issue we debated last night. One of my fears is what will happen to the leaflets during the course of the referendum. If the referendum was held on a separate  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1328"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1328</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>date, referendum leaflets would go through letter boxes all over the country. As it is, because the referendum is to take place on the same day as elections in various parts of the United Kingdom, referendum leaflets will be mixed with election leaflets and many will go in the bin. I am very sorry, but that is the case. Again I say to the Liberal Democrats that they have chosen the wrong date and, even at this late stage, they should revisit the decisions they have taken on these matters and which they have forced upon the coalition.</p>

<p><a name="11020131000051"></a>and insert "must", but I am worried about the preparation of the leaflets. As I mentioned in my previous intervention, Amendment 110ZZA would provide that,</p>
<ul><a name="11020131000058"></a>"The leaflet shall be distributed, so far as is practicable, to all households in the United Kingdom".</ul>
<p><a name="11020131000052"></a>When I asked, no one had put a price on such a project, although it would be a very costly project indeed. Although I have always taken advice from the noble Lord, Lord Newton-in another place, he was Leader of the House, and a very good Leader at that-I must advise him that those health leaflets did not come through in Scotland, possibly because of the devolved arrangements. I do not know whether such leaflets would have gone out under the auspices of the local health board or of a government department, but I worry about legislating that a specific body-namely, the Electoral Commission-publish leaflets and distribute them to every household in the land. That is a tall order for the Electoral Commission. With great respect, some Members of this House do not know just how big or small the Electoral Commission is. There is a limit to its resources.</p>

We all had supporters who spent hours writing out these things and delivering them to the Post Office. Even now, the Post Office has a universal delivery obligation. All the Government has to do is pay for the production of enough leaflets, give them to the Post Office and say, "Get on with it".</p>

That would be a tall order, although it would be a good contract in these days when there is competition. In the old days, a Member of Parliament got free postage from the Royal Mail. However, the Royal Mail now has competitors that will say, "No, we want to do that job". Therefore, the Electoral Commission will have to ensure that it is even-handed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="11020131000026"></a>My experience with the Electoral Commission was that, as Speaker, I had the duty of chairing the overseeing body known as the Speaker's committee. One of our biggest worries-this is why I am concerned about  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1329"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bringing this into legislation-was that the commission wanted to bite off far more than it could chew. For example, although in the days that we have spent debating this Bill noble Lords have spoken with great passion about the fairness of the Boundary Commission's appeals process, we previously had to stop Ministers handing over responsibility for the Boundary Commission to the Electoral Commission, as desired by its then chairman, Mr Younger. I had to say to Ministers, including the Secretary of State for Scotland, "Look, they cannot cope with that work". The commission wanted to provide seminars to train electoral officers that would have involved using a training pack that was copyrighted by an outside organisation, so the cost to taxpayers would have been quite substantial. In other words, the Electoral Commission's enthusiasm had to be curbed.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="11020131000027"></a>If the amendment is included in the legislation so that the Electoral Commission "must" do these things, the commission would have the responsibility not only for printing the leaflet and worrying about whether it might be subject to a legal challenge but for distributing the leaflet. Whether free post is given by the Royal Mail or any other organisation, the distributor will want to be paid for delivering the leaflets. Between now and 1 May, the Government would have to find out from the Electoral Commission what the bill would be. If the Government were not prepared to pay that bill, that would be another terrible strain on the Electoral Commission.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="11020131000028"></a>Given all its responsibilities-and all those that it has been curbed from taking on-I do not think the Electoral Commission could cope with publishing and distributing the leaflet. Although the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, has pointed out that everyone gets a polling card, the point about that is that the returning officer-usually, the chief executive or legal officer of the local authority-has a responsibility for ensuring that the polling card is put through the door. Obviously, every Member of Parliament gets a different polling card that is distributed by different returning officers. The point is that the burden of delivering polling cards is spread across every local authority in the United Kingdom. If we consolidate the distribution of the leaflet so that it becomes the responsibility of one organisation, I do not think that the organisation will be able to cope.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="11020131000029"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, would allow the Electoral Commission to provide information by other means. Instead of a leaflet, the famous laptops that young people use could provide the information, or it could be by means of local or national radio or television. That is my worry about the amendment.</p>

There will not be any Hegel in my remarks, but there might be some of the Krankies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="11020131000031"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, that this should not be a partisan issue. Looking at the paragraph as currently drafted in the Bill, I think that there is a need for greater reflection on how the mechanics of the referendum campaign will be organised. There has been a lot of reference to the setting up of umbrella organisations. These umbrella organisations often do not take into account people who are experienced in the day-to-day work of informing people of choices in an election. I well remember that the 1979 referendum-liked this one-involved an extremely rushed campaign. The noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, in his great wisdom and experience, made the important point that we are talking about a referendum that will be in three months time this week.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="11020131000032"></a>One of the huge problems that will be faced in the referendum is getting organisations together that will be in a position to advance the arguments both for and against the first-past-the-post and the additional vote system. It is very easy to get the great and the good to sit round a table and proselytise, but it is much more difficult to get people to go out and arrange for others to come out and go to the polling place. All the political parties, even the Liberal Democrats, will be divided. Some will take the position of Mr Clegg, who is in favour of the AV referendum; others will take the position that AV is a "miserable little compromise". Therefore, there will not be the mechanisms on the ground to ensure that people are engaged in the referendum process.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="11020131000033"></a>The issue of producing a leaflet is very important. I am sorry to disagree with the former Speaker, the noble Lord, Lord Martin, but because of the complexity of this issue many people would like something on a bit of paper that they can reflect upon and read again to get it clear in their mind exactly what they are making a choice about. Yes, that will be expensive, but taking a wrong decision that had to be revisited later would be even more expensive.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="11020131000034"></a>There is also a case for the Government to convene a discussion among the major political parties on the logistics of the referendum. I well remember the former Scottish Office-it must have been under the Secretary of State, Bruce Millan-bringing together the general secretaries of all the political parties at the start of the campaign in 1979 to try to find some kind of modus operandi that would allow a campaign to work. In fact, my great ally in that campaign was the organiser of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party, because people who run elections know the nature of the difficulties that can be faced.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="11020131000035"></a>In summary, what is in the Bill at the moment is not sufficient. There is a need for greater thought about how the mechanics will operate. There is also a need to get impartial material into the hands of the electors, because my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours is right to say that lies will be promulgated on both sides throughout this campaign. If we want to be certain of having an outcome to the referendum that everybody will accept, we have to do the groundwork.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="11020131000036"></a>I have seen the draft that the Electoral Commission has put together so far that explains the difference between first past the post and the alternative vote. I am not very good at reading instructions-I usually  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1331"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1331</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>get rid of my washing machine whenever I have to change the programme-but, having vacillated on this issue and having believed in the need for a change to the electoral system, I have to tell my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours that, having read the draft, I would now come down quite firmly in favour of first past the post. It is clear to me that the lack of certainty on how people can secure the outcome of their choice becomes glaringly obvious from the draft leaflet that the Electoral Commission has put together.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="11020131000037"></a>I have one final point. My noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours said that AV does not automatically create coalitions. No, it does not, but, although AV can create the climate for coalitions, it definitely creates odd bedfellows. That is because the nature of AV and the nature of practical politics is that people have to choose who their partners will be. At national level, that is usually very easy, but at constituency level you can end up with some very strange bedfellows. When that happens on the ballot paper, we could end up with some people in our Parliament whom we would not necessarily wish to see.</p>

However, I am aware of the fact that this is the only opportunity we have had so far to discuss this hugely important issue of the kind of information that the voters will receive and how they will be able to obtain impartial information, if such a thing exists. This is against the background-I assume we all know and can agree on this-that there is absolutely no resonance whatsoever, anywhere in the United Kingdom, about the issues that will be raised in this referendum. The public are either not interested, which I think is almost certainly the case-</p>

How many people will be sufficiently enthused by this issue to go out from door to door? How many public meetings are likely to be held on both sides? Does he see any prospect of people being so interested in this question that they will indeed do that sort of leg work, which is a feature of our elections?</p>

As someone who will be as active as I possibly can be in the no campaign, I am aware of the big disadvantage that the no campaign has, which is that everyone in the country at least knows something about first past the post but next to no one can answer serious questions about the mechanism of this particular form of the alternative vote system. That is why I would say that any impartial leaflet trying to tell the public about a system for which there is no evidence they know a great deal about must include the information as to whether this is used. If it was not used anywhere in the world, presumably that is a valid factual piece of information to give to the electorate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="11020131000041"></a>I am aware of the time, but I want to spell a point out and get a grievance off my shoulder. One must not bear a grudge, but I am still smarting under the advice that the Electoral Commission gave indirectly to the House, as it went to all Members of the House, when it was commenting on the various amendments as they were going through. The House may not remember Amendment 40B in my name but I do. It was a very simple amendment to allow the results of the referendum to be published constituency by constituency. It was a very simple proposal and I am sorry to say the House rejected it. I am not going to go into the merits of it but I simply want to make this point: in advance of the vote, the Electoral Commission, whose job it is under this legislation to provide information, made a mistake-believe me, the Electoral Commission can make mistakes -in respect of the advice it gave on my amendment.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="11020131000042"></a>As I said, my amendment was about publishing the constituency results. The commission said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="11020131000056"></a>"We do not support this amendment ... making such a significant change to the rules for the referendum this close to 5 May".</p>

<p><a name="11020131000053"></a>In other words, it was assuming that the referendum had to be held on 5 May, which is a contentious piece of information to begin with. That is a date chosen by the Government, and the Electoral Commission is not necessarily obliged to give information which helps the Government to achieve this contentious advice as to when the date should be held. More seriously, and perhaps more factually, this piece of information came to the House after the amendment of my noble friend Lord Rooker, giving flexibility as to the date, had been approved by the House. So the referendum, according to the Bill as it then stood, did not have to take place on 5 May; in fact, it could take place any time between 5 May and some time in October, and that is the Bill as it stands.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="11020131000043"></a>I do not dispute for a minute the good intentions of the Electoral Commission but it was at the least a contentious piece of advice to Members taking part in that debate. If on a fairly straightforward, simple proposal like that it could be contentious then I would suggest that, for anything that tried to explain how various electoral systems worked and the merits thereof, it would be almost impossible to get a non-contentious document out to the voters.</p>

What role does he expect public service broadcasting organisations, notably the BBC, to play in providing the public with this information, bound as they are by considerations of fairness and impartiality and trusted as they are, particularly the BBC, by the great mass of the British public to be fair and impartial? What role does he think they will play? I would also be grateful if he could inform the House what role he thinks they should play.</p>

Always near the bottom in believability tests, I fear, are party political broadcasts. Somewhere near the top are always programmes such as "Crimewatch"; people believe what they hear when someone in uniform tells them. That is the scale. The broadcast media always come out better than the print media. My short answer to my noble friend is that broadcasters have an enormous responsibility to provide the information because the public trust the information that they get from broadcasters more than that which they get from newspapers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="11020131000046"></a>I have got my grievance off my chest and I hope I have made a point at the same time by saying that even the Electoral Commission does not always get things absolutely right. The Committee will be well aware that there are penalties when misleading information is given out by candidates during a normal general election. Very sadly-at least in my view-a court was able to remove a Member of Parliament quite recently. I think the only people who should be able to remove Members of Parliament are the electorate-rerun an election if you like. My point is simply this: there is a mechanism at the moment for penalties to be imposed if it is deemed that an election result is the result of misleading, inaccurate or false information being provided to the electorate. We are now discussing something far more important than an individual constituency election. We are discussing whether we should change the constitution of our country. Moreover, we are doing so without any requirement as to the number of people voting. My noble friend Lord Graham said that he once received just two letters in favour of something and one against. We could change the constitution on a very low poll with a very small majority.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="11020131000047"></a>I ask the Leader of the House: what happens if demonstrably false information has been given out during the campaign, which results in the country's constitution being changed? As far as I can see, there is absolutely no recourse whatever if that happens. As we have already said, this is not an indicative referendum; this is a referendum that, if passed, will become law almost automatically. These are serious questions. I have spoken for much longer than I intended to and would rather leave the matter now.</p>

Will my noble friend give thought to the fact that in the Welsh referendum campaign, for example, results were announced constituency by constituency? I remember it well because Carmarthen's results came in last and that was the constituency I had campaigned in. If misleading information was put out in one area of the country, would that then lead to a request that the whole thing be done again; or would it relate only to individual constituencies where such misleading information had been put out?</p>

The Committee should be grateful to all those who have spoken. Our view from the Front Bench is generally supportive of the amendments in the group. I do not know whether Messrs Hegel, Heidegger and Marx would be flattered by the reference to them in the context of this Bill in the British House of Lords, but I am certain that they would be astonished to have been referred to at all.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="11020132000024"></a>These are important amendments. The noble Lord the Leader of the House will undoubtedly be familiar with the draft leaflet that the Electoral Commission has put out. Does he have any up-to-date information on whether the Electoral Commission feels that this is a satisfactory document? How much does it intend to change it? Maybe this is the nature of the beast, but how does the page-it is just one page-on the first past the post system compare to the pages on the alternative vote system? There are four pages on how this branch of the alternative vote system works. Is that deemed to be satisfactory by the Electoral Commission? I think that it only sets up the difficulties that many noble Lords from around the Committee have mentioned in their contributions. What I am really asking the noble Lord the Leader of the House to tell us is, what is the proposal as far as the Electoral Commission is concerned in terms of a final leaflet?</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="11020132000025"></a>The Electoral Commission published on 30 September last year, <I>Report of </I><I>O</I><I>ur </I><I>V</I><I>iews on the </I><I>P</I><I>roposed </I><I>R</I><I>eferendum </I><I>Q</I><I>uestion</I><I>,</I> to which I believe the Government responded in due course. It is worth pointing out a couple of the findings. On page 1, it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="11020132000038"></a>"Our research found the main difficulty people had in understanding the question was that they did not recognise or understand the voting systems it talks about - 'First Past the Post' and 'Alternative Vote'. Accessibility and plain language specialists also commented that these were not terms that most people would be familiar with".</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="11020132000026"></a>Then on page 2, under "Summary of our findings", it states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8"></a><a name="11020132000039"></a>"There were also some particular words and phrases used in the question that some people did not understand or struggled with: not everybody understood the term 'First Past the Post', or knew that it is the name of the system used now to elect MPs to the UK Parliament - even people who had voted before in this type of election ... The term 'Alternative Vote' caused particular problems and was not understood, or was misunderstood, by nearly everybody taking part in our research".</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="11020132000027"></a>That may not come as a huge surprise to Members of the Committee, but it is a warning note. Indeed, the Committee's discussions about the various types of alternative vote-which are the most satisfactory and which are not-pale in comparison to the fact that there is, at the moment, extremely limited understanding of what this type of alternative vote procedure actually means. Whatever view we take about the referendum takes place, there will not be very long to remedy that. So that is a warning and it is why I think that the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, are so important.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="11020132000028"></a>The Electoral Commission is, of course, an independent body created by Act of Parliament and has very strict rules, rightly, about the political activities of its staff. Nevertheless, there is no disguising the political significance and sensitivity of the decision on the electoral system  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1335"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1335</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which will be taken in this referendum and the role that the commission will play in it. As the Bill has demonstrated all too well, political interests are, of course, heavily engaged by this referendum. There is therefore a danger, as has been said on many sides, that in the context of this highly politicised environment, the information which the commission is due to circulate and which will impact significantly on the outcome of this referendum could become the subject of severe dispute. I want to remind the Committee, for a minute or two, of what can be described as an Irish cautionary tale.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="11020132000029"></a>I remind the House of what happened in Ireland during the referendum not that long ago on the Lisbon treaty in 2008. In advance of that referendum, a referendum commission was appointed under Irish law to promote awareness and understanding of the Lisbon treaty so as to inform the public about the issues at stake in the referendum. Indeed, apparently it is the practice in Ireland-some noble Lords will know this-that a commission is established for every referendum to ensure that the subject matter to be voted on is explained to the electorate.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="11020132000030"></a>The commission is also required to encourage the electorate to vote, which is another task that our own Electoral Commission has been asked to discharge in the forthcoming referendum. Like the subject matter involved in our proposed referendum, the Lisbon treaty was felt to raise issues of such complexity and technicality that it was quickly recognised that the information provided to the public by the independent commission could have a highly significant impact on the electorate's decision. The subject matter that was distributed by the commission was therefore subject to intense scrutiny by the media and became the object of public argument between the two campaigns. This eventually spilt over into a wider spat about the commission's independence, with claims and counterclaims being made about the connections between commission staff and individuals in the different campaigns, as well as allegations about a conflict of interest involving companies hired by the commission to help with legal work and communications advice which also worked for the Government. Many Members of the Committee will be reminded of that argument by what I have just said.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="11020132000031"></a>Of course, I am not suggesting that we would see the same problems repeated here, but we are saying that because of what is undoubtedly at the moment a low level of public knowledge about electoral systems, that inevitably means that the information provided by the Electoral Commission could have a major bearing on the outcome of the referendum, which in turn makes it highly likely that this information will be the focus of considerable attention, to put it mildly. Perhaps I have just set out the problem in other words, but the ways in which my noble friend Lord Lipsey and others who have spoken to amendments in this group have approached this problem need careful consideration by the Government in the little time that remains. We look forward to hearing what the noble Lord the Leader of the House has to say.</p>

I am very grateful to the movers of the amendments. We have certainly started off with a most interesting debate on this  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1336"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1336</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>group of amendments. The debate became slightly whimsical, but that is not the first time that that has happened in this Committee. I was glad to hear from my old friend the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, for whom the House knows I have a great deal of affection. He was the last great Chief Whip in opposition who achieved so much with so little when the Labour Party was a relatively small part of this House. It is now the largest group in the House of Lords. The noble Lord said that there should be time for reflection-I assure him that we have done nothing but reflect for the past three months or so-and that we should consider some of these issues on Report, and we will, of course, do so.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="11020132000033"></a>It will come as no surprise to anybody who has been listening to these debates that the Government very much hope that the referendum will take place on 5 May and have planned for that. I have said that many times and the Government announced their intentions in July. I know that some noble Lords opposite would rather that it were not held on that date and that the Labour Party manifesto stated that it wanted a referendum on AV in October, as it considered that that was a better date, but that is not the view that the coalition Government have taken. In order to get the Bill back to another place so that the Electoral Commission can complete its work in time for a referendum on 5 May, the Bill will have to go back to another place on Monday 14 February. I do not suppose that that is a surprise to noble Lords opposite either as they have known about that date for a very long time.</p>

I am also grateful to my noble friend Lord Newton for what he said about some of the common-sense aspects that came out of these amendments. It has been a full debate and I shall try to give it a full answer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="11020150000002"></a>Paragraph 9 of Schedule 1 ensures that the Electoral Commission has a role in presenting voters with relevant information about the referendum, how to vote in it and factual information about the two voting systems. The Electoral Commission's public testing of the referendum question found that the intelligibility of the question was increased when people had access to information on the different voting systems. Therefore, the commission has decided to issue factual information before the referendum. As it said in a recent briefing:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9"></a><a name="11020150000094"></a>"We intend to send an information booklet about the referendum to each household in the UK which will include information not only about the voting systems but also about how to take part in the referendum, including how to register and how to vote".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="11020150000003"></a>The Government take very seriously the recommendations of the Electoral Commission and we support the commission's decision to provide a booklet to every household if it decides that this is necessary to ensure that the public are able to make a fully informed choice in the referendum. The Government welcome and support the commission's approach to publishing the information booklet-in particular its public assurance that the final booklets will be available in alternative

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="11020150000008"></a>It is not clear from the current legislative framework under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000-specifically Section 13-whether the commission has the power to publish information about the voting systems for public awareness purposes in this particular referendum. Therefore the Government considered it best to make the position absolutely clear and accordingly, we tabled an amendment to insert paragraph 9(2) into Schedule 1 in Committee in the other place, which was passed and is now reflected in the Bill.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para103"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="11020150000009"></a>We do not see that it is necessary, or desirable, to mandate that the commission must issue information, as amendments tabled by the noble Lords, Lord Rooker and Lord Low, aim to do. Rather, it is the commission's prerogative. The commission has indicated that it would like this power and that it clearly intends to exercise it but we do not think that the Bill should go further than that and oblige it to do so. Moreover, it is simply unnecessary to legally obligate the commission in this respect. The commission has already publicly indicated its intention to produce this information, and has published the draft text that will form the basis of public information leaflets on its website. I am glad that some noble Lords have seen it. It is important that those who take a real interest in these matters should look at it and send their comments to the Electoral Commission regarding this information before the leaflets are published.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="11020150000010"></a>The same point, concerning the appropriateness of imposing a legal mandate on the commission in this area, also applies to the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. These would obligate the commission to provide a leaflet summarising the meaning of the question, together with the main arguments for and against first past the post and alternative vote. The amendments also specify that the leaflet must be impartial and unbiased, and distributed to every household in the UK, so far as possible.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="11020150000011"></a>The commission is clear that the leaflets will contain factual information; that this information will be impartial and unbiased-it would go against the commission's

For this reason we do not think it appropriate that the information includes arguments for and against each voting system. The information will be factual, whereas the pros and cons are subjective. These arguments will naturally be for the campaigns. It is hard to see how the commission could be expected reasonably to summarise all of the arguments for and against in a way that is commonly accepted to be impartial and unbiased. This is an inherently partial subject, and the more the commission is drawn in to trying to describe the pros and cons, the more open it would become to allegations of partiality. It is important that the commission is neutral. Therefore, the arguments for and against should be left to the campaigns.</p>

We very much agree with the intention of the noble Lord to ensure that leaflets are written in plain English. The noble Lord, Lord Rooker, my noble friend Lord Newton and others can be assured that the Electoral Commission is seeking the advice of language experts and working with the Plain English Campaign to produce its material. Nothing in the Bill prevents this, and the commission is doing it anyway, so I hope that the noble Lord will agree that that part of the amendment is unnecessary.</p>

We could have a debate about that: it is the kind of thing that we might put on the leaflets. As someone said, it is symptomatic and sad that the only debates on the Bill in which these issues have been raised have been in this unelected House of Lords. They were not debated in the other place and certainly will not be, so we need not apologise for debating them here.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="11020150000021"></a>There is another surprising thing in this debate. We have agreed to finish Committee stage tomorrow, and when there is such an arrangement, it is normal for those who have restrained themselves from participating in the debate to pile into the debate. That is what used to happen in the other place. However, we have had only one contribution from the Liberal Democrats. They know that they can speak on this without affecting the outcome simply because we are going to finish tomorrow anyway, yet they still refuse to join in the debate. However, that is their problem, not mine.</p>

<a name="110201-0001.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="11020150000022"></a>It has been an interesting debate, and I wish to raise a couple of further points. The legislation talks about information to "persons", not households. As far as I know, there are 44 million electors in 27 million households. The legislation says "persons". People are going to vote, not households. If we want to talk about the bias, it might be considered bias in the proposed leaflet-I have the draft in my hand-for the status quo to apply in terms of which system will be dealt with first. The issue will be: which system will be described first in the leaflet? There could be a question of bias. I have no view about which way round they should be, but if I was really fanatical, I could nit-pick and consult lawyers about which one is going to be described first-leaving aside the fact that there are four pages to one system and one page to the other, which is another issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="11020150000023"></a>Furthermore, no one has mentioned the costs involved. I saw press reports at the weekend of the yes campaign being backed by about £6 million and the no campaign somewhat under £1 million. Obviously there is money to be spent on this. It is not impossible to do this. I have so far refrained from mentioning, as I did before, the fact that in New Zealand there was never any complaint, to the best of my knowledge, about the literature put out by its Electoral Commission for its two referendums when they changed the voting system. So it is perfectly possible to explain.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="11020150000024"></a>I am pleased about something that is contained in the Electoral Commission draft, which I have only just seen. It will not wash in terms of explanation, but it will stop the Deputy Prime Minister telling fibs any more. The draft says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10"></a><a name="11020150000095"></a>"Because voters don't have to rank all of the candidates, an election can be won under the 'alternative vote' system with less than half the total votes cast".</p>

<p><a name="11020150000089"></a>Let us have an end to that. I know that the Leader said that; he is not going to point out the errors of the Deputy Prime Minister, who started peddling this view. I could peddle the issue about how it ends tactical voting. It does not-it moves tactical voting to the second vote.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="11020150000025"></a>We have had an interesting debate. My noble friend talked about leaflets. It will be booklets, not leaflets. I do not see why the Royal Mail cannot do it. It can deliver to every household quite quickly. The difficulty is in the timing. Nothing can be printed until after Royal Assent. One assumes that something will be ready to go, if the Plain English Campaign has looked at it. However, it is going to go through letter boxes in the UK at exactly the same time as other election literature. Will it get the justice that it deserves? Clearly, we are embarking on a big project. As I have said, I have no view about the referendum on 5 May. I only offered a lifeboat if a lifeboat was needed. I do not campaign one way or the other. I simply think that, as I said last night, time is running short to get the message across in a way that will result in a meaningful vote.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="11020150000026"></a>Some practical problems may come up in terms of the mechanism that will be involved. One assumes that contracts have been looked at. You cannot just go to Royal Mail and say, "By the way, you know there are local elections in which there is no free post, but there are poll cards; and, by the way, we are having a referendum. Can you knock an extra one out for every household in the country?" Royal Mail will say, "No one has asked us about that. We have not got the capacity for that. We need more warning". Has anybody done that? I presume we can ask that when we debate further amendments. However, in view of the need to make progress, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="11020150000027"></a><b><a name="110201-0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="11020150000119"></a>Lord Bach:</b> Following the previous debate, I can move this amendment from the opposition Front Bench comparatively shortly. We believe that it is absolutely appropriate that the Electoral Commission has the lead role in providing the public with educational materials in regard to the alternative vote referendum. That was the position adopted by the previous Labour Government in the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act, which originally contained clauses to provide for an AV referendum, supported by noble Lords from the Liberal Democrat Party but absolutely torpedoed and killed off by the Conservative Front Bench in the wash-up before the election.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="11020150000028"></a>We remain of the view that the Electoral Commission is best placed to provide the public with the neutral, factual background information that they will need to make an informed decision in the referendum. There is also no question that there is, as we have debated, a serious need for such background information. As we discussed a few minutes ago, noble Lords may well have read the report of the Electoral Commission on the intelligibility of the referendum question as then posed, which was published last September, following the original proposition put forward in the Bill. Following extensive public consultation, the commission found that the vast majority of UK citizens had only a slim grasp, if any grasp at all, of the choice which is being put to them in the AV referendum which, as my noble friend Lord Grocott quite rightly said in the previous debate-I hate to embarrass him-changes our constitution and may change it for a long time to come. Who knows? On the previous amendment, I quoted various short passages from that report and I shall not repeat them.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="11020150000029"></a>There is clearly a need for public education about the concepts and issues at stake in the referendum on electoral reform. Given the current low level of knowledge, it seems clear that the education people receive will shape the way in which they think and have a very great influence on how they then act. I shall not repeat my Irish cautionary tale about the trouble that a referendum commission, or in this case the Electoral Commission, can find itself in, but many such difficulties were outlined in the contributions made on the previous group of amendments. There is no doubt that it is a very difficult line for the Electoral Commission to follow without finding itself in very serious hot water from one side or the other or perhaps both.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="11020150000030"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to provide the Electoral Commission with some sort of cover which would insulate it against unwarranted accusations of showing favouritism, for example, to one argument over another. It would provide for a Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission, a body which already exists, as noble Lords will know, and it would have a role in signing off materials which the commission intend, under its broad provisions, to disseminate about the AV referendum. That Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission would include, of course, senior Members of Parliament from all the main parties and would be chaired by the Speaker, who has no party affiliation.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="11020150000031"></a>That seems to us a sensible proposal which would strengthen the legitimacy of the referendum process and help to ensure that the Electoral Commission  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1342"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1342</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>does not become embroiled unnecessarily or inadvertently in a political controversy which would tarnish the poll and tarnish the result of the referendum which, as I say, may or may not change the constitution of our country for good. It is a modest proposal but I hope one that may find some support in the Committee, particularly from the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_156"></a>
<a name="11020150000032"></a><b><a name="110201-0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="11020150000120"></a>Lord Soley:</b> I referred to this matter in my earlier comments and I am encouraged to make a further comment partly by the speech made by my noble friend Lord Davies of Stamford but also by that made by the noble Lord, Lord Pannick. The problem here is paragraph 9(2) of Schedule 1. Paragraph 9(1) is very clear. It does not put the Electoral Commission in the firing line at all. If the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, who I assume will answer this debate, heard anything of the previous debate he will have heard anxiety expressed in all speeches about the dangers of putting the Electoral Commission in a position where it takes the blame for not getting a balanced view of the two systems. As I have said on a number of occasions, it is very difficult to write a pamphlet describing the two systems without, in some way, being biased. My noble friend Lord Rooker has already touched on this.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="11020150000033"></a>There seem to be two ways of dealing with this problem. One is the way put forward by my noble friend on the Front Bench, which is to allow a political committee, the Speaker's Committee, to be the lightning conductor. That committee would oversee the work that was done and would sign it off and if there were any flak from it, it would not go straight to the Electoral Commission. That is one way of dealing with it.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="11020150000034"></a>Perhaps I may suggest another way which came to me when I heard my noble friend Lord Davies speak-I noticed that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, gave a fairly positive response to it-and that is the idea of the two campaigning groups being able to send out a leaflet, at public charge, so that it would be done rather like an election address. Looking back to paragraph 9, sub-paragraph (2) is problematic because that is where the Electoral Commission is required to make judgments about the wording used to describe the system. If we took out sub-paragraph (2)-I do not expect the Minister to respond to this straightaway but he might want to think about it-and simply left in sub-paragraph (1), then the Government could, in this Bill-I suspect that it would not need to go into the Bill-allow for the two campaigning groups to produce the leaflet as described by my noble friend Lord Davies with some sympathetic support from the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde. That could be sent round, either with the Electoral Commission's pamphlet or separately-I should have thought it would go with it-and in that way you take the responsibility of describing the two systems other than in a very basic sense which is required in paragraph 9(1), and put the requirement in paragraph 9(2) onto the two campaigning organisations.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="11020150000035"></a>I hope I am making myself clear. It is slightly complicated, but I am arguing that the two campaigns will know what they want to say for and against the two systems. If they produce their own leaflets and they are circulated with the pamphlet put out by the Electoral Commission, which they will do under  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1343"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>paragraph 9(1), then it leaves the Electoral Commission in the rather tighter position of simply saying that there is a referendum, informing people about it, informing them how to vote, but not getting into the nitty-gritty of the pros and cons or the description of how the two systems might work. That would be left to the two campaigning organisations. That way you would take the Electoral Commission out of the firing line. The alternative way is to do as my noble friend has suggested from the Front Bench and leave the Speaker's Committee to oversee the leaflet. It seems to me that either of those systems would act as a lightning conductor for the Electoral Commission and not put it in the firing line for what will almost certainly be seen as in some way a biased leaflet. I hope I have made myself clear. Perhaps the Minister would like to think about that.</p>

<p><a name="st_157"></a>
<a name="11020150000036"></a><b><a name="110201-0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="11020150000121"></a>Lord Wallace of Tankerness:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Bach, for moving the amendment. This important amendment follows on from the previous debate and I welcome the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Soley. As the noble Lord, Lord Bach, said in introducing his amendment, it is appreciated that the Electoral Commission should take the lead role in providing useful factual information. We believe it plays an important role in providing information to the public and there is a governance framework for the Electoral Commission, under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act, which we believe has operated effectively for 10 years. It is also important to recall in the context of this amendment that latterly the Electoral Commission has had the benefit of advice and involvement of representatives from the political parties: the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, for the Labour Party, the noble Baroness, Lady Browning, for the Conservative Party and Mr David Howarth, the former Member of Parliament for Cambridge who represents the Liberal Democrats.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="11020150000037"></a>The Speaker's Committee is an important part of that framework. It produces an annual report to Parliament on the commission's performance, but the nature of the role of the Speaker's Committee is different from that proposed in the amendment. The Speaker's Committee is currently not given any say in how the commission should exercise its powers. It is there to report on the performance of the commission rather than to have a say in the exercise of its powers.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="11020150000038"></a>The purpose of paragraph 9(2) of Schedule 1 is to provide legal clarity so that the Electoral Commission can issue information about both the first-past-the-post and the alternative vote systems which it identifies as being necessary to help public understanding of the referendum question. I hope that that goes some way to answering the point of the noble Lord, Lord Soley, which was whether we could delete paragraph 9(2) and leave it to the respective campaigns. Although the respective campaigns will have facility under the free post to put out their argument-no doubt a positive argument for why they wish to retain first past the post or to move to the alternative vote and an argument against the other system-that is clearly not a role that would be appropriate for the Electoral Commission.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="11020150000039"></a>Paragraph 9(2) provides a clear legal basis for the Electoral Commission, having identified a need for factual information, to provide it. In his response to  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1344"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the previous debate, the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, said that it could be accused of bias because first past the post was described before the alternative vote. In fairness, if one looks at the electoral question, the question for the referendum, which is part of the Bill, first past the post is mentioned there before the alternative vote, so it is probably not unreasonable that the Electoral Commission should reflect in its information the question which Parliament is debating and which appears in the Bill, published on advice from the Electoral Commission.</p>

It is assumed that in a "on the one hand, on the other hand" argument, you put the argument that you favour second. Cannot that be got around in a leaflet by having one side of one page for and the other against?</p>

<p><a name="st_159"></a>

Although that is an innovative and ingenious way to try to overcome the problem, I think that a practical issue is associated with it.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="11020150000042"></a>As my noble friend the Leader of the House said, the Electoral Commission has already published the proposed content of its information leaflets on its website. It is keen to have comments on the draft. If noble Lords wish to make representations about that information, they can of course send their comments to the Electoral Commission before the leaflets are published.</p>

He knows as well as I do that before elections, party election broadcasts replace party political broadcasts. Will there be referendum broadcasts for the yes and no campaigns? Will that be part of the arrangements for the referendum?</p>

I know that parties cannot use their election broadcasts for the referendum campaign. I think that that was decided in a case prior to the Scottish referendum in 1979. I think that there will be broadcasts, but perhaps I can confirm that in the course of my remarks.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="11020150000045"></a>I am mindful that all public bodies need to be held properly accountable for what they do, but we need to strike a sensible balance. It seems to me that there are dangers in introducing a role for a parliamentary committee in approving the operational work of the commission, as is envisaged under the amendment, rather than monitoring and commenting on its performance, as is the case established under the PPERA. It must also be remembered that the Speaker's Committee, however august, comprises politicians. Irrespective of how carefully we might think that the committee would use its power-I have no reason to think that it would do other than that-perception can be important  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1345"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1345</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in these matters. There might be concern if the Electoral Commission-which, I think, everyone agrees, has a reputation for its impartiality-had in this crucial area to have its work vetted or approved by a body comprising politicians.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="11020150000046"></a>Furthermore, building in an extra procedural hurdle before the commission could issue the clarifying information to help voters could be difficult if confusion about the systems was allowed to take root and hares were allowed to run which could not be corrected promptly because of the need to refer. We must also bear in mind that the commission already issues a lot of useful guidance to voters, parties, candidates and electoral administrators about the working of our system. That has worked well. I am not aware of any significant concerns about it.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="11020150000047"></a>I confirm that my instinctive answer was right: there will be referendum broadcasts for the designated campaigns.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="11020150000048"></a>It is the commission's responsibility to decide how, and whether, to provide that information. As I said, I think it is widely accepted across the Committee that the commission is well established as a neutral, independent body. I am confident that it does not need the extra provision which the amendment would impose. There is a further opportunity for noble Lords to comment on the draft. I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I am slightly disappointed by the noble and learned Lord's response. As I said in opening, this is a modest proposal-and a practical one, I think. Without doubt, the Electoral Commission will come under a lot of pressure, to put it mildly, in the lead-up to and during the campaign for the referendum. No doubt, much of that criticism will be ill judged and unfair, but the Electoral Commission will have to face it.</p>

<ul><a name="11020150000101"></a>"take whatever steps the officer thinks appropriate to encourage participation in the referendum".</ul>
<p><a name="11020150000090"></a>My concern, especially in view of the tight time scale in which the referendum is likely to be conducted, is that there will be a lack of co-ordination between all these different officers about what they do. You could get a right mess with each of them carrying out their duty to encourage participation, some in this way, some in that, some here, some there, often overlapping and often leaving gaps of encouragement. I therefore thought it fit to propose this amendment which will cast upon the chief counting officer a duty to, in effect, facilitate co-operation between all those bodies, not forgetting that in the same paragraph 10, all four sets of officers,</p>
<ul><a name="11020150000102"></a>"must have regard to any guidance issued by the Electoral Commission".</ul>
<p><a name="11020150000091"></a>So it has its oar in as well.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="11020150000054"></a>It is as simple as that. We surely need somebody who has a primary role to facilitate co-operation between all these various people and organisations. Lastly, I point out that under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, the chief counting officer is chair of the Electoral Commission. That is all I need to say. I beg to move.</p>

We have heard only too little from his Benches in the course of this debate, and therefore I wish him well in his speech. I should perhaps add that he should mind how he goes on the way home. A vow of omerta has bound the Lib Dems together over this Bill, and he has, I am sure inadvertently, broken it by intervening for a whole two minutes this evening. So mind how you go.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="11020150000056"></a>My Amendment 110ZB is not terribly well related to Amendment 110ZA, but is about a quite different matter. It harks back to the stain that still hangs over our democracy from the May general election. Memories in politics are, alas, short, but not in this House, of course. Therefore, I hardly need remind noble Lords of what happened. In a number of constituencies-16 in all-people turned up at the polling station before the 10 o'clock deadline wishing to cast a vote in those constituencies. They were not allowed to vote. According to the Electoral Commission's 20 May interim report on the matter, 1,200 voters were excluded from voting as a result of that cock-up.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="11020150000057"></a>For each of the 1,200 voters, the ban was absolute. It may not be a large percentage of the national total, but for a few days, our papers, no doubt exaggerating a little bit, were comparing us to a third world democracy. We could not even organise a vote, and when you see the way voters queue up in South Africa for hours and hours under a hot sun to exercise their right, and you find that in our own country people who have turned up on time are denied it, it leads to a shiver of shame going down one's spine. The Electoral Commission's interim report blamed poor planning, unsuitable buildings, contingency arrangements that were not triggered in time or proved ineffective and, incidentally, restrictive legislation that stopped those queuing getting ballot papers, even though they were in the polling station on time.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="11020150000058"></a>Planning for the referendum is in one sense at least perhaps more difficult than planning for a general election. Yes, we should all love to see a turnout for the referendum at least as great as that in the general election, but I do not think that many psephological experts think that is terribly likely. It really is terribly difficult to predict what turnout will be. You can imagine that the campaign starts with a poll showing a great gap between the various sides, and therefore fewer and fewer people plan to vote because they do not think their vote will make a difference. As it gets closer to polling day, it may be that polls start to narrow, and a whole load of people decide that they will after all go to the polls. By then, electoral officers will have made their dispositions and decided how many staff to have, how many polling stations and so on. In this case, the Leader of the House's technique for deciding what the turnout will be-the same technique that he used for the number of seats-by choosing a nice round number out of the air is not that much worse than any other technique. There is a danger that the accommodation will not be sufficient for the number of people who turn out to vote on the day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="11020150000059"></a>The Library tells me that we are still awaiting the final report from the Electoral Commission on last May's debacle, but bits of it have leaked out. The Government's response has left a nasty sniff in the air. The <I>Times</I> reported, even before the report came out on 11 November, that Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, had turned down the proposal in the commission's interim report for a change in the legislation so that those who turn up before 10 o'clock can vote, even if they have not cast their vote by 10 o'clock. He said that the answer to poor organisation was not to reach for the statute book. Of course it is not, but it seems sensible to have two barrels to your shotgun: to try to deal with the poor organisation and to change the legislation that inadvertently caused this problem. I am therefore a little sorry and a little surprised that this legislation-absent the amendment I am now proposing-does not seem to do anything about that shortcoming.</p>

I am, and should be, slightly surprised that the Government have not consulted it. I am

This was a serious problem. It is not a joke. If it is repeated, it will cast permanent doubt on our electoral arrangements, and it is therefore absolutely essential that we make sure that there will be no repetition of this on 5 May.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="11020150000061"></a>I should have said earlier that there is one other reason why there could be a repetition. If the referendum goes ahead on 5 May, and it remains to be seen whether that will be possible, it will be quite a complicated election. At the polling station, they will be dishing out one set of papers for the election of Governments in Scotland and Wales and another set of papers for the referendum, and people will be coming up saying "Please sir, what do I do with that?"; "I don't know that"; "I didn't know I was going to get that"; and all that sort of thing. It would be quite easy to imagine circumstances in which the staff at the polling stations became overwhelmed by the sheer volume of queries.</p>

Rather, does he not think, in view of the potential problems he was just outlining, that his amendment could add to those problems? His amendment would apply to the issue of ballot papers for the referendum only. The effect of his amendment will be that different laws would apply for the issue of ballot papers for the referendum from those that would apply for the issue of ballot papers for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and local elections. That would further add to the confusion. For those of us who agree that there is a problem with this matter and that it might be better dealt with by legislation, the legislation should be comprehensive for all elections and referendums and not just the referendum on 5 May.</p>

The trouble is that we have got before us the parliamentary voting Bill and I cannot change the whole of electoral law in a clause within it. If the noble Lord can prevail on Ministers to change the electoral law more generally as soon as possible, then that would be great. I would rather that on 5 May people were able to vote in the referendum, even if a cock-up occurred that stopped them voting in the local elections, than that they went all the way to the polling station and could not cast a ballot on anything. That would be much worse.

The arrangements as set out in the schedule are somewhat ambiguous. His amendment is one way, at least, of clarifying that. There may be other, better ways, for all I know, but certainly these arrangements need to be clarified. I strongly support the view behind the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey-that the situation in the last election, where people who came and were there before 10 pm could not, because of the law, be given ballot papers, was absolutely disgraceful. Whatever the reason, on the night the lady from the Electoral Commission who spoke did not appear to me to have grasped exactly what the situation was. She said that it had given clear instructions that the ballot papers were not to be handed out after 10 pm. It suggests to me-and I do not know what the right answer to it is-that some flexibility is required to deal with special circumstances. The people who are running the different polling stations may not necessarily be the top brass of the arrangements, but some kind of discretion must be given, because that kind of thing can happen. I do not expect for a minute that anybody realised exactly what was happening until it was really too late, and then they had this terrific sledgehammer of "You cannot issue a ballot paper after 10 pm"; witness what the Electoral Commission had said. In a sense it made the matter worse. I do not say that the people in the polling booth could have given them out after 10 pm, although I think if I was in a polling booth and in charge as a clerk I would have had a shot at that.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="11020150000068"></a>It is important that this matter should be sorted out one way or another. If the Government do not think that the Electoral Commission solution is the best, then let us have one. We need a solution. I agree, of course, that it needs to be a solution that applies to all elections-not just the referendum-although, unfortunately, I do not think that that could be done in this Bill. We are trying to do enough already. We cannot sort the whole thing out, but it is certainly important to sort it out. A very short Bill that would not take the time that this one has taken could go through both Houses and sort this out in good time for 5 May.</p>

It may well be that the wording can be improved-and it probably can-but there will be general approval for the intention. I also begin by welcoming the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, and indeed that of the noble Lord, Lord Rennard. Someone mentioned the vow of omerta. When we had a Liberal Democrat intervention in an area of policy which in many ways they have taken as their own, I was reminded rather more of the brave Horatius at the bridge:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="11020150000070"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, mentioned the question of facilitation. This is clearly a possible problem because there will be a number of right hands and a number of left hands. It is important that this be a key role-even if the actual wording is not wholly appropriate.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="11020150000071"></a>I was puzzled by another matter in this same section. In paragraph 10(1), we are told that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14"></a><a name="11020150000099"></a>"The Chief Counting Officer must take whatever steps the officer thinks appropriate".</p>

<p><a name="11020150000092"></a>At the end, in paragraph 10(5), we are told that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_15"></a><a name="11020150000100"></a>"The Minister may reimburse any expenditure incurred by an officer for the purposes of sub-paragraph (1) or (2)"</p>

<p><a name="11020150000093"></a>On the face of it, this gives an unlimited expenditure for the worthy objects of this paragraph and goes against all the normal government policies of being frightened and hesitant about open-ended commitments. It is wholly unlimited. One's mind boggles at what, in following up this worthy objective, a very zealous officer may wish to do. So I simply commend to the Government-</p>

It may well be that there should be written into the clause some test of reasonableness or otherwise, but we have to have some limit.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="11020150000074"></a>The final comment I would like to make on the amendment is on the point made by my noble friend Lord Lipsey, which was supported by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. I had the privilege of being an observer, or monitor, at both the South African election in 1994 and the first free election in Namibia in 1989. What amazed me at the time was that many people who had not had the opportunity before-those who were non-white-had such enthusiasm to get to the ballot box. I recall seeing young men carrying their aged mothers on their shoulders to get to that ballot box. I recall the long queues of people waiting to vote. All of those, in fact, who were in the tent at the relevant time, were allowed to vote. For any democrat it was a wonderfully emotional and uplifting moment.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="11020150000075"></a>As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, has just said, it was very different when we saw the people who had been excluded from voting at the time of the last election. As a democrat, I was extremely happy to see the display of real anger on the part of those who were excluded. We wait with interest to see how the Electoral Commission will respond, but surely it is not beyond the wit of man, or woman either, to give out cards to those waiting in the queue at 10 pm to enable those who have made the effort to vote on time to do so. Indeed, everything must be done to encourage people to vote. Someone who is turned away at the last moment because there is a queue may, in the future, join the ranks of those who do not vote. Let us look very carefully at this in order to encourage democracy.</p>

I would not dream of booking a holiday or anything else in any way other than online through my computer and paying with a bank card. There is some security risk, maybe, but not very much, yet we still have this absurd system for voting. But, of course, almost the first thing this Government did was to abolish the one way we could have had electronic voting by getting rid of the rather small system of ID cards that we were introducing. If we had ID cards, we would not have any of this bother.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="11020150000077"></a>This real point is this. My noble friend is right at one level to say that in Scotland we are going to have two ballot papers presented to us-but we are not because we are going to have three of them. There will be one using the first past the post system to elect the Member for the constituency, and a second paper giving a list of parties to elect. That, by the way, raises the point made earlier by my noble friend Lord Rooker about where you stand on the ballot paper. In my view, it is almost certain that Alex Salmond is the First Minister of Scotland because he made sure, when using the list system, that he was listed as "Alex Salmond for First Minister" rather than "SNP". He was at the top of the list and probably got just about enough votes to make sure he won the election.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="11020150000078"></a>We are now to have the AV paper to contend with as well, and some people will find it difficult. The referendum is very important, but a problem that may arise is that some people in Scotland will decide that the Scottish elections are considerably more important than the referendum for AV. After all, the Scottish Parliament deals with the education system, housing and all the social issues that affect people's lives. They may say, "I can't be bothered with the referendum paper. I will deal with the Scottish Parliament ones". If the turnout for the AV referendum is smaller than it is for the Scottish Parliament, that will begin to cast doubts on the referendum itself.</p>

There are also two franchises, so although the vast majority of people will get three ballot papers, some will be entitled to only one and others to two. The returning officer has to keep two registers, so it is going to be very complicated, and the likelihood of queues to vote is even greater.</p>

Moreover, if we have to have this sort of electoral system and way of voting, maybe there is a case for switching the polling day from a Thursday to a Sunday because at least that would give people the whole day to cast their vote, whereas those who are at work on a Thursday have to do it after they get home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="11020150000081"></a>I turn to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. He is quite right to say that there should be somebody to do this. But whoever is in charge of the election, what he will have to decide-certainly in Scotland-is the order for counting the different sets  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1352"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1352</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of votes. I assume that the same people will count both the referendum and the Scottish parliamentary votes. There is already criticism in Scotland that, because the referendum for AV is being held on the same day, the announcement of the results of the Scottish parliamentary election may be put off for several days because they will want to announce both results at the same time. Whoever is in charge of the election will have to make the decision about what to count first. The various ballot papers will have to be sorted out, as my noble friend said, or will it be decided that the Scottish parliamentary election votes will be counted and those results announced first?</p>

Paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 gives the chief counting officer the power to direct regional counting officers and so on, and gives regional counting officers the power to direct counting officers within their region about the discharge of their functions. That will probably include directions about the sort of issues the noble Lord has raised. But of course that does not go across to paragraph 10, which is all about encouraging participation.</p>

Maybe it is for the Government or the Electoral Commission to take a decision on this. However, I think that there will be some anger in Scotland if the results for who is to form the next Government in Scotland and who is to be the next First Minister in Scotland are delayed by the result of the decision on the AV referendum, if that is done first and the other results are delayed. For some of us, the idea of Alex Salmond being First Minister for even one more hour let alone one, two or three more days is more than we want, but the fact is that I would accept that decision if it is made. The power in the Bill may allow the officer to make that decision, but it would be a very important decision for him to make.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="11020150000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, pointed out the ambiguity and ambivalence of paragraph 10 and the need for it to be simplified. For those on the Front Bench on this side, that is clear, and I think it is the only point I need to make about his amendment. We hope that his noble and learned friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness will take note.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="11020150000086"></a>My noble friend Lord Lipsey's amendment also seems to hit the mark for us. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, was right to say that what happened at the end of the last general election night-thankfully in a comparatively small number of venues, although even one was one too many-was absolutely disgraceful. Indeed, if it had happened in any other country, whether it was a sophisticated democracy or a new democracy, I venture to think that it would have been reported in the British media as being proof that that country had not really grown up democratically and lacked certain vital factors in elections. We must make sure that it does not happen again, and indeed I think that that is what my noble friend is suggesting in his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="11020150000087"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, was quite right to say that this would only affect the referendum, but it needs to affect all elections. However, the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, is perhaps best placed of anybody in the House to use his influence to make sure that government views can be changed so that this can become general practice rather than just for the referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="11020150000088"></a>I have nothing else to say from the Front Bench except that we hope very much that the Minister will be sympathetic to these two amendments, both of which will add to the virtue of the Bill.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="11020159000002"></a>Amendment 110ZA would impose a duty on the chief counting officer to facilitate co-operation between the officer, the Electoral Commission, the regional counting officers, counting officers and registration officers. In common with other noble Lords who have spoken in the debate, the Government agree with the intention of the amendment, which is to ensure that there is a strong relationship and good communication among those involved in running the referendum. However, we do not believe the amendment is necessary because there is nothing in the Bill which would inhibit this kind of activity from taking place.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="11020159000003"></a>Paragraph 10(1) of Schedule 1 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16"></a><a name="11020159000038"></a>"The Chief Counting Officer must take whatever steps the officer thinks appropriate to encourage participation in the referendum".</p>

<p><a name="11020159000033"></a>That, of course, includes precisely the kind of co-operation suggested in the amendment. Moreover, I can assure my noble friend and the Committee that this kind of co-operation is already happening in practice. The chief counting officer has established a working group, which includes regional counting officers, to co-ordinate activity ahead of the planned polls; and the commission's plans for public awareness have been shared with this group, as well as with counting officers and electoral

We are assured that material will be developed by the Electoral Commission for use by electoral administrators to support their public awareness work and to ensure appropriate co-ordination with its own activities.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="11020159000004"></a>On a slightly more technical point, the amendment does not sit well with the current wording and spirit of paragraph 10 of Schedule 1, where the onus is on the chief counting officer being responsible for deciding what steps she thinks are appropriate to encourage participation. It should be noted that when undertaking this responsibility the chief counting officer can also use her power of direction under paragraph 5(5) of the schedule to require regional counting officers and counting officers to take a particular course of action to encourage participation. In contrast, the amendment would mandate the chief counting officer to undertake specific steps, which is not the intention of this provision.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="11020159000005"></a>In addition, one effect of requiring co-operation among certain named bodies is that such a requirement could raise a question about whether it was also permissible for the chief counting officer to consult other bodies that are not mentioned there. That problem does not arise in the original drafting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="11020159000006"></a>I understand the sentiments and the intention underlying my noble friend's amendment.</p>

If a registration officer believed that it was appropriate to encourage participation by, let us say, running a rapid registration campaign prior to the referendum and got on with it, and then it was decided that because the money was not available he could not proceed, would not that have legal implications for the officer's failure to act?</p>

I take the point and do not wish to diminish it, but perhaps I could have some time to reflect on what he is saying. It is agreed on all sides of the Committee that there should be encouragement, which we do not wish to have cut off.</p>

Surely that must have legal implications for the position of the officer concerned.</p>

I can reassure the noble Lord that reasonable expenditure for the purposes set out in paragraph 10(1) and 10(2) would be reimbursed. The noble Lord has put forward a serious hypothetical situation, but anyone would accept that running a registration campaign was a reasonable thing to do. If someone went about it in an extravagant way-which I cannot begin to think of at the moment-that would be deemed unreasonable by most sensible people and it would not be reasonable that taxpayers' money should reimburse it. However, with a straightforward, reasonable campaign, the Government would reimburse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="11020159000011"></a>On the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, the Scottish parliamentary elections will be counted first, ahead of the referendum. The selection of the First Minister does not normally follow the election anyway. I recall that in 2003 we did not get down to negotiations about establishing a coalition until the Monday after the election. Nevertheless, the point remains that the Scottish election count will take precedence over the referendum count.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="11020159000012"></a>There is a link between this amendment and the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, which relates to the role of the chief counting officer and the powers available to her. Sentiments have been expressed in the debate, as on other occasions, that democratic people were profoundly perturbed by the scenes they saw on the night of the last general election when people were not allowed to exercise their democratic rights. Paragraph 10(1) of the schedule states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17"></a><a name="11020159000039"></a>"The Chief Counting Officer must take whatever steps the officer considers appropriate to encourage participation in the referendum".</p>

<p><a name="11020159000034"></a>The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, would provide that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="11020159000040"></a>"These steps shall include measures to ensure that all those wishing to vote and arriving at the polling station within the appointed hours are able to do so".</p>

<p><a name="11020159000035"></a>Clearly, the amendment is intended to address the scenes and situations we experienced in May last year.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="11020159000013"></a>I can assure the Committee that we take very seriously the problems that arose at certain polling stations. The Government have been considering the Electoral Commission's report on the issue and, in particular, the recommendation that the law be changed to allow people who have not been issued with a ballot paper but are in the queues at 10 pm to vote. We are not convinced or satisfied that the amendment would enable the chief counting officer to direct that ballot papers are issued after 10 pm-if, indeed, that is the intention of the amendment. As the noble Lord indicated in his speech when he spoke to the amendment, the Electoral Commission report noted that that was not possible because it would not comply with the law. Clearly, the chief counting officer cannot issue a direction that contravenes the existing law. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, indicated, that is possibly not something that could be done in the context of this legislation for a referendum alone.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="11020159000014"></a>I will try to deal with the other point in a bit more detail. It is important to note that in most cases where the problems occurred in May last year, the Electoral

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="11020159000015"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, quoted my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime Minister. He quoted him accurately, but perhaps I should just quote a little more of what he said. At Question Time in the other place on 10 November, the Deputy Prime Minister said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="11020159000041"></a>"I happen to think that, in this instance, simply passing a law will not deal with the problem, which was a lack of resources and poor organisation by the returning officer, who acknowledged as much"</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="11020159000016"></a>Officials have met the Electoral Commission, and indeed electoral administrators, to discuss the issue of managing queues at polling stations. It is clear that there are divergent views on the effectiveness of any legislative change, and a significant number of administrators are not in favour of it. Again, that is a reflection of the fact that the problems in that particular case in May last year were because of planning failures and the lack of effective contingency planning.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="11020159000017"></a>Given the divergence of views that exist on the specific recommendation of the Electoral Commission and given that there is the general consensus that the problems largely arose from poor planning, we believe there is a need for significant additional discussion before any change to legislation should be proposed, if indeed that is eventually deemed appropriate. There needs to be buy-in from all those who would be involved in administering elections.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="11020159000018"></a>Under the Bill, we consider that the chief counting officer already has the necessary powers to provide appropriate guidance, training and support to the regional counting officers, as well as to counting officers themselves, to help address the issues that arose in May 2010. I am aware that some of the contingency arrangements have already changed the ratio of polling clerks to the number of voters at each polling place. We think there is certainly a need for more discussion as to all the potential consequences of any legislative amendment before a change to the principles underlying the existing electoral rules is considered. In these circumstances there is some benefit to having the certainty of the present rules, admittedly with the back-up role that the chief counting officer has the authority to play in giving the necessary guidance, training and support.</p>

My amendment would not deal with the strict legislative problem that the Electoral Commission originally identified. That is still under discussion and I agree this is not the appropriate time to put that right. However, my amendment would convey to returning officers the extreme importance that Parliament attaches to tackling these problems. Yes, it would be a declaratory piece of legislation, but that is not without force in this world. The noble Lord might like to reflect on the point that, if he rejects this proposal, it will seem as if the Government are not really taking on board the

There is no doubt about that. Anyone reading this debate would realise that the view on all sides of the Committee is that the situation was serious. I hope to reassure the noble Lord-who accepts that his amendment would not change the legislative basis for that-that there is a distinction to be made, given that it was accepted that in the cases last year the common factor was one of poor planning. In this case, there will be a chief counting officer, who will have a responsibility and already be aware-not least because of the dual role with the Electoral Commission-about the importance of this issue. I am sure the chief counting officer will be well aware of the sentiments expressed and the important and serious points made in this debate. If the noble Lord's aim was to get a message across, his amendment has provided a very helpful forum and opportunity to get that message across. She has the powers, we believe, to provide the appropriate guidance, the appropriate training and the appropriate support so that these issues will be addressed and the kind of situation that we saw on May 2010 will not arise again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="11020159000023"></a>The first argument advanced by the Minister was that paragraph 10(1) says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="11020159000042"></a>"The Chief Counting Officer must take whatever steps the officer thinks appropriate to encourage participation".</p>

<p><a name="11020159000037"></a>He said that such a provision allows the chief counting officer to direct the other officers-regional counting officers and so on-as to what to do and how to do it.

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="11020159000026"></a>Paragraph 5(5) of Schedule 1 explicitly gives the chief counting officer powers to direct counting officers in the discharge of their functions. I thought long and hard about this and consulted-if he will not mind my saying so-with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, who knows a thing or two about interpretation. We agreed that the reference there to the power to direct is with regard to the conduct of a referendum. If the Minister looks back on paragraph 5, he will see that it is about the conduct of the poll, the printing of ballot papers, the issue and receipt of postal ballot papers, verification and counting of votes cast-that is, solely and exclusively a power of direction on technical and practical matters.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="11020159000027"></a>Lastly, the Minister said that he thought that the situation would be endangered by my amendment because he said that, if there was a right of "knocking heads together" among these five categories of officer, it might involve consultation with outside bodies.

The amendment would give the Chief Counting Officer, who is chair of the Electoral Commission, the power to incur expenses for the effective conduct of the referendum and in certain limited circumstances, make payments in respect of those expenses out of moneys to be provided from the consolidated fund. I can assure the Committee that the Chief Counting Officer will be able to spend conduct moneys only where doing so provides a clear financial benefit. The Royal Mail, for example, has indicated that it may be able to provide a cheaper service for the sweeps of mail centres-a service that ensures that any votes still in the mail centres towards the end of polling day are identified, extracted and provided to returning and counting officers before the close of poll that evening-if it can contract for this on a national basis with one individual rather than having to negotiate and contract with more than 350 officers who will be conducting the poll at local level.</p>

It was suggested to me last year by the Law Society of Scotland and I tabled it last November-it seems like quite a long time ago. The amendment clarifies the basis on which a judicial review of the certification by the chief or regional counting officers of the ballot papers counted or votes cast in the referendum may be taken. As the Minister will know better than anyone present, now that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, has left the Chamber, judicial review is different in Scotland from other parts of the United Kingdom. In Scotland, a petitioner must have both title and interest to sue. In England, only interest is required. We submitted as inequitable in the context of a referendum on United Kingdom voting that the challenges to the count are based on separate legal rights north and south of the border. In order to have title to sue, a person,</p>
<ul><a name="11020172000154"></a>"must be a party...to some legal relationship which gives him some right which the person against whom he raises the action either infringes or denies".</ul>
<p><a name="11020172000115"></a>This is from the case of Nicol (D &amp; J) v Trustees of the Harbour of Dundee 1915.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="11020172000008"></a>In his <I>Report of the Scottish Civil Courts Review,</I> Lord Gill, the Lord Justice Clerk, has recommended in paragraph 25 that the current Scots law on standing is too restrictive and that the separate tests of title and interest should be replaced by a single test: whether the petitioner has demonstrated a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the proceedings. This would make the position the same in Scotland as it is in England for anyone who wanted to challenge the result of the referendum, as recommended by Lord Gill. The amendment seeks to give effect to that recommendation.</p>

The position should not be different in England and Scotland. In England, interest is sufficient, which means a general interest-almost in a layman's sense-in the subject matter, whereas in Scotland, interest and title are needed, title meaning, as my noble friend Lord Foulkes said, some legal relationship which gives them a right to sue. The amendment would make Scotland and England the same in relation to whether you are entitled to challenge an electoral process which is identical on both sides of the border. That seems sensible. I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>

He and I well know that the matter has been raised by the Law Society of Scotland. Indeed, I tabled a similar amendment in the previous Parliament.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1361"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1361</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110201-0002.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="11020172000011"></a>The amendment would amend the provisions so that a challenge brought through judicial review in Scotland can be launched if its purposes are on the same basis as proceedings elsewhere. In Scotland, there are two separate tests for bringing judicial review, in that a petitioner has to demonstrate both title and interest, whereas in England, Wales and Northern Ireland there is a single test of interest alone.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="11020172000012"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, also mentioned the recommendation made by Lord Gill, the Lord Justice Clerk, in his <I>Report of the Scottish Civil Courts Review</I>. However, I am concerned that because of the way in which this amendment is drafted, it will not have the desired effect. By stating that,</p>
<ul><a name="11020172000155"></a>"the petitioner's interest alone shall be sufficient to enable a petition to be lodged",</ul>
<p><a name="11020172000116"></a>it has almost gone too far and would effectively disapply the need to establish all other matters when considering a case for judicial review-including, indeed, whether there is sufficient legal grounds for a challenge.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="11020172000013"></a>The other, perhaps more practical, point is that it is difficult to see what the practical effect would be, as we think it is likely that the Scottish courts would entertain a judicial review from any elector entitled to vote at the referendum or at parliamentary elections and any permitted participant. By their very nature, they have an interest-they were taking part in the election.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="11020172000014"></a>We should be mindful of the fact that this issue goes wider than the referendum alone. It raises important issues about the nature of judicial review in Scotland, not least those flowing from Lord Gill's report, and the circumstances in which they should be permitted to raise petitions for judicial review. That is an important issue. It is one that undoubtedly is receiving detailed consideration, not least by the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament. It would not be helpful if this Bill somehow tried to pre-empt it on an ad hoc basis, particularly, as I have indicated, we believe that an elector in Scotland would be able to raise a petition.</p>

I am not quite clear.</p>

That is not specific to this referendum. We have a quite important change in the law of judicial review in Scotland anyway and it goes along with numerous other recommendations on civil procedure in the Scottish courts. These matters are, I am aware, under consideration, but it would not be appropriate in this Bill to do it on a one-off basis, particularly in circumstances where we believe that being a participant in the referendum, one would qualify to challenge, if indeed that situation should ever arise.</p>

I read the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, as saying that the current requirement in Scotland for judicial review is title and interest. He is expressing the view from the Dispatch Box that if you were an elector in the relevant election that you wished to challenge-the referendum-that would give you title and interest for the purpose of Scottish judicial review. That being so, the difficulties and dangers of trying to do an ad hoc change here do not arise and we should be reassured that any elector would be able to bring a judicial review challenge in Scotland, just as they would in England.</p>

The worry would be that there could, theoretically, be people advising in Scotland who will be unaware of the discussion now taking place and of the deliberate abstention from following up Lord Gill's advice on a one-off basis on this very point, where there is potentially a conflict between the practice in Scotland and that in England. Would it not be possible to think of some way of putting on to the statute book information so that anyone advising would see that title and interest were thought to be, by the Minister or by the Government, both present in this case?</p>

I think it is satisfactory as it stands, but I understand what the noble Lord is saying: that there may be circumstances where, in the absence of any reference, someone may not appreciate that fact. Without making any commitment, I will look at that and see whether there is a way. As I have indicated, as the amendment stands there is a problem, too. In fact on interest alone, regardless of anything else, it would qualify and I am sure that is not what the noble Lord intended.</p>

Now, if the Government are in a position to reimburse such reasonable expenditure prior to the referendum, should that information not be communicated to local authorities?

The Government appear, in the answer that the noble and learned Lord gave me, to be to some extent offering them the resources as long as the expenditure is reasonable. Perhaps the Minister might write to me on this point, because I am sure that local authorities will have picked up on his responses to my earlier interventions.</p>

I do not think that I need to elaborate on what I said to him before. I want to indicate briefly that Schedule 1 makes provision about the key aspects of the conduct of the referendum and the regulation of the referendum campaign. The approach of the Government in doing this has really been to replicate the provisions that are made for parliamentary elections, where they are appropriate. However, there are some areas where we need to make specific provision to tailor-make the provisions for this referendum. On the campaign spending and funding framework already in place for referendums, what there is under the PPERA will generally apply. I commend this schedule to the Committee inasmuch as it tries to replicate, wherever appropriate, the rules which are now well tried and tested.</p>

However, I was particularly grateful for the intervention from the noble Lord, Lord Neill, on the Cross Benches, and for the Minister's response: that he will look at this again to see whether there is a way to achieve it so that Scots and English people will have the same rights guaranteed on both sides of the border, without any court having to make a decision and without creating a precedent which might cause any difficulties for other aspects of judicial review. On the basis that the Minister has been very helpful in giving me that assurance, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Amendments 112A and 112B are to some extent probing amendments, while Amendment 112C goes a bit further than that. The first two refer to the publication of the notice of the referendum and the notice of poll. They would change the publication of the notice of the referendum from not later than the 25th day before the day of the referendum to not later than the 30th day and the notice of poll from not later than the 15th day to not later than the 20th day. The idea of this is that in a number of elections recently the elbow room between the publication of the notice and the notice of call and the actual referendum itself has not given enough time for the issue of postal ballots or the return of postal ballots and all the other procedures in between that need to take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="11020172000033"></a>Before the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, jumps up and says that this only deals with the referendum and that there are elections as well, let me say that I fully understand that consequential amendments will be required in relation to that if we agree Amendments 112A and 112B. But more elbow room needs to be given. I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, having been involved in so many elections, my noble friend Lord Collins, who masterminded elections for a number of years, and others who have been involved in elections will know that that timetable has created some problems for those involved in the practical operation of elections and referenda.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="11020172000034"></a>Amendment 112C would change the polling hours, currently 7 am to 10 pm, to 6 am to 11 pm. I think that we should do everything possible to make it easier for people to vote. Extending the arrangements for postal voting has been particularly helpful. The fact that you no longer have to prove that you are incapacitated to get a postal vote and that people on holidays can get postal votes has made it easier for such people to vote.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="11020172000035"></a>I would like to see us move towards a situation where voting took place at weekends so that you did not have to rush to do so on a working day between 7 am and 10 pm. If you could vote on either a Saturday or a Sunday, that would take account of religious objections to voting only on a Sunday and would make it much easier for people to cast their vote. As I said to the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, if that were agreed for the referendum, there would be consequential amendments in relation to the election.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="11020172000036"></a>I have accepted that I cannot change the dates to Saturday and Sunday. However, I have been more modest and suggested an hour earlier in the morning and an hour later at night. We were talking earlier about people in Sheffield and elsewhere turning up at 10 pm and not being able to vote at the last election, and this proposal is one way of resolving that. It gives a bit more time for people to vote in the complicated election and referendum situation that we are going to have. It also takes into account different working patterns.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="11020172000037"></a>Some people find it difficult to vote between 7 am and 10 pm, and anything that makes it easier for them to do so will be helpful. There are people who start work at 7 am and, for their own reasons, may not be able to get to the polling station by 10 pm. There are people whose life patterns and activities have changed. There are some people who are doing two jobs who will find it difficult. This just makes it that little bit easier for people to get to vote and anything that helps in that direction should be encouraged.</p>

There are two types of people in particular that this amendment would help. There is still what is called a three-shift pattern in factories and elsewhere of 6 am to 2 pm, 2 pm to 10 pm, which known as a back shift, and 10 pm to 6 am on a night shift. I worked that pattern myself for many years. The 6-to-2 shift sounds great-you get into work at 6 am, finish at 2 pm and have the rest of the day to yourself. Unfortunately, most people who have worked that shift will tell you that they spend most of the afternoon lying asleep on the couch, trying to catch up with the disruption to the normal sleep pattern and normal shift pattern. You can wake up feeling disorientated at times. It may sound a bit silly but I can assure people that the disruption to your normal pattern, in working that three-shift pattern, can have that effect on you.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="11020172000039"></a>There is also the back shift between 2 pm and 10 pm. It sounds great-you can get up in the morning and have time to do plenty of things before you start work at two o'clock. But you can have quite an extended travel time to get to work for 2 pm and, with other things to do in the morning, you may find that by the time you finish work at 10 pm the polling station is closed. As for the people who do the night shift, again it sounds great, as you have plenty of time during the day, but ask anyone who works the night shift and they will tell you that their day is disrupted. If there is a constantly changing shift pattern, working a different shift each week following the 6-to-2, 2-to-10 and 10-to-6 three-shift pattern, I can assure your Lordships that there is a disruption to the patterns of sleep and behaviour.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="11020172000040"></a>The second category is a new and developing pattern to which my noble friend Lord Foulkes of Cumnock has referred. This is the growing number of people who manage two jobs, particularly women. It always seems to be women who get landed with the part-time jobs, though they are not quite cheap labour thanks to the Labour Government's national minimum wage law that was opposed by the Liberals and Tories at the time. Nevertheless, these people are trying to keep two jobs going and are rushing between them. An extra hour's voting time at the end of the day will give people an extended opportunity to vote.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="11020172000041"></a>I believe that that category of part-time workers is growing. Again, I do not like it but they are mostly women workers because they have got to snatch a job of two or three hours to cope with child care and all the rest of it. They have to dive back, run a house, and probably get their man fed and out to work. There are some areas in the world where women still do not have a proper place in life. Keeping family together falls harder on women than on men, and I regret to say that a sexist society still operates like that. I would certainly support anything that can help women and part-time workers in that category. I would indicate my strong support particularly for Amendment 112C.</p>

It is effectively the same as the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Foulkes in that it proposes that the polls should shut at 11 pm. The

There may be reasons why that is a bad thing. I will wait to hear what the Minister says.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="11020172000043"></a>The next group of amendments, which would have been moved by my noble friend Lord Rooker, but which I will move because he cannot be here, seek to deal with the overcrowded polling stations issue, which we have already discussed and in which there was an impressive intervention by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern. There was quite broad support for the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips. The amendment that proposes that the polls should shut at 11 pm, as opposed to 10 pm, might, subject to the information that the Minister has, be of assistance in relation to that. If the number of people who would vote between 10 pm and 11 pm was quite low-even though there might be a late surge-it would reduce the likelihood of what happened in the previous general election happening again. It might, for that additional reason, be worth contemplating.</p>

<a name="11020172000044"></a><b><a name="110201-0002.htm_spnew65"></a><a name="11020172000194"></a>Lord Wallace of Tankerness:</b> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, for raising these issues with his amendments, which would provide electors with earlier notice of the referendum and give voters extra hours to cast their ballots. As noble Lords are aware, it is the Government's intention that the referendum should be held on 5 May. Therefore, any alterations to the timetable and the hours of polling proposed for the referendum would inevitably create inconsistencies between the rules governing the referendum on the one hand and those governing the elections scheduled to take place on 5 May, with which the referendum will be combined, on the other. Fundamentally, this would be confusing and unhelpful for voters. Noble Lords may already have noted that that view is supported by the Electoral Commission. The amendment would also be inconsistent with the combination of rules in Schedules 5 to 8 to the Bill.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="11020172000045"></a>I turn to the first part of the amendment, which deals with the referendum timetable and the issuing of the notice of poll. With the exception of the Scottish parliamentary election, the 25-day timetable will be used for all other polls that are scheduled to take place on 5 May 2011. During the Bill's passage through Parliament, we specifically amended the deadline for issuing the notice of poll from 16 to 15 days before the date of the poll. The noble Lord's amendment would take that up to 20 days before the date of the poll. The purpose of the amendment was to ensure that a consistent deadline for the publication of the notice of poll applied for most of the polls that will be combined across the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="11020172000046"></a>Only in Scotland will the deadlines for publication of the notice of the two combined polls be different from each other, due to a slightly different timetable that applies to Scottish parliamentary elections. However, moving the deadline to 20 days before the poll would lead to inconsistency right across the United Kingdom and potential confusion for voters and electoral administrators. The Electoral Commission will take steps, however, to ensure that electors are aware of the referendum before the statutory timetable commences, and electors will not have to wait until notice of poll is

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="11020172000047"></a>I turn now to the amendment on polling hours. It is an important amendment and important arguments have been adduced in its favour. It would extend the polling hours for the referendum, which could be difficult for polling staff and polling agents. It may even be difficult for people who rely on public transport to get to a polling station for 6 am for the opening of the poll. At the end of the day, extending the close of poll by one hour could have implications for the staff at the time of verification, not least in those cases where two polls will be combined on one day. However, perhaps more importantly, it could be confusing to voters to have polls taking place on the same day but closing at different times. Under this proposal, voters would turn up before 7 am or after 10 pm to vote in the referendum, but would perhaps be told that they were unable to vote in the Scottish parliamentary election, the Welsh National Assembly election or some of the local government elections in England. I suspect that would increase, rather than reduce, the possibility of voters missing their opportunity to vote, which could cause some dissension.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="11020172000048"></a>The important point, which I think the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, mentioned, is that the opportunities for postal voting and voting by proxy are now such that if the current polling hours are unsuitable for electors, they still have the opportunity to vote. I readily accept that in many cases work patterns and family patterns may make it difficult, but it is now possible to vote either by proxy or by post. As we all know from taking a keen interest in elections, the number of postal votes has increased considerably; obviously a good number of people take that opportunity. It may be that the message about opportunities for postal and proxy voting can be reinforced in the context of information relating to the polls.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="11020172000049"></a>It is also important that the issue regarding the timetable for the polls goes wider than the referendum alone. It should perhaps be reviewed in the longer term for future national elections and referendums. With these words and assurances, I hope the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

That would test those hours. I am particularly interested in Amendment 112C. Could we look at the possibility of some kind of pilot in an election in a selected area to see if it made any difference?</p>

Although we are rushed in this, I hope that, for future elections, the Electoral Commission could look at longer hours and, perhaps, different days. I think the Minister said towards the end of his reply that he wanted this. Pilots have been done. As my noble friend Lord Collins would remind me, we had an all-postal-vote pilot in the north of England, which had a very interesting result. I should perhaps have declared my interest as a postal voter. I accept what the Minister has said but I hope we will look at ways in which we can make it easier for people to vote, such as voting at weekends and longer voting hours. If it can be done with one or two pilots, as my noble friend Lord McAvoy said, that would be very useful. In view of the Minister's very helpful reply, I will withdraw the amendment.</p>

There are three of them, two of which seek to deal with the chaos at the end of the general election. On page 32, paragraph 13(1) of Schedule 2 to the Bill, "Rules for the Conduct of the Referendum", provides that:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30"></a><a name="11020172000134"></a>"The counting officer must provide a sufficient number of polling stations and, subject to the following provisions of this rule, must allot the electors to the polling stations in whatever manner the officer thinks most convenient".</p>

<p><a name="11020172000054"></a>My noble friend Lord Rooker proposes that that be amended so that,</p>
<ul><a name="11020172000158"></a>"no polling station shall be allocated more than 1050 electors".</ul>
<p><a name="11020172000055"></a>If you put a limit on the number of electors sent to a polling station, you reduce the chance of there being the chaos that there was at the previous general election.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="11020172000056"></a>The next amendment in this group is Amendment 120. At page 35 of the Bill, paragraph 17(1) says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="11020172000135"></a>"The counting officer must provide each presiding officer with however many ballot boxes and ballot papers the counting officer thinks are necessary".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="11020172000057"></a>My noble friend Lord Rooker proposes amending that to ensure that the counting officer in every ballot station has as many ballot papers as there are electors allocated to that polling station. That is sensible because it means that they cannot run out of ballot papers. Again, it is a way of reducing chaos.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="11020172000058"></a>The final amendment in this group is Amendment 121. On page 35-I know all noble Lords are following this in their own copies of the Bill because it is so completely fascinating-sub-paragraph (7) says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="11020172000136"></a>"In every compartment of every polling station there must be exhibited the notice-</p>

Put no other mark on the ballot paper, or your vote may not be counted'".</ul>
<p><a name="11020172000059"></a>If noble Lords turn to page 61, they will see that, instead of "Mark one box only", the wording in the second paragraph of the notice given there is:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33"></a><a name="11020172000137"></a>"Vote in one box only".</p>

<p><a name="11020172000119"></a>If noble Lords go to page 67, line 25, they will see the phrase:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_34"></a><a name="11020172000138"></a>"Vote in ONE box only. Do not put any other mark on the ballot paper".</p>

<p><a name="11020172000139"></a>If noble Lords go to page 74, they will see in paragraph 2:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_35"></a><a name="11020172000140"></a>"Vote in one box only. Put no other mark on the ballot paper".</p>

<p><a name="11020172000060"></a>My noble friend Lord Rooker says that "Mark one box only" and,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"></a><a name="11020172000141"></a>"Vote in one box only",</p>

<p><a name="11020172000120"></a>say the same thing; that it is confusing to have different phrases on different notices; and that we should use the same phrase,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"></a><a name="11020172000142"></a>"Vote in one box only",</p>

<p><a name="11020172000121"></a>right across the notices given to electors. That seems extremely sensible, so his amendment, which affects page 35, rule 17(7), is to take out the words "Mark one box only" and put in the words</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"></a><a name="11020172000143"></a>"Vote in one box only",</p>

<p><a name="11020172000122"></a>because that is the phrase used everywhere else. It is difficult to imagine-though I am quite sure that the noble and learned Lord will have some clever answer for this-why different phrases were used.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="11020172000061"></a>The first two amendments avoid the chaos. The third amendment-I am not sure why it is in this group, but it is easy to deal with in this group-is to ensure consistency in the instructions given to electors. I beg to move.</p>

We all remember what happened at the general election, where people were queueing at polling stations because the flow of people simply could not be accommodated, and we can all agree that at this referendum election there is certainly going to be more confusion than there is at a normal parliamentary election, where everyone understands what is required of them. It is the simplest possible thing to have to do-put a cross by their favoured candidate-and we all accept the result; at least, the vast majority of us accept the result.</p>

I predict with complete certainty that, should we go down the road to AV, there will be far more spoiled ballot papers than there normally are-that has been the case with every move away from first past the post. Staying with the referendum, there will be people who will seek the advice of polling clerks. I do not know what the law is if they seek that advice. Are the polling clerks expected

It must therefore follow, surely, that we need to make special provisions for this very unusual election where there is bound to be more confusion. I cannot be confident that there will be large numbers of people voting, but we need to allow for that and we clearly were not allowing for that effectively at the last general election. Amendment 115 is presented with characteristic simplicity and common sense in the name of my noble friend Lord Rooker and I strongly support it.</p>

We had made recommendations as to what should be on the ballot paper; the civil servants basically took over the agenda and wrote the question; I objected very strongly, but of course as usual, I was overruled on the detail; and the result was that a lot of ballot papers in the first mayoral elections in London were wasted because of the framing of the question.</p>

Therefore, I hope that a debate takes place within the department about whether the current wording in these areas of instruction is right and whether the wording that my noble friend wishes to introduce for the benefit of people voting in the referendum might be better. The Minister should take this as a very serious amendment: it might not be the final wording, but let there be a further debate, because if it does not take place, the danger is that the events of the first mayoral elections in London may well be repeated.</p>

They raise important issues which it is very helpful for the Committee to have the opportunity to address. Amendment 115 obliges by law that counting officers should not allocate more than 1,050 electors to any polling station within their voting areas. This is a very worthy and laudable attempt to address the problems, referred to by the noble and learned Lord in moving this amendment, which arose at some polling stations in the May 2010 election, when a number of electors were unable to cast their votes due to queues forming at certain polling stations. Although these incidents were isolated, they are certainly not taken lightly-I emphasise that again.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="11020172000068"></a>It is the responsibility of electoral administrators to provide for the smooth running of the voting process in elections, and that includes contingency plans to cater for events such as when there is a higher than expected turnout at one or more polling stations for which they are responsible for allocating voters and for staffing. The chief counting officer for the referendum is, of course, the chair of the Electoral Commission and she has the power to direct all other counting officers across the United Kingdom who administer the referendum. The Electoral Commission has indicated that the chief counting officer intends to issue directions to counting officers as to the maximum number of electors to be allocated to any polling station and the associated minimum number of staff to be present at each polling station. As I indicated in response to an amendment moved earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, the Electoral Commission has already started to issue guidance to counting officers on the number of polling staff who will be required.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="11020172000069"></a>I am therefore concerned that the amendment would remove any discretion, both of the chief counting officer and of all other counting officers, to decide how many electors should be allocated to each polling station and the number of staff who should be present at each polling station. To give an example, it does not seem sensible to require that a village of, say, 1,200 electors should have two polling stations when there is no suggestion that previous arrangements for that village have proved inadequate. Indeed, it might even mean that fewer staff were available at each polling station to assist voters. It is that kind of flexibility which we would not like to remove from the chief counting officer.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="11020172000070"></a>We know that queues arose in the elections of May last year primarily because of planning failures and the lack of effective contingency planning. However, we believe that at the polls being held in May this year, better guidance, better staff training and support and better planning procedures in the run-up to the polls would be more appropriate and more effective in addressing the issues that have been raised, as opposed to placing statutory limits on the number of voters who can be allocated. I hope that the chief counting officer's stated intention to issue directions to counting officers on this issue will reassure noble Lords and that the House will recognise that the amendment would reduce flexibility, and that that in turn could increase risks and not necessarily prove good value for money.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="11020172000071"></a>On the second amendment, which would oblige all counting officers to print 100 per cent of ballot papers, I must say that until last year I always thought that that was the case anyway. The purpose is that they should print the same number of ballot papers as there are voters on the electoral register in their area of responsibility. Currently, they must print only the number of ballot papers that they feel is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="11020172000072"></a>As the Electoral Commission notes, there were problems with ballot papers at the previous general election. The <I>Report on the Administration of the 2010 UK General</I><I>Election</I> stated at paragraph 5.13:</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1373"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1373</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39"></a><a name="11020172000144"></a>"We are also aware of some isolated reports that voters at a small number of polling stations may also have experienced other problems. These included ... polling stations where supplies of ballot papers ran out during polling day before being replenished".</p>

<p><a name="11020172000123"></a>Even though these incidents were isolated and do not appear to have stopped anyone casting their votes, we certainly do not take that situation lightly. It is the responsibility of electoral administrators to provide for the smooth running of the voting process. That includes contingency plans to cater for events such as a higher than expected turnout.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="11020172000073"></a>However, I hope to reassure the Committee that the intention of the amendment can be achieved without the need for its inclusion in primary legislation. The chief counting officer for the referendum-as I have already indicated, she is also chair of the Electoral Commission-has the power to direct all other counting officers who administer the referendum. Further discussions with the Electoral Commission have identified that the chief counting officer intends to direct all counting officers to print 100 per cent of their ballot papers. The Electoral Commission believes that the power of direction allows the chief counting officer to require counting officers to print ballot papers according to her direction. This allows her suitable flexibility to be able to decide what is right in particular circumstances, should this be necessary. I hope that the chief counting officer's stated intention to direct that 100 per cent of ballot papers be printed will reassure the Committee, but equally we believe that the Electoral Commission's preference for the chief counting officer to have flexibility in this area should also be respected.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="11020172000074"></a>Finally with regard to Amendment 121, I take the point that wording is important. However, I do not accept the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, that holding the local elections and the referendum together will cause huge difficulty given that last year a general election and local elections were held together, and that is not unprecedented. The amendment seeks to modify the wording of the notice which must be exhibited in polling stations across the country on the date of the poll. This is a helpful and sensible amendment and would ensure consistency with the formulation of words used in a number of forms in the Bill, to which the noble and learned Lord drew our attention, such as the postal voting statement, declaration of identity and proxy poll cards. The noble and learned Lord asked me to explain the measure. I draw the Committee's attention to rule 10 of this schedule on page 31 of the Bill, which grants the chief counting officer responsible for administering the poll the discretion to amend the voter-facing materials prescribed by the Bill for the purposes of making these materials easier for voters to use or understand. This encompasses the notice prescribed by rule 17(7), which is the subject matter of this amendment.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="11020172000075"></a>I do not think that it would be helpful at this stage for the Committee to amend aspects of the Bill which are the subject of future modification by the chief counting officer. We know that she is considering the modifications that she may wish to make to these voter-facing materials, and the Government do not wish at this time to pre-empt any decisions which she may take to amend them. However, I assure the Committee that the Government have discussed this

Practical issues have been raised but I hope I have reassured the Committee that an element of discretion is left to the Electoral Commission and that these very important issues are being addressed. On that basis I ask the noble and learned Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

I am not sure that I made it clear that my concern was not about holding local elections and a referendum on the same day but about the fact that the referendum itself was something entirely new. The question voters are going to be asked is whether they support the first past the post system or the alternative vote system. However, a lot of people will be confronted with that question for the first time in their lives and it would not be surprising if they found filling in their ballot paper rather more confusing than normal.</p>

However, unfortunately, it did not quite hit the mark on any of the three amendments. I completely take his point that it would be ridiculous to have two stations in certain places because you might have a village with 1,051 electors. However, I wonder whether that would not be best dealt with by saying that the norm should be 1,050 electors, save where there are exceptional circumstances, because generally you are trying to get to a figure of 1,050.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="11020172000078"></a>Secondly, I was confused by the noble and learned Lord's answer in relation to what the chair of the Electoral Commission intends to do. I understood him to say that she intends to direct that 100 per cent of ballot papers be printed, but that she wants flexibility. But what does she want flexibility for if she intends to instruct that 100 per cent of ballot papers be printed? Why not put in the Bill what I understood the first part of the noble and learned Lord's answer to indicate what she intended to do? That would give certainty.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="11020172000079"></a>Thirdly, in relation to the difference between the notice and the form, the noble and learned Lord took a good shot at this but I do not think that he said that there was any particular reason why they were different. As my noble friend Lord Grocott says, this will be a completely novel experience for voters to vote on whether there should be first past the post or an alternative vote system. There needs to be clarity. Yes, he is right that the chief counting officer has the power to change the forms but the wording of the Bill is mandatory. For example, paragraph 17(7) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40"></a><a name="11020172000145"></a>"In every compartment of every polling station there must be exhibited the notice-</p>
'Mark one box only'".
<p><a name="11020172000124"></a>If I were the chair of the Electoral Commission, although I had a power to make changes, in the context of mandatory language I would feel safest, legally, in not making a change. We agree that it is much better if the wording is the same right across all the material. One of the purposes of scrutinising this

That would make for a better organised poll and would get rid of any difficulty or risk in that regard for the chair of the Electoral Commission.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="11020172000080"></a>I absolutely respect the effort that the noble and learned Lord has made but my noble friend Lord Rooker may bring all three of these amendments back, with a slightly different amendment in one case and broadly the same amendment in the other two. In the case of the third amendment, it would help greatly if he were willing to go through the Bill and ensure that the wording is consistent, as his officials can do that much more quickly and much more consistently than we can. On that note, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

Is that right? Looking at it to start with you want it to apply to sub-paragraph (5) as well, but sub-paragraph (5) appears to go in the drafting because the deletion in the amendment goes up to the second "or" in the second line. You would not want a vote not to be counted if the polling station happened to be in the wrong district. I assume that sub-paragraph (5) is deleted because it is included in sub-paragraph (4), or am I wrong about that? I cannot see any reason why a technical failure of the position of the polling station in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland should vitiate the vote. I assume it is because the polling stations in sub-paragraph (5) are included in sub-paragraph (4). Officials are nodding. It might be better if the noble and learned Lord says yes.</p>

This small amendment refers to the sealing of ballot boxes before the commencement of the poll, as provided for in the rules for conduct of the referendum given in Schedule 2 to the Bill. The schedule currently advises that the presiding officer must show "anyone present" in the polling station immediately before the commencement of the poll that the ballot box is empty. My noble friend's argument-we do not make too much of this or say that it is a major issue-is that this should be changed to require the presiding officer to show "the first elector" who comes to vote in that polling station that the ballot box is empty.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="11020172000086"></a>We believe that the amendment would add a degree of precision to the requirement on the presiding officer and add to confidence in the legitimacy and validity of the poll and its result. Being more specific about who is to see and verify that the ballot box is empty is a small but important symbol that the poll is to be carried out properly. It is too vague to say "anyone present". That could be the cleaner or the person who is with the presiding officer to help with the running of the poll. Why not require that the first elector who comes through the door should see that the ballot box is empty before casting their vote, which would be the first one in the box? As I said, this is not a major amendment, but I think that it deserves an answer. I beg to move.</p>

We have good traditions and symbolism in British democracy. I have been an election agent and a candidate. I thought that it was the law that either the agent or candidate could see inside each ballot box before it was locked. That happened regularly. Perhaps it was only in council elections-I am not sure, but I used to see it quite often. I agree very strongly with entrenching the symbolism so that it is not just anyone who sees that part of the procedure. Perhaps we could embellish our democracy a bit by making a bit of a tradition and a bit of a show, to get people there and show that the box is indeed empty. While folk may scorn that type of thing, nevertheless it would show clearly the symbolism that our democracy is vibrant and seen to be so.</p>

I tabled a number of amendments dealing with individual registration but none in this particular area because it had not dawned on me at the time that, in the very different world in which we now live, there might be those who, in certain conditions, might be prepared to abuse the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="11020172000091"></a>I think particularly of the comments by the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, about ballots that she believed had been in contravention of correct process. I acknowledge that at times it is difficult to tell whether the noble Baroness is speaking on behalf of the Government, the coalition, the Conservative Party or a faction within the Conservative Party. For example, I think of her comments immediately after the Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election about the right wing of the Conservative Party. I also think of her comments the previous night on BBC2's "Newsnight" programme in connection with the Royal Bank of Scotland-I regret I was unable to be in the House this afternoon when this matter was handled in Questions-when the noble Baroness said that the Government were renegotiating contracts with executives of RBS. Since then, the Treasury has been very keen to suggest that it is not doing anything of the sort. However, the comments made by the noble Baroness on electoral issues were ones that we should take careful note of when considering this amendment.</p>

I would like to see ballot boxes that are transparent, so that it is possible for people to see their vote going into the box.

On the other hand, when thinking of the mechanics of polling day, one has to consider that sometimes people do not fold the ballot paper properly and if that happened in a transparent box it would show who the person had voted for, or did not vote for, which would render the vote invalid because someone was able to identify it.</p>

I would rather we did not have ballot boxes at all and voted electronically, but that is a personal campaign which I have been running for a long time. I include in that this place as well. I notice that we will be able to bring electronic devices into the Chamber-but perhaps not yet-and then we can start to vote through them as well.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="11020172000097"></a>I have one question for my noble friend who moved the amendment. Who exactly is the first elector? In certain circumstances, those who work at the polling station can be electors in that seat. They could be given the right to vote prior to the polls actually opening. That is a bending of the rules but I think it happens. It is an easy way to ensure that someone who is working all day has the opportunity to vote first. How would my noble friend respond to such circumstances? I think there is some case for saying that the rules must be absolute and that the polling station must not open until 7 or 8 am, whichever election it is, and that no one can vote before then. I have a suspicion that in the past people have been allowed to vote just before the polling station opens.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="11020172000101"></a>I have, I promise, a very short anecdote to tell. At one time, the Labour Party was doing extremely badly in the polls and in November 1983 a friend of mine took his young son with him to the polling station. I will not name my friend as I am not sure this is legal, but his young son actually made the cross on the ballot paper and put it in the big black box. Thinking of the ballot as a lottery, the lovely little boy, who is now very grown-up, said, "Which one wins, Dad? Is it the first one out?". In 1983, many Labour Party members would have said, "If only".</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="11020172000102"></a>What is interesting about that story, which has kept with me, is the excitement of a young person going to vote and the idea that the first elector would have a role in the endorsement of the process. I am sure that any of us who are involved politically would make sure that it was one of ours who was there, a young person or someone who had just got the voting right because they had become a British citizen. We would make something of that to give the citizen a particular tick to that process. I hope that that may be given serious consideration.</p>

Surely, if this changes the regulations for the referendum, it will create problems if the old system will be continued for the local government and Scottish Parliament elections. The noble Lord, Lord Rennard, raised that point several times in previous debates. It is a valid point and something that my noble friend Lord Bach should address. I am not against that in principle but if we have a different system for checking the ballot box for the referendum from that in the Scottish, Welsh and local government elections, that might create problems.</p>

That creates some confusion as to who the first elector will be.</p>

We know that a Bill is coming in on the funding of political parties. If the Long Title of that Bill was sufficiently wide, we might introduce a whole series of amendments governing elections and political parties. That might well be the peg, and we should be prevailing on the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, to push his luck with Ministers to secure an early introduction of legislation.</p>

Now I know why the noble Lord, Lord Rennard, enjoys being such a nitpicker. It is quite fun challenging the amendments put forward by Labour Peers.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para109"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="11020172000108"></a>However, I think that the intention behind what my noble friend suggests is absolutely right. In a number of elections overseas, ballot boxes have been stuffed in advance by supporters of one candidate or another and elections have been challenged. That could happen in a referendum. The principle is very important, notwithstanding the technical problem that I have raised in the unavoidable absence of the noble Lord, Lord Rennard.</p>

We resist the amendment, which, apart from anything else, we believe to be defective. The amendment requires the presiding officer immediately before the commencement of a poll to show the first elector, rather than anyone present in the polling station, that the ballot box is empty.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="11020172000110"></a>However, as the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, pointed out, no elector would be allowed into the polling station prior to the poll commencing at 7 am, which means that the presiding officer would be unable to show the first elector that the ballot box was empty before the start of the poll. In addition to the timing difficulties associated with the amendment, it can be argued that it is not necessary, as referendum agents will be able to appoint polling agents who may observe the presiding officer showing the empty ballot boxes before they are sealed prior to the start of the poll. Therefore, the question does not arise.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43"></a><a name="11020172000148"></a>"Immediately before the commencement of the poll, the presiding officer must show anyone present in the polling station that the ballot box is empty".</p>

<p><a name="11020172000125"></a>I should perhaps have made this point in moving the amendment, but what happens-and I do not suppose that this is normal-if the presiding officer is the only person? The poll commences at a certain time. It must begin at the time set by statute or by statutory instrument. If he happens to be the only one who has turned up, the presiding officer would presumably have to show anyone present and the only person present is himself. I am sure that is not what is intended. The current language is not satisfactory.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="11020172000112"></a>I think my noble friend Lord Maxton is wrong on this occasion. In almost every case that I know of, those who work on elections do a great job as polling clerks and have postal votes. As my noble friend Lady Golding told the committee, they are obliged to have postal votes because they do not know where they are

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="11020172000113"></a>Because of the extraordinary support I had for this amendment, I am very tempted indeed to seek the opinion of the Committee, but in spite of pleas from behind me, what has held me back is that I think the clinching point was made by my noble friend Lord Foulkes. If we were to do it for the referendum only, it would leave a difference between practices in other elections and practices in the referendum. As my noble friend said, the answer is that there should be government legislation to amend electoral rules, but I cannot see that legislation coming through in a great hurry, so with enormous reluctance I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="11020178000006"></a>I would like now to move to Schedule 2. A particular part of the schedule that is of interest to me is the question of the provision of polling stations, which is a matter of considerable controversy in constituencies throughout the country. Rule 13(1) in Schedule 2 states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49"></a><a name="11020178000097"></a>"The counting officer must provide a sufficient number of polling stations and, subject to the following provisions of this rule, must allot the electors to the polling stations in whatever manner the officer thinks most convenient".</p>

<p><a name="11020178000089"></a>Rule 13(2) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50"></a><a name="11020178000098"></a>"One or more polling stations may be provided in the same room"</p>

<p><a name="11020178000090"></a>Rule 13(3) states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51"></a><a name="11020178000099"></a>"In England, the polling station allotted to electors from any parliamentary polling district wholly or partly within a particular voting area must, in the absence of special circumstances, be in the parliamentary polling place for that district unless the parliamentary polling place is outside the voting area".</p>

<p><a name="11020178000091"></a>Rule 9 refers to the use of schools and public rooms:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="11020178000100"></a>"The counting officer may use, free of charge, for the purpose of taking the poll-</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53"></a><a name="11020178000101"></a>(a) a room in a school within paragraph (3)".</p>

<p><a name="11020178000092"></a>Paragraph (3) of rule 9 then goes on to make provision for schools in England and Wales, and in Scotland.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="11020178000007"></a>Now, the location of polling stations in individual constituencies-not only in elections, but particularly in this referendum-has a major effect on turnout. We cannot rely on a postal vote system, which some of us have great reservations about anyhow although it was part of the package introduced by the previous Government. Of course, the Government themselves obviously had reservations about what they were doing on postal voting, but it was felt that those changes would bring greater integrity into the electoral system. The question is, if turnout is affected by polling station location, to what extent can the public indicate where they believe polling stations should be situated?</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1383"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1383</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110201-0002.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="11020178000008"></a>We know that parish authorities very often make representations to local authorities to secure the location. Also, other organisations within individual communities -schools, church groups, women's institutes and all kinds of voluntary organisations-sometimes make representations. I have found over the years that very often there is indifference within local authorities to the protests of people who object to the location of polling stations, particularly to where they are inconvenient. I remember that, in my then constituency in the county of Cumbria, on occasions I would go to the local authority and say, "Look, provision here isn't satisfactory". Very often the local authority was very sensitive, and changes would be made.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="11020178000009"></a>I now live in Maidenhead and when I voted on the last occasion I had to drive a tremendous distance, even within the town, to go and vote. When I got there, I found the polling station split into various sections, all of which received electors coming in from various parts of Maidenhead. I believe that is wrong. The question is: what chance does an individual elector have to influence decisions on the location of polling stations?</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="11020178000010"></a>My view is that there should be some mechanism that is much more substantial than current arrangements for allowing individual electors and organisations to influence the location of these stations, particularly as their location affects turnout, which is now one of the major issues in Britain's elections. We are seeing progressive reductions in turnout in both general and council elections, so we must find ways of addressing that problem. One way is to increase the number of polling stations. I hope that, in replying to this debate, the noble Lord might comment on this problem which I think arises in many communities.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="11020178000012"></a>The noble Lord will see that the form for a postal vote-form 2-is prescribed on pages 60 and 61 of the Bill. I should say that he might need some advice from his civil servants because I have never had a clear answer to this question. The form requires the person who wants to use a postal vote to fill in the boxes set out in the form. After the individual has filled in their date of birth in one place, a box is provided for the voter's signature. Next to that box, it says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54"></a><a name="11020178000102"></a>"(voter's signature) IMPORTANT-Keep signature within border".</p>

<p><a name="11020178000093"></a>That has always troubled me because many people who vote by post are actually old and infirm, and I have never been quite sure what happens if their signature goes outside the box.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="11020178000013"></a>In a sense this is not a minor point because I wonder whether that means that the vote may not be counted, which is what happens if you make other mistakes or put wrong entries on the form, or whether it simply means that the signature may not be able to be read by electronic means. I have always assumed that the reason for keeping the signature within the box is so that it can be read electronically. That might not be right, so if it is not, I am not sure why it is so important for the signature to be kept within the border.</p>

<a name="110201-0002.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="11020178000015"></a>Again, I know that the Minister may have to take advice on this, but what happens if a voter filling in a form for a postal vote does not keep the signature within the parameters of the box? Is the problem simply that the signature cannot be read electronically but the vote will still be counted because someone will read it manually, or does it mean that the vote will not be counted? Obviously this question does not just apply to this form, but to others as well.</p>

I am lucky because the polling station is in the street where I live, but that is not the case for a lot of people, who have to travel many miles to get to their polling station. The Government ought to look at that problem. At some point in the future-obviously not now-there is a case for a proper revision of electoral law in this country so that it can be brought together for the production of some sort of consolidated Bill.</p>

This is the bit where we should be able to transcend party politics. This has been a closely fought part of our legislative process, but at the end of the day the reality is that, for the referendum to have real value and merit in the development of our constitution, people need to feel confident that it has been conducted in such a manner, and the rules of the legislation have been applied in such a way, that they can relax not only from a partisan point of view but from a citizen's point of view. I urge the Leader of the House, who is a reasonable man, to look at these issues as someone who just wants a proper result for the referendum.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="11020178000018"></a>There is a strong case for all the parties represented in this House to get together to discuss these nuts-and-bolts issues. I remember with some pain Scotland's 1979 referendum, which is an experience that I would not wish to repeat. Earlier I spoke to the noble Lord, Lord McCluskey-who, sadly, is not in his place at the moment-who was talking about some of the pressures that he experienced as a Minister in the Government at that time when looking at how the referendum should be run. There are no two ways about it: there will be huge divisions in every party. That means that the parties must be confident in the structures that exist.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="11020178000021"></a>At an early stage of the Bill my noble friend Lord Boateng made a powerful speech about how this Parliament, the mother of Parliaments, is looked to by Parliaments around the world for its procedures and its respect for the processes of democracy that transcend all that is party political. I urge the Leader of the House to reflect on what my noble friend said on that occasion. At the other end of the world, in Egypt, there are people crying out for the kind of democracy that we take for granted. Here we have an opportunity, at the fag end of a Bill that has been difficult for both sides of the House, to say that our democracy is bigger than the partisan divides.</p>

There is clearly sense in using school-houses for this purpose, not least because, in the past, each village and town would have its own school. I speak with the experience of coming from a rural constituency in Cornwall, where the schools are getting bigger; local village schools are being closed and our children have to travel longer distances to school. This probably makes sense because we are able to give them a better education and ensure that the schools are better resourced with technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="11020178000024"></a>However, it means that people in rural communities who tend to use schools as voting centres will now have to travel a greater distance to the school. This has always been a problem in rural constituencies. My mother never voted until quite late in the day. At about nine o'clock in the evening people would knock on the door and say that she had not voted, and the Conservatives and Liberals would offer cars to take her to the voting station. She always went with the Conservatives because they tended to have rather big cars and she quite liked that. She always voted Labour but she felt that it was a part of the joy of the constitutional process to go in the kind of large car in which, no doubt, the Leader of the House is accustomed to travelling, both in his ministerial office and in his private life.</p>

I am not unattracted by creating a part of the complex of our social life which is not dominated by governmental or quasi-governmental institutions and where a sense of community is fostered. One of the things I suggest to the Leader of the House is that we should give real consideration to looking at nodal and communication points, where people cluster in communities, and see if we can put polling stations in those centres. People clearly now gravitate towards urban shopping centres and out-of-town shopping centres; perhaps we should at least experiment with putting polling stations closer to where people go in their day-by-day life. The local post office is the obvious place, for instance, to have a polling station in a village that has for many years not had a school-house. This observation tends to point me in the direction of supporting the sentiment expressed on this point by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="11020178000026"></a>I wonder if I could also just delay the House for a brief moment to pick up a point made by my noble friend Lord Soley: why the application for a postal vote requires the date of birth at all. Can the Leader of the House explain this? We now operate in a society where it is increasingly regarded as inappropriate to ask people their dates of birth. Indeed, when you interview somebody you are no longer allowed to ask their date of birth; you have to deduce it from their education and their appearance. It seems quite extraordinary that this is a requirement of the postal voting form. There must be a suspicion that, perhaps if one misrepresents one's age-one perhaps becomes accustomed to taking a couple of years off in polite conversation-you might complete the form incorrectly and in so doing prejudice your vote and conceivably the outcome of the whole election. I ask the Leader of the House if he can tell us why it is necessary that people should still be embarrassed by having to disclose their date of birth.</p>

However, not a single amendment has been suggested by noble Lords opposite on this. That suggests that this is the present situation, taking account of the new circumstances of this event. I frankly find it quite extraordinary, in the light of the undertaking given by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, yesterday that we were going to make rapid and sensible progress, that the last 19-before I spoke, 18-minutes seems to have been an attempt just to elongate the evening's proceedings.

It always seems to happen in these deliberations of ours. There is not much toing and froing but there is certainly plenty of toing on our side to try and subject this Bill to scrutiny; and time after time the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, injects a note of acrimony into the proceedings.

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="11020178000031"></a>I am particularly interested in paragraphs 13 and 14 of Schedule 2 on the provision of polling stations. Paragraph 14 says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55"></a><a name="11020178000103"></a>"The counting officer must appoint and pay-</p>
(a) a presiding officer to attend at each polling station".
<p><a name="11020178000032"></a>I find these people very good, on top of their job and they know what they are doing, but occasionally something happens which is not clear. I am seeking clarification from the noble Lord the Leader of the House, if he is able to give that clarification; if not, perhaps he could point me in the direction where I can get it.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="11020178000033"></a>I am trying to find out the power of presiding officers and the extent of their power. Is it confined entirely within the polling station, or does it extend outside? The example I am going to give is relevant to polling stations and I will explain briefly the point on which I seek clarification. In a local election in 2007 in my former constituency, there was a bit of local rivalry-acrimony, even. An independent candidate was standing. Voting was by the PR system, which guaranteed chaos anyway, and there was further chaos because in an area about 50 feet from the polling station entrance the independent candidate had arrayed about six people in a sort of semi-circle. They were stopping people at that distance from the polling station and inquiring as to how they were going to vote and putting pressure on them.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="11020178000034"></a>Folk who are going to the polling station do not like being stopped and questioned. It is bad enough trying to shove a leaflet into their hands-we have all tried that, I think-when you have spent six weeks pushing the candidate's name through the letterboxes everyday. People were being approached and they did not like it. Intimidation is the wrong word to describe what was happening, but nevertheless there was pressure. I spoke to the police on the door. Come election time, people have such respect for our democratic process here in Britain that they are very reluctant to get involved in anything that they have not had experience of before, or they do not have written guidance on.  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1388"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1388</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I then spoke to the presiding officer. It might not have been as bad as saying that people had been hindered going to vote, but it was not far from it. Presiding officers are good people-they have the best of intentions-but they are quite unsure. This went on for several hours and if he had remonstrated there could have been an unpleasant scene.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="11020178000035"></a>I am looking for guidance from the noble Lord the Leader of the House, if he can give it, as to what geographical area a presiding officer has control over outside the polling station. Is it entirely a matter for the police? How should it be handled? I find that contention at polling stations is getting more intense. Sometimes, unfortunately, it is between the political parties, especially in certain hard fought areas. Who exactly, or what procedure, is written in the Bill that would cover the ceasing of such behaviour, and if so what would be the proper channels to put a stop to it?</p>

Members opposite will know I have not spoken that often during these long debates. However, the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, rather than trying to calm things down, actually provokes people into speaking and that is the case in this instance. I just say to my noble friend Lord Myners that the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, may travel in a big limousine, but I travelled on a No. 3 bus with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness, this morning. He does not travel in a big limo.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="11020178000037"></a>At the start of this debate, my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours made a point about the position and number of polling stations, not just in rural areas-which my noble friend Lord Myners raised-but also in urban areas. I remember particularly at one point during my career as a Member of Parliament in Glasgow Cathcart, the local government boundaries were redrawn. One of them went down the middle of Mount Florida, so one side of the road was one local government seat, and on the other side was the other. On one side of the road in that new local government seat, there were two multi-storey blocks of flats. On the other side was the polling station for the road, in the school where those people had gone to vote for all the time that they had been in those flats. Now they were being told to go and vote half a mile or a mile away.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="11020178000038"></a>Many of the people who lived in those flats were elderly. I accept that I am of the age where the bulk of my major campaigning, certainly as a Member of Parliament, was done before that big introduction of postal voting for the elderly. In my day, in order to get a postal vote you had to have a tame doctor who would go along and sign a form. I accept that I am therefore of the elderly. Indeed, I will get a free TV licence on 5 May, the date of the elections and of the referendum, when I will reach the great age of 75. However, the fact is that, while people can now of course use postal voting, many elderly people want to use their vote personally. They want to go out and, if they are fit and able, go to the polling station and cast their vote. My noble friend is quite right to say that the turnout is affected in some cases by where the polling station is situated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="11020178000039"></a>I finish by making the point, yet again, that we would not need polling stations at all as such, and that people would be able to vote anywhere, if we had electronic voting by using ID cards. Indeed, although the Government got rid of ID cards because they said that those were so expensive, if we look at the uses that could be made of an ID card we would actually save money in the long run by having them for everybody.</p>

I have a list here that I got from the Printed Paper Office. Even by my calculations, we have actually got through a majority of the groups for today. I understand that we will finish this Committee stage tomorrow and I cannot see any problem with that whatever. Secondly, on the question of schools, although I heard the comments from my noble friend Lord Myners, we should be looking to get out of using schools as polling stations completely, if we possibly can. That would avoid children losing a day in school.</p>

I am sure that it will make us wonder, in the light of us looking at it in some detail, whether there perhaps should have been one or two amendments, as the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said, I think wrongly, that there had been no discussions on this schedule at all.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="11020178000042"></a>The real problem with this schedule is that we can sense in it that the parliamentary draftsmen-whom I do not blame, as it is a very difficult job-think that it is about the procedure relating to any election. The whole point is that this is not any election. It is fundamentally different, so far as the voter going into the polling booth is concerned, from all the elections that he or she is familiar with, where they know that there will be names there and have, obviously, put their cross by the favoured candidate. However, this is about asking a question and it will not do, for a number of reasons, simply to lift huge chunks that are clearly from existing legislation-I do not blame the draftsmen, as I have said-about the conduct of elections, thinking, "Well, we can just lift this and stick it in and this will be okay for a referendum to change the constitution".</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="11020178000043"></a>I shall give one example. I do not know the answer to it but it is quite significant. A relatively small part of this schedule has the totally innocuous information about the,</p>
<ul><a name="11020178000109"></a>"appointment of presiding officers and clerks".</ul>
<p><a name="11020178000094"></a>We all know the job of a clerk in a polling station, but I submit to the Committee that in a referendum on changing the voting system, that clerk is likely to be presented with difficulties that clerks in polling stations simply do not face. The elector will go in, thinking that he or she is voting principally for a local government candidate. Certainly, in the areas that I am familiar with, it is on who should be their local councillor. They will then be presented with a second ballot paper which will ask the question:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="11020178000104"></a>"At present, the UK uses the 'first past the post' system to elect MPs to the House of Commons. Should the 'alternative vote' system be used instead?".</p>

<p><a name="11020178000095"></a>I put it to the Committee that many people will be going into a polling station for the first time. I am not patronising people or saying the electorate do not

I would be very surprised indeed if no more than one elector then left the cubicle where they were about to vote and asked the clerk who distributed the ballot papers what they were being asked to vote on. That is perfectly plausible and indeed an almost inevitable consequence of what is happening.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="11020178000044"></a>I asked the question-I do not know the answer-whether it is within the law for the clerk to give advice to the would-be voter about what the alternative vote system is. I assume it probably cannot be because presumably I could be a clerk if I applied to be one and I know what I would tell them about the alternative vote system. So presumably it would be completely out of order for clerks to give advice in that way. If that is the case and a confused elector goes to clerk on desk and says, "I am puzzled about this second ballot paper, I understand the first one", at the very least I would suggest that in the appointment of clerks and counting officers on page 33 a script should be offered to them out of courtesy. They would need to know what to say to someone who came to them with that question.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="11020178000045"></a>I doubt whether the Leader of the House when he sums up will have given any thought to this as it is only a small part of the Bill but it illustrates the point that you simply cannot lift the rules that apply to every other kind of election and apply them to this most fundamentally important election of changing the way we vote and thereby changing our constitution. So please can we be told whether there is any law relating to what clerks can do faced with this question? If there is not, should there be or, at the very least, should there be guidance as to what should happen in the polling station when this kind of eventuality arises?</p>

It might well be that some rather keen, over-eager young turks who think that they can push their case might erect rather aggressive advertising material outside polling stations in the referendum to push their case. One would have thought that under Schedule 2 there would be some restriction on the kind of material that could be used in the vicinity of a polling booth.</p>

There are circumstances in which precisely that could happen. There are some very strange people out there who do very strange things and they may well turn up during the referendum campaign.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="11020178000050"></a>I want to raise one or two points on Schedule 2. I had better raise this point rather than have a long discussion on an amendment. I strongly agree with what my noble friend Lady Liddell said. I think it would be useful, and I hope the Minister will consider this, to get together a group of MPs and Peers from all parties to look at some of these schedules in more detail to identify if there are any problems that might arise and make some suggestions to the Government. That seems a very good idea.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="11020178000051"></a>There is one theme running through the whole series of schedules as far as I am concerned: full account has not been taken of the problems arising from the combination of polls. We can deal with this under later schedules. However, there are specific points that I want to raise in relation to Schedule 2. I agree with what my noble friends have said about minimising the use of schools and trying to find community centres and other public buildings-or, indeed, private buildings if we can find them-that can be used so that we do not disrupt the education of children.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="11020178000052"></a>I find paragraph 9(3) of the schedule strange. It refers to "schools within this paragraph" but goes on to exclude private schools. Why are private schools not going to be used? Why does it apply only to local authority schools? Some noble Lords opposite might say, "Local authority schools are paid for with public money", but private schools also, because of their charitable status, get substantial support from public funds. They all have charitable status. I see the looks on the faces of some lovely ladies opposite. I do not know if I am allowed to say that. Perhaps it is sexist and I will be thrown out of Sky Sports for saying it. However, if you think that this is envy on my part, or some kind of horrible class snobbery, have a wee look at my curriculum vitae and you will find something of interest about which you can come back to me.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="11020178000053"></a>My second point concerns paragraph 14(1). I certainly agree with what is suggested by,</p>
<ul><a name="11020178000110"></a>"the officer may not employ a person who has been employed by or on behalf of a permitted participant in or about the referendum".</ul>
<p><a name="11020178000054"></a>People who have been active-there will be a lot of them-in the "Yes to AV" and "No to AV" campaigns should not be appointed as counting officers and should not be at polling stations. Could the Minister tell us how the counting officer will know whether people have been involved in such campaigns? Will there be a form for them to fill in? Will there be an oath to take? Will they have to sign a document saying that they have not been involved? It would be useful to know that.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="11020178000055"></a>The last point that I want to raise-there are many more that I could raise but I do not want to take up too much time-concerns agents. We heard earlier about agents from the two campaigns. In Scotland, the local election areas, Wales and Northern Ireland, there will also be election agents for the parties. There will party agents and agents for the "Yes to AV" and "No to AV" campaigns. Presumably the party agents dealing

Could that be confirmed? People will come in with red, blue, yellow and perhaps tartan-or whatever the SNP decides to use this time-rosettes, as well as ones saying "Yes to AV" and "No to AV". Presumably polling agents will have responsibility, powers and authority to deal with that and to ask questions, as I have done countless times as a polling agent. I am not as old as my noble friend Lord Maxton, but I have been a polling agent on several occasions. You have some rights to go in and check things, such as the number of voters and so on. How is this dealt with?</p>

However, in a sense the problem is even greater than he perhaps realises. I cannot see that most of the people who will be campaigning for the yes vote or the no vote will not be political activists anyway.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="11020178000057"></a>There are not large numbers of us around, so it may very well be that, at the school, some people will be asked to take on a dual role, both as an agent for a party and an agent for one of the campaigns. The problem with that, of course, is that at one school the Conservative agent may be against AV and at another school the Conservative agent may be acting as agent for the yes vote. It is all going to get very complicated.</p>

What I was trying to say and I have been trying to say it in a number of contributions earlier, is that these polls will be far more complicated than we are led to believe by the Government and will cause lots of problems. I have no wish to exacerbate the problems; that is why I strongly support the suggestion of my noble friend Lady Liddell of Coatdyke than an all-party group should be set up to look at these schedules and identify any problems that might arise. That, surely, is us on this side being a wee bit helpful.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, is right that it reflects experience from other elections. Looking at the 15th Marshalled List, Amendments 112A to 122A are specific amendments to Schedule 2, so I am not sure whether the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, was right when he said that there were no amendments to Schedule 2. I am interested in a number of specific issues that relate to the interaction between the referendum and other polls. First, in paragraph 13 (3), it is said that in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland,</p>
<ul><a name="11020178000111"></a>"the polling station allotted to electors from any parliamentary polling district wholly or partly within a particular voting area must ... be in the parliamentary polling place for that district unless the parliamentary polling place is outside the voting area".</ul>
<p><a name="11020178000060"></a>Why is the parliamentary polling area being chosen for a referendum and for the other votes when Parliament is not the district for the count, nor the place for which people are voting? I am surprised that that has been chosen.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="11020178000061"></a>Secondly, paragraph 22-this is for the referendum-places upon the presiding officer the,</p>
<ul><a name="11020178000112"></a>"duty to keep order at the officer's polling station".</ul>



<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1393"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column 1393</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="11020178000062"></a>That makes the presiding officer the person responsible. Is it envisaged that the same presiding officer will be appointed for the local elections and the parliamentary elections? I assume that it is. If not, who is in charge of the polling station? Issues might arise in relation to the conduct of a polling station of the sort, for example, that arose at the end of the general election as to when to close the doors, or what to do about the queues. There needs to be some degree of certainty as to who is in charge. I assume that that will be achieved by the same person being appointed as the polling officer.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="11020178000063"></a>Thirdly, the schedule envisages a polling agent being appointed and a referendum agent being appointed. The purpose, as I understand it, of a referendum agent and a polling agent being appointed is that those two "agents" are responsible for seeking to prevent personation in the polling station. Is it envisaged that this would be two people, or is it envisaged that it would be one person for the same polling station? Do the same rules apply both in relation to electoral law on referendum voting and the polling voting? Can there be a conflict? Again, we would be looking for the same person to be appointed to deal with both.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="11020178000064"></a>The thing that I cannot find in the rules, though I am sure that it is here somewhere, is what prohibitions are there on material relating to the referendum within the polling station? For example, will it be permissible to have within the polling station the "neutral documentation" provided by the Electoral Commission describing the two sorts of system, or will that be prohibited? This relates to the question legitimately raised by my noble friend Lord Grocott regarding the extent to which help on the issues will be provided to individual voters. It is obvious that partisan material should not be provided but what, if any, material will be allowed in the polling station which is genuinely intended to assist voters? If the answer is nil, I would accept that and understand it, but equally I would not regard it as objectionable if neutral material prepared by a neutral body were allowed. It would be useful for the Committee to be given answers to those questions.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, asked whether I was impressed with the depth of her passion on this subject. I confirm that I am. I understand exactly what she was saying. I say to those who echoed her remark about cross-party talks that I am sure that if the Labour Party were to write in and ask for those cross-party talks, that would be accepted, if they have not already taken place. The noble Baroness is right that this matter should be conducted in a non-partisan manner.</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="11020178000066"></a>The debate naturally strayed far and wide across the gamut of electoral law and I will follow up some of the more detailed points in writing. The noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, said that she was frantic, unhappy or depressed-I cannot remember which word she used-about the 1979 referendum. My memory of it is that it went rather well. It had a good result and was excellent in many respects. Therefore, I do not share the noble Baroness's unhappiness, which perhaps shows the width of the gulf between us on these great issues.</p>

Counting officers should have a process in place to determine such cases. Their system should be able to pick up signatures which are valid but stay slightly outside the box. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, asked whether the public can make representations on polling station locations. They can do so.</p>

This is an important point and it is what scrutiny is for. He seems to be saying that in certain circumstances a signature outside the box would invalidate the vote. If that is the case, frankly it ought to be stated on the form that if a person strays outside the box, the vote is invalidated. I know that this applies in other situations but it is an important point. If people, particularly the infirm, stray outside the box and it is within the remit of the returning officer to make a judgment on that, if he decides against the person, that person's vote is invalidated.</p>

This is a matter for the returning officer and I am sure that the rules are exactly the same as regards the referendum. The returning officer, who is independent, would decide these matters, but all the rules are not expressed. When you become a returning officer, you must learn all these rules, and it is a bit of an ordeal to get them all into your head.</p>

The fundamental point is that there is nothing really different about these rules and regulations. They are modelled on existing provisions which govern the conduct of elections. That is why I refer the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, to the Representation of the People Act 1983. If he looks up Section 18B to 18D, I think that he will find the answer to his question. Likewise, the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, who asked about poll clerks advising people on the subject matter of the referendum. We would not expect clerks to advise on that but there will be guidance in the polling station on how to complete the voting paper and, as we have already debated several times, the Electoral Commission and the campaigns will be educating the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="11020178000077"></a>There is another point. The noble Lord, Lord Grocott, has got it into his head that there is something very strange and very new being done here. If you live in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or London, you have already voted in referendums and PR elections. I think we had more local referendums in the 13 years of Labour Government than this nation ever had. I think people are quite used to the idea of going into a polling booth and being asked a question other than who they wish to vote for: on whether they want local mayors, for instance, or whether they want regional government-that was a great question the Labour Party asked. I also think that he has underestimated the degree of interest that will be generated, and is being generated, by the campaigns in the run-up to the referendum.</p>

In the European referendum in 1975, there was not the slightest doubt in anyone's mind about what was at stake. It was a choice about whether we stayed in or we did not. Neither was there any serious doubt about what was at stake in the referenda on Scottish and Welsh devolution. I am simply reflecting, I am sure, what is the truth-that large numbers of people will not know any detail about how the alternative vote

My children, who are at school, are taught different electoral systems. This has been done for the past 25 years. I do not think that it is very complicated. I was rather impressed by the Electoral Commission's work. The noble Lord asserts that nobody will be interested. I say that they will be. At least they are being given a choice, which is important.

<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="11020178000083"></a>The underlying legislation for this is of course Schedule 1 to the Representation of the People Act 1983, with which many noble Lords will be familiar. I hope that noble Lords opposite will find that this is a useful subject that they may wish to debate on one of their Thursdays, or in a Question for Short Debate, because there are important issues that they will want to discuss. Under this schedule, appropriate modifications have been made to reflect the features and language specific to referendums. For example, references to "returning officers" have been substituted by "counting officers", and references to "election agents" have been replaced with "referendum agents".</p>

<a name="110201-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="11020178000084"></a>Two aspects of the rules merit special mention. They govern the count and recount procedures, and a power enabling the chief counting officer to modify some forms contained in the Bill. Counting officers will be responsible for the conduct of counts in their respective areas, which will be conducted on a regional basis. Like local returning officers in the European parliamentary elections, referendum agents will be permitted to attend the count, much like election agents. Rule 42(2) specifies that a referendum agent and certain designated counting agents may require a counting officer to recount votes for that area. As with UK and European parliamentary elections, a counting officer will have the discretion to refuse any such request if he deems it to be unreasonable. Rule 43 gives power to both regional counting officers and the chief counting officer to issue a direction for a recount of the votes only in one specified circumstance: where the officer requesting the recount has reason to doubt the accuracy of the count under rule 43(4).</p>

I go back to the suggestion made by the noble Baroness, Lady Liddell. It may well be a good idea for party officials to get together to discuss this, and I hope that the offer will be taken up.</p>

</ul>

<p><a name="11020151000003"></a><b><a name="110201-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="11020151000066"></a>The Lord Bishop of Leicester:</b> My Lords, following the recent cases of child sexual exploitation that we have seen in the media, I am glad to have this opportunity to raise this important topic today. I very much look forward to hearing contributions from all those who are here. What I have to say arises partly from my own pastoral experience as a parish priest and a bishop and partly from my more recent experience as the chair of the trustees of the Children's Society.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000004"></a>As noble Lords will be aware, child sexual exploitation, as defined by the Department for Children, Schools and Families in 2009, is sexual exploitation of children or young people under the age of 18 that involves putting the child or young person in exploitative situations, contexts or relationships in which they receive something, whether it is food, accommodation, money or drugs, in return for performing and/or having others perform on them some form of sexual activity.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000005"></a>Sexual exploitation can occur through the use of technology without the child's immediate recognition of the exploitation, such as being asked to post sexual images on the internet or on mobile phones without immediate payment or gain. Recent reports by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre and Barnardo's have indicated the use of the internet in child exploitation as a growing issue. The Barnardo's report, <I>Puppet on a String</I>, which I commend to your Lordships, has highlighted that a number of primary school children have admitted to meeting someone whom they previously met only online.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC314"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC314</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000006"></a>In all these cases, the person doing the exploiting exercises some form of power over the child or young person by means of their age, gender, intellect or other factors. Violence, coercion and intimidation are common and can involve the child or young person being plied with gifts, alcohol and drugs, which often form part of the grooming process. This all helps to explain why it is often very difficult for some children or young people to accept the true nature of their relationship and to take the risk of exposing the perpetrator.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000007"></a>Any child or young person may be at risk of sexual exploitation, regardless of their gender, race or social background. However, we unfortunately know that factors such as living in care or being runaways or having mental health problems all increase a young person's vulnerability to sexual exploitation. In particular, we know that the link with running away or going missing is an extremely strong indicator of risk. I shall return to that point later.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000008"></a>As we know, child exploitation has devastating consequences for the individual being exploited. It has an extremely damaging effect on a child's or young person's self-esteem, mental health and, indeed, lifelong ability to form secure relationships, yet, in spite of this, there are no national statistics to map the prevalence of child sexual exploitation. This lack of data works against the children of our country, as it keeps a vital child protection issue somewhat obscured.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000009"></a>I want to draw attention to five issues in particular. First, children of course have a right to be protected from sexual exploitation. This is enshrined in law at national, European and international levels. In this country, local safeguarding children boards are responsible for co-ordinating local responses to child sexual exploitation, yet initial research from the University of Bedfordshire has demonstrated that many local safeguarding children boards still do not consider child sexual exploitation as a priority and have failed to identify resources or plans to address this, with less than a quarter of the boards even having a protocol for child sexual exploitation. This leads to a group of very vulnerable young people being left without adequate and timely services and the support that they so desperately need. I urge the Minister to look into this issue seriously and to let us know what measures he can put in place to rectify this situation.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000010"></a>Secondly, I want to mention the inadequate training for professionals across the front line. Many professionals who work with young people remain unfamiliar with the risks or indicators of sexual exploitation and show little understanding of the issue. Indeed, they often do not know how to support a young person in an exploitative situation who is going through the courts with a case against their abusers. This situation is often exacerbated by the fact that many young people are not willing to identify themselves as being exploited or even to recognise that they are at risk of harm. In keeping with this lack of understanding, the behaviour of children and young people affected is often identified as disruptive rather than indicative of need and they are often met with punitive rather than welfare responses. Research from the Children's Society has shown that victims aged 16 and 17 are particularly unlikely to receive a safeguarding response. These are the young  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC315"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC315</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>people who are often seen as a low priority, despite the law stating explicitly that they should be responded to and safeguarded as children until they are aged 18. The lack of data and awareness of the issue of child sexual exploitation has led to a significant lack of resources for specialist support services for children and their families.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000011"></a>Thirdly, I take this opportunity to raise the issue of the inadequacies of current law enforcement and police responses to child sexual exploitation cases. These remain primarily reactive rather than proactive. The prosecution relies heavily on the young person to make a complaint and to give evidence in the court against their exploiter. The process of grooming to which children are subjected and the use of threats and coercion make it extremely difficult for them to go through the criminal justice process. The sexual exploitation of children is, of course, a form of child abuse and should be seen as a child protection issue. It is extremely important that investigations are carried out by officers who are trained in child protection procedures with families showing risk indicators for child sexual exploitation. It is vital that the police work closely with partner agencies to develop a co-ordinated response to ensuring that the welfare and safety of the child is paramount. What is most ironic is that children aged 10 years or over still remain criminally liable for the commission of a prostitution offence such as loitering or soliciting. This is clearly at odds with the intention to make it clear that sexually exploiting children is a form of child abuse. Often it is the fear of being prosecuted under this legislation that prevents children from coming forward to seek help to get out of exploitative situations. I urge the Minister to ensure that it is explicitly clear that any child who has been sexually exploited is supported through the justice system, which is meant to protect them, and that their exploiters are dealt with accordingly.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000012"></a>Fourthly, I want to make a point about the importance of co-ordination and joint working between local authorities and police forces to tackle child sexual exploitation across boundaries. Effective cross-department and multidisciplinary working can make a huge impact on safeguarding children, especially those in care, who are often failed due to a breakdown in communication between different agencies or who get lost in the gaps between them. The Government and local authorities have a duty, of course, to protect all children, especially those who rely on them as corporate parents.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000013"></a>Finally, I urge the Government to respond to the needs of these vulnerable children. I call on the Minister to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety of children, especially those in the care of local authorities, from being groomed for sexual exploitation. In particular, I hope that the Minister will pay close attention to the link between running away and sexual exploitation. I fear that, despite great efforts in recent years to develop statutory guidance and an action plan on runaways, this issue has fallen down the list of political priorities at the DfE. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that this is not the case and that action is being taken to prevent children from being exposed to such horrific abuse, which is happening in far too many of our towns and cities today.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000015"></a>Like other noble Lords, I have received the briefings from the Children's Society and Barnardo's on what they rightly describe as a horrendous crime. The reference in the Barnardo's report to the special challenges posed by out-of-area residential care strikes a particular chord with me, yet I find myself impelled to sound a note of caution, lest in our efforts to reduce child exploitation we have the unintended consequence of discouraging individuals from working with children and so impoverish the physical and intellectual lives of the very children whom we are seeking to protect.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000016"></a>I am chairing a task force looking into the regulatory and other burdens that impede the growth of small charities and other groups. We have had a good deal of evidence that well meaning efforts are discouraging people from volunteering to work with children. In my three minutes, I cannot develop my argument at length, so I shall read four paragraphs of a letter that I received from a lady in Manchester. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11020151000050"></a>"About 8 years ago, I decided to get involved in a local Manchester Drama group ... whose members range from seven years to 80 years old. A number of us assumed responsibility for teaching the children and preparing them for the annual pantomime and other productions. Naturally we were CRB checked-a process I had no issue with and wholeheartedly support ... However-having been CRB approved, we were invited to a session of the local Child Protection Officer. I came away from that meeting with a number of very serious questions as to whether I should in fact get involved with this sort of group. The talk left me feeling I would potentially be placing myself in situations of real risk ... The Child Protection Officer focused the session on ensuring no adult put themselves into a vulnerable position i.e. if a child requests to go to the toilet-in no circumstance should an adult accompany them. If a child (with particular reference to girls) falls and cuts her knee, whilst wearing tights-under no circumstances should any adult remove the girl's tights and help stem the bleed ... No adult, whatever sex, should ever be alone with either one or more children ... I came away from the session questioning the sense in many of the messages conveyed. As a caring, responsible adult (who as an adoptive mum ... has the highest level of CRB clearance) I did not feel at all comfortable with the prospect of not being able to help an injured child".</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000017"></a>I would like to tell the Committee that this was an isolated example, but we have had many letters along these lines. Of course, child protection is an important issue, but thousands of our fellow citizens find it enjoyable and rewarding to work with children. We have to avoid a situation in which, if someone says that they enjoy working with children, they are immediately treated with grave suspicion.</p>

His interest in child welfare is well known. I want to focus on trafficking, an issue that many noble Lords have raised recently in your Lordships'   


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC317"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>House. It is a horrific practice and one that we should do all in our power to tackle. Local authorities and safeguarding are important and essential.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000019"></a>We have some figures on trafficking and sexual exploitation of children, but they are likely to be severe underestimates. Nevertheless, some things are clear. Childline reports that 8 per cent of all calls are about sexual abuse-an increase of 42 per cent in two years. The reason for the increase may be that children are becoming more confident in speaking out about such abuse. I hope that they are and that they feel supported to do so. The Barnardo's report, <I>Puppet on </I><I>a</I><I> String</I>, has been referred to already. I want to underline the fact that children who are particularly vulnerable are those in care, those excluded from mainstream education and those using drugs or alcohol. Such children need a great deal of co-ordinated support, as the right reverend Prelate said.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000020"></a>I shall now focus on trafficking. It is estimated that at any time more than 140,000 persons are victims of trafficking; 84 per cent of them are trafficked for sexual exploitation and most are women and girls. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime shows that trafficking in persons is one of the most lucrative illicit businesses in Europe, generating €2.5 billion a year. Some of these children go into care but are recycled into exploitation. Some are not discovered. That is another example of where local authority protection services should intervene.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000021"></a>ECPAT, the umbrella organisation fighting trafficking, recommends that central government should provide funding to local authorities to ensure that child victims of trafficking are provided with safe accommodation, such as foster care, and that social workers should be trained to identify and support children who may have been trafficked. It is vital to address gaps in provision, such as the lack of co-ordination and the lack of someone who can understand the wishes and feelings of children.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000022"></a>What can we in the UK do? First, I hope that the UK Government will take note of the Barnardo's report, <I>Puppet on a String</I>, and the ECPAT recommendations. It is difficult to see how cuts to local services can engender more funding to do this and to focus on child trafficking and sexual abuse, but I hope that the Minister will reassure us. I hope that the Government will eventually sign the European directive on human trafficking. I know that progress has been made but, if the Government signed up to this directive, that would be an important symbol of our commitment as a country to fighting this modern-day slavery. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

We have heard that only 20 per cent of local authorities have access to specialist services, even though it has clearly been shown that cases are more easily identified when specialist services are available. This was emphasised recently in an article in the <I>Guardian </I>by Carlene Firmin, who pointed out that, if local

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000024"></a>This debate follows the recent notorious Derby case where many young girls were abused, two of whom were in public care. In order to find out what lessons had been learnt, I looked at the serious case review. These reviews have been patchy in quality in the past, but since Ofsted has been looking at them they have improved and are well worth looking at. I understand that the Munro review, published this morning, suggests that Ofsted inspection should now cease, so I hope that the raised quality and value of these reviews continues. I am concerned about how safeguarding will be enshrined in the new slimmed-down Ofsted inspections of schools. Can the Minister tell us something about that?</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000025"></a>I turn to the Derby case. The serious case review reveals that concerns about the welfare of the two young women in care, who were among those abused, emerged at a very early stage-one from birth and the other from primary school age. From 2008, they were engaged in disturbed and risky behaviour, including criminal activity, absconding and drug and alcohol misuse. Practitioners in health and education and in children's social care all failed to recognise the significance of these behaviours in terms of abuse and they failed to intervene effectively.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000026"></a>Often when I am faced with speaking about issues such as this, I turn to the coal face. The coal face in this case is my friend Carol Runciman, who is the lead member on children's services in York. I asked her what she thought about these issues. She said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11020151000051"></a>"It doesn't take a lot more money-what it takes is training and understanding of how things happen and how both young people and carers and parents can be alerted to the dangers ... getting warnings out via social networking sites and sites, like school networks, that the young people use. Having a clearly identified point of contact is important-a designated teacher or teaching assistant in school who is trained to know what to do ... having information in drop in centres for young people-youth clubs, young people's drop in centres, even health centres-that all helps".</p>

<p><a name="11020151000048"></a>We should listen to the coal face.</p>

Coming from the north, as I do, I know that there is great concern about children being sexually exploited. A short time ago, a group of predators, all of whom seemed to be of Asian origin, were sent to prison. They came from West Yorkshire, Derby and Blackburn. They had groomed young people with drugs and alcohol and then threatened them so that they obeyed these evil men. The young people were driven to prostitution.</p>

<p><a name="11020151000028"></a>If the Minister can find out, it would be interesting to know how many of these children had come from care. Will there be a cross-departmental inquiry on grooming vulnerable children for the purpose of sexual exploitation? I assume that there was cross-departmental working when the predators were found guilty and

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000029"></a>West Yorkshire used to abound with industry. People were brought in with their skills to work in the mills. Now this work has mainly gone to China, which has left many people unemployed years later. Some of them have preyed on children to make money out of sex. I also hear that Asian men may not be satisfied with forced marriages and so look elsewhere for sex.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000030"></a>Many children from care seem to have low esteem and become vulnerable, as do young teenage girls, who rebel and leave home for various reasons. They all become easy prey. Will the Minister give an assurance that the cutting of so many police will not affect child protection? How much child awareness is taught in schools to make all children aware of sexual exploitation, so that when they are at risk they can spot the dangers? I know that this awareness is taught in schools in Australia.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000031"></a>All professionals working with children and within the criminal justice system should be trained to understand issues relating to child sexual exploitation. Some of the children are very young. They are at risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Surely it is time to stop being complacent and to act now to protect these very vulnerable children.</p>

On two-thirds of those nine days, the first Oral Question is in the name of one of the right reverend Prelates on the Bishops' Bench. I do not know whether it is a convention of your Lordships' House that the Bench of Bishops always takes the top of the Order Paper if a right reverend Prelate has a Question to ask or whether that is an index of the enthusiasm of right reverend Prelates straining like greyhounds in the slips to be the first away. On top of that, on Thursday the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester has the first two-and-a-half-hour debate, which is on the role of marriage and marriage support.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000033"></a>This episcopal procession is led today by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester, with his Question for Short Debate, which is itself a harbinger of the similar top Oral Question to be posed on 10 February by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds. We are all in the debt of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester for having triggered all this activity and for the skill with which he has launched it. Having used more than a third of my allotted span with this willing obeisance to the Bishops' Bench, I shall use the final strait to make one observation and to ask one question.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000034"></a>My observation is that, when these matters were brought dramatically to public attention and general concern by a series of articles in the <I>Times</I>, the thought was aired that the police had been inhibited from raising the profile of these matters for fear that they would be liable to charges of racism. I can understand that inhibition. I had to ponder a similar dilemma more than 50 years ago, although in a different context  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC320"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC320</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and to a different degree. I chose then to make indiscretion the better part of valour. However, I hope that the climate will have been so changed by recent developments that this inhibition will be lifted. I share the views of my noble friend Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, as a consequence of eight years as president of St Andrew's Youth Club, half a mile from this Palace, whose reputation is that oxymoron, "the oldest youth club in the world".</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000035"></a>There are lots of questions that one could ask, but, in a debate of short speeches, my noble friend the Minister is liable to be reduced to a St Sebastianic barrage of questions and one must not be self-indulgent. Mine relates to trafficked girls, an issue that has already been mentioned. I am aware of the Christian organisation thus concerned that goes under the name of Chaste-for the benefit of the <I>Hansard </I>writer, I spell that title with "te" rather than "ed"-but how far is the fact that prostitution among such girls is a criminal offence at the specified age an obstacle to the resolution of such traffic?</p>
<h5><a name="11020151000060"></a>3.55 pm</h5>

<p><a name="11020151000036"></a><b><a name="110201-gc0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="11020151000072"></a>The Earl of Listowel:</b> My Lords, the previous Government appointed Sir William Utting, the former director of the Social Services Inspectorate, to do two reports into the safeguarding of children in local authority care. One of his chief conclusions was that an environment of overall excellence is the best safeguard for children. The Barnardo's report, <I>Puppet on a </I><I>S</I><I>tring</I>, which has already been referred to, states:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11020151000052"></a>"We also know that some groups of young people are more vulnerable to targeting by the perpetrators of sexual exploitation. These include children living in care, particularly residential care".</p>

<p><a name="11020151000049"></a>I should like to concentrate on children's homes.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000037"></a>I hope that the Minister may take the following questions to Tim Loughton MP. Will he consider undertaking a review of children's homes? Will he consider approaches from John Diamond, chief executive of the Mulberry Bush school, who is leading a group of tier 3 specialist providers in residential care to talk to the Government about how we can ensure that high-quality specialist residential care continues? Does he recognise the need to ensure that the current climate does not have the perverse effect of driving out high-quality provision as commissioners look for the cheapest residential care that they can find in the circumstances?</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000038"></a>In my experience visiting children's homes, I have heard staff talk about girls in their care being approached and given gifts by men. They have expressed concern about their limited ability to intervene. I have heard of girls being called out at night by an elder girl in the home and of staff rewarding in the morning those girls who did not respond to that pressure. It is a very difficult environment in which to work. While 90 per cent of children's homes in Denmark, and 50 per cent in Germany, have degree-level qualified staff, only 20 per cent of homes in this country do, yet the children in those residential settings often have far higher levels of need than they would in Germany or Denmark. This area needs careful attention and I hope that the Minister will review it.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000039"></a>To see the difference that excellence in provision can make, your Lordships need only visit Hackney social services, which last year achieved 25 per cent

This was a local authority that used to have an appalling reputation for its provision. It has done this by insisting on recruiting the very best social workers using the Reclaim Social Work model. Consultant social workers lead small teams supported by systemic therapists who have eight years of training. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>
<h5><a name="11020151000061"></a>3.58 pm</h5>

<p><a name="11020151000040"></a><b><a name="110201-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="11020151000073"></a>Lord Faulks:</b> My Lords, although I very much welcome this debate, I come to it from a slightly unusual standpoint as a barrister who has spent the past 20 years or so acting in claims against local authorities, social services departments and children's homes for failures to protect children from sexual abuse. I, of course, share the concern of all noble Lords for the victims of sexual abuse. Anyone who has heard adult survivors of sexual abuse give evidence in court can feel nothing but horror for the way in which their childhood has been ruined by the breach of trust. Often, they come from very unpromising circumstances and their lack of faith in adult figures is confounded by their experiences. Anything that the Government can do and can continue to do to protect such children from abuse and exploitation is, of course, welcome.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000041"></a>I wish to sound a note of caution, however, although this must be seen in the context of my experience as someone who has spent many hours sitting round tables with social workers who are alleged to have been negligent in failing to protect children from sexual abuse. Social workers have a very hard job. There is no lack of guidance; indeed, a preponderance of guidance is now available. However, the inquiries that take place and the hearings that occur in the studied calm of the Royal Courts of Justice are a world away from the  real fog of social work, with the difficulties of obtaining information and the changes of files and personnel.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000042"></a>It is a considerable worry to social workers that they are exposed to litigation and the risk of litigation. Previously, the courts had decided that social workers were not so to be exposed; it was considered that this was a multi-agency task and that it was unfair to single out social workers for responsibility. However, the Human Rights Act has altered that and we are now in a position where social workers face these  allegations.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000043"></a>Of course, the Government will be anxious to make sure that social workers are properly trained and do all that they can to take on board the recent thinking about improving the way in which they do their job. I know that the Government will be taking note of Professor Munro's report in particular. However, I ask the Minister to bear in mind the fact that social workers are dedicated individuals who do an unglamorous and not very well paid job in often difficult circumstances. They are pilloried by the press when things go wrong and, although I am sure that all of them have children's best interests at heart, we should be careful that, in our understandable urge to protect children, we do not confound matters by putting them off doing that job well.</p>

<p><a name="11020151000044"></a><b><a name="110201-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="11020151000074"></a>Baroness Howe of Idlicote:</b> My Lords, I join others in thanking the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester for securing this debate on a subject that is of growing concern. The prevalence of child sexual exploitation is growing and the age of exploitation is getting younger. With rapid technological advances, the grooming of children has become more sophisticated, as abusers are using the internet and mobile phones to find and groom children. A recent report by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre found a 16 per cent increase in the number of cases in a year, with a quarter of these from online grooming. Children are unwittingly putting themselves at extreme risk through internet usage.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000045"></a>Despite these shocking statistics, in most local authorities child sexual exploitation apparently is not, as we have heard, recognised as a mainstream child protection issue. Certainly more attention and resources must be focused on child protection on the internet. Studies suggest that almost 60 per cent of children aged nine to 19 have viewed online pornography and the rate of unwitting exposure is increasing. It is clear, therefore, that filtering software to control access to pornographic material needs to be improved. The onus seems to be far too heavily left to rest on parents, teachers and carers. Surely internet service and website providers should share a greater responsibility for keeping our children safe and be made much more accountable in this regard.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000046"></a>We need to make it a lot more difficult for our children to come across inappropriate adult content and images of child abuse on the internet. Are the Government engaging with internet service and website providers to ensure that steps are taken in this direction? I am especially concerned with the increasing ease with which internet content can be viewed through television. I believe that the BBC, whose age ratings are known and respected by parents, are already helpfully involved with some guidance to broadcasters, but will the Government's next communications Act address this problem statutorily? Given that internet videos are not currently subject to the same rules as television, this convergence could threaten to expose even more children to inappropriate content. If legislation is not the Government's intention, what measures are in place, or at least being explored, to protect children from the result of these technological changes? In short, what are the Government doing to address this?</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="11020151000047"></a>I hope that, when he replies, the noble Lord will be able to reassure your Lordships that child sexual exploitation is indeed a priority for the Government and that he will tell us something about the actions that they are proposing to take to deal with this situation.</p>

A report last year for the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre revealed a 16 per cent increase in reported cases of sexual exploitation. Perpetrators of this heinous crime are using more sophisticated channels to lure their victims, often plying  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC323"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC323</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>them with gifts, drugs and alcohol, specifically targeting vulnerable children. These children are groomed then abused, leaving them with deep emotional and psychological trauma.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000002"></a>Two of the young girls who were abused by a gang in Derby were in the care of Derby City Council. A serious case review into these victims' cases revealed that if they had been taken into care earlier they would have been less vulnerable to the exploits of their abusers. A 2009 report published by Barnardo's entitled <I>Whose Child Now?</I> revealed that 80 per cent of councils did not have a service dedicated to supporting victims of sexual exploitation. A greater focus on the training of professionals who deal with children is needed to improve the chances of early identification in cases of sexual abuse.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000003"></a>I turn now to a sensitive issue. The facts speak for themselves: 50 of the 56 perpetrators who have recently been convicted of these abhorrent crimes are from the Muslim community. However, any attempt to draw a parallel between these crimes and one ethnic or religious group would be not only wrong but particularly unwelcome. Child sexual exploitation is not exclusively carried out by one community. The recent focus on race in the media could have an adverse effect on the wider ability of the agencies to detect cases of abuse among all communities and in the country generally.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000004"></a>Barnardo's, the children's charity, has launched a report called <I>Puppet on </I><I>a</I><I> String</I>, which examines the nature and scale of sexual exploitation. The report states that the incidence of trafficking of children around Britain for sexual exploitation is rising, with children as young as 10 being groomed by predatory gangs. The report also reveals that the average age of victims has fallen from 15 to 13 in the past five years. Will the Government heed the advice of key figures in appointing a Minister with specific responsibility for dealing with this issue? Child exploitation is a deeply unwelcome phenomenon in our society. Our duty lies with providing victims with all the support that they require to rebuild their lives. We must also ensure their safety and prevent them from becoming innocent victims.</p>

Most parents want the best for their children but, when parental responsibility is transferred from parents to the state, the state carries a huge responsibility to help those vulnerable children. I hope that the Minister will do all that he can to remind local authorities of the responsibilities that they carry, because many of these children have experienced chaotic lives, have been deprived of a normal childhood and have low self-esteem and poor educational attainment. The responsibilities carried by the state are huge and local authorities need to be constantly reminded of that.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000006"></a>Secondly, we need to recognise that predators on these young children have developed more sophisticated ways. Unfortunately and understandably, many of these young children crave affection and confuse the giving of affection with that of sexual favours. Therefore, it is  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC324"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC324</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>particularly important that we not only are vigilant but help young people to recognise the dangers and equip them better to withstand those dangers.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000007"></a>Does the Minister recognise that many local authorities have a tendency to place young children far from their locality? I fear that that often leads to an attitude of "out of sight, out of mind", which exposes these young children to even more danger. Because local authorities are sometimes more committed to a policy of ethnic compatibility, rather than of securing a normal family life for young children, many of these young children are allowed to languish in care for many years. I hope that the Minister will do all that he can to reduce the length of time taken in court proceedings and ensure that drift is eliminated from childcare practice. These children should be helped to have a more secure future, because childhood passes all too quickly.</p>

<p><a name="11020153000008"></a><b><a name="110201-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="11020153000039"></a>Baroness Hughes of Stretford:</b> I, too, congratulate the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester on securing this debate on this very important topic. It is a privilege to speak after the knowledgeable contributions of so many colleagues.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000009"></a>While recent cases have brought this issue to the fore, there has in fact been a growing awareness of this problem for some considerable time. In a previous life, I spent some years as a research fellow investigating what was then called organised sexual abuse of children-paedophile gangs, trafficking and so on. I was a senior lecturer at Manchester University and spent many gruelling hours reading the transcripts of children's evidence and interviews. Like other Members here, I know what a vile predatory crime this is, targeting the most vulnerable children.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000010"></a>This is also a challenging issue for professionals-possibly one of the most challenging-as well as one of the most dangerous for children. The crime is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as modern communications technology makes it easier for paedophiles and perpetrators to keep their tracking and contacting of children hidden from parents and carers.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000011"></a>There has been progress over recent years but, as the Children's Society and Barnardo's have reported, the implementation of government guidance, best practice and so on is patchy as regards local safeguarding children boards and local authorities. The extent to which progress has been made is variable. It is clear that, for an effective local response, we need a child-centred approach that is sensitive to listening to children, capacity for early intervention and identification, close integration and inter-agency working-as was reinforced again today by the Munro interim report-the capacity of professionals to share information easily and early, and the dissemination of knowledge and best practice.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000012"></a>As well as adding to the calls to the Minister asking what progress he is going to make, I should also like to express some concerns about decisions that the Government have already made, which I think will create new and unnecessary barriers to that progress. The first relates to the cuts to local authority budgets. I have to raise this issue, because the worst levels of  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC325"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC325</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>cuts are being experienced by the local authorities with the highest children-in-need scores; they are in exactly those places where most vulnerable children are going to be.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000013"></a>Secondly, why has the Minister distanced himself from Every Child Matters, the acclaimed multi-agency framework that is making it much easier for agencies to work together? Under the Education Bill, schools will now be absolved from the duty to co-operate with other agencies locally. Thirdly, the abandonment of ContactPoint will make it much harder for professionals even to know who else is working with them, let alone how to contact them. Finally, absorbing CEOP into a national crime agency with border control, immigration and all those things will harm the dissemination of the best practice that CEOP has been achieving.</p>

It has been a good debate and a good advertisement for speed dating. I shall try to crack on. I welcome the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes of Stretford, to her new role. I look forward to working with her. I know that she is experienced in this area and was herself a Minister for Children and Families in my department.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000015"></a>This debate is timely because, as we have discussed, today sees the publication of the interim report from the Munro review and because of the attention that there has rightly been on this issue following the series of reports in the <I>Times</I> and the publication of the recent thoughtful and helpful report by Barnardo's, which I have read with care.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000016"></a>In his speech, the right reverend Prelate spoke with authority and experience about a subject that all noble Lords who have contributed today clearly care about deeply. It is hard to think of a greater responsibility or duty that we have as a society than to keep our children safe. We have a particular responsibility to care for those children who are the most vulnerable-those without families who are looked after and live in children's homes or in foster care, a point that the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, underlined. On her specific point, it is the case that we can opt into the EU directive if we want to, once we have seen how it works.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000017"></a>As a number of noble Lords have said, it is impossible not to read the horrific stories that we have all seen recently and not be appalled. The Barnardo's report published in January underlined the youth of many victims of child sexual exploitation, suggesting that children as young as 10 are being targeted.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000018"></a>The fact that most of us find such behaviour inconceivable is, in some ways, part of the problem. Having been involved in the past in a minor way in some historic child abuse cases, I know that there is often a reaction that an allegation simply cannot be true, either because it is so shocking or because an alleged offender has been a colleague for many years. Yet some of those allegations were and are true and I believe that that is the frame of mind in which we have to tackle this issue. However, I accept the points made  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC326"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC326</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>by my noble friends Lord Hodgson and Lord Faulks about proportionality and the need not to undermine inadvertently the important relationship that we want to encourage between adults and children, particularly in the context of encouraging volunteering. That lies behind our proposals for reviewing the vetting and barring scheme.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000019"></a>As was said in the debate, knowing the scale of the problem is one of the challenges that we face. I therefore welcome the fact that the Barnardo's report and the <I>Times</I> articles have drawn attention to the problem and brought things out into the open. Research commissioned in 2002 found that children were known to suffer sexual exploitation in 111 of the then 146 child protection committee areas. Work carried out by Barnardo's in 2005 found 507 cases across London boroughs. A more recent survey by Barnardo's showed that in 2008-09 it worked with 1,059 children and young people and that this had risen the following year to 1,098.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para51"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000020"></a>However, apart from a sense that we all have that this is only part of the story, we almost by definition do not have hard and fast data. I hope therefore that noble Lords will support the announcement in January that the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre is carrying out a thematic assessment, which, among other things, will look at establishing whether there are any patterns of offending or victimisation, consider the effectiveness of existing processes and make recommendations to reduce risk. CEOP is looking to make its findings on this research public within a timescale of three to six months.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para52"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000021"></a>I know that there has been a lot of media debate around issues to do with ethnicity, a point that a number of noble Lords have raised. My view on that is very simple: while we should not make generalisations-we know that child sexual exploitation affects boys as well as girls and occurs across the country, involving people from a range of ethnic backgrounds-we should not turn a blind eye to wrongdoing for fear of rocking the boat. Indeed, rocking the boat is often precisely what we will need to do in this area, a point made by my noble friend Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para53"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000022"></a>I turn to the current framework. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 is intended to protect young people from sexual exploitation. It extended the scope of the law to include a range of new offences, including meeting a child following sexual grooming and paying for the sexual services of a child. In addition, the police and Crown Prosecution Service are able to convict using other sexual offences, such as rape or sexual activity with a child under 13 or a child under 16, or they may use other legislation to disrupt this activity.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para54"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000023"></a>The statutory guidance on safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, <I>Working Together </I><I>t</I><I>o Safeguard Children</I>, was first published in its current form following the 1989 Children Act. Since then it has been regularly updated and in 2009 separate statutory guidance on the sexual exploitation of children was published. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, was involved in producing that guidance. The main objective of the guidance is to encourage local safeguarding children boards, practitioners and others working with young people and local agencies to prevent the sexual

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para55"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000024"></a>Because looked-after children-children in care-are most vulnerable and more likely to be at risk of harm, local authorities have a specific statutory duty to safeguard and promote their welfare. In practice, that means that local authorities must allocate the child a social worker, who will assess their needs and draw up a care plan that sets out how the authority intends to respond to the full range of the child's needs, including their education and health needs. I take the points that have been made about the importance of training in that regard. If there is any suspicion that the child may have been trafficked, whether or not for the purposes of sexual exploitation, the social worker must assess the child's vulnerability to the continuing control of his or her traffickers. The local authority must then place the child with a carer who has the necessary skills and experience to support and protect them.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para56"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000025"></a>I understand the point that was made about the danger of criminalising the victim. Points were made about the way in which the police operate and I will relay those to my honourable friend Mr Loughton. I shall read an extract from the statutory guidance:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11020153000031"></a>"The Government remains clear that children and young people who are sexually exploited should not be regarded as having bad or criminal behaviour; they are the victims of sexual abuse. The responsibility for the sexual exploitation of children or young people lies with the abuser ... The focus of police investigations and of prosecutions should be on those who coerce, exploit and abuse children and young people".</p>

<p><a name="11020153000030"></a>However, I will follow up the point that was raised.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para57"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000026"></a>I ran through that at quite a pace, but I wanted to make the point that the legislative framework is broadly in place. The issue that we have is that its application is patchy. As has been said, early findings from research carried out by the University of Bedfordshire show that there are low levels of compliance with the 2009 guidance, suggesting that only a minority of local authorities are prioritising child sexual exploitation as a child protection issue.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para58"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000027"></a>I turn to the steps that the Government are taking. The Barnardo's report talks about the need for a lead Minister. That role is being carried out by my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children, Tim Loughton, who has the cross-government lead role on this issue as part of his child-safeguarding responsibilities. I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Masham of Ilton, that he understands fully the need for a collaborative and cross-departmental approach to these issues. He is clear about that and he is involving Ministers from a range of departments, including the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health, as well as local authority children's services, local safeguarding children boards and organisations such as CEOP, Barnardo's and others, and other voluntary organisations. He is already working with the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Home Office, James Brokenshire, to develop a joint approach, and I know that they have both recently met Sheila Taylor, who runs Safe and Sound Derby. Mr Loughton has also recently met the chief executive of Barnardo's.

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para59"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000028"></a>I will be certain to ensure that my noble friend reads today's debate and I am happy to relay to him any further specific concerns that noble Lords may have. I will ensure that there is an answer to the questions raised by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. I will also follow up separately the important points made about the spread of technology by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and respond to her. I am not an expert in these matters, but common sense says that the ready availability of pornography has a desensitising effect, while the way in which technology can be used by people to work together to share images and to co-ordinate activity suggests that there is a growing problem there.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para60"></a>
<p><a name="11020153000029"></a>The Government share with the right reverend Prelate and other noble Lords a recognition of the problem of child sexual exploitation and of the particular vulnerabilities of looked-after children. It is almost impossible to comprehend the suffering that some of these children and young people have endured and are enduring at the hands of their exploiters. Like all noble Lords, we are determined to do all that we can to stop this terrible abuse.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para61"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000003"></a>This morning, the British Heart Foundation announced that it is spending £50 million on stem cell research in the hope that one day it will be as easy to recover from a heart attack as it is to repair a broken bone. A year ago, the groundbreaking partnership was announced between the Multiple Sclerosis Society and the UK Stem Cell Foundation to pump-prime and speed up stem cell research. This perhaps reflects science's fast-moving progress in relation to stem cell research and the wonders that it might bring to medicine over the next few years. Right now, the HFEA is conducting a consultation on the ethics of sperm and egg donation.  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC329"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC329</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>This issue is often in the media, which is unsurprising given what donation involves-that is, making children who may not be genetically related to their parent or parents.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para62"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000004"></a>As medical science advances, there seem to be more, not fewer, ethical issues to address in this area. To underline this point, not long ago-in fact, in March last year-the noble Earl the Minister and I were dealing with the regulations arising out of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 relating to the disclosure of information for research purposes and parental orders regarding the adoption of children born of surrogate mothers, among other matters. These are both highly sensitive and important issues concerning ethical and safeguarding matters and both rest in the hands of an HFEA accountable to the Minister and to Parliament.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para63"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000005"></a>In preparing for this debate, I used as my starting point what both organisations do and I tried to work out how these functions might be undertaken in the new regime that the noble Earl kindly outlined to some of us not long ago. The HTA licenses and inspects organisations that store and use human tissue for purposes such as research, patient treatment, post-mortem examinations, teaching and public exhibitions. It also approves organ and bone marrow donations from living people. Its work covers anatomy, stem cells, cord blood, public display-that is, the public display of human body parts in various forms-post-mortems, coroners and transplants. It is clear to me that the HTA covers a wide but related range of competencies, as well as the ones that were behind the organisation being established with such care some years ago.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para64"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000006"></a>The ethical issues that arise all the time as a result of the advances in science throw up new and sometimes very complex issues. Public indignation at the cavalier use of body parts for research without the knowledge or consent of patients and their families was huge and many in your Lordships' House will recall the thought and time that were given to creating a regulatory framework that would command public confidence. The Bill was given more than 100 hours of direct parliamentary scrutiny in both Houses, not counting pre-legislative scrutiny or investigation by Select Committees. I fail to see what has changed that can allow any slackening off of the responsibility that the HTA bears for the uses of human tissue.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000007"></a>The HFEA is the UK's independent regulator of treatment using eggs and sperm and of treatment and research involving human embryos. It sets standards for and issues licences to centres; provides authoritative information for the public, particularly for people seeking treatment, donor-conceived people and donors; and, very importantly, determines the policy framework for fertility issues, which are sometimes ethically and clinically complex. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 includes provisions for research on different types of embryos and changes the definition of legal parenthood for cases involving assisted reproduction. More than 200 hours were spent scrutinising this and previous legislation in both Houses, not counting the need for Select Committees and pre-legislative scrutiny. I make this point to emphasise that Parliament  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC330"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>took its time to get these things right. It seems to me that, if Parliament is going to change the HFEA and the HTA, it needs to take time to do that also.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000008"></a>The Government argue that the HFEA's licensing function could be moved and that its very sensitive records should become a responsibility elsewhere. I remind noble Lords that, on every occasion that Parliament has discussed human fertility since the 1980s, it has agreed that human embryos have a unique status and that their use for treatment and research requires special oversight.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para67"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000009"></a>Some say that IVF treatment has become so common that its regulation should be normalised in some way. I point out that, although public opinion has indeed moved, there are still powerful forces wishing to stop or limit the use of assisted conception and there are still the unscrupulous who would wish to profit from, for example, the longing of parents to have a baby. In addition, there is a very real danger that important research will be frustrated by people who have strong and hostile views should the responsibility for ethical review be removed from the responsible but supportive environment fostered by the HFEA.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para68"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000010"></a>The HFEA plays an important role in actively improving standards by, for example, being responsible for several consultations on issues of best practice, such as the ones to which I have referred. Reducing multiple pregnancies by limiting the number of embryos transferred has been and remains an important part of its work. My question is whether the Care Quality Commission will take on the important role of ensuring that clinics' results are not achieved regardless of the perinatal mortality associated with multiple pregnancy.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000011"></a>The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act is the focus for interactions between doctors, nurses and scientists. I suppose that these interactions could take place elsewhere. However, all the disciplines have vested interests and I point out, with the greatest respect, that organisations such as the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of Nursing, the Association of Clinical Embryologists and the British Fertility Society do not have the same impartial image enjoyed by the HFEA. The public have learnt to trust the HFEA and, indeed, the HTA. These bodies act as a bulwark between the sensational headlines in the less responsible press and those who are working in the field. Who would take on that role if either of these bodies was abolished? Would Andrew Lansley, or indeed the noble Earl, be prepared to act as that bulwark?</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000012"></a>UK legislation on these matters is the envy and the blueprint for the world. In Australia, for example, the states of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia have legislated to establish statutory oversight bodies. In 2000, the Singapore Cabinet appointed a bioethics advisory committee to examine the ethical, legal and social issues arising from biomedical research and development. Again, that is not a government department but a stand-alone, arm's-length body.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000013"></a>I am not opposed to change and improvement and I am not opposed to these proposals for the sake of it. I support change to make organisations more effective-for example, by sharing back-office functions or other facilities, by changing regulatory functions or by testing  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC331"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC331</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to see whether functions could be performed more effectively elsewhere. It might be that the proposals that the Government have suggested so far for the HTA and the HFEA will provide efficient regulation of some of their functions through the CQC and possibly through the still-to-be-created academy of medical science. However, none of the proposals answers the question that is the subject of this debate: where would the ethical and safeguarding issues that are at the heart of the work of both these bodies sit?</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para72"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000014"></a>I am aware that the Government have said that there is no intention to revisit the ethical and safeguarding provisions in the HFE Act or the principles of consent underpinning the HTA, but they have so far failed to address how the ethical and safeguarding functions might satisfactorily be carried out were these organisations not to exist. I cannot see the CQC or an academy of science being an appropriate body. That leaves us the Secretary of State and the Government, which is where we came in all those years ago with Alder Hey and the challenges posed by the new embryo and fertility advances of the 1980s. I suggest that public confidence in this area is best established through the independence of the bodies that regulate-the HTA and the HFEA-and that the Government need to rethink their proposals.</p>

As your Lordships will know, I had the privilege of introducing the HFEA legislation all those years ago, so I feel a certain parental responsibility towards the authority that prevents me from wanting to see it perish. However, as children grow up, the needs surrounding them can change and it may well be asked whether all that the HFEA was set up to do needs to be done in quite that way now. For example, when it was set up, IVF was comparatively rare and it would be fair to say that people were somewhat afraid of it. We had the benefit of the report of the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, suggesting what should happen.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para73"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000016"></a>Since that time, IVF has become a much more regularly occurring clinical process. Undoubtedly, there have been questions-for example, about the number of embryos to implant-but these processes take place in other areas as well; there are important risks in many clinical processes and we have authorities that are responsible for monitoring them. There may well be a case, therefore, for considering whether the control of the practice of IVF should continue with the HFEA. Research, too, happens in many areas. It involves important ethical issues, even in other branches of medicine and scientific research. I think that the HFEA was set up primarily from the point of view of that research and its control. Although there may be room for modification, that should continue.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para74"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000017"></a>I have had no direct concern with the Human Tissue Authority-I am glad to see its chair taking part in our debate-but I had the privilege of sitting on the Select Committee that looked at the draft Bill.  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC332"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC332</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Many questions relating to the Human Tissue Act were raised there. The answer of the then Government was: "If these are mistakes, it is too early to correct them". I have always thought that the sooner you correct a mistake that you have made, the better. I have no particular concern about the Human Tissue Authority. Our Joint Committee raised the possibility of a degree of co-operation between the two authorities that had not until then existed, although the situation may well have improved since we completed our deliberations. However, it is absolutely clear that the committee found no basis on which these two authorities could properly be put together as a single authority. We were absolutely unanimous and strongly of that view.</p>

<p><a name="11020174000018"></a><b><a name="110201-gc0001.htm_spnew13"></a><a name="11020174000129"></a>Lord Alderdice:</b> My Lords, we are all grateful to the noble Baroness for achieving this short debate-and it is short; one has only a few minutes. For that reason, my noble friend Lord Willis of Knaresborough will address the HFEA, my noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby will have an overall look at the issue and I will focus my attention on the Human Tissue Authority. I declare an interest, because my wife is a consultant histopathologist in the NHS in Northern Ireland. She does not do any forensic or coroner's work, but I declare the interest in any case.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para75"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000019"></a>The assumption in the noble Baroness's Question is that these bodies-I will refer now only to the Human Tissue Authority-have increased public confidence and patient safety. I am not at all sure that that is in fact the case with the HTA. When I was much younger in medicine, I remember that one government requirement was that 10 per cent of deaths that did not require a coroner's case PM would be post-mortemed. Why? Because the final judgment about whether or not clinical judgment was correct comes in the court of the full and rigorous autopsy of the pathologist. There is no other way of being certain. Even then, one may not get a final answer.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para76"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000020"></a>What has happened over the last few years is that we have achieved not the 10 per cent figure but the almost complete disappearance of such post-mortems. Many histopathologists, especially those who are newly qualified, will no longer carry out post-mortems. The Royal College of Pathologists is looking at whether it should allow pathologists to qualify without having proper experience in post-mortems, because so few of them are being done. One cannot talk about increased public confidence in post-mortems if the outcome has been that almost nobody wants permission for them to be done. That expresses a lack of confidence in post-mortems, not increasing confidence.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para77"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000021"></a>I will be more specific. In February of last year, the president of the Royal College of Pathologists wrote to the then Secretary of State, the right honourable Andy Burnham MP, with an eight-page letter-for obvious reasons, I cannot quote it in any detail-expressing the Royal College of Pathologists' deep lack of confidence in the work of the HTA. He began the letter by saying that the fall-out of the HTA's actions risked destabilising the provision of post-mortem examination services in England and Wales. He wrote about the concerns not only of the royal college but of  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC333"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC333</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the coroners' service. He talked about the lack of efficiency, citing the work of the CPA, which undertakes external quality assessments for full laboratory services-in other words, histopathology, haematology, microbiology and clinical chemistry. The fee that the CPA requires for inspecting the entire laboratory service is half that which the HTA requires for inspecting just the mortuary. Even in terms of efficiency, therefore, there are serious questions. When the HTA was established, it had a lot of experienced people who had conducted post-mortems, but that is no longer the case.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para78"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000022"></a>If the new Government understand that this is the relationship that has developed between the professional bodies-to the point where pathologists are no longer eager to carry out post-mortems-they would not be responsible if they did not take this issue seriously. Should the Government not ask whether the HTA is the best vehicle to carry out what are undoubted requirements for proper procedures to scrutinise this professional work?</p>

They are the issues that the Minister rightly addressed last week when he kindly and courteously invited us to be given a briefing about the Government's intentions.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para79"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000024"></a>For me the jury is out on these issues. I would certainly want to see, at the very minimum, a reform of the HFEA. The Minister will recall, as other noble Lords will, the debates that we had during the passage of the Bill, when a number of us argued for the creation of a national bioethics commission to oversee some of these ethical issues. I suppose that I subscribe to the cautionary verse of Hilaire Belloc, who said,</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11020174000100"></a>"always keep a-hold of Nurse</p>
 For fear of finding something worse".
<p><a name="11020174000089"></a>I would like to see the colour of the Government's money. I want to see precisely what they have in mind before coming to a conclusion.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para80"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000025"></a>It is worth going back, as the noble and learned Lord did in his remarks, to the creation of the HFEA. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, has said, it was necessary to create it-these were the words of the Warnock report-</p>
<ul><a name="11020174000105"></a>"if the public is to have confidence".</ul>
<p><a name="11020174000026"></a>She said that it needed to be an "independent body", that the membership was,</p>
<ul><a name="11020174000106"></a>"not to be unduly influenced by sectional interests",</ul>
<p><a name="11020174000090"></a>and that its membership was to include,</p>
<ul><a name="11020174000107"></a>"a diverse range of views".</ul>
<p><a name="11020174000091"></a>She also laid great emphasis on what she described as the,</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para81"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000027"></a>I note that the chair of the HFEA, Professor Lisa Jardine, said in the <I>Guardian</I> on 5 January that,</p>
<ul><a name="11020174000109"></a>"the safeguarding of the 'special status of the embryo' will be lost",</ul>
<p><a name="11020174000093"></a>if the HFEA is abolished. In an article in the journal <I>Nature</I> last August, it was suggested that,</p>
<ul><a name="11020174000110"></a>"losing the HFEA as a discrete body could undermine public confidence".</ul>
<p><a name="11020174000094"></a>The article on Professor Jardine adds that the HFEA,</p>
<ul><a name="11020174000111"></a>"carefully shelters human embryos from routine experimentation".</ul>
<p><a name="11020174000095"></a>Perhaps the Minister could tell us whether he has asked how many embryos have been thus spared; surprisingly, the HFEA, via Parliamentary Questions, says that it cannot tell.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para82"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000028"></a>Whether it is the unnecessary destruction of human embryos, the dangers caused to women by hyperovulation syndrome-before the Committee met today I passed the Minister a new paper from a German medical magazine about this question, because it goes right to the heart of patient safety-the ethics and mercantile nature of exploiting poorer women through the sale of eggs, an issue that the HFEA is currently considering, or the extraordinary way in which the HFEA has, for instance, pursued Dr Mohamed Taranissi, requiring it to meet legal costs of nearly £190,000, it is obvious, as the current HFEA chief executive stated in a memo, that,</p>
<ul><a name="11020174000112"></a>"something clearly has gone wrong-badly wrong over a sustained length of time".</ul>
<p><a name="11020174000096"></a>At the very minimum, I think that reform is needed.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para83"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000029"></a>I would therefore be grateful to hear how Her Majesty's Government propose that there should be what the Minister himself has described as a "lighter touch". Is that something that people such as me should be fearful of, or should we welcome it? Does it mean that in any sense there will be less regulation? Will the status of the human embryo be diminished further? How will the exercise of the HFEA's powers through this lighter touch be done? Also, how will the Government ensure that the requirements of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, which stand in place, will be adhered to if the HFEA ceases to exist in its present form? Who will be responsible for the transfer of sensitive data that the HFEA holds? How will independence, freedom from undue influence or sectional interests and a diverse range of views be upheld?</p>

It is rather delightful for me to be able, on this rare occasion, to support the Government's position and to support the Minister-at least, I suspect that I will be supporting him. It is a particular delight to see the noble Lord, Lord Wigley, attending this debate; it was he who, in 1985, broke the Speaker's Chair in the debate when the Private Member's Bill came in as part of Enoch Powell's attempt at legislation. I, of course, can declare an interest as an ex-poacher in this area-I no longer run an IVF unit-and I note that I am followed by a noble Baroness who was a gamekeeper.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para84"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000031"></a>I must say that I was open-mouthed at the quality and the succinctness of the speech of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, when he introduced the HFE Act. It seemed like a model of what should happen. It is fair to say that at the time it was an essential piece of legislation, which has now passed its day. It is no longer necessary; the research that it regulates is not really suitable for regulation by the HFEA. I believe that other areas of medical research, such as paediatrics, obstetrics, geriatrics and assisted dying, in many ways raise much more important ethical issues on a day-to-day basis. With stem cell research, the HFEA is inadequate for the purpose. A completely different body is needed, since stem cell research is ubiquitous and affects every tissue in the body, including the brain and the liver, and will clearly be an important replacement therapy in future. If it is to be regulated, it needs a different kind of touch.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para85"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000032"></a>As for clinical regulation, frankly the HFEA cannot prevent accidents or errors. It has not done that and it cannot do that; no regulatory authority can do that completely, any more than any other way of inspecting laboratories can. It does not prevent exploitation of women, who pay massive fees-in my view unreasonably-and has not helped in the costing of IVF treatment. It is unable to prevent fertility tourism, which goes around British legislation on a regular basis, and has not prevented clinics from collaborating with overseas units in allowing their patients to go to places such as Spain and Russia to seek treatment that they cannot offer themselves-with what kind of relationship, I am not sure.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para86"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000033"></a>There is a repeated assertion that the HFEA has always assuaged public concerns about IVF. I think that that was true 20 years ago but it is not true any longer. The public are pretty mature about this area, as was shown clearly by the hybrid embryo Bill. Things have moved on and the public are rather more sophisticated.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para87"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000034"></a>Lastly, one of my concerns about the HFEA is that it is extremely costly for men and women who are already paying for these services. I have just checked on the cost at Hammersmith Hospital, a clinic that I used to direct. Effectively, the HFEA requires two extra salaries to be paid and individual patients will pay on average around £300 for the use of IVF licences for their treatment. That seems an unfair burden in an area of medicine that is already extremely burdensome for the patients.</p>

One thing that she pointed to, which concerns many of us, is the extent to which there are huge commercial pressures in this field, which have led in other countries to an almost complete abandonment of what one might describe as the ethical limits that are widely understood in the medical profession. With an issue such as whether a grandmother's frozen eggs should be used for the purposes of fertilisation, one has to say that the difficulty in reaching a proper conclusion rises daily.</p>

<p><a name="11020174000036"></a>I wish to raise the issue of inspection and the issue raised by my most admired poacher on the question of medical research. First, there clearly has to be some inspection of the clinics that fall under the HFEA. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us his view of how that inspection will function. It may be more limited than it used to be, as the noble Lord, Lord Winston, and the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, said, but it must be maintained at the level of day-to-day practice. It is very important that that should be so in order that patients can have some sense of the safety of the enterprise.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para89"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000037"></a>On the much bigger issue of medical ethics, raised by the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, we are looking at a tremendous multiplication of the issues around ethics and the massive advance of life sciences. I accept that that cannot be dealt with by the HFEA, with its rather limited terms of reference. We must try to bring together a much more significant body to look at the whole issue of the relationship between ethics and life sciences. In that context, may I sweeten that pill by suggesting to the Minister that one way in which one could develop the great idea of a great society would be to look at a marriage between a body that had status in government terms with the other great bodies that look into these matters-the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, the Royal Society and others? In that way, one might get a genuinely wide spectrum of opinion, including great scientists and ethicists, on the issues that now confront us with life sciences. I believe that, unless we do that, we will quickly run into real problems where dogmatic forces take up resistance to any advances or other dogmatic forces look at the commercial elements as the way to guide our consideration of biological and biochemical ethics in future years.</p>

For most of my tenure I was paid the princely sum of £8,000 per annum, but it was a burden-nearly a full-time burden-that I undertook with pride and viewed as a privilege, grateful that infertility had not affected me. I wished to help others safely and with respect for their dignity, avoiding exploitation, and I remained in awe of the achievement of the scientists.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para90"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000039"></a>This debate, for which I am grateful, is about public confidence. It is not about confident, or self-confident, doctors; nor is it about how wonderful and trustworthy our doctors and embryologists are. If that were the issue, we would not need regulation in many walks of professional life and the controversy surrounding the Public Bodies Bill would fade away. It is easy in these surroundings or among researchers and specialists to forget how sensitive the issues of IVF and embryos are, and how very concerned the public are. The most vivid event during the passage of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill three years ago was the hundreds of members of the public protesting outside this Palace about the possible extension of embryo research to animal hybrids. If your name, like mine, is associated with embryo research, you are the recipient of hundreds of letters about it, and not always peaceful or unthreatening ones. As the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, said in her esteemed report of 1984, the  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC337"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>public want to know that some principles are involved. It is also not to be forgotten that most of the treatment in this country is private, and therefore a great deal of money is involved and the need for protection is all the greater. European law, as referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Winston, is a weakness in that protection but unavoidable.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para91"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000040"></a>Any analogy with the progress of science in the US, which is largely unregulated, is false. The US has been home to some of the scandals that have echoed around the world, whether it was a clinician using his own sperm, octuplets or the sale of eggs and sperm by needy college students for large sums of money. That is not a road that we wish to risk going down, but we are not risking it under the Government's proposal. Those who want to see the HFEA abolished seem to think that there will then be no regulation and that they will be free to do what they want, and quickly. But no-the law will be the same; consent will be needed exactly as before, and so will licences. Taking the processes into other organisations can be guaranteed to be no faster, no less bureaucratic and no cheaper; just worse. IVF is not routine because, although it is practised very often, any one treatment can throw up not only ethical issues that are known to us, such as saviour siblings, but also new ones, as the science progresses every day. One cannot separate the collection of embryos and eggs from patients from their storage, their storage from donation for research, donation for research from new research and stem cell work, and none of that from the great database, patient guidance and reliable statistics and health screening of donors. The risks will be too great and the gains from the government proposal nil, and our international reputation will suffer.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para92"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000041"></a>We are talking about an annual expenditure of £7 million, of which only £1.5 million to £2 million comes from the Government, and even this, I am told, could be reduced. Certainly patients will still have to pay for regulation if the tasks of the HFEA are dismembered, so it will be no cheaper for them either. Placing the regulation with the CQC is misguided. This is a new organisation. There have already been hints that it is overburdened and its operations have not always been met with praise. There is no improvement in public confidence there; nor will the public be persuaded that embryos will be treated with respect and that there will be bounds on embryo research if it is handed over to unknowns and not the accountable and expert figures of the HFEA. Review, yes; reversal, no.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para93"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000043"></a>As my noble friend said, the authority was set up as a result of the organ retention scandals at Alder Hey and Bristol. The retention of children's organs-including in some cases their hearts-without the consent or knowledge of their parents, rightly created outrage. It resulted in a crisis of public confidence. At the time, David and Hazel Thewlis, representatives of those affected, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11020174000101"></a>"The Human Tissue Act has provided a new foundation for the people of this country ... consent was the cornerstone of the Act, and this must colour all of the work of the Human Tissue Authority".</p>

<p><a name="11020174000044"></a>The authority has put informed consent at the centre of everything it does, and by doing so it has ensured the safe and ethical use of human tissue. I can confidently say that it has turned around the crisis in public confidence. However, it would be misguided to be complacent. The improvement is by no means universal or fully embedded. The reasons why we were set up have not gone away.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para94"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000045"></a>I am not hidebound or precious about which bodies should do the work, nor are my authority members. What we are concerned about is ensuring that the advances we have made are not lost, particularly the hard-won confidence of the public in the proper use of organs and tissue. We believe that the current proposals to transfer our functions to three or possibly four different organisations risk undermining the progress that has been made.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para95"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000046"></a>Paula O'Leary, of the Alder Hey parents' support group PITY II, said recently:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11020174000102"></a>"We fought hard for 10 years ... who is to say this is not going to start up all over again?".</p>

<p><a name="11020174000047"></a>Roger Goss from Patient Concern said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11020174000103"></a>"Dividing would be diluting. That would be going back down the hill in terms of protecting patients' rights to exercise informed consent".</p>

<p><a name="11020174000048"></a>The best way of making sure that does not happen is to maintain a clear focus on the safe and ethical use of human tissues and organs across all our sectors. To do that, we need to keep our functions together. That way, we maintain a consistently rigorous approach to consent, and guarantee an individual's right to decide, in life and in death, what happens to their bodies and the bodies of their loved ones.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para96"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000049"></a>The HTA is a small organisation with a broad remit. Our activities are interdependent. There are pathologist researchers, and researchers treating patients with tissue. Researchers study organs to improve the success of transplants. They are all regulated by the HTA and the ethical issues are common to all the sectors that we regulate. The gift of organs and tissues is a special one, giving rise to special ethical considerations. During the passage of the Human Tissue Act, consent was described as the golden thread through all our activities. That is why there is a single set of core standards across all the sectors that we regulate under the Act.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para97"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000050"></a>We are a lean organisation. The money that we get from the Department of Health is £1 million a year, about one-sixth of our total cost. We have to earn the rest. What we do makes a difference. Last year, we approved 1,100 organ donations from living people. Since we began regulating, these numbers have increased year by year. We work to give more people the gift of life offered by organ transplants. When tissue is used in medical treatments-such as the use of bone marrow stem cells in cancer treatments, or skin for burns victims-people can be confident that they are safe and good quality and have been donated with consent. If stem cells are collected from umbilical cord blood for potential future use, we safeguard the safety of

Our regulation of mortuaries means that individuals and their families can have confidence that their loved ones are treated with dignity and respect. In research, too, people can know that tissue will be kept only with their consent or the consent of their family, so they can be confident that their wishes will be respected.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para98"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000051"></a>I have no quarrel with the Government's intention to simplify the regulatory landscape. My plea is simply that we do not jeopardise the gains that the HTA has made by spreading its functions across a number of disparate organisations and losing the coherent overall approach that has been so successful in promoting public and professional confidence in the safe and ethical use of tissues and organs.</p>

Indeed, it is-as the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, said to me when I came into the Room-like Groundhog Day: we are back again debating exactly the same things. I thought that we had put these issues to bed. I do not, in fact, oppose my noble friend's proposals on principle. It is right that we constantly look at the organisations and that we constantly review their procedures to make sure that they meet the times. Nor do I claim infallibility for either the HFEA or the HTA. They are not infallible and are in constant need of reform and refreshment. However, it is the lack of clarity over what is proposed, the lack of any consultation on the proposals, and in particular the lack of any public involvement in these proposals that makes me concerned about the future functions of both the HTA and the HFEA.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para99"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000053"></a>On 13 October last year, in response to a Question from the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, the Minister said that,</p>
<ul><a name="11020174000113"></a>"20 years ago it may have made sense to look at a single body for carrying out the functions undertaken by the HFEA".</ul>
<p><a name="11020174000098"></a>He went on to say:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="11020174000104"></a>"Times have moved on".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 13/10/10; col. 512.]</p>

<p><a name="11020174000099"></a>However, it was not 20 years ago that Parliament discussed this issue; in fact, it was three years. It is three years since the Joint Committee on the Human Tissue and Embryos (Draft) Bill, which I was privileged to chair-four members of that committee are in the Moses Room today-carried out detailed scrutiny of proposals to amalgamate the HFEA, the Human Tissue Authority and the MHRA into a single authority, RATE. The unanimous view of the committee and of Parliament during debate on the successor Bill was to retain separate regulators. No one proposed amendments to change that during the passage of the Bill. There was unanimity in both Houses that the use and practice of both tissue and embryos should remain separate and that they should in fact have separate regulators. What is more, that was the overwhelming view of the medical and scientific community, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the BMA, the Royal Society, the Association of Medical Research Charities, the Academy of Medical Science, the Royal College of Nursing, the Wellcome Trust, the MRC and the Royal College of Pathologists. What has changed since 2008 to mean that all that is no longer appropriate?</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para100"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000054"></a>The Joint Committee also carefully considered the regulation of research using not only human embryos but also admixed embryos, including cytoplasmic hybrid embryos. The fact that a single regulatory authority could make decisions in the round-recognising that groundbreaking research was but a short step away from clinical practice-appeared to us at the time to be a distinct advantage. I believe that it remains a distinct advantage today. Indeed, it is because a single authority, independent of the Government, was able to exercise its regulatory duties over all activities involving the human embryo that confidence in this extremely sensitive, ethical and emotive area of human science has progressed with support from the public. Also, because there was an experienced independent regulator, science was able to triumph over the reactionary views of the then health Chief Medical Officer, who regarded admixed embryos as "Yuk".</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para101"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000055"></a>Crucially, where is the evidence that such change as is being proposed will benefit science and clinical practice and improve public confidence? Of course, there is a strong argument-the noble Lord, Lord Winston, made it in our committee-that fertility treatments using embryos are now commonplace and should be regulated like any other medical procedures. If the Minister believes that, let us have a public debate about it. Likewise, if the recent report of the Academy of Medical Sciences into the broader issue of the regulation and governance of medical research is going to be the blueprint for the new proposals, let us have a public consultation and a public debate on it. Let us not rush into removing organisations that have huge public confidence and the confidence of clinicians, as it would be rather like throwing out the baby with the bathwater.</p>

It is particularly timely as the Government consider their response to the major concerns about the inclusion of the HFEA and HTA among the bodies to be abolished under the Public Bodies Bill, whose Committee stage discussions we are set to resume.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para102"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000058"></a>As has been stated, we on these Benches can speak with some authority on this matter, having, as the House will be aware, closely examined the case for merging the HFEA and HTA into a single body just over two years ago while we were in Government. We came to the firm conclusion that two distinct independent regulatory bodies needed to be retained to oversee the areas of human tissue and assisted reproduction.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para104"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000060"></a>The HTA, born out of the terrible events at Alder Hey and Bristol hospitals, and the crisis in public confidence over unauthorised retention of babies' organs and tissues, has in our view established hard-won trust and respect among the public and professionals. My noble friend Lady Warwick is right to express concern that this will be lost if the current clear focus of the HTA is diminished in the transfer of its functions and role.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para105"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000061"></a>This does not mean that we do not recognise the scope for review and change within either body, or how the regulatory framework may be developed in the future. Both bodies themselves acknowledge this. We also recognise that many in the key professional groups involved are supportive of such changes as bringing all medical research regulation, including embryo research, within the remit of a single medical research regulatory authority, as recommended by the Academy of Medical Sciences. However, time and space would be needed for independent examination and review of this and the broader issues of how functions should be delivered in future and the risks, benefits and costs, rather than just the current focus on how functions are to be transferred.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para106"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000062"></a>We are concerned that the Government's process is to transfer functions to bodies that are as yet undeveloped and untested in this area of expertise. The Care Quality Commission is very much an organisation in transition and development, as it plans to take on a range of new duties and work envisaged in the Health and Social Care Bill. The role and possible functions of the new medical research body, and of the health and social care information centre, need much more work and development. All this is in the context of the Department of Health having its work cut out, taking on a huge volume of work, responsibilities and functions that will come its way from the abolition or reorganisation of many of the other bodies due to be axed in the Public Bodies Bill.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para107"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000063"></a>This is also at a time when the Government themselves are committed to large-scale staff reductions in the Department of Health. There are also key issues of accountability and independence at stake. Professional bodies and clinicians directly regulated by the HFEA, for example, of course have a key view of the changes needed, but they are not the only stakeholders, as speakers in this afternoon's debate have underlined.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para108"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000064"></a>Dismantling the HFEA and HTA, diluting their accountability and handing over their powers to Ministers and civil servants on such sensitive issues needs public involvement and stakeholder conversation, as speakers have pointed out. How would the new organisations be independently scrutinised and accountable? How much money would be saved from transferring the functions of the HFEA and HTA to the CSQ and new bodies? Will the Minister explain in more detail the timetable that he is currently working to for consultation and development of the new framework?</p>

<p><a name="11020174000065"></a>We on these Benches again urge the Government to reconsider their position and remove the HFEA and HTA from the bodies to be deleted under Schedule 5.</p>
<h5><a name="11020174000124"></a><I></I>5.17 pm</h5>

<p><a name="11020174000066"></a><b><a name="110201-gc0001.htm_spmin5"></a><a name="11020174000137"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl Howe):</b> I start by expressing my thanks to the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, for tabling this debate, and to all speakers for raising their concerns on this very important set of issues. Let me say immediately that the need to maintain public confidence in every part of the NHS is absolutely vital, particularly in areas as delicate as embryology and human tissue.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para110"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000067"></a>I can offer your Lordships absolute reassurance today that our plans do not represent any threat to patient safety, nor to the safeguards held within the legislative framework of provisions within the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act and the Human Tissue Act.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para111"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000068"></a>The Department of Health carried out its review of arm's-length bodies and published its recommendation in July 2010. We recognise the important role that the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Human Tissue Authority have played in the regulation of their respective areas over the years. We thank them sincerely for it. Our recommendations in respect of these bodies took account of the complexities and sensitivities attached to the particular areas in which they operate.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para112"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000069"></a>We are not rushing. We have allowed for the full length of the planned Parliament to take these changes to their conclusion. That is far longer than any other change proposed within the department's review, a decision that reflects both the importance of the two bodies and a recognition that we need to consult fully on, and settle, the detail of all the changes. However, we are clear that a more joined-up system needs to be formed.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para113"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000070"></a>With the establishment of the Care Quality Commission, and the Academy of Medical Sciences' recommendation for a new health research agency, new alternative structures have become available to ensure a more cohesive system for both healthcare and health research regulation that will benefit patients, health professionals and researchers. It is therefore our intention that the healthcare-related licensing functions of the HFEA and HTA will transfer to the CQC.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para114"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000071"></a>The CQC already regulates a wide range of NHS and independent healthcare providers. It registers them and ensures that they are meeting essential standards of safety and quality. It takes action if services drop below these essential standards and acts quickly if people's rights or safety are at risk. It undertakes investigations where there are concerns about quality, seeks the views of people who use services and informs people about the quality of those services. Noble Lords will recognise that this is similar to the roles undertaken by the HFEA and HTA, on a smaller scale, in respect of the regulation of infertility treatment and activities involving the use of human tissue.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para115"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000072"></a>We estimate that about 80 per cent of the centres currently licensed by the HFEA are either regulated by the CQC or in premises that it regulates. The CQC  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC343"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC343</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>also covers 60 per cent of the centres licensed by the HTA. It therefore seems wasteful, and indeed unsustainable, to continue to have these regulatory systems running in parallel. It makes sense to streamline, and ultimately to trust the CQC with the responsibility. There is no reason why the CQC should not be able to fulfil that responsibility as effectively as do the HFEA and HTA now.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para116"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000073"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, asked about the multiple birth policy. That is an issue that concerns the safety of patients and their children, and it would fit very well into the CQC's remit.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para117"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000074"></a>Noble Lords will be aware of the Academy of Medical Sciences' report on the regulation and governance of medical research. The report has made recommendations for simplifying the complex framework of regulation. In particular, it suggests the introduction of a new health research agency. The report has been embraced by a wide range of groups and experts. It recognises that there are significant benefits in bringing all medical research regulation, including embryo research, within the remit of a single medical research regulatory authority. The Government welcome the report and are considering their response.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para118"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000075"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred to Lisa Jardine's comments about the threat to the status of the embryo. I emphasise that the intention is to co-ordinate health research regulation better so that the system is streamlined without changing or compromising the safeguards. Current quality and ethical safeguards for research involving the use of a human embryo, for example, must be necessary for the research to be approved, and will remain very firmly in place. It is worth reflecting that, although the statutory requirement that the use of embryos is necessary and that the research is necessary or desirable will remain in place, a research regulatory authority with a broad outlook across medical research would be well positioned to make that assessment.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para119"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000076"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, asked who would be the keeper of ethical safeguards. I would say simply that the ethical safeguards are laid out in legislation, as agreed by Parliament.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para120"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000077"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, suggested that those in favour of the Government's proposals think that they will not be regulated at all. I have not gained that impression. The letters from professional bodies-the British Fertility Society, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and leading clinicians-show clearly that they understand that regulation and legislative provisions will remain firmly in place.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para121"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000078"></a>There are three key points that I want to make at this juncture. First-I say this especially to my noble friend Lord Willis-my department is planning to undertake a public consultation exercise this summer about where HFEA and HTA functions are best transferred. We regard this as a key part of the process. We will consult on any subsequent use of powers agreed in the Public Bodies Bill to effect those transfers. Effectively, therefore, there will be two consultations.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para122"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000079"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, understandably said that he would like to see the colour of the Government's money before reaching a view on these issues. As yet, no final decisions have been reached on exactly which  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC344"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC344</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>functions will go to the CQC, the potential health research agency, the Health and Social Care Information Centre or elsewhere. The exact detail of how the powers in the Public Bodies Bill might be used will be considered further and in detailed discussion with the HFEA, HTA, CQC and key stakeholders and in public consultation.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para123"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000080"></a>Secondly, our plans are about streamlining the functions of the regulatory bodies concerned. I regard that as the precursor to the lighter touch referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Alton. The lighter touch itself will revolve around the design of systems, which will ensure that the burden of bureaucracy is lessened overall for the NHS and other organisations. The CQC and the HFEA will play a leading role in the development of an efficient approach.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para124"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000081"></a>I stress again that, despite what some commentators have said, there is no intention to revisit the ethical provisions and safeguards in the HFE Act, the principles set out in the Warnock Report, or the principles of consent underpinning the Human Tissue Act. The proposed powers in the Public Bodies Bill could not be used to do any of those things. The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, asked what had changed regarding the principles that were debated at length in both Houses of Parliament. The answer is: nothing. The HFE Act provisions that recognise the special status of the human embryo will remain in place, entirely as they are now, as will the provisions in the Human Tissue Act that ensure that donors' and families' rights and safety are protected.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para125"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000082"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, said that she did not have a closed mind to some sort of reorganisation of functions, and I am hope I am right in detecting the same message from the noble Baronesses, Lady Deech and Lady Warwick, and my noble friend Lord Willis. That is welcome. All would say, as I have explained on previous occasions, is that if we cannot secure a place for the HFEA and HTA with the Public Bodies Bill then we will have to look to a future health Bill to support the transfer of functions, however we decide that that transfer should be conducted. However, to move into primary legislation would mean that the safeguards enshrined within the HFEA and HTA Acts would then be open to parliamentary scrutiny and vulnerable to amendment. I know that very few noble Lords would relish that scenario.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para126"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000083"></a>Thirdly, we envisage that our proposals should offer benefits to patients, healthcare professionals and researchers. We want the streamlining of regulation and reduction in the number of regulators to mean a less burdensome and bureaucratic system, both for the NHS and for the independent sector. We will work with the HFEA and HTA to try to ensure that those with the necessary expertise will follow their functions to the new arrangements so that it is not lost.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para127"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000084"></a>We have received significant numbers of representations from professional bodies and clinicians who are directly regulated by the HFEA, expressing support for the Government's proposal to include the HFEA in the Public Bodies Bill. Many also expressed concern about the HFEA's current approach to regulation. I have placed these in the Library.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC345"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC345</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para128"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000085"></a>My noble friend Lady Williams asked about legitimate public concerns about patient safety. I point out that the EU tissues and cell directive sets out robust provisions for safety and quality, covering assisted reproduction and the human application of tissue and cells. The role of competent authority to regulate against the requirements of the directive and standards for quality and safety will remain in place to ensure that patient safety remains a key consideration.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para129"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000086"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked where the Government saw the information functions going. We will have to consult on that issue carefully with all the bodies concerned. We will give due regard to the sensitivity and confidentiality of the nature of the information currently held by the HFEA and HTA, and we envisage that it will be a key area on which we will consult.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para130"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000087"></a>My noble and learned friend Lord Mackay and my noble friend Lord Willis referred to the proposal two or three years ago to form RATE. This is a completely different proposal; RATE simply involved replacing the HFEA and HTA with a single organisation that would undertake all the functions of the two bodies in their entirety. The proposal was rejected because the benefits of doing so for embryo research, for example, were not apparent. The current proposal to indentify where individual functions might best be placed is a different approach and has more potential obvious benefits, such as more streamlining and cohesion.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para131"></a>
<p><a name="11020174000088"></a>My noble friend Lady Williams asked why the Government did not set up a national bioethics committee. The consideration of specific ethical issues by bodies such as Nuffield and parliamentary scrutiny committees remains the preferred approach.</p>

I am a member of the charity Diabetes UK and actively support its work.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para133"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000002"></a>I thank the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Hill, for being here to respond to this debate. I am sure he has a busy diary and his attendance is very much appreciated. I am delighted that my noble friend Lady Young of Old Scone is also taking part. She is the chief executive of Diabetes UK, and I think it is fair to say that we are all looking forward to her informed contribution to this debate.

<p><a name="1102021000003"></a>Too many children with type 1 diabetes get a raw deal at school. Many of our children are excluded from school trips or social events; they are excluded from PE lessons; they are prevented from eating the  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC346"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC346</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>snacks they need when they need them; they are denied access to their medicines when they need them because they are "safely locked away"; and they experience bullying. Many young children are also left to inject insulin themselves, leading to increased fear and anxiety for their parents. It is therefore not just the children with diabetes who get a raw deal; their parents do too.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para135"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000004"></a>As well as the worry that parents feel for their children, many are forced to give up work because schools refuse support if a child is unaccompanied by a parent. Diabetes UK continually hears from parents who are unable to work because they have to go into school to administer medicine. Diabetes UK also continually hears from parents who have to fight for basic support from a school and they do not always get it. Some children have even been forced to move schools. They have heart-breaking stories, and there is an emotional and financial strain on families.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para136"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000005"></a>At this point, I congratulate Diabetes UK, which has established an advocacy service offering vital help for families struggling with these issues. Diabetes UK deals with around 100 enquiries a month. I also commend the charity for its long-running efforts to improve the lives of all children with diabetes at school.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para137"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000006"></a>Noble Lords may ask: why does this issue matter when only a small number of children live with type l diabetes? However, it is not a small number. More than half of our schools have children with diabetes. In recent times, childhood obesity and poor food choices leading to type 2 diabetes have been the focus of attention. While these issues should not be ignored, only 1,400 children in the UK have that form of diabetes. However, 20,000 children under the age of 15 have type 1 diabetes. Its incidence is increasing, particularly in the under-fives, where the number affected has increased fivefold over the past two decades. Two thousand children are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes every year.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para138"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000007"></a>Children with diabetes have as much right as any other children to a decent quality of education and school experience, yet their school experience varies greatly from no school support and very patchy support to good, child-centred provision. Many of our schools are failing to help children with diabetes to participate fully in learning and school life. Worse still, a lack of education among pupils, parents and teachers leads to bullying and children struggling to fit in. That increases their anxiety about being "different"-a feeling which could affect their confidence level in school and throughout life.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para139"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000008"></a>David, a boy from a school in Northamptonshire who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when he was three, got upset when a girl told him that she was not allowed to play with him in case she caught his diabetes. Another boy used to call him "Diabetes Boy". He remembers how he was not invited to play at his friends' houses, as their parents were scared that they could not deal properly with his diabetes if they needed to.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para140"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000009"></a>Children with type 1 diabetes are at risk of heart disease, blindness, amputations and kidney failure, so proper control of their condition is imperative. It is vital to keep their blood sugar regulated, avoiding fluctuations. Regular blood-sugar tests and injections, sometimes up to four or five times a day, are necessary  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC347"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC347</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to avoid life-threatening complications. These tests and injections have to take place during school. It is not a choice; it is a necessity. Insulin, via injection or pump, sometimes several times a day, is vital for life. At a school in Warwickshire, Jane, a young girl, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 11. She was told not to inject herself in public as it was "disgusting", but these injections have to take place during the school day.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para141"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000010"></a>Too many schools are uncomfortable about dealing with children with diabetes. Another school was not treating a six year-old's "hypos" when they occurred, nor telling the child's parents. It also refused to do the blood glucose monitoring test because staff felt too squeamish.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para142"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000011"></a>Many schools lack knowledge and have a fear of liability. In one school, although it had a nurse to assist children with diabetes, children were excluded when the nurse was on leave or absent, and pupils were made to wait outside the school gates until the nurse arrived each morning. There are some reports of schools expecting parents to ignore clinical advice and change a child's testing and injection regime to suit the schools' scheduling. Surely this should be the other way round.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para143"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000012"></a>Five year-olds banned from school sports days; schools refusing to hold supplies of insulin or blood-testing kits; worse still, schools refusing to have children with diabetes in their classes; a nurse refusing treatment to a toddler-the list of shocking accounts goes on. Some schools believe that administering medicine is not their responsibility. A Diabetes UK survey showed that, although more than half of schools were aware that they had pupils with diabetes, 70 per cent required either that such children injected themselves or that their parents came in to do it. Only 16 per cent allowed staff to test and give medicines to pupils.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para144"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000013"></a>That is why more than 80 per cent of five to 11 year-old children with diabetes are failing to achieve good control of their condition. This is the worst level in Europe. It means increased health problems for our children and worsening health as they enter adulthood. It is a preventable strain on the resources of the NHS and a preventable level of suffering.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para145"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000014"></a>We should have policies and procedures that protect our children, not put their health at risk. Too many children struggle to keep their diabetes under control. Schools need to be part of the solution, not the cause of the problem. They have a vital part to play in supporting the daily management of diabetes in children.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para146"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000015"></a>There are some great schools which support children with diabetes very well. The right attitude and leadership at a school can make a huge difference. Their good practice needs to become standard practice in all schools. All children with diabetes should be known to the school, with individual care plans prepared with the child, parent, doctor and teacher. Good practice involves a positive school attitude, a child-centred approach and a high level of training for the staff. The aim in every school, or at least every school with a child with diabetes, should be to train all teachers and support staff. Government need to be proactive and strengthen existing legislation so that children with  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC348"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC348</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>diabetes or any health condition are recognised as a vulnerable group and their well-being is properly supported.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para147"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000016"></a>The plight faced by children with diabetes at school exemplifies fundamental failings in public policy, bringing health and education together at a national and local level. Effective partnerships need to be built, and schools need to be required to provide staff training so that teachers have the confidence to support children with diabetes properly and ensure that the guidance is followed. Inspection is the key to ensuring the proper implementation of policies and procedures. We need to establish standards in schools for the support of children with specific health conditions and place a duty on Ofsted to monitor whether that is provided.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para148"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000017"></a>Do the Government know the number of children in our schools with long-term conditions and the numbers for each condition? It is only with accurate information that the Government can know the amount and type of support needed to plan accordingly. As Ed Balls, Labour's former Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, said, we want this to be the best place for children to grow up. That is why Every Child Matters. Every child needs the chance to fulfil their full potential.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para149"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000018"></a>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to agree to meet the delegation from Diabetes UK and myself to explore what can be done to improve the situation. I do not believe that this involves huge costs; rather, it involves a willingness and a desire to see the situation improved. As Daniel at age five said: "I like school, but school doesn't like me".</p>

It found that only 16 per cent of schools that have such children on the roll have a medication policy and administer vital insulin. This issue is not confined to diabetes; it is broader than that. There are other serious but manageable conditions which children have for which this is an issue.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para150"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000020"></a>I was surprised to read that this is not really a minority issue, since 52 per cent of primary schools have at least one child with this condition and, of course, other schools have epileptic children and those with serious nut allergies and so on. All require special attention to the needs of the child. I was horrified to read in the report that, when the school cannot administer insulin during school hours, often the parents have to come in to do so, jeopardising their opportunities to hold down a paid job.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para151"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000021"></a>When considering matters such as this I always turn to my bible, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which this country has been a signatory for 20 years. There are five articles in the convention which are relevant to this issue and, taken together, enshrine the rights of diabetic children as well as all others. Article 4 on the protection of rights says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1102021000108"></a>"Governments have a responsibility to take all available measures to make sure children's rights are respected, protected and fulfilled".</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1102021000110"></a>"Children who have any kind of disability have the right to special care and support, as well as all the rights in the Convention, so that they can live full and independent lives".</p>

<p><a name="1102021000104"></a>We do not normally consider diabetes as a disability but, for these purposes, these rights are relevant. Then there is Article 24 on health and health services, which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1102021000111"></a>"Children have the right to good quality health care",</p>

<p><a name="1102021000105"></a>the best possible in that country. Finally, Article 28, on the right to education, which says:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1102021000112"></a>"All children have the right to a primary education, which should be free".</p>

<p><a name="1102021000106"></a>It also says that any form of school discipline should take into account the child's human dignity. Excluding the child from school just because a nurse is not on the premises flouts their rate to an education. Certainly asking a child to inject their insulin in the school toilets flouts their right to dignity.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para152"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000022"></a>In this country, as with all other state signatories, every child has the same rights as every other. I therefore support Diabetes UK in some of its demands on the Government. It wants diabetic children to be viewed as vulnerable children. It wants the forthcoming child health strategy to spell out how the Government will ensure implementation of relevant policy in schools. This becomes particularly difficult when we have so many state-maintained independent academies, some of which will be primary schools. Being autonomous makes them a little more difficult for the state to control. That is the whole point of academies; they are not controlled by the state. How will we ensure that they take adequate care of these vulnerable children? Perhaps the Minister will tell us.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para153"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000023"></a>Diabetes UK is calling for Ofsted to routinely inspect whether schools have clear medication policies, but how can they do that when their remit is to be slimmed down to four planks? Which part of the Ofsted inspection will cover the health of children with long-term life-threatening diseases? The charity also asks for partnership working between schools, local authorities and PCTs. However, PCTs are being abolished, and academies will not have such close relationships with local authorities as those of community schools. How will diabetic children fare under these new regimes? I will be interested in hearing from the Minister on this.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para154"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000024"></a>It is a national disgrace that we have the highest number of children with diabetes in Europe and the lowest number attaining good control of blood sugar. As we have heard, only some 20 per cent do. Questions have to be asked about why we have such a large number of children with diabetes, and I assume that for some of those children the answer lies in obesity and lack of exercise. What are the Government doing to address childhood obesity and ensure that all children have the opportunity for enjoyable sport and other forms of exercise, such as dance and cheerleading, which do not always have a competitive element? If we do not address these issues, we will store up health problems and cost for the future, as the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, said in his excellent

Children with diabetes should not be excluded from lessons such as PE-they actually need exercise to help them to control their blood sugar-to extracurricular activities and school trips. Their human dignity requires that they have proper opportunities for injecting insulin, where necessary, in hygienic conditions.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para155"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000025"></a>I am pleased that the Education Bill published last week retains the duty on schools to promote the well-being of their pupils. In some cases, such as those of children with disabilities and conditions such as diabetes, that requires special measures because these are special children. Is that duty enough, or does the Minister think that other measures are required to ensure that schools take that duty seriously?</p>

<p><a name="1102021000027"></a>Sir Lewis Namier, the great historian of the pre-1832 unreformed Parliament, once declared with playful and light-hearted exaggeration that,</p>

<p><a name="1102021000107"></a>I wish that Namier was still around to make a merry quip about the fact that in the 21st century a Prime Minister has elevated someone who acted as his political tutor, if only in a minor respect. I stress the word "minor" because my right honourable friend the Prime Minister, with his instinctive grasp of politics, needed little guidance as he passed through the Conservative Research Department, which I helped to run in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para157"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000028"></a>The Conservative Research Department, now as then, is refreshingly free from ideological fervour, as every true Tory institution should be. That has enabled it to supply recruits for the Labour, as well as the Tory, Benches in this House. It nurtured the late Lord Longford, and 30 years ago the Conservative Research Department was adorned by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport.

This was the genesis of the historical interests that have always mattered to me more than anything else.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para161"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000032"></a>One other place is never far from my thoughts: Northern Ireland. I taught for some years at Queen's University in Belfast before becoming political adviser to Airey Neave in 1977. At that time, Britain often gave the impression of wanting to wash its hands of Ulster altogether. Today there is a lesser, but still grave, danger: indifference. The Province has a devolved Government. Why not leave it entirely to its own devices? I believe strongly that progress in Ulster will be greatly assisted if its affairs feature in a wider British context rather than being relegated entirely to a purely local one. I hope to play a part in achieving this.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para162"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000033"></a>The subject of today's debate illustrates the point. The recent formation of an all-party diabetes group in the Northern Ireland Assembly creates a new focus on the issue there, while the highly regarded national organisation, Diabetes UK, embraces Northern Ireland within its work. One complements the other.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para163"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000034"></a>There are today some 20,000 children of school age in the United Kingdom with diabetes, of whom around 1,000 live in Northern Ireland. During my time as general secretary of the Independent Schools Council, in the course of which I visited many excellent Ulster schools, such as the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and St Malachy's College in Belfast, I had numerous opportunities to admire the resilience and determination with which such children strive to reach high standards and so lay the basis for success in their subsequent careers. I have always been greatly struck by the indomitable spirit shown by children with diabetes as they make their way through the various rounds of the Northern Ireland Schools Debating Competition, of which I have the honour to be president.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para164"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000035"></a>Children with diabetes and their families have in Diabetes UK a formidable champion of their interests. Naturally, its overall aim is to encourage all schools to follow the practice of the best, where, every day, children with diabetes enjoy a full school life because they receive the support they need. But in some schools there are undoubtedly problems to be overcome, as the detailed surveys and inquiries conducted by Diabetes UK show-the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, referred graphically to them. Staff are sometimes reluctant to help with insulin injections, a point to which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred. That undoubtedly adds to the great burden on families. In a Diabetes UK survey in 2009, 35 per cent of the young people who responded said their parents either had to give up work or reduce their hours of work to support them with their diabetes in school. This is a matter of particular concern to the Northern Ireland representatives of Diabetes UK.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para165"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000036"></a>The problems could often be swiftly alleviated if schools followed the advice that Diabetes UK has provided in its excellent publications. Perhaps the most important is the admirably succinct <I>Children </I><I>w</I><I>ith Diabetes </I><I>a</I><I>t School</I><I>: </I><I>What All Staff Need </I><I>t</I><I>o Know</I>. It lives up to

To ensure that staff indeed know, governors and heads need to establish and enforce arrangements that are appropriate for their individual schools. In this, they face a particularly urgent challenge that emerges in so many areas of school life today: to reverse the intense pressure that teachers have felt for far too long to keep their distance from their pupils in case a close association is misunderstood. That simple, yet profound, factor has impeded progress in our school system. The Government have recently made clear their support for change to overturn this harmful trend. That would do an immense service to children with diabetes who, along with others suffering from serious health problems, need a close association with dedicated and sympathetic teachers.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para166"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000037"></a>I hope that this important debate in the House will assist the start of that urgently needed process. I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, who initiated this debate, for giving me this opportunity to address the House for the first time.</p>
<h5><a name="1102021000121"></a>5.55 pm</h5>

<p><a name="1102021000038"></a><b><a name="110201-gc0001.htm_spnew24"></a><a name="1102021000132"></a>Baroness Young of Old Scone:</b> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Lexden, on his dextrous maiden speech, which I suppose is an appropriate term for someone who bears the name of a batsman. He is of course steeped in the history and politics of the Conservative variety. Before he came to your Lordships' House, he was instrumental in writing a history of 175 years of the Carlton Club and 80 years of the Conservative Research Department. I am sure that his historical perspective on politics will come in useful in these days of new experiments in government. As the noble Lord said, the Conservative Research Department was the cradle from which many illustrious Conservative Members of your Lordships' House and the other place cut their teeth. I thank the noble Lord on behalf of your Lordships and on your behalf, if I may, wish him a fulfilling time in this House.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para167"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000039"></a>I also thank the noble Lord for cutting his maiden teeth on an important issue regarding diabetes. I of course declare an interest, which has already been revealed by other noble Lords, in that I am the chief executive of Diabetes UK. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, for initiating this important debate and for his kind words about Diabetes UK, and I thank other noble Lords who have spoken and who will contribute on this heart-rending issue; 20,000 children under 15 have type 1 diabetes, another 1,400 have type 2 diabetes and an increasing number have both types. Noble Lords have given us many statistics and told heart-rending stories, and although many children every day enjoy a full school life, others struggle with control of their condition, without having to deal with the other disadvantages that other noble Lords have mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="1102021000040"></a>Every child with diabetes should be entitled to the full opportunities of education and not be dependent on parents, many of whom, in these straitened times, simply cannot afford to give up work. I want briefly to add my voice to calls for what is needed to allow that to happen. There should, in particular, be an end to inadequate and variable levels of funding for support in schools. If statementing is inappropriate for these children, what mechanism is? There needs to be more

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para169"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000041"></a>Can the Minister assure us that the Government will put clear and specific duties on schools and local authorities to ensure continuity of care, in order that children with diabetes can benefit from a proper education? We need an end to the postcode lottery. I hope that there is no more increased use of the phrase which struck terror into my heart when I was in conversation about the postcode lottery in healthcare-that this was "no longer a postcode lottery but postcode democracy". I hope that the excuse of decisions being made on a local basis is not used to support very uneven standards of care and support for these children in schools. I ask the Minister to ensure that all schools be required to have a medical policy to define how they support the health needs of children with long-term conditions; there are more than 1 million children with long-term conditions in schools. There needs to be clarity of responsibility for funding support for children with diabetes in school and an end to the ping-pong between health and education authorities, which are both anxious to pass responsibility for support for these children backwards and forwards. There needs to be clarity on who is responsible and who can be held responsible.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para170"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000042"></a>Ideally, we would like to see a full-time qualified nurse for each secondary school and for each cluster of primary schools to help support children with diabetes. Also, as the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, said, we need an individual healthcare plan for each child that is prepared jointly between the child, the parents, the doctors and the teachers, and regularly updated. I hope the Minister can tell us how appropriate healthcare can be assured in educational settings, because it is not just about supporting these very vulnerable and often heavily challenged children in their school lives. It is also about reducing long-term financial costs of the condition to the NHS, reducing the adverse economic costs and emotional impacts on families, and ensuring that these children have a less tough time than they currently do, as well as achieving physical and economic well-being later in life.</p>

For the child in those days, when you had to do an insulin injection with all the equipment that existed then, it was a terrible business. These days we have wonderful insulin pens which you can get in many colours, and which at least look interesting when the child is with other school children.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para173"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000046"></a>The parent of a diabetic child is particularly affected, because they have to work even harder. Parents are always zealous to ensure that the education of their children is secured, but it means that they have to work out a balance within the family. There may be other children, a partner and so forth, and the wider family is also affected. I felt guilty that my nephew, a seven-year-old, had contracted diabetes, when I had contracted it at the age of 21 just a few months earlier. I somehow felt that it was a responsibility of mine. Of course, it affects the wider community, which is why the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, pointed out the effect on schools receiving children who are diabetic.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para174"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000047"></a>I want to talk about something positive. Some two or three years ago, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, might like to know, Diabetes UK put on an absolutely wonderful event in the House of Commons, which brought together about 100 children with 100 carers to meet us as parliamentarians. I was exhilarated that day, and I felt absolutely humbled, not only to meet these youngsters of seven, eight or nine, but also to meet the parents. One of the things that I observed was that, for a change, the children were meeting other children who were in the same boat, and the mothers-and they were principally mothers-were meeting other mothers and carers. That is my great worry. That occasion was thrilling, but so often within the school context the child, the carer or parent is isolated. We must redouble our efforts to remember that and to give further and greater help.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para175"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000048"></a>I refer to another event which the noble Lord, Lord Hill, might like to find out a little more about. Two or three years ago, a school from the West Country came up to address parliamentarians in the House of Commons. What was unique about the visitors was that they brought all the children from a particular class who had grown up with children who developed diabetes during their school years. These children had a better understanding of diabetes because the school had made an effort to teach them about it. Their rallying round was thrilling and clearly provided a wonderful support service for those with diabetes. I do not know whether that school still exists and whether we can find out more about it but their experience should be replicated. For the children who were not diabetic it was not a burden; it contributed to their better understanding of treating people who are afflicted by this disease.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para176"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000049"></a>Although I think that the noble Lord, Lord Hill, has already been asked this question, I want to ask him about the clarity of responsibility in placing specific duties on schools and local authorities through upcoming legislation to ensure that there is support and continuity of care at schools for diabetic children, as that is crucial. There needs to be a thread running through the legislation to provide that protection. We need to  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC355"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC355</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>end the current patchwork quilt of varied support up and down the country, and we also need sufficient and accessible funding to help all those who are involved in looking after diabetic children. Again, schools, local authorities and health authorities need to work together. We need to ensure that all schoolchildren with diabetes can take part in all aspects of schooling. Never again must kids be excluded because of the misunderstandings that exist. Would the Minister care to say something about the possibility of having a full-time nurse in all secondary schools, or at least a full-time nurse in a cluster of primary schools? She-it normally is a "she"-can be crucial in spreading the news to teachers about looking out for the child who is diabetic and who perhaps is suffering a hypoglycaemic reaction, or "hypo". That needs to be better understood.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para177"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000050"></a>We need better healthcare planning within schools. We need to ensure that each school has a medical policy for children with long-term medical conditions, who I believe number something like 1 million in the community. Each diabetic child should have an individual and regularly updated healthcare plan with the involvement of the child, the parent and the doctor. Diabetes UK is rightly worried about the education and children's Bill, which is coming up, in that it removes duties on schools to co-operate with local planning arrangements, which are so vital. The growth of academies, where there is no direct link to local authorities, fractures that important complementary approach. It is unclear from the Health and Social Care Bill how schools fit in with the new framework. Perhaps the Minister could say more about that.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para178"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000051"></a>In the final minute or so available to me, I should like to refer to something that the noble Baroness, Lady Young, may be able to take up in her role, supported by the Government. I may be wrong but I am not aware that any of the school dramas on our TV screens show diabetic children. More importantly, if they do, I am not sure whether they show them as a positive image, rather like my example of the schoolchildren supporting the members of their class who had diabetes. I wonder whether the noble Baroness could explore that through her agency. It was done recently with regard to someone with Parkinson's disease. I recall a film which had a positive image, where the heroine had acquired Parkinson's at a very young age. There are interesting and inspiring stories to tell about this and we should take every opportunity to do so.</p>

I found several case studies of children who have type 1 diabetes but who, beyond that, should be leading happy, fulfilling and productive lives at

It is to our shame that that is not the experience for a large and significant group of children with diabetes across the country.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para180"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000054"></a>In the case studies, Matty's mum said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1102021000114"></a>"Matty decided that he wanted school dinners this week. At the end of last term I went in and saw the cook and the dinner lady and explained that he would need to go to the front of the queue. This morning he told me that he didn't want school dinner because the dinner lady had told him off for walking to the front of the queue and made him wait until last."</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1102021000115"></a>"When Charlie started reception we had a major fight on our hands with the headmaster who expected Charlie to do all his own blood testing, choose an appropriate snack and go and get it from the store cupboard - all at the age of 4 and only having been diagnosed 4 months previously!"</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para182"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000056"></a>In case we form the impression that the fault always lies with the school or with the local authorities, the next case study will put us right. I quote the case of Anthony:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="1102021000116"></a>"Unfortunately, when we had a meeting with the school and our DSN, (who we thought was there to support us) made matters worse. The DSN seemed to do her utmost to discourage the school from taking on procedures such as testing, her attitude being that schools should not have to take on such levels of care. We were quite surprised and hurt at her attitude. It made us feel very much on our own in the pursuit of a good standard of care for a young child starting school".</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para183"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000057"></a>The obstacles were not just raised for families through PCTs in these case studies. In another study, the health and safety officer told a teenage boy with diabetes at a secondary school that he could not carry his insulin and self-monitoring equipment with him at school. This meant that if he felt unwell he would have to go a considerable distance to the school's reception area to carry out tests, which would have put him at risk.</p>

<p><a name="1102021000058"></a>Obviously, as my noble friend has said, there are children with diabetes who enjoy a full school life because of the support their school gives them. But the sad little stories from desperate parents that I have quoted tell us that by no means all children have that opportunity in 21st-century Britain. Why does the Minister think that such inconsistency of policy and practice across local authorities exists, despite guidance being offered by the last Government, and what are his Government's plans for dealing with this inconsistency? I am certainly not making a political point here, because things could not have become so much worse for this group of children during the eight months of the coalition Government. We all have questions to answer as far as these children are concerned. However, I am concerned by the scale of future local authority spending cuts, as well as by the demise of PCTs and the reorganisation of the NHS. Both these coalition Government policy commitments will throw an already complex picture for children with diabetes into sharper relief in the future.</p>

<p><a name="1102021000059"></a>How does the Minister respond to Diabetes UK's concerns, shared by this side of the House, and mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that the changes proposed in the education and children's Bill, which will remove the duty of schools to co-operate with local planning arrangements, together with the growth of academies with no direct link to a local authority, risk further fragmentation of services for this group of

It would be helpful to learn from the Minister how schools are expected to fit into the new framework envisaged in the Health and Social Care Bill.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para186"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000060"></a>I know that the Minister, who I have a great deal of respect for, will agree with me that it is intolerable for parents and children who have this condition to be treated so differently in so many different schools, different LAs and different PCTs, under different head teachers, by different nurses and different staff. These children and young people do not deserve such a cruel lottery of treatment in their schooling. We know that all schools have a common-law duty of care. They also have a duty to promote pupils' well-being. What does the Minister feel is current legal framework for ensuring school support? I know that under the previous Government's Every Child Matters policy, of which I am immensely proud, all schools were required to have a disability equality scheme. Does the Minister believe that further guidance is required?</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para187"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000061"></a>What is the Government's response to Diabetes UK's recommendations? They are ably set out by the noble Baroness, Lady Young: that there should be multi-agency working across schools; that there should be proper training for staff in schools, to feel confident when dealing with children with diabetes; that there should be an individual healthcare plan for every pupil; and that there should be one full-time qualified school nurse for each secondary school and cluster of primary schools, as noble Lords have said.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para188"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000062"></a>I would be happy for the Minister to write to me on some of these points. As I have said, our own record in this area is not so burnished that I demand answers from him. I know that all noble Lords who have taken part in this important debate will want to see an end to the confusion, alienation and misery that too many children with diabetes and their carers are currently experiencing.</p>

We have already heard a significant number of points that the Government will need to reflect on. I pay tribute to the work that he has done, both here in Parliament and as a member of Diabetes UK, to raise awareness of the problems that diabetes sufferers endure. I was glad to have the chance in the small hours of the morning last week to discuss some of the issues that he has raised; it was one of the few benefits that I could see of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill, but we must be grateful for small mercies.</p>

I think that I speak for all noble Lords in saying that we look forward to his contributions to debates in the future.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para190"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000065"></a>I shall briefly recap on some of the figures that we have already heard and, in doing that, I welcome very much the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, and the tone and way in which she approached this issue. This is not a political issue, and the approach and the legislative framework taken by the Government follows the one taken by the previous Government.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para191"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000066"></a>We have heard some of the figures showing the scale of the problem. There was an audit in 2009, which showed that there are an estimated 23,000 children with diabetes, the vast majority with type 1. The peak age for diagnosis is between 10 and 14 years, but type 1 can affect children in their preschool years. No one would want a child with a long-term medical condition such as diabetes to miss out on school life or be treated less favourably because of it. We have heard a number of powerful examples and personal testimony that make that point.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para192"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000067"></a>It is also true-and this lay behind some of the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Harrison-that there are many examples where schools provide very good support to pupils, especially in primary schools, where they are working closely with parents and the local NHS. There is one example in Nottinghamshire, which other noble Lords may also know, where the county and city councils and the local NHS trusts run training for school staff. They allow heads to apply for reimbursement towards funding staff, and run a network of diabetes specialist nurses to cover primaries and secondaries. So there is good practice, and one issue that we need to reflect on is how we can make that good practice more universal. I accept the point made by a number of noble Lords that provision is currently patchy. We know that there are cases in which parents do not feel-and not only do they not feel it but it is obviously true-that they get the support that they need. We heard today of children with diabetes having to miss classes or be excluded from school trips or being left to inject themselves unsupervised, with parents feeling that they are forced to reduce hours or give up work or move schools because they do not trust  staff to carry out blood tests or carry out insulin injections.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para193"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000068"></a>I acknowledge the picture that has been painted by Diabetes UK in its report, <I>State of Diabetes Care in the UK 2009</I>. While there is excellent practice out there, in other areas it is patchy. I also understand the strength of feeling behind its <I>Children's C</I><I>harter</I> report. It is a view that has been expressed by noble Lords today and by my noble friend Lady Walmsley, in looking at it from an international perspective. There should be equal access to treatment, high-quality medical care and support in schools for children and young people.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para194"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000069"></a>I shall briefly summarise the legal framework and then move on to talk about some of the other issues raised and address directly the request put to me by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, about meeting and how we might take things forward.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC359"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC359</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para195"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000070"></a>Schools are responsible for drawing up their own policies in the light of their statutory responsibilities-for example, health and safety legislation or the Equality Act 2010-and local needs. The department recommends that schools and their employers should have policies in place on the management of pupils' medicines and on supporting pupils with medical needs. There is no legal duty on school staff to provide medical support, to administer medication or to supervise a pupil taking it. Like the last Government, we do not have plans to change that. However, as has been pointed out, there is a common-law duty on all staff to act in loco parentis when children are at school.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para196"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000071"></a>To encourage schools to provide support for children with medical needs, the DCSF as it then was, jointly with the Department of Health, published guidance on managing medicines in schools and early years settings back in March 2005. The DFE, together with the Department of Health, is currently reviewing that guidance. Perhaps that provides us with an opportunity to reflect on some of the points that have been raised. I invite Diabetes UK, perhaps through the noble Lord or through the noble Baroness, Lady Young-I am spoilt for choice-to speak to my officials about that. We also hope that we can use the review as an opportunity to draw attention to good practice. Again, I hope that Diabetes UK can help us to champion that good practice.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para197"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000072"></a>It is sensible for schools to have clear general policies in place to support pupils with medical needs. For pupils with serious medical needs, it is sensible for schools to draw up individual healthcare plans setting out in black and white the level of support that is needed, and clarifying for staff, parents and pupils the help that will be provided. Our guidance makes it clear that any volunteers, usually school support staff, who carry out such duties on a daily basis, should be properly supported in doing so.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para198"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000073"></a>Staff who volunteer to assist with any form of medical procedure should be given reassurance that they will not be sued for any action they take in providing the vital support that pupils with medical needs may require. We know, once they understand the reasons for the injections and blood tests, and have been adequately trained in practical skills and provided with reassurance, that they are acting within the scope of their employment, they are generally keen to help individual children.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para199"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000074"></a>As has already been discussed, the Government are reforming the way in which the NHS deals with public health-in particular, how it works with local children's services. The White Paper, <I>Healthy Lives, Healthy People</I>, published last November, has a clear principle at its heart: that prevention is better than cure. It sets out a clear plan to reduce health inequalities and causes of premature death and illness.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para200"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000075"></a>That means making sure that there is a major role for the NHS, particularly for school nurses and community healthcare teams as well as paediatric diabetes specialist nurses. School nurses will continue to have a vital role in providing training and support to schools, in developing health reviews at school entry and in managing pupils' well-being and medical and long-term conditions.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC360"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC360</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para201"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000076"></a>I reassure noble Lords that we are listening to the concerns that have been raised and are working closely with the Department of Health to ensure that no child misses out because of their long-term medical condition. We are also working closely with the department to enable schools to draw on additional expertise from local health professionals and children's services to meet the needs of their pupils. We seek in particular to develop a new vision for school nurses that reflects their broad public health role in the school community. I would again invite Diabetes UK to talk to the Department of Health about this work.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para202"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000077"></a>Perhaps I may respond to some of the specific issues that were raised. I will write to the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, if I have failed to respond to all her points. I was asked about academies. It is the case that academies have to meet independent schools standards regulations. They require them to have regard to the Department for Education guidance, <I>Health and Safety: Responsibilities and Powers</I>, which sets out the key elements of a health and safety policy, one of which is supporting pupils with medical needs. Having visited a lot of academies, I do not think that there is any intrinsic reason to believe that they will carry this out less well than any other school. Heads of academies who I have met care about their children just as much as the heads of any other school. Academies are free to buy back services from a local authority.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para203"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000078"></a>I was asked by my noble friend Lady Walmsley about competitive sport. PE remains compulsory from the age of five to 16. The Government are keen to encourage competitive sport. I agree with her that it can play an important part in dealing with the issues. I am very happy to discuss with her further the slimmed-down Ofsted regime. Of the four categories that we have outlined, one is to do with behaviour and safety.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para204"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000079"></a>In response to questions about funding and as noble Lords might expect, there is little specific that I can say, but I was struck by the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, who said that this not a matter primarily of money and that it is much more to do with finding ways of working sensibly together.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para205"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000080"></a>Like, I think, all noble Lords, the Government are committed to ensuring that all children and young people with long-term medical conditions get the help and support that they need while at school. We will work closely with the Department of Health to ensure that. I would be delighted to meet the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, to discuss this further or perhaps to point him towards my honourable friend Sarah Teather, who has departmental responsibility for these matters. I am grateful to him, as are all other noble Lords, for giving us the opportunity to debate these important issues.</p>

<p><a name="1102021000081"></a><b><a name="110201-gc0001.htm_spnew28"></a><a name="1102021000137"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> My Lords, I am grateful for the opportunity to draw attention to the importance of heritage railways in Britain and I thank all noble Lords who have put their names down to speak in this short debate. I declare an unpaid interest as president-elect of the Heritage Railway Association, a volunteer body that brings together the heritage railways in the United Kingdom and Eire. I have also recently been appointed by the Prime Minister to the board of trustees of the National Museum of Science and Industry and shall be serving on the advisory board of the National Railway Museum.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para206"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000082"></a>The heritage railway movement covers over 111 working heritage railways and tramways, as well as 60 steam museum sites. Indeed, laid end to end, our heritage railways would stretch for some 500 miles, reaching from King's Cross to Dalwhinnie in the Highlands of Scotland. There are over 399 stations on these lines-more than on the Underground network-and there is a fleet of around 800 preserved steam locomotives.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para207"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000083"></a>Apart from the preserved lines, steam is still alive and well and earning money on the national network, too, with many steam excursion trains being run each year, as well as regular services on the West Highland line, the Cambrian coast line and between York and Scarborough. I pay particular tribute to the work of the specialist team at Network Rail as well as the train operators who co-operate to make this possible. As a number of noble Lords may be aware, in the past few years a brand new A3 steam locomotive called "Tornado" has been built by volunteers to the original LNER design. That is in revenue service as well.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para208"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000084"></a>I should also mention the value of the work of the Railway Heritage Committee in designating historic railway artefacts and directing their disposal, when no longer required on the main line, to heritage railways or museums. This approach has been actively supported by Network Rail, the train operating companies and the rolling stock leasing companies. As a result of their working harmoniously together, people can see and appreciate many of these historic pieces of equipment in daily use.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para209"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000085"></a>The status and role of the Railway Heritage Committee is about to change as a result of the Government's decision to include it in the Public Bodies Bill. I shall not anticipate the debate that we are due to have in Committee on that Bill, other than to say that we are very close indeed to agreeing a way forward that would provide for the statutory powers and duties of the committee to be transferred to the Science Museum.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para210"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000086"></a>Your Lordships may ask why all this matters. The main answer is that heritage railways give a huge boost to the local economies of the areas that they serve and that we lead Europe and America in the development and presentation of our heritage railways. They are a source of inward tourism as well. To underline the point, the Heritage Railway Association took the lead in establishing a federation of heritage railways across Europe, called FEDECRAIL. Our expertise is keenly sought by other members, particularly in eastern Europe. Those members also look with envy at the statutory powers exercised by the Railway Heritage Committee and wish that they had something similar in their countries.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC362"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC362</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para211"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000087"></a>The value to tourism is enormous. The National Railway Museum attracts almost a million visitors annually, more than any other museum in England outside London. Heritage railways attract more support than almost any other part of the heritage sector, with the exception of the National Trust. While historic ships, aircraft and classic cars have their adherents, no other transport mode attracts anything like this level of interest, with direct benefit to the tourist economy.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para212"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000088"></a>This has been confirmed in independent studies undertaken for a number of lines, notably the West Somerset, Severn Valley and Welsh Highland railways. I think that we may hear something about the Welsh Highland Railway from the noble Lord, Lord Wigley. The West Somerset study was undertaken by Manchester Metropolitan University and indicated a value of £1.90 to the local economy from every £1 of fare income to the railway. This means that the value of the railway is at least £4 million to the local economy. I say "at least" because this excludes the considerable spend by volunteers on accommodation, food, fuel, restaurants and so on. These are significant sums of money. Each year, 6.7 million people are carried on heritage railways, whose earnings in 2009 amounted to £81 million. Not only does this point to a value of over £150 million a year to the economy, but it is a figure that is growing year by year as lines are extended.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para213"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000089"></a>The other major economic benefit of heritage railways is in employment. Altogether almost 2,000 people work in the sector, some part-time, and often in areas of high unemployment-heritage railways frequently provide high-quality engineering jobs in areas where little alternative skilled work is available.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para214"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000090"></a>Then there are the health benefits of providing easy access for walking, as well as the environmental benefits of car-free access to the countryside. While most railways offer a steam-train ride as their main attraction, an increasing number also fulfil a useful transport role. The Swanage Railway, for example, provides a park-and-ride service to reduce congestion on the A351 through the picturesque village of Corfe Castle. The Welsh Highland Railway provides sustainable transport to sensitive areas in the Snowdonia National Park, particularly the village of Beddgelert. Also, what better way is there to visit the Brontë Parsonage Museum at Haworth than by the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway?</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para215"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000091"></a>We may add to this the benefits to education that are offered by many railways, with their information packs for schools linked to the curriculum, as well as visits to depots and signal boxes. The range of subjects covered by the railway is wide-ranging: history, of course, as well as geography, economics, social history and politics. Indeed, there is almost no area of life in Britain that is not touched by the railway. It was Benjamin Disraeli-or the Earl of Beaconsfield, as perhaps we should call him in your Lordships' House-who, writing in his novel <I>Sybil</I> in 1845, correctly predicted that,</p>
<ul><a name="1102021000117"></a>"the railways will do as much for mankind as the monasteries did".</ul>
<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para216"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000092"></a>None of the achievements of today's heritage railway movement would be possible without the support of volunteers, of whom more than 17,632 are recorded in the returns made annually to the Office of Rail Regulation,  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC363"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC363</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>quite apart from those who help in other ways such as fundraising. The range of activities that they undertake is astonishing, from safety-critical work such as driving trains or signalling, to developing specialist skills for locomotive restoration, to straightforward labouring to keep the railways in good shape and safe for passengers.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para217"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000093"></a>What better example-and I address this point to the Government particularly-of the big society at work could there be than a heritage railway, with volunteers working alongside paid staff, bringing a boost to the local economy and a range of societal benefits without recourse to the taxpayer? The level of volunteer input means that heritage railways run without subsidy and raise their own capital. A number have also been successful in securing Heritage Lottery Fund grants.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para218"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000094"></a>Some people find it hard to understand why there is such a high level of interest in railways and railway heritage among British people-an interest increasingly shared by many overseas visitors. Go to any bookstall and you will see a huge range of magazines and periodicals devoted to this subject. I have seen a total of 16 magazines about railways or model railways in my travels and I understand that these have a combined circulation of around 360,000. When we add in the electronic magazines and the fact that magazines are handed on to friends, we have a regular railway readership of about a million.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0001.htm_para219"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000095"></a>My theory is that this interest-I hesitate to call it an obsession-reflects genuine pride in the fact that railways were a British invention and the source of a dominant export industry for over a century. They contributed enormously to the 19th-century Industrial Revolution. They transformed people's lives, making it possible for them to live in the countryside and travel into towns and cities to work. They were responsible for creating most of Britain's seaside resorts and enabled working people to go on holiday.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldhansrd/text/110201-gc0002.htm"/>


<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000096"></a>Even today, the influence of Britain's railways worldwide cannot be overstated. Railways have been regulated and given special powers by government throughout history and their significance in people's lives, whether or not they are regular users, means that they have a very high profile and raise strong views.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000097"></a>Many railway staff are proud of the industry's heritage, which plays some part in their motivation. It is perhaps for all these reasons that from 1947 onwards the Government have considered it necessary to legislate to protect Britain's railway heritage, which has been actively supported by the industry, from the days of the British Transport Commission to today's rail companies. I hope that when replying to this debate the noble Earl the Minister will acknowledge this uniquely British success story and confirm that the Government will continue to encourage its progress and development.</p>

<p><a name="1102021000099"></a>I have been on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway to Whitby this year and on the Bluebell Line. Anyone visiting railways such as these will immediately pick up the tremendous enthusiasm of people who visit the sites. It is difficult to imagine a more attractive site to visit than the development of a model railway. We hope that some of these railways-the noble Lord mentioned the railway to Swanage-will shortly be connected to the main line, as is the Bluebell Railway. Then there will be the question of interworking with the main line, which many of us are sure will happen.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000100"></a>In the discussions that we are to have on the Railway Heritage Trust, it is important to ensure, first, that the artefacts that have been preserved so conscientiously in the past are transferred-if they have to be transferred-to a body that will take the matter very seriously. Secondly, we would like to be assured that the cost of the transfer is cheaper than what we have now. I am pleased to hear the noble Lord say that he is hopeful of an arrangement with the National Railway Museum. That will be a relief to me, because I expected to be told that the matter would be dealt with in Marsham Street, which would stop the collection of heritage artefacts for some years to come.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="1102021000101"></a>We fully support what has been said, all of which has been true. I think that the heritage railways deserve our fullest support.</p>

First, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Faulkner on the dedication that he shows to the heritage sector, which is absolutely vital. I am pleased to hear that he is going to be involved in all the various committees and is actively negotiating some continuity for the heritage sector in order to preserve our industrial heritage, rather as the National Trust and English Heritage do for our old buildings and landscape. They may have to end up owning half the forests in this country if one believes the press comments at the weekend. However, I return to the subject of the railways.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000003"></a>The heritage railways are still part of the national railway structure. They have the potential to-and sometimes do-fulfil a very useful role in moving people around, whether for shopping or getting to school. They do so effectively and reliably, and I think we will miss something if that does not continue. When I worked in Folkestone years ago, I noticed that the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway-which, as a narrow-gauge railway, is quite long-used to run a school service, taking kids to school every morning and bringing them back in the evening, and many other railways do that. In that respect, it is interesting to compare the heritage railways with Network Rail's branch lines. The All-Party Parliamentary Rail Group had a meeting last night with Sir Roy McNulty, who is carrying out a cost-reduction study for the Department for Transport. I told him that I hoped he was not going to start cutting Network Rail's branch lines due to the cost. Network Rail started off a year or two ago by saying that the freight-only lines cost £100 million a year. However, it could not provide any evidence for that and we ended up with a figure of £10 million, so something was slightly wrong with the estimation.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000004"></a>The Network Rail branch lines and heritage lines have one thing in common. There's a very cheap way of running light trains on them which could provide the service that I was just talking about. That is something like the Parry people mover. It is like a tram but it runs on the main line. It has been operating between Stourbridge Junction and Stourbridge Town extremely reliably-with a reliability rate of, I think, 99 per cent-since it has been going. During the recent cold weather, it operated much more reliably than the mainline trains. However, I foresee opposition to its use coming from the main railway people, the passenger operators and Network Rail. I often detect a similar reluctance on the part of some of the heritage lines to accept something like this to provide a service when they do not want to run steam trains or anything else; in other words, rather than run a daily service, they would prefer to keep the line doing nothing other than running a steam train on a Saturday.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000005"></a>I know that costs are involved but I hope that, as we move forward in the various debates on our railway heritage, we will try to see whether some of the issues facing not only the heritage lines but the Network Rail branch lines can be tackled, along with the problem of getting a connection between the two without spending an enormous amount of money on consultants' fees. We should see whether we can use this wonderful piece of infrastructure that is all around the country for the benefit of those who live locally. I see it as part of the localism agenda.</p>

There are five of Wales' little trains in my home area, including the Welsh Highland Railway, the Ffestiniog Railway and the Snowdon Mountain Railway, which provide major inputs into the local economy.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000007"></a>A study in 2009 undertaken in Bangor University-I have the honour of chairing the advisory board of the Bangor Business School-showed that some £9 million a year is already coming into the local economy, and the amount is likely to increase to about £12 million. About 250,000 visitors a year use the lines, which are also used by a lot of local people. This half term it will be possible to travel by steam from Caernarvon to Porthmadog and back. It is a tremendous journey, through Beddgelert and the Aberglaslyn Pass, where you experience a vista that you cannot see when you travel by road or drive. This is an important part of our economy.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000008"></a>My maternal great-grandfather came to the area as a railwayman, and I am therefore part of the heritage, I suppose. The impact of the railways on my area has generally been enormous since the 19th century. One thinks of the difference they made to places such as Llandudno, Aberystwyth and Pwllheli. Without the railways, those towns would not have grown. Would Holyhead be there, had it not been for the main line across Anglesey? The railways brought dramatic views-the Menai Bridge, the Froncysyllte viaduct and so on. Even where railways have stopped operating, we are lucky enough to have some cycle tracks, which elsewhere often live side by side with the small trains.</p>

<p><a name="1102023000009"></a>I should declare an interest. I am president of the National Library of Wales, in Aberystwyth, where we have a major collection of railway-related items, including the Henry Robertson collection, which is a major collection of railway plans and sections in north-east Wales from between 1842 and 1888. The collection is worth seeing, and includes plans used in the parliamentary process, with original manuscript drawings of the track layouts, bridges and buildings. There are some 12,000 items in that collection. The National Library has held day schools on these subjects for the Welsh Railways Research Circle. We have more than 2,000 photographs dealing with railways in the National Library and a number of paintings. In fact, one of the paintings is of the Friog Cutting accident in 1883 and is a unique item. There is a very warm welcome to be had there. There is a tremendous collection, which of itself is part of the railway heritage. I hope it will be seen as such.</p>

I shall not detain the Committee for long, but this is an important debate at an important time, when we debate other matters in this House. I pay tribute to the Railway Heritage Committee and the work that my noble friend is doing to secure its future during the passage of the Public Bodies Bill. I wish him all success in that.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000011"></a>As a tourist in the UK, I have had many pleasurable journeys on railways with my wife Alicia, after introducing her to the heritage railway sector some years ago before we were married. I had the pleasure of travelling on the narrow-gauge Ffestiniog Railway some years ago, and only last summer I travelled on the steam railway in Antrim, Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000012"></a>What is striking about all these journeys is the enjoyment to be had and the variety of people who are travelling-including teenagers, young couples, children with their parents and grandparents, and people from all over the world. I concur with the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, in this respect. As my noble friend Lord Faulkner said, these railways boost the local economy by supporting the hotel and restaurant sectors and other parts of the local tourism industry.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000013"></a>I agree very much with the comments of my noble friend Lord Berkeley, who is well known for his expertise in the transport sector as a whole. His knowledge of and support for the heritage sector are evident. I concur with the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Wigley. Some of my earliest memories as a child are of getting on the boat train from Euston to Holyhead on our regular family holidays to Dublin in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

The moment I decided that I was going to be seriously interested in 12-inches-to-the-foot-scale railways was probably when I was aged 14 and a Gresley J38 crossed the Grange Road level crossing in the west of Alloa. That became impossible-first, because we failed to preserve any of the Gresley  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC367"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC367</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>J38s, and, secondly, because the railway disappeared from Alloa for 38 years. However, the railway has returned. It is now served by ScotRail and is proving to be a success of a considerable order. I shall not go on too much about that, because clearly that is not what this debate is about.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000015"></a>Like stamp-collecting, an interest in the railways teaches people a lot about geography and probably economics, and causes them to travel. A huge number of books and DVDs are published. You can build up the historical identity of your locality. For example, the Alloa Waggonway, which existed from 1761 to 1929, was the first place at which iron was used for the rails. Curiously enough, there was a failure with wooden rails. They experimented with putting metal on top of the wood, but that did not work. Alloa probably has the earliest of all the railways.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000016"></a>Interest in the railways is multigenerational, which is in itself extremely useful. I have already mentioned our failure to preserve a Gresley J38, which is probably not as important as the failure to preserve one of the Peppercorn A1s, or allowing the "Duke of Gloucester" to deteriorate to the point where its rescue was remarkable. It has been very interesting to someone also interested in the built heritage how the A1 steam trust went about raising the money, not relying on large grants-although there were certainly generous donations-but by going out to build a class 8 locomotive based on the price of a pint. That meant people giving £5 a month. I am one of the late joiners at number 2,440, but I know that people giving between £5 and £10 a month to the A1 Steam Locomotive Trust means that it has a monthly income of £10,000, which is quite remarkable. I must admit, looking at what is happening to the locomotive "Tornado" at present, it is just as well that people are giving money in those quantities. It is certainly morale-building when something like "Tornado" comes to a preservation railway. Interest in it undoubtedly creates increased attendance.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000017"></a>There is a question in my mind as to whether the steam preservation movement should create the locomotive of the future-the steam turbine electric. We will see whether the movement can support that.</p>

He is a dedicated heritage railway man and very knowledgeable.

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000019"></a>In 1861, the Paraguay central railway, which was built, run and owned by the British, started construction. It was completed in 1911 with 376 kilometres of track between Asunción and Encarnación, where it crossed the great Paraná River and joined up with Argentine railways. The British continued to run it until 1959, when it was nationalised by President Stroessner and gradually fell into disuse until the restoration of democracy. It was then privatised in 1999, when Dr Lauro Ramirez took charge and created a plan for the restoration of the railway as a major tourist attraction. Fortunately,  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC368"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC368</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he was a heritage enthusiast. So far, the restored railway runs for only two or three kilometres. It has two, wood-fired steam locomotives, originally built in Scotland and shipped out there. It also has several restored carriages. There is a workshop in Sapucay, 30 kilometres by road from Asunción, which is probably the last wood-fired steam locomotive workshop in the world. Nearby is the English village where the workforce lived and which has huge historical and architectural value. This is a remarkable story. The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, would be very wise to visit the railway when he next travels in that part of the world, as I know he has visited the heritage railway in Tierra del Fuego in the very south of the continent. He might also like to take in Antofagasta, at the start of the Antofagasta-Bolivia railway of which I was 30 years ago chairman and which runs up to Bolivia. It is a commercial railway, but it also has a museum with a lot of old locomotives. I am glad to say that I played some part during my brief chairmanship in making sure that that was established and properly run.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000020"></a>This debate is an opportunity. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, on his splendid endeavours.</p>

I declare an interest as one of the numerous vice-patrons of the Bluebell Railway, which is endeavouring to raise funds in its 50th jubilee year. I believe that I have one or two colleagues in the House who are also vice-patrons.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000022"></a>Like the noble Lord, I think that heritage railways, particularly the Bluebell Railway on which I shall speak, epitomise all that one looks for in the big society as it is currently described. Last year, for example, the Bluebell was granted the prestigious Queen's Award for Voluntary Service. While it has a calibre of full-time employees, its mainstay is volunteers. Nearly 600 of them keep the organisation running and have done so for more than 50 years. Last year, the Bluebell line carried 187,000 passengers, including my noble friend. It is a good employer, a great tourist attraction and a great educator, not just for Sussex, where I reside, but also for the UK; people come from overseas to visit our steam trains. It had a turnover last year of more than £3 million. In addition to that, as others have described, there is a wider benefit to the local communities as people come in to see the railway.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000023"></a>As well as providing full-time employment for staff, it currently offers more than 40 full-time apprenticeships in its carriage, wagon and locomotive works, which are not only maintaining the old skills that are required but, with the use of technology, moving into new areas and developing new engineering skills.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000024"></a>The trust has very ambitious plans for growth. Of particular importance, it is now working on a northern line extension project that will link into East Grinstead and the national rail network. That gives the opportunity to talk about some of the issues which the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, mentioned.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000025"></a>There is a final obstacle to be overcome: the removal of thousands of tonnes of household waste that were tipped into the Imberhorne cutting on the outskirts of  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC369"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC369</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>East Grinstead. The work is costing well over £2 million. There is urgency to the task, as our exemption from land tax charges unfortunately expires on 31 March 2012. If the waste is not moved by then, we will face very high costs arising from the landfill tax. After April 2012, the costs will triple, with an extra £64 for each tonne taken out. Indeed, if it is not cleared before 2014, the cost will go up to £80 per tonne, which is an extra cost on top of the expenditure that I have just described. These costs are being driven by government changes to the landfill tax.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000026"></a>The Bluebell Railway is a charity and many of our volunteers are having a problem with the cost of providing fuel for their cars, which affects the numbers who turn up. We are also having problems with the local authorities, which are suffering expenditure cuts, and that is also a concern for us. We are therefore looking for donors.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000027"></a>As the train is ahead of schedule, I shall take an extra minute to make an appeal for donors, in the hope that people will be prepared to put themselves forward. In terms of the big society, we are looking to individuals and groups, but I also make an appeal to bigger organisations. The Bluebell Railway line will end at East Grinstead, adjacent to a big Sainsbury's store. Sainsbury's will gain considerable benefit from having this heritage railway running alongside its store. As we have not been able to persuade a large company to make a very helpful donation towards what we are endeavouring to do, perhaps I may appeal to the noble Earl. In spite of all the problems that he has, perhaps he could have a helpful word in the right quarters with some of the bigger organisations around East Grinstead, which so far have not pulled as much weight as we would have wished, and that might help in getting the rest of that household waste out of the cutting. I look forward with great interest to a response on that.</p>

My noble friend is an active and committed supporter-indeed, leader-of the heritage railway movement. I know of his dismay when he found out the potentially devastating implications for the work-past, present and future-of the Railway Heritage Committee, having discovered that it had been included in the dreaded schedules to the Public Bodies Bill. My noble friend has since campaigned tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure not the continuation of the committee in its present form and relationships but the continuation of the vital statutory role and functions that the committee currently undertakes to protect our railway heritage.</p>

<p><a name="1102023000029"></a>It is clear from my noble friend's comments today that substantial progress has been made, one hopes, towards achieving that goal. I understand that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, and the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, are-how shall we put it?-not exactly hindering my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester in seeking to achieve his worthy and honourable objective. If I have judged the situation correctly, then I congratulate the two noble Lords concerned for the good that they, too, have done, and are doing, on this issue.</p>

<p><a name="1102023000030"></a>My noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester has given the facts and figures on the considerable contribution being made by heritage railways to the economy-frequently, as he said, in areas where jobs are at a premium and the local economy needs every boost it can get. However, the attraction of our heritage railways goes deeper than that. Heritage railways have to meet the tough operating and safety standards of the Office of Rail Regulation before they can carry any passengers. They are real railways and working railways, not static museum pieces with no life and character of their own. They are the living embodiment of railway life and the railway experience in the era when steam was supreme. That is why they attract the interest, involvement and commitment of so many volunteers and enthusiasts in restoring, maintaining and operating steam locomotives and formerly closed passenger lines, and it is why they attract, to the economic advantage of the local communities concerned, the patronage of so many passengers-mainly tourists-who want to sample or remember the age of steam and the early days of diesel traction. It is a passion and an interest widely shared. Indeed, my 60th birthday present from my family was a couple of hours on a heritage railway in Derbyshire driving a steam locomotive up and down the line-under strict supervision, I hasten to add, and not with any passengers. It was a fascinating experience and something that I had always wanted to do.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000031"></a>As a nation, we are proud of our history and of our past, and we are prepared to invest our time, our energies and our money in ensuring that that history is preserved and valued. Our railways are an important part of that history, and the great strength of the growing and expanding railway heritage sector is that it truly achieves that objective of preserving and valuing our memorable and nation-changing railway history. Even more importantly, though, the sector does that in a way that, as the now heritage railways did when they first opened so many years ago, strengthens and develops the economies of the communities that it serves, by attracting large numbers of visitors and tourists and creating jobs, as well as now providing the younger generation with a living insight into life in a previous era.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000032"></a>I am confident that, like us, the Minister also recognises the importance of the contribution of the railway heritage sector, and I look forward to this being reflected in his reply to this debate.</p>

<p><a name="1102023000034"></a>This is a good time to be debating this matter. Sixty years ago, a group of amateur railway enthusiasts was given control of the Talyllyn Railway in mid-Wales, a statutory railway company, and on 14 May 1951 they achieved a world first-the operation of the first public passenger train of the preservation era. At the time, many doubted whether the venture would succeed, but it did, and since then the heritage railway sector has  


<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC371"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC371</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prospered, not only in Great Britain but right around the world, as the noble Viscount has told us. It is important to understand that the heritage railway sector's prosperity is entirely a product of private, individual enterprise and initiative, independent of any involvement of the Government, which is limited to essential safety regulation.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000035"></a>Indeed, for Tom Rolt, the distinguished author and one of the founders of the Talyllyn Railway Preservation Society, the venture was a small but significant move against what he saw as the prevailing trends of the time of creeping state control of people's lives and the increasing uniformity of our industrial processes. In a real sense, the railway preservation movement was an early flowering of what we now call the big society, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, and touched on by another noble Lord as well.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000036"></a>That is all the more remarkable when we consider the scale of the task facing railway preservationists. To give just one example, the pioneering Talyllyn was still using its original track and rolling stock, which were 85 years old when the preservationists took over, presenting them with the pressing need for expensive renewals. The heavy engineering task is no less awesome today.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000037"></a>To emphasise individual achievement is not to say that the Government are uninterested in railway heritage. Through the Department for Culture, Media and Sport we sponsor the National Railway Museum, the largest in the world. In 2011-12, the department is funding the National Museum of Science and Industry, of which the NRM is a major part, to the tune of £37 million. Of course, all noble Lords are delighted to hear of the new appointment of the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner. The Department for Transport currently sponsors the Railway Heritage Committee, of which more later.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000038"></a>I turn to the subject of the debate. Let us first consider the sector's contribution to education. Heritage railways provide living museums, enabling the younger generation to learn an important aspect of social, economic and engineering history at first hand. To give just one example, the Sittingbourne and Kemsley Railway in Kent provides educational visits for schools and has recently appointed an education officer who is currently working to provide material relevant to the curriculum. It has developed an association with a local scout group to provide interesting and useful railway-based activities in which group members from different age groups can participate. The railway also works with Swale Skills Centre to provide training for suitable candidates.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000039"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, talked about the Bluebell Railway and its work with paid staff, volunteers and apprentices. That pattern is repeated around the country on many railways.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000040"></a>I turn to the sector's contribution to tourism and the regional economy. These are two sides of the same coin, and many noble Lords have made contributions on this topic. Heritage railways create direct paid employment, often in areas where jobs are in short supply; promote tourism and attract visitors to their areas; and generate spending on services in the area, and indirect employment.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC372"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column GC372</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000041"></a>This is not mere conjecture. For example, academic research in 2008 on the local contribution of the Ffestiniog Railway showed a total economic impact on Gwynedd of between £8 million and £9 million per annum, with between 334 and 375 full-time posts supported in the region. Thus, the total benefit to Gwynedd was estimated at £15 million a year. In England, the East Lancashire Railway Trust has estimated that the railway yields total regional gross value added of £1.6 million and supports around 70 direct, indirect or induced jobs in the local community.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000042"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, talked about making full use of the heritage railways infrastructure. Heritage railways provide other benefits too. The West Somerset Railway has recently been running freight trains, delivering stone from the Mendips for coastal defence work and keeping heavy lorries off the Somerset roads. The heavy engineering workshops that these railways often have to establish provide a valuable engineering capability for the wider community.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000043"></a>I should also mention the Government's role in safety regulation. The heritage railway sector voiced concerns that changes to the safety regime might prove to be disproportionately burdensome to its operations, prior to the introduction of those changes in 2006. Through discussion with the department, the sector was able to agree the final implementation timetable for those changes, which included an additional six months' preparation period prior to their application to non-mainline railways, during which the safety regulator provided operators with additional support and guidance.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000044"></a>Accessibility has been another regulatory issue affecting heritage railways. We know that the sector takes accessibility seriously, but the department recognised that it would not be desirable to destroy the very nostalgic atmosphere that passengers, including those with disabilities, wished to experience, by making old carriages fully accessible. Therefore, Parliament agreed last year to exempt, by order, all pre-1999 vehicles on heritage and tourist networks from accessibility requirements in perpetuity.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000045"></a>I promised earlier to return to the Railway Heritage Committee. Last October, the Government announced our decision in principle to abolish the committee, and the committee has been listed in Schedule 1 to the Public Bodies Bill to facilitate that change. The noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, has proposed a transfer of the committee's power of designation to another body-for example, the board of trustees of the Science Museum, which is the legal entity behind the National Museum of Science and Industry, which includes the National Railway Museum. It is important to remember that the role of the Railway Heritage Committee is to designate items, not to hold them; I am sure that all noble Lords will agree.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000046"></a>The Government recognise the valuable work that the noble Lord has done on this proposal. While not wishing to pre-empt the debate on this matter that will take place during Committee stage of the Public Bodies Bill, I assure him that positive discussions are continuing between the relevant government departments.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, referred to the prospect of the Bluebell and Swanage Railways connecting to the main lines. The Government look forward to

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000048"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, talked about the Parry people mover. I do not know much about this project, but we must look at all practical options for reducing the cost of the railway while maintaining services.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para44"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000049"></a>In his opening comments, the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, said that there was a fleet of 800 preserved locomotives, but of course there are many more waiting to be restored. There is no shortage of work. The noble Lord also mentioned the "Tornado" project. I am sure that all noble Lords look forward to the boiler problems being resolved.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para45"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000050"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Montgomery, talked about Paraguay. I acknowledge the importance of the history of the major contribution that UK engineering firms made to overseas railways. The noble Viscount mentioned a famous steam locomotive that was built in Scotland. I recently read a fascinating book about the building of railways around the world.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000051"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, mentioned the Bluebell Railway, which I have visited more than once. Having been educated at Stowe School, I look forward to the "Schools" class locomotive of that name being returned to running order after giving sterling service. That locomotive was originally secured by my noble friend Lord Montagu of Beaulieu.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, also talked about the East Grinstead extension of the Bluebell Railway. We congratulate that railway on its efforts to remove waste from its line extension. I am sure that the noble Lord will continue to press local businesses to contribute to the line extension, but sadly it is not my role as a government Minister to intervene.</p>

<a name="110201-gc0002.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="1102023000053"></a>In conclusion, I am grateful for this opportunity, in its 60th anniversary year, to congratulate the railway heritage sector on its successes, often in the face of monumental engineering and financial challenges, preserving an important aspect of the nation's heritage, enriching the lives of millions and providing tangible and very welcome support to our regional economies.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="11020129000032"></a>In my Statement to the House of 29 June 2010, I informed the House of the outcome of my review of how the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will spend its programme funding in this financial year. I am now in a position to announce decisions about programme spending for the next financial year 2011-12.</p>




<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS72"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column WS72</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="11020129000033"></a>The Foreign Office's priorities are to safeguard Britain's national security, build British prosperity and support British nationals around the world.</p>

<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="11020129000034"></a>The review we have conducted will ensure that FCO programme spending is aligned with our priorities and contributes to the development of Britain's diplomatic influence and the promotion of our values. We must ensure the money is spent effectively and supports the Government's commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of GNI as official development assistance (ODA) by 2013.</p>

<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="11020129000035"></a>As a result of the review the FCO will change the way it manages its programme spending. We will give British ambassadors greater responsibility for deciding how best to spend their local budgets to support UK foreign policy objectives and strengthen bilateral relationships. We will reduce administrative spending and seek other cost savings. We will introduce new procedures to assess the impact of FCO programme spending worldwide.</p>

<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="11020129000036"></a>For the 2011-12 financial year, we have decided to allocate:</p>
£57 million for programmes dedicated to national security;£24 million for programmes to support UK prosperity, including through the promotion of a stable and open global economic environment which will help countries develop; and£58.5 million for the support of democratic values, human rights and British diplomatic influence overseas.
<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="11020129000037"></a>This is a total of £139.5 million. I anticipate that in future years it will be necessary to make some reductions in these allocations in order to be able to continue to support our diplomatic network overseas, while achieving the savings we committed to making during the comprehensive spending review.</p>

<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="11020129000038"></a>Within the overall allocations set out above we have made a number of significant decisions on funding for individual programmes next year.</p>

<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="11020129000039"></a>On security, we will sustain spending on counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation at £38 million and £3 million respectively. We will provide £16 million for spending on counter-narcotics and rule of law programmes in Afghanistan. This represents a reduction of £2 million, which will be made possible without affecting the outcomes of our projects there, as several of them will reach the end of their capital investment stage. We will incorporate future spending on drugs and crime projects into the bilateral programmes managed by posts overseas, while provide a total of £2 million as a ring-fenced element within those budgets to be dedicated to projects on drugs and crime.</p>

<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="11020129000040"></a>We will significantly increase spending on programmes to help countries develop and to support UK prosperity, bringing these to a total of £20 million. We will spend more on projects which promote openness, international trade and investment, transparent and stable regulatory environments and strengthen the multilateral trading system and international investment opportunities, while resisting protectionism, including creating a commercial diplomacy fund of £4 million dedicated to identifying and securing commercial opportunities for our businesses, and supporting inward investment to the UK. We will maintain current levels of spending

<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="11020129000041"></a>In terms of the promotion of our diplomatic influence and values, we will increase funding for bilateral programmes to £19 million, including a ring-fenced allocation for the western Balkans and other non-EU countries in Europe. We will establish a new fund of £5 million to address, in partnership with regional governments, the long-term underlying governance and social, economic and political participation issues affecting the Arab world. We will increase spending in the support of the Overseas Territories to £7 million. We will sustain our spending on human rights and democracy at £5 million. We will slightly increase spending in support of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy to £3.5 million. We will dedicate £17 million to spending on scholarships while at the same time ensuring a greater proportion of that spending is in Commonwealth countries.</p>

<notus-date day="1" month="2" year="2011" textMonth="Feb"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS74"></a><b>1 Feb 2011 : Column WS74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="11020129000045"></a>Today signals a landmark in the freeing up of councils to successfully manage their own housing stock for the benefit of their tenants-a change that has long been talked about, but the coalition Government are actually delivering.</p>

<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="11020129000046"></a>Today we are publishing the information councils need to plan for this significant reform-reforms which will see councils keep their own rents and spend them on their own housing. This includes a detailed description as to how their opening financial position will be determined and the process for implementing these reforms in April 2012. It also gives each local authority a much clearer idea as to exactly how they will be affected by the reforms. This will enable them to use the next 14 months to plan ahead and put themselves in the best possible position to maximise the benefits of the new freedoms. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House.</p>

<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="11020129000047"></a>In line with the Government's emphasis on transparency, local authorities and tenants will be able to see how and why the valuation has altered since the proposals published in March 2010.</p>

<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="11020129000048"></a>Our proposals for self-financing for council housing will:</p>
give councils the resources they need to manage their own housing stock for the long-term-correcting decades of under-funding; give councils the incentives and flexibility they have sought to drive up quality and efficiency; and give tenants the information they need to hold their landlord to account-replacing the current opaque, centralised system with one which establishes a clear relationship between the rent councils charge and the services they provide 
<a name="110201-wms0001.htm_para43"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="11020129000049"></a>These reforms are fair. They are rooted in a consistent and tested calculation of the value of each council's social housing business, producing a sustainable self-financing settlement for each local authority. I expect all councils to welcome the reforms and to start planning now how to make the most of their new freedom.</p>

<ul><a name="11020134000159"></a>
<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>To ask Her Majesty's Government what discussions they have had with the government of the United States and the Joint Strike Fighter prime contractor about (a) structural and propulsion design flaws for the F-35B version, (b) the impact of them on weight and costs, and (c) the possibility of the entire programme being cancelled.[HL6096]</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="wa_st_1"></a>
<a name="11020134000003"></a><b><a name="110201w0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="11020134000196"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Astor of Hever):</b> The UK has been briefed on difficulties discovered during development test associated with the F-35B structure and Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) propulsion systems and also on the design changes which have been processed to fix these issues during the development phase. The UK remains confident in the US programme leadership and the prime contractor in its ability to deliver these whilst maintaining capability and affordability. As our contribution to the JSF development programme is fixed under the 2001 memorandum of understanding there will be no direct development cost implications from these changes to the UK.</p>

<a name="110201w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="11020134000004"></a>While we will continue to swatch closely the development of F-35B short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant and will seek to ensure that we gain the benefits of our early investment in F-35B STOVL aircraft for test and evaluation, our decision announced in the strategic defence and security review to change variant to the more capable F35C carrier variant (CV) for operational use has not been influenced by these development issues. Both the F35C CV and F35A conventional take-off and landing variants are performing as expected during test and have not experienced the same technical issues as the F35B STOVL. We have held no discussions with the US on the possibility of the entire programme being cancelled.</p>

While we are committed to procuring three F-35B aircraft, at a total of $632 million, to conduct joint test and evaluation with the US Armed Forces, we will gain substantial benefit from operating these aircraft as a part of the F-35C programme. In particular, the mission systems are common between all three JSF variants and our continued participation in joint test and evaluation is vital for the delivery of essential legal, safety and operational sovereignty requirements. The three F-35B aircraft are early phase aircraft. The final unit cost of our F-35C operational aircraft will be substantially lower.</p>

<a name="110201w0001.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_69"></a><a name="11020134000091"></a>First, the Government have assisted the British Israel Chamber of Commerce to establish a high tech committee and launch a high tech initiative which HMG have co-designed. The initiative puts leading British tech entrepreneurs in charge of developing strategies in three specific subsectors.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_70"></a><a name="11020134000092"></a>Secondly, allied to the chamber's high tech initiative, the Government are hosting a round table at the end of January 2011 on building a UK/Israel high tech partnership involving British tech entrepreneurs and their Israeli counterparts. Together, they will aim to identify the potential synergies between the UK and Israeli high tech economies, discuss how to encourage more Israeli companies to look to UK for business partnerships, and establish how to increase the number of British companies doing business with Israel.</p>

<a name="110201w0001.htm_para71"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_71"></a><a name="11020134000093"></a>Thirdly, the Government have launched an initiative to strengthen UK/Israel scientific links. This is an important underpinning to a stronger high-tech partnership. It is focused on the life sciences, where both Britain and Israel have immense strengths. It was launched by the Foreign Secretary during his visit to Israel in November 2010 and a new UK/Israel Life Sciences Council will have had its first meeting in Jerusalem on 25 January, bringing together top scientists from both sides to identify specific fields in the life sciences where Britain and Israel are both strong and therefore provide a focus for collaboration.</p>

In doing so, EULEX judges work together with their local counterparts in mixed panels or mixed teams, ensuring that such cases are properly investigated, prosecuted, adjudicated and enforced, according to the applicable law. EULEX judges serve both at the level of the supreme court and at the level of district courts in Kosovo.</p>
