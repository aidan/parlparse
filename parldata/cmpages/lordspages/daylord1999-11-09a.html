<A NAME = "91109-01_head0"></A><H3><center>Finance Act 1998: Conditional Exemption for Chattels</center></H3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Chesham </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether the statement of the Baroness Hollis of Heigham that "It is a general principle of English and Scottish law that retrospective legislation should be avoided wherever possible" (HL Deb, 13th October, col. 502) applies to conditionally exempt items for inheritance tax purposes.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   Yes, my Lords, the presumption against retrospection applies to this as to all other legislation. The 1998 Finance Act made two changes; first, to tighten the conditional exemption quality standard for chattels, but only for future undertakings, secondly, to reaffirm the original principle of reasonable public access behind conditional exemption and to take steps to ensure that it is achieved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Chesham: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. Is he aware of the comment made by his noble and learned friend Lord Williams of Mostyn, who is sitting next to him, that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"we all bristle when we see retrospective legislation"?--[Official Report, 18/10/99; col. 856.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-01_para0"></a>
If there is so much bristle in the Government over retrospective legislation, why on earth have they retrospectively withdrawn Writs of Summons in the House of Lords Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, we seem to be going somewhat wide of a Question about conditional exemption for chattels under the Finance Act 1998. I believe that I had better leave it at that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that retrospective legislation leads inevitably to injustice, and that for centuries Parliament has avoided it? Will the Government therefore do their utmost to preserve the principle that, except in rare circumstances affecting the state, there should be no retrospective legislation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I made it clear in my original Answer that there is a presumption against retrospective legislation. There are of course exceptions--as the noble Lord, Lord Renton, is well aware--for finance Bills, where the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 allows taxes to be raised before legislative authority is given. <P>


<a name="column_1248"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1248</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, I agree with the noble Lord that the presumption against retrospective legislation should be continued.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bridges: </B>   My Lords, I have an interest in the particular matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Chesham, which I explained to the House on an earlier occasion. I do not propose to repeat it now. I invite my noble friend Lord McIntosh of Haringey to look again at the explanation which he gave to the House when replying to the debate on 26th May:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is proposed that there should be improved access only where there is already in the agreement a requirement for reasonable public access".--[Official Report, 26/5/99; col. 1032.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-01_para1"></a>
That statement makes it clear that the provisions under discussion are not retrospective legislation, as was claimed by the noble Lord, Lord Chesham, and others. It seems to me that my noble friend's words prove the opposite. The agreements between the taxpayer and the Revenue, freely reached on the basis of the earlier law, were deemed by the Treasury to be inadequate. In order to strengthen the provisions for public access, the Treasury decided to amend the law so that it could insist on more public access. That procedure had the effect of nullifying the agreements previously reached, because the legal basis upon which they relied was removed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-01_para2"></a>Does the Minister agree that the definition in the Oxford English Dictionary of retrospective legislation as,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"operative with regard to past time",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-01_para3"></a>
applies in this case? Will the Minister please re-examine this question so that it may be resolved satisfactorily through agreement between willing taxpayers and the Revenue?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, of course in preparation for this Question I re-read my speech of 26th May and it will come as no surprise to your Lordships that I agree with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-01_para4"></a>There is no element of retrospection. The undertakings given in exchange for conditional exemptions were that there would be reasonable public access. The experience following those agreements was that reasonable public access was not achieved--in other words, there was a unilateral derogation from that agreement by the owners of the chattels, not by the Government. It was necessary for the Government to ensure that the original undertakings were adhered to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, in view of the statement of the noble Lord, Lord Bridges, about "willing taxpayers", will the Minister consider the number of unwilling taxpayers paying inheritance tax? Does he not believe that this tax is defined as one that can be avoided if one is clever or has good advice, because there is a great deal of inheritance tax avoidance planning in this country? Does not the Minister consider it time that the Government looked to the Australian system, where inheritance tax has <P>


<a name="column_1249"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1249</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been abolished completely, and other forms of taxation are used instead? Will he put that suggestion to his right honourable friend the Chancellor?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, certainly it is true that the issue of inheritance tax is a major concern for a limited number of people. I am not sure that there are any willing taxpayers for any kinds of tax, whether that is inheritance tax or any other kind. There are taxpayers who believe that paying tax is the right thing to do, but that does not necessarily make them willing.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-01_para5"></a>The principle behind conditional exemption is designed to ensure that there should be public access to works of art and chattels owned by, on the whole, rich people. It has had some effect. However, because it has not had enough effect, the Chancellor felt it necessary to protect the public by ensuring that there really was access to those works of art on which tax had been foregone by the Exchequer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Saatchi: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Lord accept that the most generous interpretation that can be given to the dispute between the Government and the owners of the exempt chattels is that there has been a misunderstanding between them as to the rights and obligations under the terms of those provisions? Therefore, does he not believe that it would be gracious of the Government at least to offer to compensate owners who have been confused about the change of rules for the increased costs that they will suffer in terms of security and insurance?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I believe I should make it clear that there is no disagreement, still less misunderstanding, between the Government and the vast majority of those who have taken advantage of conditional exemption. They are already compensated by not having to pay the tax. If they want to preserve their right to maintain those chattels without showing them to the public, they have a very simple solution: they can pay the tax. I do not believe that there is any obligation on the Government--either moral or legal--to contribute to security or legal costs.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, no. UK recruitment and deployment policies accord with international standards laid down in the UN <P>


<a name="column_1250"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1250</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Convention on the Rights of the Child and International Labour Organisation Convention No. 182. The UK has played, and will continue to play, a full and active role in negotiations on this matter. We recruit only volunteers with parental consent if the volunteer is under 18, and ensure that all recruits understand fully their military obligations prior to enlistment. However, we keep our policies under review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for that reassuring reply. As the British Army consists of volunteers, in contrast with some other NATO armies, does she agree that a 17 year-old should be enabled to be part of a combat unit if that is what he wants to do? As regards younger teenagers, are they not suitably placed in cadet forces at present, where training and discipline can do them only good and also possibly prepare them for later military service, including the Territorial Army?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the noble Lord has hit exactly the right point. Ours is not a conscript army; it is a volunteer army. If young people of the age of 17 want to take part in combat, they can do so under the current deployment policies of the Armed Forces in the UK provided that they are fully trained--that is a very important point--and fully understand the obligations placed upon them. The noble Lord makes a most apposite point about 16 year-olds. Extensive training is given, not only within the Armed Forces but in vocational issues; for example, the opportunity to obtain a Level 2 NVQ. Therefore, proper pastoral care is given to those young people.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister look again at one part of her otherwise very satisfactory reply: that which relates to young people between the ages of 16 and 18 being engaged in combat? She will be aware that the United Nations is making great efforts to bring about an international agreement that no young person under the age of 18 will be put into combat. In particular, I am thinking of the dreadful civil wars raging in Africa. Will she consider again whether the United Kingdom might help to give a lead in this matter, which might then be followed by many other countries?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the discussions taking place in the United Nations. My answer to the noble Baroness is that the real point of worry is the use of very much younger child soldiers in conscript armies. I do not believe that there is a comparison between some of the child conscripts that we have seen, for example, in Sierra Leone or Uganda where children as young as 12 are forced into conscript armies, and the way that the United Kingdom Armed Forces operate. Of course, the noble Baroness will know that there has been <P>


<a name="column_1251"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1251</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discussion on the optional protocol. That is due to resume in January next year and the United Kingdom will play a full part in those negotiations.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, will the noble Baroness agree that many of us approve of the proposal to allow young offenders to volunteer? Does she agree that they would benefit greatly from the discipline and organisation which they would encounter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am very pleased to hear such an unequivocal endorsement of the Government's position on this matter. In that way, the noble Lord distinguishes himself from some of his colleagues in another place who have been a little less than welcoming of the initiative. It is important to remember that the young people concerned will be those who have received short sentences and have not been found guilty of racial crimes, crimes of sexual abuse or child abuse. It is right and appropriate that those young people are offered a second chance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Lockwood: </B>   My Lords, I accept the comments of my noble friend. There is a real difference between deploying child labour in the Armed Forces in some countries of the world and our use of 17 year-olds. Nevertheless, is she not aware and has the Question not demonstrated that our deploying 17 year-olds in armed conflict is a controversial subject? When the United Nations protocols are reviewed in January, will she bear in mind the very real concern about the use of 17 year-olds in this situation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I am well aware of the controversial nature of these points. Perhaps I should say to my noble friend that we have canvassed the views of the senior officers in the Armed Forces. It is their view that not to deploy trained 17 year-olds might well cause difficulties for deployment of the Armed Forces in certain circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-02_para0"></a>In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, I made clear that this issue will be discussed again. A working party in the Ministry of Defence is discussing recruitment and employment of under 18 year-olds. The MoD is, therefore, already considering the issue. In January, discussions will be re-opened on the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I undertake to bear in mind not only the points raised by the noble Baroness but those made by a number of other organisations to the MoD on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I refer to the announcement concerning recruitment in prisons. Presumably only those who have committed minor crimes would be approached. Is not service in a cadet force before someone reaches mid-teenage most likely to reduce later lapses into crime?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord makes a valid point. It is also worth noting that at present a little over 40 per cent of all Army recruits are aged under 18 years. The statistic <P>


<a name="column_1252"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1252</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>for the naval service is 32 per cent and for the RAF, 20 per cent. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, is correct. The training they receive in the cadet forces is, indeed, a good training for future life. It is also worth noting that those aged under 18 years of age generally stay in the services longer and are more successful than their older peers.

<P>
<UL>Whether the Treasury's decision to bill the Ministry of Defence for the cost of operations in Kosovo and East Timor has affected the training, equipment programmes and morale of the Armed Forces.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the financial arrangements for ongoing operations in Kosovo and East Timor are not expected to affect the training, equipment programmes or morale of the Armed Forces. It has been agreed with Treasury colleagues that the reserve will cover the net additional costs of operations in Kosovo where the MoD cannot accommodate them without detriment to other commitments. Final decisions on the handling of the costs of East Timor operations have not yet been taken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew9"></A><B> The Earl of Carlisle: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. Was it not the case that the costs of the Gulf War and, indeed, the South Atlantic campaign were met in full from the Consolidated Fund? Will she make urgent representations to the Treasury that all the costs of the East Timor and the Kosovo campaigns are met out of that fund rather than from the grossly overstretched defence budget?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I have given the noble Earl the reassurances he sought. The reserve will cover the costs of the operations in Kosovo where the MoD cannot accommodate them without detriment to the important points raised by the noble Earl; that is, recruitment, training, equipment programmes or morale in the Armed Forces. The question of East Timor, where costs are very much lower and the action is of recent history, is still under discussion with the Treasury. On the one hand we are talking about costs of some &#163;100 million in relation to Kosovo; on the other, as far as concerns East Timor, we are talking about &#163;7.5 million. However, I hope that the noble Lord is reassured by my comments on the Treasury reserve fund.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, there are continuing problems facing refugees returning from West Timor to East Timor. I understand that probably <P>


<a name="column_1253"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1253</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>another 200,000 are due to return to East Timor. Can the Minister give any idea of how long British forces are likely to be involved there in the near future?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, we have said that the British forces were going in for a limited period. As far as I am aware, there has been no review of such a period. If the position changes, I am sure that my right honourable friend Mr Hoon will make an announcement accordingly. However, until he does so, I believe we can rest on the position which was announced at the time that the Gurkhas went into East Timor. There has been no change as yet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Bramall: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may crave the indulgence of the House for a moment in order to say how sad I am that this is the noble Earl's last Question in your Lordships' House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew14"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Bramall: </B>   The noble Earl speaks with passion, from the heart and without notes; all attributes that this House can ill afford to lose. I wish I could share the Minister's complacency about the defence vote when her Ministry is struggling desperately to correct manifest ills of undermanning and overstretch, and to enhance the confidence and commitment of those who serve. Does the Minister not accept that any additional burden such as this, accentuated ceaselessly by the arbitrary Treasury cuts of 3 per cent compound interest per annum presented on the palpably spurious grounds of efficiency savings, means in practice that all major votes on equipment, accommodation and training are now being seriously cut back and eroded?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I agree warmly with the comments of the noble and gallant Lord in respect of the noble Earl, Lord Carlisle. We shall all miss his contributions, not only on defence matters. I think I can safely say that no one in your Lordships' House can rival the noble Earl's expertise on the Baltic states. That will be sorely missed by all of us, especially those who have answered his Questions on the subject.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-02_para1"></a>Having said that, I disagree profoundly with the comments of the noble and gallant Lord regarding the MoD. There is absolutely no complacency in the MoD about our running costs. Perhaps I may remind him that we have attempted to deal with the question of overstretch, for example, by the withdrawal of troops at the height of our operations in Kosovo this year. We contributed 37.4 per cent of NATO's troops. We are now down to a contribution of 10.1 per cent. Far from retrenching on questions of training and morale, the MoD is investing more in such aspects, particularly on service morale. I refer, for instance, to more telephone calls for the families, introducing guaranteed periods of post-operational tour leave and a whole range of issues. The MoD is not retrenching but meeting these issues with considerable confidence.

<A NAME="91109-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, is not the real point underlying the noble Earl's Question that we should <P>


<a name="column_1254"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1254</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>seek to move to a system whereby any country providing armed forces under the authority of United Nations receives 100 per cent reimbursement of the cost from a fund to which all members of the United Nations contribute pro rata to their GDP?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, that is an interesting question. The noble Lord may be interested to know that it is exactly the one I asked officials when being briefed to answer this Question. Whether costs are repayable or eligible for sharing will always depend on the operation in question. We aim to use the appropriate arrangements for each of the operations in which we engage. NATO, for example, has an agreed set of funding principles for the peace support operations undertaken since the IFOR deployment in 1995. The noble Lord raises an important point, not only so far as concerns NATO, but so far as concerns the UN; it is one on which we should reflect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Burnham: </B>   My Lords, I seem to have been asking this question or questions like it with regard to operations in different countries ever since this Government came to power. Is it possible for Her Majesty's Government to develop a consistent policy whereby the costs of any foreign operations undertaken as a result of that policy are automatically covered by the Consolidated Fund and not out of the defence budget?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, my colleagues in the MoD would be delighted were that to be the case. However, as the noble Lord knows, after 18 years of his party being in office these matters must be agreed throughout Whitehall. The scale and cost of different operations are enormously different. For example, Kosovo and Bosnia involved the deployment of thousands of troops at great cost to the defence budget. Access to the reserve was therefore essential if the government commitments under the SDR were not to be gravely damaged. That was the assurance I gave earlier to the noble Earl. But that is different from the scale of costs involved in other operations such as the ongoing operation in the Gulf and that in East Timor. The costs there are much lower. As the noble Lord is aware, it is normal for these matters to be discussed between the MoD and the Treasury with the Foreign Office also playing a role in the discussions.

<A NAME="91109-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Bassam of Brighton): </B>  My Lords, the Government believe that police powers contained in the Public Order Act 1986 and other legislation are sufficiently robust to meet the demands of situations of public disorder. Enforcement of legislation is an operational matter for chief officers of police. There are no plans to undertake a specific review at present, but we shall of course take account of any lessons to be learnt from the planned police review of the policing arrangements for the state visit.

<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Phillips of Sudbury: </B>   My Lords, if one is to have an ethical foreign policy, one should practise what one preaches. Is the Minister sensitive to the fact that many in this House and beyond are extremely disturbed at the way in which the Public Order Act was enforced during the recent visit of the President of China? We all understand the difficulties the police face in enforcing this legislation. Can the Minister arrange that the results of the inquiry set in motion by Sir Paul Condon--I commend him for so doing--be made available to the House?

<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, I remind the House that the policing of demonstrations and protests is an operational matter for chief officers of police, and that must be right. The noble Lord asks a reasoned and reasonable question. Clearly I cannot speak for the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, but I shall endeavour to pass on to him the views and questions of the noble Lord. My understanding is that the commissioner intends to make public his thoughtful conclusions as a result of the review he is undertaking of the operation during the recent state visit of the President of China.

That is a long-cherished tradition in this country and one in which our Government believe fundamentally. We shall therefore do everything we can to uphold that. I am sure that all Members of your Lordships House will seek to protect that basic right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Mackenzie of Framwellgate: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree with me that in policing public order incidents there has always been a distinction between political protest and ceremonial events?

<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew10"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, is it not the case that during the recent visit there was a restriction of peaceful, public protest? Is it not also the case that the Government interfered and encouraged the police to take decisions which caused that restriction of peaceful, public protest? Is the Minister aware of the dismay with which that was received by politicians and democrats on all sides in Hong Kong?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, as I have explained two or three times already to the House, the policing of such events is an operational matter for the police. I am sure that the noble Viscount agrees with that. I am delighted that the noble Viscount agrees that there should be no interference in that process. We in this House are delighted also at his concern to protect the rights of protesters and demonstrators. I am sure that that is a view he has held for many years, perhaps going back over the lifetime of the previous government. We clearly need to reflect carefully on the commissioner's findings following his review of the way in which the operations were conducted during the recent state visit of the President of China.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend agree that we should pay tribute to the performance of the police forces in this country in policing public order and ceremonial events? Bearing in mind the enormous difficulties the Chinese people faced in the first half of this century through civil war, invasion and natural disasters, the progress they have made in the past 50 years is a tribute to them. Will my noble friend therefore join me in paying tribute to the contribution that the Chinese community makes to the diversity and cultural experience of this country?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Bassam of Brighton: </B>   My Lords, the answer to two of those questions is yes. I am not a Chinese historian, but I can agree that the Chinese have made great progress and are taking great strides. However, I am sure that they have much to learn from us, as we have much to learn from them.

<BR>
The Commons disagreed to this amendment for the following reason--
<BR>
1A
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "91109-03_para2"></a>Because Clause 2(6)(b) of the Bill makes provision for the filling of vacancies in the office of Mayor of London and it is unnecessary to make special provision for particular cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on their Amendment No. 1 to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason numbered 1A. I shall make the same point in relation to Amendment No. 6 and shall speak to that now.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-03_para3"></a>These amendments relate to the issue of impeachment. When the amendments were moved in this House I argued strongly against them and am gratified that the Commons comprehensively endorsed the Government's view by a majority of 155 votes that the assembly should not be able to remove the mayor from office.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-03_para4"></a>The effect of your Lordships' amendment would have been to allow the assembly to sack the mayor if 19 of its 25 members voted to impeach him or her. It is the Government's view, supported, I believe, by sound constitutional principles, that that would be wrong. We have the recent experience in the United States where one group of directly-elected politicians tried to remove another group.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-03_para5"></a>Under this Bill, the mayor and assembly members will have different mandates and different roles. They will have a directly-elected executive, and the assembly will be there to scrutinise the exercise of his or her executive powers. Over 5 million Londoners will be entitled to vote for the mayor and they will do so directly. It is not right that 19 assembly members, elected under a different process, should be able to overturn that decision. That should be a matter for the people of London, not for a separate set of politicians.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-03_para6"></a>As my honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning explained in another place, if these amendments were to be accepted it is not fantastical to admit to circumstances where a vote to impeach the mayor would take place and do so on pure political grounds. A popular candidate for mayor may well be elected who represents one political party but that party might be unpopular with the electorate and, therefore, the majority of seats in the assembly might be won by other parties. In a three-party system, it is entirely possible that the assembly could put together a 75 per cent majority to sack the mayor: not because <P>


<a name="column_1258"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1258</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>he or she was doing a bad job, not because he or she had acted illegally or because he or she was corrupt, but simply because 19 assembly members disagreed with the policies being pursued. I hope that noble Lords will accept that that cannot be right. In such circumstances, each successive mayor would be subject to the whim of the assembly and short-term political gains.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-03_para7"></a>As has been explained, there are ways of removing the mayor. In legitimate circumstances, the mayor can be disqualified from office. The normal rules governing the conduct of local authority members will apply to the mayor. I believe I recall the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, pointing out on Third Reading that, if you are going to remove a politician, it is better to have a judicial rather than a political process for so doing. That is what we have here. Under the provision the mayor must stand down if he or she is convicted of an offence which carries a sentence of more than three months' imprisonment, is adjudged bankrupt, is disqualified under Part II of the Representation of the People Act or is disqualified under Section 17 or 18 of the Audit Commission Act. That is judicial process. In addition, the Bill contains a number of "automatic procedure" situations where the mayor would be disqualified from office; for example, failure to declare election expenses and failure to attend six consecutive statutory meetings of the assembly, as prescribed in the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-03_para8"></a>Therefore, we have provided for "high crimes" through the judicial process. We have also provided for electoral mismanagement or failure to observe the basic duty of the mayor through the procedure set out in the Bill. I do not believe that we should provide for a situation where the mayor could be removed by a political cabal within the assembly. That is a matter for the people of London; it is not a matter for members of the assembly who will have their own duties and responsibilities to pursue. Indeed, it could lead to incredible deadlock and considerable distraction from the objective of giving good governance to London. In moving this Motion, I should point out to the House that I shall move the same in relation to Amendment No. 6, which is the substantive amendment in this group.

<P>
<A NAME="91109-04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I must say a few words on this amendment, and I suppose those words should really be: "On the Government's head be it". We have never pretended from these Benches that our solution was the only one to deal with a mayor who may go off the rails or, at any rate, lose in a very important and fundamental way the confidence of both the assembly and the people of London; nor have we pretended that this is the best solution. But it is the only one on offer.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-04_para0"></a>The Government have not come forward with any different solution. They have not proposed a different number of assembly members who would be able to <P>


<a name="column_1259"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1259</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>take this important step; they have given the electors of London no opportunity to unseat a mayor until the next election--and that might be three or three-and-a-half years away from when the issues arise; and they have made no proposal for a judicial or quasi-judicial process.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-04_para1"></a>The Government have been very creative about the possible scenarios as to how such a procedure might be misused. But it is a matter for the Government to deal with the "what ifs"; for example, what if the mayor goes off the rails? What if the mayor acts in such a way as to bring the whole of London's government into disrepute through allegations about links with particular contractors dealing with major capital projects, or about private financial activities?
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-04_para2"></a>I have pointed out before to your Lordships that this party does not believe that the private life of a politician should be a matter for the public and the press to crawl all over. However, there are certain situations where it is legitimate for private activities to become a matter of public consideration because they affect the public's confidence in the office holder. There is also the situation where the mayor may bring the authority into disrepute because of investigations into activities which may lead to two months' imprisonment. Indeed, the list could go on still further.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-04_para3"></a>I believe that the solution we propose is the logical conclusion; namely, that the members of the assembly should be given the statutory responsibility to hold the mayor to account. Sadly, what is now going on as regards the selection of the Labour Party's candidate for mayor is threatening to bring the whole project into disrepute. I hope that that can be turned around and that public confidence in London having its own government will grow between now and 4th May. At present, the public feeling is that this will turn out to be something of a farce. That would be the most enormous tragedy. Indeed, having got through the whole process, it would be very sad if we were to find that the structure allowed the mayor to bring London's new government into disrepute, without there being any mechanism available to deal with such a situation. That would not be good for London and, above all, it would not be good for the political process.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-04_para4"></a>We on these Benches do not propose to disagree with the Commons--although I wholeheartedly disagree with their reason--and we will not seek to send our amendment back to them today. However, I felt that the points that I have made were important enough for me to detain your Lordships for a few minutes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the Government have got this right. For the many reasons outlined by the Minister, the assembly members should not be able to get rid of the mayor. However, if the people of London make a mistake and appoint the wrong person--for example, someone who, within six months, turns out to be a really bad mayor doing a thoroughly bad job, but does not invoke disqualification because the technical requirements are not available--is the noble Lord <P>


<a name="column_1260"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1260</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>really saying to Londoners that there is nothing they can do for three-and-a-half years until the next election? I would be grateful if the noble Lord could make the position clear to the House, and to the people of London, when he replies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-04_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister knows, we agreed with this amendment when it was so ably presented by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. Indeed, we agree with the arguments that she has put forward today for thinking that the House of Commons is wrong. We also agree with her in that we certainly would not dream of sending it back to the other place. In the end, if something goes unfortunately wrong, the responsibility will rest with the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-04_para5"></a>While I am on my feet, I should like to make a statement which is quite important as far as concerns Hansard. I should like the following to be on the record. During the course of the debate on the Question "That this Bill do now pass", on 1st November. I believe it was quite obvious that I was very angry. As I look at all the amendments which are before us today, I must say in sorrow that it seems to me that the Government are legislating on the hoof in sending the Bill backwards and forwards between both Houses. It is a contempt of Parliament itself that the amendments came to us so extraordinarily late and then went to the other place. They were the Government's own amendments; but, somehow, they are now being altered by the Government again. This is not the way to legislate. I very much hope that it will not happen with any other Bill that ever comes before this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-04_para6"></a>This has been an extraordinarily bad Bill. I believe that the Secretary of State at the department and the Permanent Secretary should be asked to look at the way it has been handled, not, as I said, by Ministers in this House, but overall. As I said on the Bill do now pass debate, we have run a sweepstake on when the Government will have to come back to Parliament with an amending Bill. I shall not speak again on this Bill. Frankly I believe that the Government have treated the people of London with contempt in the way they have produced this Bill. It does not bear speaking about further.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-04_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dixon-Smith: </B>   My Lords, one thing needs to be said. The Minister has called in aid the fact that the mayor will be elected by some five and a quarter million Londoners. We need to remind ourselves that those same Londoners will also vote for and back the assembly. It is not a case of one group of politicians being against another; it is much more serious than that. We have to accept the Government's position, but I do not think that we should use false arguments in order to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I note the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. We all accept that there have been problems with the passage of this Bill. As the noble Baroness has said that she will not speak on the more detailed amendments later, I point out that these amendments were for the most part indicated earlier to <P>


<a name="column_1261"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1261</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>avoid the possibility--that the noble Baroness suggests--that some of our amendments may be slightly defective, as was the case in relation to measures on transfers and pensions. I shall explain that later.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-04_para7"></a>I point out to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that we have a procedure for removing the mayor for high crimes; namely, we have a judicial process. The judicial process is the most appropriate in these circumstances. It is a fundamental principle that as regards their mandate--I must disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, on this point--and responsibilities, politicians are accountable to the people and not to another set of politicians unless those politicians elect the politician in question, as is the case with the Prime Minister or the leader of a party. The matter we are discussing constitutes an entirely new situation in Britain but the circumstances of political office in general do not. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, that the people of London will elect a mayor for four years, as they elect a government for that same period. There are those who felt it was fairly evident that certain governments in the recent past were making a thoroughly bad job of things after six months and that people had no redress. However, people can seek redress after five years. That applies also to the matter we are discussing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, people can get rid of the Government; they can fall.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the people cannot get rid of the Government in that sense. They cannot directly get rid of politicians. The politicians themselves are directly elected and cannot get rid of one another. The same principle applies to the matter we are discussing. The same principle should apply to all elective office.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-04_para8"></a>I refer to the analogy with the United States, where the system which the noble Baroness proposes has almost brought the whole American constitution into disrepute. But at least the founding fathers had the wisdom to include some qualification, with regard to high crimes and misdemeanours, of the circumstances in which the system could operate. Admittedly that has been stretched a little in recent years. However, this amendment--as was agreed by this House--would have no such limitation save one; namely, the ability to cobble together 19 members of the assembly to vote against the mayor. That is not a sensible way to proceed. Despite what the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, has said, it is a situation where one set of politicians is effectively cancelling the mandate of another. That is purely a matter for the people to decide.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-04_para9"></a>In my view this amendment is seriously constitutionally flawed. It is also politically unwise, legally doubtful and probably operationally pretty impractical. It adds nothing to the Bill but it provides an opportunity for serious political mischief in certain political circumstances, distracting both the mayor and the assembly from their central job of providing better governance for London.

<P>

<A NAME = "91109-05_para8"></a>The government amendment agreed in the Commons amends only in minor ways the amendment carried in this House.

<FONT SIZE=3>unlawful discrimination and to promote good relations between persons of different racial groups.

<P>

<A NAME = "91109-05_para10"></a>The Government's amendment restores the provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976, which we believe should remain on the face of the Bill, and also removes the word "secure" from subsection (1) of the amendment passed in this House. That is because we do not believe that in all circumstances it will be possible for those authorities to secure equality of opportunity for all in the strict sense of the word. If this remains on the face of the Bill they would be vulnerable to subsequent legal challenge. We do not think that would be sensible.

<A NAME = "91109-05_para15"></a>The Government's own amendment introduced at Report stage used that kind of terminology. There is due regard to the principle that there should be equality of opportunity for all people. Section 120 of the Government of Wales Act, Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act and Section 17 of the Crime and Disorder Act and all statutes of 1998 use that terminology.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-05_para16"></a>When the Minister responsible for conducting the Bill through the House introduced this amendment in another place, he said that it would make it a duty of <P>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1265</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the GLA, the Metropolitan Police Authority and the fire authority to exercise their functions with due regard to these needs. When questioned on the matter he said that leaving out the word "due" would not change the impact of the legislation, but would simply reduce the number of words in the Bill by one, which must a good thing. Of all the explanations that have come from another place as regards this Bill, that must be the weakest.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-05_para17"></a>I hope that I am not seeing a problem where there is not one. I hope that the Minister can give us an assurance that leaving out the word "due" will make no difference at all to what the provision means. I would far rather see it in the Bill, but I understand that there are problems of timetabling. We do not want to threaten the Bill as a whole. It is important that those who interpret the Bill have the toughest assurances to which they can refer in Hansard that "having regard" means the same as having "due regard" in the legislation to which I have referred. I beg to move.

<A NAME="91109-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the replacement amendment. The previous amendment said that "due regard" had to be taken to the need to promote and secure equality of opportunity. I have made the point more than once that one cannot secure equality of opportunity. Now the requirement is to have regard to the need to promote equality of opportunity. That is a correct statement of that which is possible. It is an improvement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-06_para0"></a>As regards the noble Baroness's amendment, I do not agree that two words are necessarily as good as one. If "due regard" and "regard" mean the same thing, then "regard" is correct. It will be interesting to hear whether the Minister considers that "due regard" is exactly the same thing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare: </B>   My Lords, I also welcome the new clause. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, has entered the Chamber and that the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, is also present. I thank the Minister. We began this battle some months ago. I thank him at this late stage for the fact that the matter has returned to this House in this form. On behalf of the noble Lords, Lord Dholakia and Lord Harris, I thank the Minister for the clause being inserted into the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Thomas of Walliswood: </B>   My Lords, I wish to make a very simple point. In our eyes there is a difference between "regard" and "due regard". The latter means the right weight of attention when balanced against the other points to which one has to give attention when taking a decision. That is what "due regard" means. One can consider a point and dismiss it, but if one is giving it "due regard" and the weight it really needs, it has to be kept in mind all the time. That is the difference.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Harris of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, this appears to be the opportunity to welcome the fact that this matter has returned to us in an improved form. I am deeply <P>


<a name="column_1266"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1266</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Archer, for saying that on my behalf. What has taken place is extremely important. There is agreement on all sides of the House and from the Commons that there should be written on the face of the Bill some extremely important requirements as regards the new authority. That is valuable and will be important, given the nature of London and its communities.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-06_para1"></a>I am a little worried that in this debate the Liberal Democrats are demonstrating their kinship to the medieval philosophers about how many angels can dance on the point of a pin. I hope that in his reply the Minister will make it quite clear that "having regard" has exactly the same force as "having due regard". We do not need undue prolixity. The important point is that written on to the face of the Bill are now clear expectations as regards equality of opportunity, combating discrimination and promoting harmonious race relations. That is a bonus and it is also extremely important for the people of London.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, surely the word "due" is otiose in this connection. Perhaps an opinion from the noble Lord behind me will be of value.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I hesitate to request detailed legal opinion. However, I can assure the noble Baroness that my legal advice is to the effect that it is not necessary to use the word "due" in the clause. The authorities must have regard to the needs to provide equality of opportunity and therefore they must have regard to that need in the provisions of the Bill. Although at first sight I can understand the noble Baroness pursuing the matter, my legal advice is absolutely clear that it is unnecessary. That was reflected in the attitude taken in another place by my honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning who is the same gentleman to whom the noble Baroness referred.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-06_para2"></a>I am grateful for the expressions of support from the noble Lord, Lord Archer, my noble friend Lord Harris and other noble Lords. The new clause is an improvement to the Bill. It has attracted cross-party support in this House and in another place. We do not need the additional wording. I believe that all our objectives are the same. Therefore, I ask the noble Baroness not to pursue her amendment, but to adopt the Commons amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I hope that I made it clear that we very much welcome the inclusion of these provisions. We do not want to deal with the number of angels on the head of a pin, but we want to make sure that the consensus developed across the House sticks in the form of a clause which has as much weight as all your Lordships expected it to have when the matter was discussed at various stages during the course of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-06_para3"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, said that it is a self-evidently otiose term. If that is so, then it is self-evidently otiose, no doubt, in the three statutes to which I have referred which were produced under the aegis of the same Government.

<P>

<A NAME = "91109-06_para7"></a>One of the key principles of transfer is that the transferor and the transferee should generally be considered as the same person in law. This principle applies in various places in the Bill. The amendment corrects a slight inconsistency in that application. In all other cases the same person in law may be disapplied if this is specified in the relevant transfer or pension instrument. This discretion is vital to allow the functions to proceed smoothly--for example, by not transferring to successor bodies any criminal liability incurred by their predecessors.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-06_para8"></a>Amendment No. 541A introduces this discretion to the continuity provisions in the Bill. It will ensure that the same person in law provision is properly applied and that it will be clearly so interpreted by the courts. I commend the amendments to the House.

<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para0"></a>These are technical and consequential changes to the detail of new Schedule 12 to the Bill as it was introduced into the Bill through Amendment No. 703. <P>


<a name="column_1273"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1273</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The amendments are needed to clarify some minor points within the schedule and to make one necessary consequential amendment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para1"></a>It may be helpful if I were to clarify the effect of these five amendments. Amendment No. 703A extends the scope of the TfL transfer schemes and provides that rights and liabilities under enactments may be included in them. For example, this provision might be needed to allow rights or liabilities held by TfL--such as a right under a local Act--to be transferred over to a PPP company.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para2"></a>Amendments Nos. 703B and 703C are needed to bring in a provision on TfL transfers in line with the provisions in the Bill on the transfer of assets to the new authority when it is established. The amendments should remove from the new schedule a reference to instruments or agreements in connection with a transfer scheme. These amendments are vital to ensure consistency of interpretation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para3"></a>Amendment No. 703D relates to the operation of the TfL transfer schemes to provide that different transfers under a particular scheme may have effect at different times on the same day. This flexibility may be needed to allow tax neutrality in these transfers where it is appropriate.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para4"></a>Amendment No. 703E is consequential to Amendment No. 703. It relates to provisions in the Bill which deal with the continuity of repeal or revoked functions. The amendment is required to bring this provision into line with changes which have been made in the new Schedule 12 and elsewhere in the Bill. It provides a mechanism for disapplying the continuity provisions if specified in the statute or in statutory instrument which brings the revocation into force. This amendment will ensure consistent interpretation of transfer provisions across the Bill.
<P>

As it stands, Amendment No. 703 abolishes a number of functions of London Transport, which will either be transferred or suspended in relation to the transfer to TfL. Amendment No. 703E simply reflects those functions in the other part of the clause; in other words, it is not a new provision. The other four amendments are minor <P>

<A NAME="91109-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may draw attention to Amendment No. 703 as it stands--which is not the easiest thing in the world. In regard to that issue, Amendment No. 703 means that all functions of London Regional Transport will be wound up as a consequence of the Bill--they will, in a certain sense, be transferred to other authorities. For example, the biggest function of London Regional Transport is to provide public transport. That function will be wound up because London Regional Transport will be wound up. This amendment is consequential upon that.

<A NAME="91109-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree en bloc with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 793A to 793F to Lords Amendment No. 793.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para7"></a>These amendments relate to pensions. The schedule to which these amendments refer relates to the framework within which the implementation of assurances which were given by the Deputy Prime Minister in another place will take effect. Those assurances related to the right of London Underground staff who would transfer as a result of the public private partnership to retain their membership of the London Regional Transport pension fund and the benefits which go with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para8"></a>Noble Lords will recall that I explained at Third Reading how the Government intended that this assurance would be implemented by secondary legislation. These amendments do not introduce a new policy but clarify and tidy up the existing provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para9"></a>Amendments Nos. 793A and 793B make clear that an LRT pension scheme may be amended for the purpose of protecting the pensions of those staff transferred to the private sector as a result of PFI deals since 20th March 1998, as well as of those staff who will transfer as a result of the London Underground PPP deal.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para10"></a>Amendments Nos. 793C, 793D and 793E extend the Secretary of State's power to require the trustees of the LRT pension fund to give consent to changes, including ensuring that employees of private sector companies are able to participate in the LRT funds, as well as employees of TfL.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para11"></a>Amendment No. 793F extends the Secretary of State's powers to make amendments to the LRTPF affecting people who were employees of any predecessor body of LRT, rather than simply of its immediate predecessor. This is intended to eliminate a possible anomaly where a member of the LRTPF scheme whose employment ceased before the establishment of the LRT's immediate predecessor would fall out of the meaning of the schedule as it currently stands. I commend the amendments to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-07_para12"></a>Moved, That this House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 793A to 793F as amendments to Lords Amendment No. 793.--(Lord Whitty.)

<A NAME="91109-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   My Lords, at the beginning of the proceedings this afternoon my noble friend Lady Miller said that she would impose on herself a regime of silence. She felt that she had made her complaints about the way the Bill has been dealt with. I believe that my noble friend has done that with passion and conviction. At that stage, it was not necessary to add to the points she made.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para0"></a>However, this is the last debate we shall have on the Bill. I should like to put on the record my view that if the Government produce a Bill of this size, of which <P>


<a name="column_1279"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1279</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pages and pages consist of government amendments introduced at Third Reading in the second House, and which even now still have to be amended--the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has shown us that that is the case--by yet further government amendments from another place, the chances of the Government having got the Bill right must be absolutely nil. It is not possible to legislate properly in such a hasty manner or to expect legal advisers, draftsmen and officials to have been able to think through all the consequences of the pages of new amendments that have only just been tabled.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para1"></a>I beg Her Majesty's Government to consider, when drawing up legislation for the next Session of Parliament, that never again are the two Houses of Parliament faced with a piece of legislation like the one before us. The Bill is being rushed through on to the statute book in the sense that it was obviously produced long before it was ready. Whole areas of the Bill have not been properly drafted and, in many cases, may not even have been properly thought through. Both Houses of Parliament have been expected to take on the Bill and deal with it, receiving amendments, further amendments and even amendments to amendments, all of them government amendments. That is not the way in which Her Majesty's government should be carried on. I hope that Ministers will take my words to heart and try to do better.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clinton-Davis: </B>   My Lords, it is a little rich for noble Lords from the party which, when in government, amended legislation at a very late stage in the process, to advance that kind of argument. I agree that we have too much legislation, but that affects both sides and is not a singular offence. The noble Lord ought to recognise that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-08_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, it is important to counter the view taken by the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. The Bill before us is unprecedented because the amendments, of which now there are almost 1,000, have come from the Government, and have arrived very late in the day. Even at Lords Consideration of Commons Amendments we are considering government amendments to amend government amendments which amend government amendments. During the eight or nine years that I served on the Government Benches, no measures as complex as the one before us were introduced at such a late stage and at such short notice.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para2"></a>Many of us have only today seen for the first time the amendments before us. Those of us who listened to the debate in another place yesterday evening had hoped for a little light to be shone on the complexity of the amendments that have come before us today. I agree wholeheartedly with my noble friend Lord Jenkin. Let us hope that this will never be repeated in this House again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I may have missed something, but I am not sure that any of the comments in our debate have addressed the amendments before <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>us, which have been tabled to safeguard the pension arrangements for London Underground staff. They will make their contributions under a new system of funding for London Transport to the future benefit of Londoners and their public transport system.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para3"></a>Having said that, I feel that I must respond to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch. Why are we here? We are not here because we want to produce a complex piece of legislation, but because we are constructively and creatively trying to re-establish a London-wide authority which has been missing for nearly 20 years as a result of wanton destruction by the last regime. Rather than seeking constructive reform of the old GLC, that administration chose instead to abolish it. A complex Bill was introduced to abolish the GLC, followed by a further complicated measure to abolish ILEA. But it is so much easier to destroy something than to create something.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para4"></a>The Bill before us will create a whole new authority to manage the strategic planning, the transport system, the police and the environment of Greater London. That is a difficult and complex job, but one that urgently needs to be done for Londoners. I cannot quite follow the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, when he used the word "rushed" to describe any of the proceedings that we have had in this House. Nevertheless, I understand that there have been difficulties in the House when dealing with the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para5"></a>However, the prize we have been seeking, and the outcome which I believe we now have, is to re-establish a strategic authority for Londoners so that they can democratically control their futures in a way that has been so seriously absent because of the destructive views of a previous regime nearly 20 years ago. In commending this Motion and group of amendments, I hope that noble Lords will feel that we have, despite everything, done a good job on the Bill and that it will stand Londoners in good stead.

<FONT SIZE=3>rear several hundred mallard, also for the purposes of shooting. A sizeable part of the holding is in a site of special scientific interest. I am also a member of the Country Landowners' Association, although I have tabled the Motion of my own volition, without prompting from any other person or body.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para9"></a>I have written to the Minister setting out my concerns. In doing so, I stated that I was not fundamentally against a general policy of reducing the amount of lead in the environment. That has of course been an objective of environmental policy across Europe for many years. However, I am bound to take note that a former government vet, Mr Bygrave, stated in a paper produced earlier this year that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no statistically significant accurate scientific evidence credible enough to warrant legal restrictions on the use of lead shot in the U.K. has ever been published".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-08_para10"></a>
None the less I take as read the desirability of reducing pollution in wetland areas although I would not go so far as to follow the Danish example with a total ban on the use of lead shot.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para11"></a>I have been informed that in the past the British Association for Shooting and Conservation--BASC--has discussed this measure with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Until the later stages, that body had been in some agreement with the Government's proposals, but later on there were differences of opinion, and at that point the DETR decided to go it alone. If that is correct, I should like to ask what consultations--if any--took place with conservation, wildlife and land management interests thereafter, particularly on the powers to be vested in the Secretary of State to authorise entry, search and seizure measures. I should also like to ask about the species criteria contained in the schedule to the regulations. In short, I should like to know who agreed to what on this issue, when, and what peer-reviewed domestic research leading up to the tabling of the regulations had in fact been carried out.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para12"></a>Curiously, the regulations apply to England but not to Wales and Scotland. Therefore my second question to the Minister is: why is that the case? It had long been understood that the intention was to phase out lead shot from wetland areas. I can certainly understand the translation of "wetland" as a term of art into a reference to a wetland site of special scientific interest. However, I have the impression that some of the listed sites are not wetland at all. I therefore ask why those areas are contained in the schedule to the regulations?
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para13"></a>Furthermore, the species limitation, particularly in relation to all species of duck, geese and swan, as stated in the regulations, might have been appropriate for a wetland only habitat, but I question whether it is appropriate when extended beyond that to other areas--in fact, all areas--by a species-based criterion. Why is that being done? Perhaps I may ask the Minister whether it is proposed in due course to apply it to all sites of special scientific interest.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para14"></a>I am not aware that shooting with lead shot a duck which I may have reared on my own estate and away from any wetlands constitutes a specific <P>


<a name="column_1282"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1282</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>environmental risk or reprehensible practice. I rear mallard--not a vast number but several hundred. It is one of the most common species and is often reared for sporting purposes. They are released onto small flighting ponds constructed for that purpose and they also attract other wildlife. The mallard is neither a Red Data Book protected species, nor is it listed in the schedules to the Wildlife and Countryside Act. In his paper, however, Mr Bygrave, to whom I referred earlier, revealed that the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust Wetland Advisory Service report, entitled Biological monitoring of lead shot replacement in the UK--final report--contract No. CRO 184--Report to the Department of the Environment, published in 1997, commented on the need then for reliable statistical data. I also understand that mallard were selected as the principal study species with tufted duck and pochard as the secondary study species. It occurs to me, therefore, that the inclusion in the regulations of all species of duck may have rather more to do with the choice by conservationists and researchers of species convenient to them for their purposes rather than any compelling case justifying a ban on the use of lead shot for shooting the same species.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para15"></a>Conservationists and others are quite good at taking up issues in this way. Given a fair wind and enough of them giving mutually complimentary lectures, papers and the like, some not very well substantiated assertions assume the veracity of Holy Writ. Governments should be wary of that type of potential disinformation and they should expect the evidence to be properly scientifically scrutinised and conclusive, unless of course the severity of the effects is such as to justify overriding current practice in the interests of the precautionary principle. Anything else simply devalues legitimate conservation and engenders distrust. That is not helpful. I look forward therefore to learning the justification in this instance because I feel that the notice to adjust given to sportsmen and land managers involved in areas outside wetlands, foreshores, estuaries and other such places has been unacceptably short in respect of the wider criteria now being applied. In other words, there is a right way of proceeding, enabling the Government's proposals to be phased in, and there is a wrong way. I think that the wrong way has been chosen and it gets to the point of patent unreasonableness.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para16"></a>I do not wish to become too much involved in alternatives to lead shot but, according to my understanding, Bismuth/tin, tungsten matrix and steel shot cartridges cost between two and four times that of the lead equivalent. That is because there is a shortage of supplies. The industry has not had time to adjust to the scale of the effect now facing it. The American experience with steel shot is certainly not accurate in this situation and not directly comparable to England where guns are often of lighter construction and different build. Therefore, there are significant risks in using some types of alternative ammunition in these guns.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para17"></a>That is not to say that a reasonable cost increase should outweigh demonstrable conservation concerns. I am simply saying that I do not think that those <P>


<a name="column_1283"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1283</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>overriding conservation concerns have been proven in this instance. There is no precautionary principle at stake with mallard, as they are reared and by and large very common, or for that matter with Canada geese, which fundamentally are grass eaters. As far as I am aware--I stand to be corrected by any noble Lord who knows better--neither species shows widespread morbidity through lead ingestion. A two to fourfold increase in ammunition costs is a severe impediment. So I ask the Minister to indicate what is the Government's justification for applying the restriction so widely as opposed to a more orderly phasing in if the evidence actually shows that that is necessary and desirable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para18"></a>The regulations insert provisions empowering the Secretary of State to authorise entry, search and seizure similar to those contained in Section 108 of the Environment Act 1995, a measure intended to provide for the effective intervention by the Environment Agency's staff in the event of serious pollution incident or risk, for the protection of human life and health and, specifically, for the execution of the agency's functions of investigation in that respect. Sadly, those relevant savings clauses in relation to the section's application to those functions of the Environment Agency have not been replicated in the regulations. Can the Minister say why similar savings are absent in this instance?
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para19"></a>So conveniently wide-ranging are some of these powers--particularly those of Section 108--that I have been informed privately by another noble Lord of instances where the police seek to involve the Environment Agency's personnel in order to gain them access to premises which under normal police powers they could not have achieved. Noble Lords may consider that far-fetched and I am bound to admit that I do not have any direct personal evidence. But I do have direct knowledge of an analogous situation from the time when I myself was a public servant so I can say that to my own certain knowledge that kind of thing does go on.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para20"></a>I have considered the precedents for Section 108, the powers of entry, search and seizure, which are almost unique on our statute book. They are there for the understandable purposes which I described earlier. Unfortunately, paragraph 4 of the regulations does not recite them. I am indebted to the Library of your Lordships' House for unearthing a paper on entry, search and seizure by Professor Richard Stone of Nottingham Trent University which sets out the powers available under various Acts of Parliament. I should like to hear from the Minister why such powers have been considered appropriate here and what environmental imperative justifies them. It is one thing for the Environment Agency to authorise trained personnel to investigate where necessary and to protect the general public from serious pollution and health and safety risks; it is quite another for the Secretary of State to be given powers to authorise any person at all to enter onto land to perhaps seize a dead duck to check whether it has lead shot in it. In short, the powers are wholly disproportionate.

<A NAME = "91109-08_para21"></a>Even in a case of dangerous dogs, an application for access has to be via a justice of the peace and the information justifying the order for access has to be given on oath and to the effect that there are reasonable grounds for believing that an offence is being committed. While under Section 108 of the Environment Act the powers are very wide, they do, as I said, relate to checking on compliance, carrying out the pollution control functions of the agency, determining whether such a function should be carried out, or carrying out an assessment and preparing a report required by the Minister. But even in the case of preparing a report, the power of entry relates only to incidents or potential incidents involving serious pollution to the environment, harm to human health, danger to life, and so on, while the seizure of property applies only where those items to be seized have caused, or are likely to cause, pollution to the environment or harm to human health. I agree with the views of the Country Landowners' Association that the Wildlife and Countryside Act powers are more appropriate here, not those of the Environment Act 1995.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para22"></a>What will be the outcome? If the House will excuse the pun, in the case of shot wildfowl, the sportsman and landowner are quite simply sitting ducks. The evidence is transient and highly portable. It could be introduced by a third party or even by the person purporting to carry out the investigation for which access is required. It seems to me that there is absolutely no defence, particularly if, as I suspect, we are dealing with environmental strict liability. Can the Minister say how the liability issue will be addressed? What standard of proof will apply and how will the innocent be protected?
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para23"></a>Noble Lords may think that no one would stoop so low as to concoct evidence. But I say this to the House: an official of English Nature once told me of his abiding suspicion that a particular species had been introduced to a site for the purposes of procuring for that site a protection that it did not otherwise merit. It was supposed to have been introduced by a third party, but he lacked absolute proof.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para24"></a>Environmental sharp practice is not new. It is a risk that most landowners accept in the greater interest of environmental protection. But to say that landowners and those using lead shot in shotguns for legitimate sporting purposes should be put at such risk, with non-recourse powers of entry, possibly by unqualified personnel--the regulations do not state whom the Secretary of State shall appoint--bereft of the caveats of the legislative parentage of Section 108 of the Environment Act is wrong. When it also involves a potentially criminal act of using a firearm, it is not surprising to hear, as I have, concerns being raised in some quarters as to whether this provision is more about firearm and shotgun control than the legitimate protection of bottom feeding species of wildfowl in important wetland habitats.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para25"></a>Therefore, will the Minister tell the House what the Government's intentions really are? The Prime Minister may state that there is no agenda to ban shooting after a hunting ban--and I am prepared to <P>


<a name="column_1285"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1285</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe that--but the body language of this new regulatory power appears to be saying something rather different. We should be told the reality.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para26"></a>The effects of the regulations would in some instances be patently absurd. Away from a site of special scientific interest scheduled in the regulations, a pheasant can be killed with lead shot with impunity, but not if it is pricked and wanders off or falls to earth to die within a scheduled SSSI. A mallard reared for the purposes of shooting on the same estate may not be shot with lead at all. A landowner may shoot with lead shot a mallard on the Welsh or Scottish side of his hill, but not on the English side. A farmer in a scheduled SSSI may not shoot anything with lead shot, whether it be crows, magpies or rabbits. Matters have moved away from what I understood was an agreed geographical approach based on wetlands and marshes to an SSSI base, which may include all kinds of different land forms, some of them not involving much, or anything, in the way of wetland at all. And, of course, a species criterion has been inserted on the way, which has the effect of far wider geographical application than was ever originally envisaged, and without good scientific grounds.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para27"></a>That causes confusion and consternation. It creates high risks with criminal sanction and potentially large gaps in the fabric of the necessary protection of the individual before the law. It bestows direct liability and penal costs on legitimate activities for no substantial reason; and it could seriously disadvantage the genuinely harmless pursuit of sports away from sensitive areas. It will certainly increase the costs of sport in terms of ammunition, ensuring compliance by shoot managers, landowners and those who are entrusted with enforcing the legislation. As I wrote to the Minister, it may be appropriate to criminalise culpable neglect, but not honest mistake or innocent acquiescence.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para28"></a>The department has indicated that, currently, only the police will be authorised to enter on to land. Will the Minister confirm that for the benefit of our discussion today? If so, the regulations should state as much. As framed, they are far too wide, having regard to the nature of the objectives, and could readily by changed at a moment's notice at the whim of Ministers. Please will the Minister give some reassurance on that point?
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para29"></a>I am bound to say that minor infringements relating to the ownership of shotguns have recently been interpreted by the police as prima facie grounds for the withdrawal of licences. If a licence holder can be taken to court by the police for telling his mother where he keeps the key to the gun cabinet, as was reported in the press recently--thankfully, the case was thrown out by the High Court--surely this statutory instrument will produce high risks related to the shooting of common species protected from certain types of shot solely by the regulations. Moreover, how enforceable will the legislation be? Or will the law be seen as an ass?
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para30"></a>This looks like bad law. It is unjustified in its extent; unreasonable in its effect; and inconsistent in its application. It uses the wrong legislative precedent. <P>

<A NAME="91109-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, first, I should declare an interest. I take part in shooting, although not commercially. We are all grateful to the noble Earl for providing the opportunity to debate the statutory instrument. I do not want to deal with the technical aspects of whether or not it is necessary to protect wildlife. The noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone, kindly supplied me with a great deal of information on that aspect. I read it carefully and did not find it immensely convincing. We shall no doubt hear from the noble Baroness later.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para32"></a>There is a suggestion that an international obligation is involved. I find it hard to think that we in Britain should have to do this kind of thing for international obligation at a time when in Europe the Spaniards are still allowed to torture bulls to death in public for amusement. Be that as it may.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para33"></a>I want to discuss the way in which the Government have set about this matter and in particular the use of the powers of entry into private property. Taking powers of entry is a very serious matter in this country. In a parliamentary Question on 28th October, I asked on how many occasions since May 1997 the Government had laid statutory instruments giving powers of entry to private property. The Government's Answer was that it would be a disproportionate effort to answer the Question. Surely that indicates their attitude. So I asked our most efficient House of Lords Library. Using the Lexis legal database, and by tapping in "powers of entry", some 15 statutory instruments were immediately found.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para34"></a>Yesterday, my noble friend Lady Blatch asked the same Question about powers of entry. She received a similar Answer from the Home Office Minister; namely, that it would be a disproportionate effort to investigate on how many occasions that had happened--although he went on to say:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-08_para36"></a>
I hope that the Government will reconsider their reply. I hope that they will accept that enough of us regard this as an important matter for them at least to satisfy us that they keep a careful record of the number of occasions on which they have allowed this kind of thing to happen.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para37"></a>The matter is important enough for any decision by the Government to introduce a statutory instrument allowing powers of entry to private property to be taken at the highest level. Ideally, one would like it to be taken by Mr Alastair Campbell, who has great <P>


<a name="column_1287"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1287</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>knowledge of the implications for public policy. But at the very least, surely the decision should be taken by the whole Cabinet.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para38"></a>Let us have a little more detail on exactly what is involved in this particular statutory instrument. It does not include premises used for residential purposes. But does it include all other premises? Land, vehicles and vessels are included, but are shops included? What about farm buildings? Legislation in such matters must be precise.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para39"></a>The noble Earl referred to the question of who has the power to enforce the legislation. In his parliamentary Answer, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, told me:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The decision on who will enforce the regulation lies entirely with the Secretary of State".--[Official Report, 28/10/99; col. WA 41.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-08_para40"></a>
That is delegated legislation within delegated legislation. Will the Government at least inform Parliament if they decide to give consent to anyone other than the police, who have been given the primary responsibility so far, to implement the powers of entry?
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para41"></a> I have consulted the police. They indicated that they would be very unhappy if anyone other than themselves had such powers of entry. Certainly, that view applies to local authorities. I understand that this regulation will not be top of police operational priorities and that essentially enforcement will be on the basis of complaints. Given the stretched resources of the police, particularly in rural areas, I suspect that in most cases enforcement will be minimal. The problem of trying to prove an offence, will, I believe, be that in a number of cases it will be difficult to establish who has fired any particular shot.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para42"></a>Aggressive enforcement runs the risk of damaging relations between country people and the police. That is most undesirable in rural areas where the police are particularly dependent on the eyes and ears of ordinary people including those who shoot, especially through neighbourhood watch schemes, to prevent and detect real crime. Unenforceable law is bad law. Because of the way that this instrument is drafted I believe a large part of it will be unenforceable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para43"></a>We should never forget that statutory instruments originated with Henry VIII's Statute of Proclamations of 1539. That was a tyrannical Act later repealed. The Act said that any royal proclamation should have the force of law. I believe that in accordance with today's standards of parliamentary scrutiny we should be able to ask the Government to think again. However, I am aware that in this House it is not the convention to follow a prayer against a statutory instrument with a vote that would require the Government to reconsider it. I hope that the interim House may have more confidence in these matters and consider changing that particular convention.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-08_para44"></a>I remind the Government who, from the tone of Answers to my earlier Questions appear to feel irritation that we question these matters, that from the days of Magna Carta the function of Parliament has never been to be a convenience to the executive. It is to <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, I am glad to support my noble friend's Motion. In doing so I declare a minor interest in that I shoot duck on about three half-days a year on average. My noble friend, with his usual thoroughness, has covered the ground so well that there is not a lot that can be added. However, I should like to put two or three questions to the noble Baroness. First, why are snipe included in the restrictions? If snipe are hit at all, even by a not very well aimed shot, they are almost certain to be killed outright. In this respect they are about as different from mallards as can be imagined. The latter can survive for a long time with a great deal of shot in them. Moreover, what about the availability of the newly-approved cartridges? Snipe are normally shot with size 7 shot or smaller, but very few non-lead shot cartridges containing such small size shot are made. The demand is so small that it is not economic to manufacture them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para0"></a>My second question is by no means flippant; it is entirely serious. Have the Government consulted the dental profession about this instrument? However meticulous one may be, it is impossible to guarantee that all shot is removed from a game bird before it is cooked. Even lead shot can do terrible things to a tooth, as I know to my cost. Will not steel or tungsten shot be even more dangerous? There are also forestry considerations. One hears that the Scandinavians, apart from the Danes, who have very few forests of any size, are extremely worried about the effects of steel shot on trees. Apart from other considerations, once steel shot is embedded in a tree it can cause great damage to saw blades when it is felled or trimmed. But the main objection to the regulations, among many others, must be the draconian and disproportionate entry, search and seizure measures allowed therein, as the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, stressed. My noble friend Lord Lytton pointed out that these measures are normally employed only when there is a risk of serious harm to human health.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para1"></a>I conclude on a slightly different note. My noble friend Lord Lytton, conscientious as always--I am aware that his business commitments have prevented him from attending as regularly as he would wish--decided not to stand for election, at the possible expense of less qualified but more regular attenders. The House will therefore be deprived of the benefit of his particular expertise which is not so easy to replace. The same can be said of 50 or 60 other noble Lords in various quarters of the House who did not stand for the same reason or, being over 70, believed that younger Peers should be given a chance, or stood for election but failed to be elected because their faces were not particularly well known. What a tragedy that an amendment along the lines of that tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Coleraine, which would have secured the retention of the services of a modest number of speaking but non-voting Peers, was rejected <P>

<P>
<A NAME="91109-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monro of Langholm: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Earl for giving the House the opportunity to question the Minister on why the decisions that the Government have taken are in this statutory instrument. I declare various interests, from involvement in Solway wildfowling to membership of the Nature Conservancy Council and as the Minister who took the Environment Act through another place in 1980. With that environmental background, it is perhaps all the more important that I demonstrate my concern at what has been done about the blanket inclusion of SSSIs in this statutory instrument. It shows that the heavy hand of what is now English Nature has the ear of the Minister and perhaps has overtaken what many of us believe to be common sense.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para2"></a>Noble Lords have covered much of the detail of the instrument. I indicated my interest in the Solway, having represented it in another place for over 30 years. This instrument applies only to England. Immediately, we run into a distinct conflict between Scotland and England as to precisely where in the Solway is the border and on which side we are permitted to use lead shot and on which side we cannot. We had this debate during the passage of the devolution Bill relative to the boundary between England and Scotland, which at the present time varies from the centre line of the River Eden, or River Esk, down the middle of the Solway to what was agreed in the Bill; namely, that there would be a specific indication by latitude and longitude of the precise boundary between England and Scotland. Has it been resolved? Do we know what is the exact boundary between England and Scotland, particularly in the upper Solway which is mentioned in the schedule to the regulations? If not, we have no right to place before Parliament an instrument with a vague idea of where the national boundary lies and what is legal and what is illegal. The Government should have resolved that and made it clear in the statutory instrument before they placed it before Parliament.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para3"></a>I share with other noble Lords grave concerns about the draconian powers given by this instrument. They go far beyond any possible damage that may be involved. The Government should look at this matter again, particularly in the context of a general discussion with the police in Scotland and England, and Wales for that matter, given the boundary between England and Wales, as to how they might interpret this draconian measure. It does no good to stir up unnecessary confrontation in the countryside where everyone works towards a common goal and understands the reasons for this statutory instrument, even if many believe that it is misguided and there has been insufficient consultation, particular on the availability of alternative types of shot, such as tungsten, tin and so on. One is aware that from the point of view of wounding birds it is far better to use <P>


<a name="column_1290"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1290</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>lead shot with a high kinetic energy than steel, tungsten or tin which is less effective, and, therefore, we are not assisting the birds. It is better to have a clean kill than a bird wounded by alternative shot.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para4"></a>The Government have to give many answers on the statutory instrument. Will the Minister indicate the position as regards a punt gun? The regulation indicates that a shotgun is a smooth bore weapon but it does not indicate whether a punt gun is legal, as it is at present. I appreciate that under the regulation the punt gun would have to be used with alternative shot. However, there should be a reference if the regulation covers it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para5"></a>I hope that the Minister will explain why we have included all SSSIs. Some are miles away from wetlands. An answer seems to have been accepted from English Nature without considering the original intention: to cover wetlands alone, and estuaries such as the Wash, the Solway and other parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para6"></a>I should like the Minister to respond to those questions and to think again before introducing a regulation which is so widely flawed.

<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para7"></a>As a landlord I have an SSSI within the land that I own. For the past five years I have leased out my shoot to a tenant. The lease makes it clear that he is not allowed to use lead shot over any of the waterways or lakes. To that extent he is meant to use bismuth cartridges. However, he seems inadvertently to use lead shots over those areas and recently we obtained an injunction to stop him doing so. My point is this. No matter how hard I try to regulate the lease, the tenant, his guests and other such people have inadvertently used lead shot over those waterways over which I have sought to ensure that it should not be used. Every time the tenant uses inadvertently such shot, I may be taken to court through his use of it. Surely the regulation is wrong. It should put the liability on the shooter and not the landlord. There is no incentive for the shooter to use non-lead shot. If the liability were on him, he would have an incentive to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para8"></a>One queries how many sensible landlords would want shooting to take place with these regulations in force. How do the Government intend to enforce this part of the regulations?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dunleath: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend Lord Lytton for raising this matter. I declare an interest. As the Minister will be aware, I live and shoot in Northern Ireland where, at present, like Scotland and Wales, we do not have restrictions on the use of lead shot. However, perhaps more unusually, I am fortunate (if that is word) to be invited each year to shoot in Holland where no lead shot in any form is allowed. When I go there, we are equipped with bismuth shot.
<P>


<a name="column_1291"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1291</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para9"></a>However, like my noble friend Lord Lytton, I, too, wonder whether these restrictions are the beginning of a more concerted campaign to do away with shooting of game and wildfowl in the United Kingdom. In the Netherlands the cessation of shooting has been a creeping process. For example, the raising of game for shooting is now wholly illegal. One cannot put down pheasants. In recent years, it has become illegal to shoot snipe and woodcock. Last year it became illegal to shoot partridges.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para10"></a>There are further restrictions. In Holland, one may shoot ducks but only more than a certain distance away from where they are fed. One is still allowed to shoot geese but only, for some reason I do not know, until 11 o'clock in the morning.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-09_para11"></a>Like my noble friend, while I have no particular argument against the controlled use of lead shot in specific instances, I am concerned that the regulations are the beginning of something more comprehensive and worrying for the many thousands of people in the United Kingdom who enjoy shooting and wildfowling.

<P>
<A NAME="91109-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Kimball: </B>   My Lords, the noble Earl has made it clear that there is grave concern on the subject of lead. It becomes an emotive issue. We have had to remove the lead pipes from our houses. People have had to give up their lead soldiers; or they cannot buy more of those lovely toys. Lead paint is no longer acceptable in one's house; and fishermen have long given up using lead weights. We have to recognise that there is genuine concern about lead.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para0"></a>I think that I am correct in saying that most members of the Countryside Alliance accept the removal of lead shot where it is a proven cause of poisoning through ingestion by water fowl. We have accepted a voluntary undertaking not to use lead shot over marshland habitats and areas below the high water mark.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para1"></a>As the noble Earl pointed out, one of the problems is that it adds to the schedule many areas which do not fall into the definition. The Stamford training area in Norfolk is hardly a wetland. The Cairngorms are in Scotland, so that issue does not arise yet, but they are hardly a wetland. Those inclusions bring the regulations into disrepute. There should be a formal method to challenge the inclusion of an SSSI within the schedule.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para2"></a>The distressing and alarming matter--as other noble Lords have pointed out--is that the schedule has moved from the scheduling of areas to the scheduling of extra species. In no way can a golden plover and a common snipe ingest lead shot by going along the water with their beaks. They drill through the ground. I used to have a snipe bog on an SSSI. We used to put out dried blood from the slaughterhouse on mown strips. The snipe stuck their beaks through and caught all the lovely bugs underneath. It was a certain way of collecting them. But in no way do those birds ingest the lead shot over the marsh. So there is no evidence of poisoning of golden plover and common snipe. The <P>


<a name="column_1292"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1292</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>effect of including those species in the regulations makes most sportsmen think that the regulations are not well founded.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para3"></a>In introducing the Motion, attention was drawn to the question of enforcement. I remind noble Lords that the premises of every game dealer are subject to inspection. If there has been a complaint about a shoot, it is perfectly in order for the police to inspect the game dealer's register, and the game on his premises.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para4"></a>I believe that the regulations are more enforceable than people realise. But I am equally confident that the shooting community will not break the regulations. If this is the law, it will be abided by even though it is bad law, will be a burden on people, and we should not have allowed it to go through. Perhaps in the revised House we shall get rid of the convention by which we do not throw out unsatisfactory regulations. Perhaps we may have a good hunt and kill a fox next time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Young of Old Scone: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as chairman of English Nature, which has been mentioned on several occasions during the debate. I want also to declare an interest in ducks and water birds and in shooting. The management of land and water for shooting is extremely good for conservation. It would be wrong to see the regulation as a polarisation between the shooting and conservation communities.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para5"></a>I should like to think that the Government have made a move on this issue, not hastily in an ill-thought-out way, but carefully and far too slowly. For more than 15 years, we at English Nature have had an interest in the issue, and discussions with the shooting interests have taken place for some time. I assure the House that in our discussions we have not sought surreptitious government control by the back door or a cessation of shooting. We have simply been looking for a way forward that would suit the shooting community and conservation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para6"></a>The toll on wildfowl due to ingesting lead shot is unacceptable in conservation terms. There is research evidence of that. Apart from the conservation impact, lead poisoning causes a nasty and lingering death. For that reason, the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement requires the British Government to produce regulations to enforce a ban by the end of next year, not just in England but in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para7"></a>We looked for a voluntary ban. I should have preferred this to have been resolved without regulation, but that did not work. There was insufficient interest in the voluntary ban to encourage the market to produce adequate supplies of cheap non-toxic shot to allow sporting shooting to continue using such shot. As a result, the regulation is not the draconian measure it may appear in cold print, but is a signal to the market and the shooting community to move into the next generation of water fowl shooting.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para8"></a>The United States banned lead shot in wetland areas two years ago, and I do not see that as a country where sportsmen are easily deprived of their sport or guns. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>The provisions for enforcement may look draconian, but they are less draconian than those in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 in that local authorities may be mandated to take action on behalf of the authorities. I envisage that they will be rarely, if ever, used. The whole purpose of the regulation is to send a signal that non-toxic shot needs to be used in these circumstances. The cost argument need not delay us too long, bearing in mind the cost of cartridges versus the total cost of a shooting day.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para9"></a>I hope that your Lordships will accept that this is a reasonable way forward for the shooting community and for conservation; that the responsible shooting community will rise to the signal that this gives; and that in two or three years we shall consider this to have been a bit of a storm in a teacup.

<P>
<A NAME="91109-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Burton: </B>   My Lords, I support the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, in his objection to the regulations. Despite being highly contentious, the regulations are a grave infringement of the rights of the individual. Until today, this matter has never before been debated in Parliament. It was sneaked in after Parliament rose for the Summer Recess.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para10"></a>There has been little scientific research into the issue in this country and certainly there have been no peer reviews of the little scientific work that has been done, and preferences within the regulations are largely American. The noble Baroness, Lady Young, mentioned America were some research has been carried out. The situation is different because a large amount of shot was found over a small area.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para11"></a>The result is that many inaccurate assumptions have been presumed. Probably the most extensive research in Britain was done by Dr G P Mudge in 1981. His report records very low or zero incidents in pink-footed, barnacle and white-fronted geese, wigeon, pintail, shoveler, scaup and moorhens. It seems that some of the lead pellets found in the very small number of other species affected may have been caused by wounding and not by the swallowing of lead pellets.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para12"></a>Yesterday, I spoke with one of Dr Mudge's researchers who monitored the Beauly Firth near Inverness; waters which were heavily populated with wildfowl at that time. The three most heavily shot-over areas were used for sampling. Twelve cores were taken out to a depth of three feet in each of the three places once a month for five months over an autumn and winter. Thus, 180 core samples were taken. These were carefully washed and strained. At the end of the experiment they found only three or four pellets. I hardly think that over such a heavily shot area the risk is serious.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para13"></a>Some of the best grouse moors are on hills which have been mined for lead; for instance, there are lead hills in south Scotland and in many areas of the Pennines. The regulations refer to the protection of "animals", but does that description mean birds, mammals or both? If it means mammals, what effect are the regulations intended to have on them? I thought that their intention was to protect birds.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para14"></a>If lead is banned, what are the alternatives? There is bismuth, a substance which is said to be highly toxic. Dr Bellamy seems to agree with the danger. Has research been carried out into the toxicity of bismuth? Bismuth, of course, is five or six times the price of lead, but that is another matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para15"></a>Then there is so called "steel". That is very dangerous. This shot is inclined to ball and can blow up gun barrels. It certainly severely damages the carcasses of any quarry shot at. We experienced that when Belgians came to shoot grouse. At lunchtime, the keeper said to the owner of the property, "I don't know what these people are firing at our birds, but they're not fit for the market any longer". For the rest of the day, he provided the Belgians with cartridges. However, the substance has already been banned in Sweden as it is so damaging to forestry. Any tree damaged by the shot will set the sawmill metal detectors bleeping in order to prevent damage to the saw and perhaps even to the saw-miller himself.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para16"></a>Another material is tungsten, but that is also a non-starter. There are various reasons why it cannot be used; it is just not suitable.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para17"></a>One wonders therefore whether there is any good alternative to lead. My noble friend said he was worried about wounding and I believe that most of the alternatives are likely to cause more wounding than is caused by lead.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para18"></a>I consider the draconian wording of Article 4(i) to be totally unnecessary. It empowers the Secretary of State to authorise any individual, not necessarily a police officer, to break into anyone's premises at what is termed "a reasonable time". It authorises such persons to remove private property and to have tested anything found thereon. There have already been many cases where environmental bodies have interfered with evidence. I know of three cases where certain bodies removed the evidence or clearly interfered with it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-10_para19"></a>I am not sure what will happen at the Country Landowners' Game Fair next year because I understand that that area is protected. I do not know whether the shooters will have to use bismuth, but what are they going to use to shoot the clay pigeons at the game fair? Apparently, one cannot use lead shot in that area. These regulations must be withdrawn, at least until proper research has been carried out, and I do hope that the Minister will understand the difficulties which have been talked about on all sides of the House this afternoon.

<A NAME="91109-11_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Selborne: </B>   My Lords, I wonder whether we are in danger of slightly over-stating the case. I find myself in slight disagreement with some of my noble friends on this side of the House. I should declare an interest, as chairman of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee from 1991 to, I believe, 1996. I have to report that during that time there was a lot of agreement from all sides of shooting and conservation interests as to what was required.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para0"></a>Some of the issues which have just been mentioned simply did not represent live debate any more. It was recognised that the ingestion of lead was undesirable. <P>


<a name="column_1295"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1295</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It was recognised that it had to be phased out, and at the meetings that I attended--and I attended quite a few--I found that people were very co-operative. Again, with due respect, much of science was simply not disputed. It was recognised that this was something that had to be addressed and it was hoped that it could be addressed by voluntary bans.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para1"></a>I do not want to go into the issues of whether or not these regulations contain draconian measures but I think that we need to put the record straight as to whether or not there is any serious dispute over whether lead is a desirable element to use in shot where there is a danger that wildfowl may ingest it. I do not think that is in dispute and I do not think that at this stage of the debate, which has been going on for many years, we need to put it in dispute.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para2"></a>I was interested to hear my noble friend say that he had sought to impose a ban by law and of course he has had to do this by means of an injunction. It is precisely the interests of, if I may say so, such far-sighted landlords of shoots which we are protecting in this measure. I do not think that many people would want to take a tenant to law in order to enforce such a covenant. It is very desirable that there are regulations of this kind, but I do not wish to discuss the minutiae because it is the principle with which we have to concern ourselves.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para3"></a>I find myself in agreement with the noble Baroness, Lady Young, that a voluntary measure would have been desirable but apparently it was difficult to achieve and therefore I think that we are now bound to follow this route.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Dormer: </B>   My Lords, we on these Benches certainly welcome these regulations and hope they will be the first step in moving towards greater protection for SSSIs and wildlife in general. After what we have heard this afternoon I think there is widespread agreement that lead is harmful, but I will not go further into that. The noble Lord who has just spoken has said that there had been a long process since 1991 and that there has been plenty of time to reach a voluntary solution.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para4"></a>It has been said that the landlord or the shooter should be the person accountable. However, it is plain that the landlord is the person who owns the land; he is there and he makes the rules for the people who shoot on the land. Therefore, the landlord is the person who is most easily held accountable. Most noble Lords who have spoken seem to be principally worried about the fact that the law enforcement is too draconian. I think that, given the state nationally of our SSSIs, and given the concerns that have been voiced about lead to the wildfowl listed in these regulations, their needs to be a sufficient power to say that this is a serious matter and one which will be taken seriously. Given the failure of voluntary agreement, I think a clear message needs to be sent out that these are wildlife and birds regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para5"></a>One speaker mentioned that it was strange that we should be living up to our international obligations. Surely in the case of wildfowl and in the case of <P>


<a name="column_1296"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1296</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>migrating birds in particular we must all live up to our international obligations. I do not want to detain the House for any length, given the time that we have spent on this debate, but I hope that these regulations will be kept in force and I am sorry that this will be the last occasion that the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, will be speaking to us. Certainly in my brief acquaintance with him I have enjoyed the extent of his knowledge, but I cannot agree with him today.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Glentoran: </B>   My Lords, before I start I must declare an interest in that I have been associated with the British Field Sports Society and the Countryside Alliance over a number of years.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para6"></a>In principle, I personally support the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, in this appeal. Perhaps, rather more importantly, this is yet another bad piece of legislation that has been poorly put together because at the heart of it there was really not much dispute, as we have already heard. There was a fair amount of agreement about the need for some kind of legislation if it was found that the voluntary agreement was not working. However, the whole business of lead shot--I will not spend much time on it--is still being debated. It is certainly not proven and Professor Bellamy himself says that "lead" is not the right word to use. He suggests that "toxic" is the word that ought to be used in this legislation, which puts the thing in a very different perspective from that angle.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para7"></a>Moving to what is prescribed in the first part, that any wild bird included in Schedule 2 to these regulations should not be shot anywhere, again, this is clearly poorly phrased. As we have heard from speakers around the House, the common snipe flies regularly over grouse drives and the mallard travels freely and regularly. The golden plover is also available a long way from wetlands where people may be shooting in semi-light and so on, and shooting with lead shot.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para8"></a>However, for the purposes of today's debate I think that we would accept the need for restriction over wetlands, even though I personally think that this is not yet proven scientifically. There are some percentages quoted in papers that I have read; one was 12 per cent of geese, and that actually refers to flying birds. Anyone who has seen geese in flight knows that they flight in thousands. Also, with due respect to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, I have seen a paper that I suspect she has also seen from English Nature. Clearly I did not draw the same conclusions from it as she did. I found it quite misleading.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para9"></a>I think there are a lot of things in the air that need further discussion before serious legislation is brought. I also think that to have legislation based on a species schedule was quite unnecessary--it really was--and it was unnecessarily restrictive. As has been stated by my noble friends, there is no disagreement. Those of us who shoot for sport clearly support protecting the wetlands from lead poisoning. In spite of that, I have to say that I live in a home where the water is kept in lead tanks and flows through lead pipes, and I have been drinking it for over 50 years. Your Lordships may regret it, but I am still standing here! Therefore <P>


<a name="column_1297"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1297</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>although lead poisoning may be very painful, the only painful lead poisoning that I know about is when you get shot.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para10"></a>As to the second stage, which is really much more serious, this is yet another example, as we heard earlier, of over-restrictive legislation. It is draconian against the individual. Why should regulations like these be worded so loosely? They could have referred to "a policeman" or something similar. Inevitably people like myself and others are going to be suspicious. If we happen--God forbid!--to have a Secretary of State responsible for these matters who is strongly affiliated to the ALF or something similar, we can expect the ALF to be authorised to come and stop a grouse shoot in the middle of a moor because it is thought that somebody shot a snipe that they happened to have seen see through binoculars. The whole thing becomes ridiculous.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para11"></a>Over-prescriptive legislation should never be at risk of being ridiculous. I beg to offer that comment, and I seriously think that to have a law which cannot be enforced geographically because the borders cannot be clearly defined, the reason for which is hard to prove because the scientists do not yet agree and there is insufficient proof and evidence, and which really goes overboard in regard to taking actions against a private person and private property, is bad legislation. Arguments have been put from all around the House, and those are mine. It is a convention of this House that the Opposition do not vote against negative instruments and I do not intend to do so.

<A NAME="91109-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, for initiating the debate, and I should like to join with other noble Lords in paying tribute to his work, knowledge and contribution to the work of this House. I know personally from the detailed work that he carried out on the Rating (Valuation) Bill that his professional knowledge in his own specialist field is second to none.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para12"></a>Noble Lords all around the House have put forward their arguments--with, I must say, varying degrees of personal conviction--ranging from the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, who did not totally convince me that he believed that there was a need for this issue to be tackled in a determined way.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para13"></a>There is no doubt that the toxic effects of lead in terms of the reproduction, development and survival of animals and wildlife are well known, and, as the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, the stricter controls have covered areas far beyond the issue of protecting wildlife. However, in wetlands where hunting takes place, there has been widespread lead poisoning among waterfowl. Such losses to the bird population are simply unnecessary. Waterfowl are particularly prone to eating lead as they take grit to help in digestion, and it is estimated that in the UK 2 to 3 per cent of mallards have been dying each year from lead poisoning. That figure may be as high as 5 per cent for other waterfowl species in some areas.
<P>


<a name="column_1298"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1298</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para14"></a>As long ago as 1983, the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution recommended that, as soon as alternatives were available, the Government should legislate to ban the use of lead shot and fishing weights in circumstances where they are irretrievably dispersed in the environment. Since 1987 the supply of lead fishing weights judged to be the most harmful to swans has been prohibited and the new swan population has risen by over 30 per cent since that date.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para15"></a>I am sure that all noble Lords would welcome the progress being made. Progress on restricting the use of lead in shotguns was slower because of the need to develop alternative shot types. Those shot types are now available and there is no reason why wildfowl should continue to be exposed to the risk associated with the deposition of lead shot.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-11_para16"></a>From 1993 to 1996 the Government, with the assistance of shooting and related organisations, funded a ballistic testing facility to aid manufacturers in the development of suitable alternatives to lead. That facility tested the many different types of shot available today. Apart from steel, which has been used in the United States for a number of years, bismuth, tungsten polymer and tin shot are now available to shooters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Burton: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that bismuth is not available in sizes seven and eight, which would normally be used on snipe?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I lack the noble Lord's detailed knowledge of the availability of specific shot for particular types of birds. I shall write to him with the answer that he seeks.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para0"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monson, raised the issue of the effect of steel shot in woodlands. The concerns he mentioned were raised during the consultation process, but they were not deemed significant enough to widen the total ban to woodlands. We have previously stated to the Forestry Commission that we do not intend to apply a complete ban in forested areas. However, we look forward to the consultation that will take place in the light of experience. If landowners are concerned about possible damage to their timber, they should, as stated in the response from the Forestry Commission, impose their own restrictions on the use of steel shot in that particular area.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monson, raised the issue of consultation with dentists. I must say that his contribution was quite evocative; I remembered the small lead pellets in rabbits that I ate as a child, and I must agree with the noble Lord that one had to avoid those as well as the harder steel shot.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para2"></a>The move to regulation was taken only after detailed consideration of the issues and wide consultation with all involved. In 1995, a working group of government, shooting, farming and conservation organisations, along with the gun and ammunition industry, was set up by the previous Government to consider the phasing out of the use of lead shot in weapons in the UK. Through a <P>


<a name="column_1299"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1299</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>programme of research, guidance and publicity, the group encouraged the development of alternatives and of means to encourage people who shoot over wetlands to switch voluntarily to these. However, the working group reached a conclusion, after considerable publicity for the voluntary phase-out, that it was necessary to move on from the voluntary phase.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para3"></a>At the end of 1997, the Government carried out a consultation exercise with more than 60 interested organisations, local authorities, representatives of field sport societies, gun and ammunition manufacturers, shooting organisations, conservation groups and enforcement agencies. They all worked together to establish which approach should be adopted at the end of the voluntary phase-out period. Responses to that consultation revealed overall support for a move to a statutory ban as soon as possible. As a result, the Government took the view that a voluntary approach is not sufficient to ensure the protection of waterfowl, as my noble friend Lady Young of Old Scone said.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para4"></a>A detailed consultation document issued on 8th April 1999 outlined draft regulations to restrict the use of lead shot in Great Britain. It was sent to over 4,000 individuals and interested organisations. Responses were accepted until the end of June. Following analysis of the responses, my right honourable friend the Minister of State at the DETR, Michael Meacher, announced on 2nd August that restrictions on the use of lead shot would come into force in England on 1st September, the start of the hunting season for ducks and geese.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para5"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, and other noble Lords, in particular the noble Lord, Lord Monro, have referred to the fact that similar legislation in Scotland and Wales is a matter for the devolved authorities. The noble Lord, Lord Monro, and the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, raised the issue of cross-border shooting. It is a fact of life that frequently one needs to know whether one is in Scotland, England, or Wales. I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, that he talks to his noble friend Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, who seemed to be clear as to who had a right to vote in the Scottish referendum and who did not. He must therefore know the borders better than anyone.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para6"></a>Much legislation applies to England only, and it is not a unique feature of this particular statutory instrument. If there is any question of prosecution, obviously evidence would be gathered as to whether or not the offence took place in England.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para7"></a>It was important that any regulation was easily understood by both the shooting community and those who would be responsible for enforcement. We considered prohibiting the use of lead shot in all weapons. However, there are difficulties associated with drawing up a working definition of a wetland. Wetland areas are dynamic: new gravel workings change flood control regimes; there are habitat restoration schemes, etc; and they are subject to fluctuating use by waterfowl.
<P>


<a name="column_1300"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1300</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para8"></a>After consideration of a number of different definitions of wetland, it became clear that it would not be possible to define wetlands in such a way that all shooters would know exactly where the ban applied. Therefore, enforcement of legislation would be very difficult. For that reason, the Government decided to prohibit lead shot over those SSSIs on which waterfowl regularly occur, as well as areas below the high water mark which are, by their nature, wetland areas.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-12_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to my noble friend for intervening. I should like to have spoken in the debate but I was fulfilling my duty to ensure that there is a quorum in our Select Committee. Is my noble friend aware that there is a particular need to ensure that the wildlife interest is safeguarded in those areas which are close to or within conurbations? One of the particular dangers faced in those areas is the use of air rifles by irresponsible trespassers. Is it possible to prohibit the ammunition which they use? Can we also be given some assurance that the Government will urge the police authorities, particularly in such areas, to ensure that enforcement receives some priority?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his intervention. I believe that he is referring to areas which are not covered by this statutory instrument. However, I believe that the issues and concerns which he raises will be covered by other legislation. If my noble friend writes to me giving details of the areas he has in mind, I shall look into those matters carefully and seek to reply to him.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para9"></a>While I accept that prohibitions would contain a substantial proportion of the most important habitats for waterfowl, a means needed to be found to limit the risk from lead poisoning in the areas where birds are generally hunted. Therefore, the most practical means of achieving a reduction in the deposition of lead shot outside the designated sites was to prohibit the use of lead shot for shooting ducks, geese, coot, moorhen, snipe and golden plover. Careful consideration was given to the list of species covered by the regulation. Those species directly at risk of lead poisoning were automatically included. As a consequence, birds such as ducks, geese and swans were included in the list, although swans are not legally hunted in this country. The other four species--coot, moorhen, snipe and golden plover--were included after advice from English Nature indicated that those species, although not at risk from lead poisoning, could be hunted in areas where ducks and geese occurred. Therefore, the risk of lead poisoning in those species would affect them adversely and put them at risk.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para10"></a>Several noble Lords, including the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, in introducing his Prayer, asked whether the Government have any plans to extend the list of sites to cover all SSSIs. The Government have no plans to extend the list to cover all SSSIs.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para11"></a>I understand the reservations expressed about blanket prohibition relating to certain areas. Later, I shall refer in more detail to the fact that there will be widespread consultation in the light of experience of the hunting season in the coming years.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para12"></a>We recognise that the cost of some alternatives to lead shot are more expensive. However, set in the context of the overall cost of shooting and given the environmental benefits which will accrue, we believe that the increased costs of certain cartridges are not unreasonable. I have been made aware of the concern of noble Lords that people might use steel shot in unadapted guns, which, I am reliably informed, could become dangerous very quickly if used in that way. Obviously, we, along with all those who are responsible in the field of hunting and shooting, will continue to ensure that people are made fully aware of those dangers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, raised the issue of the use of lead shot by a tenant against the wishes of the owner of land and property. There is no liability. In such a case, the liability lies with the person who uses the lead shot if he does so against the wishes of the owner.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para14"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, asked about the application of the burden of proof. It would be the responsibility of the prosecuting authority to prove that an offence had been committed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para15"></a>The issue of enforcement has been referred to by many noble Lords. I say in response to the noble Lord, Lord Burton, that any evidence which environmental agencies or those who are concerned might have of tampering with evidence should be reported in great detail to the proper authorities. It is impossible for me to deal with such a generalised statement of concern.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-12_para16"></a>Concerns have been voiced that regulations have introduced new draconian measures to allow undesirable organisations to police the ban, enter people's homes and seize property. Nothing could be further from the truth. The enforcement powers of the regulation are closely related to those in Section 108 of the Environment Act 1995. The enforcement provisions of that Act superseded those of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 under which the regulations were made. It is usual for regulations to have similar enforcement powers to the primary legislation under which they are made. As such, the powers contained in the regulation are clearly not new. The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, raised that issue.

Does she agree that Section 108 of the 1995 Act contains several provisions which could be seen as protective provisions relating to the use of this power to determine whether provisions of pollution control enactments are complied with? Those similar provisions are not in these regulations.

<FONT SIZE=3>enforcement of the regulations will be carried out primarily by the police. Notices have been sent to chief constables of all police forces in England authorising them to enforce the legislation. There may be occasions, albeit very rare, when organisations such as the Environment Agency or English Nature are better placed to enforce the regulations. We need that element of flexibility. However, I assure the House that there are no plans whatever to give enforcement powers to any NGOs. The regulation does not give powers to enforcing authorities to enter dwelling houses without a warrant. Several noble Lords raised the issue of the right to enter premises. Authorised persons have power only to enter non-residential premises in order to make necessary examinations and carry out their investigations.

<P>
<A NAME="91109-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Marlesford: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Baroness leaves that point, she said that there might be occasions when bodies other than the police--she mentioned the Environment Agency and English Nature--may be in a better position and therefore may be authorised by the Secretary of State to enforce these regulations, under paragraph 1(4)(i), which means entering premises. What arrangements are proposed to inform Parliament if and when that happens?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-13_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, I am not aware of any arrangements to inform Parliament. I shall write to the noble Lord if I am wrong about that. I do not believe that it is normal practice for that to occur, nor that that was envisaged in the original measure which, as the noble Lord will be only too well aware, was passed under the previous administration. As I have said, if I am wrong on that, I shall write to the noble Lord and place a copy in the Library.

<A NAME = "91109-13_para1"></a>In closing, I am conscious that this is a complex subject. In spite of badly overrunning my time, I have not been able to answer all the points raised by noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para2"></a>I assure the noble Lord, Lord Dunleath, that this is not the beginning of the end of allowing shooting and wildfowling. That is not the intention of the Government. Having listened to the noble Lord, Lord Burton, he will be aware that across the House there is concern that, while shooting and wildfowling can continue, the use of lead shot, where it damages wildlife, should be controlled and constrained to protect the species.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para3"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Marlesford and Lord Kimball, raised many complex issues concerning which sites are covered. I know that the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, will be pleased to know that the Government are aware that the lists of sites covered by regulation might need revision.

<A NAME="91109-13_spnew4"></A><B> The Earl of Lytton: </B>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for their contributions to today's debate. I am extremely grateful to them for taking part. Perhaps noble Lords will excuse me if I do not mention individual contributors by name; the Minister has been through the matter exhaustively. In view of the time we have taken, I shall keep my remarks to a respectable length, if not an absolute minimum.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para5"></a>I turn to the comments made by the Minister. I believe I am right in saying that the evidence of toxic effects, particularly to mallard, was based on a tiny sample. I simply ask whether that was statistically relevant for the purposes of backing up the need for the regulations.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para6"></a>I am bound to accept that the phasing out of lead shot is probably desirable as a general objective, subject to it being found to be necessary. The emphasis on what is necessary is where I shall start and finish.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para7"></a>I was gratified that the noble Baroness referred to the fact that there was no intention to extend a complete ban to forested areas. I was also glad to hear her closing remarks on the question of reviewing which sites of special scientific interest, and perhaps which parts of them, would be included in future. Had she also agreed to review the species list, I would have been much happier. I am bound to say that the fact that plover and snipe could feed on wetland areas seems to me to be a remarkably thin piece of technical evidence. With the greatest respect to the noble Baroness, Lady Young, if that is the standard being put forward by the Government's nature adviser, I believe that every landowner and shoot manager will take due note of that and of what has been said here today.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para8"></a>One issue which concerns me is liability. I am pleased to note that the burden of proof will be on the authorities. I am concerned about strict environmental liability. I had a real panic attack after the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, made her comments. We know what happens under environmental legislation. If the polluter cannot be found, the landowner, the owner of the property who is there with his goods and chattels, is in the firing line, even if he is self-evidently not the person who has perpetrated the act of pollution. When we discussed that measure in 1994-1995, I said that that was wrong. I still say that it is wrong. That is looking for deep pockets, not for people who are culpable of criminal offences. That is a point I particularly want to stress.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para9"></a>I am pleased to hear that the working party will be reconvened. I hope that that will give those who remain in this House and those who have had so much input into this matter in the past an opportunity of <P>


<a name="column_1304"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>raising issues such as species, geographical areas, the use of particular shot and whether there are difficulties in the light of the shooting season.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para10"></a>From my own personal shooting operations, I know that it will be impractical to change shot for shooting the mallard we have reared. I have issued instructions to my shoot staff that the mallard will simply be caught up in due course when they are mature and put in the freezer. The only sensible thing to do is to send them off unshot in that way. I said to my local branch of English Nature that if they thought that a 40 per cent fall in the mallard population over the past couple of years was high--I understand that that was the order of magnitude--to expect an even bigger one next year. John Lytton will not be putting down more ducks until there is a practical way of shooting them on a mixed shooting estate. There are real problems in dealing with this issue. Noble Lords have explained how it is practically impossible to try to enforce this as a matter of contract. It will be something of a nightmare. It is best for me to say that we will not deal with duck any more.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para11"></a>I am concerned about what might happen to forestry and about the criticisms of steel shot. I am also concerned with steel shot in use in older guns in particular. That needs careful watching.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para12"></a>I do not feel it appropriate to seek the opinion of the House on this issue. The Minister is quite clear as to where we are all coming from. I echo the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Young. We should not have a situation where landowners and shoot managers are at loggerheads with the conservation authorities. However, by the same token, as I said earlier, such authorities need to watch their step. It is no good for these matters to be done "on sus". They need to be based on hard, understandable facts. They should not be done in the neural network of discussions between conservationists, but should be understandable as practical expediencies to landowners.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para13"></a>As I said earlier, this is the last occasion on which I shall address your Lordships, and I ask your indulgence. I have been honoured to serve in this House. I have been supported throughout by the indulgence of your Lordships, for which I am extremely grateful. I am also grateful to the Officers and staff of the House--I cannot mention them all by name--for their support, commitment, total expertise and devotion.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-13_para14"></a>I shall leave here with a slightly heavy heart. On the other hand I do not regard myself as indispensable here; I never have. There is probably as much that I can do outside the House as in. I have a profession to which I shall return--indeed, which I have never left. The cost of attending here to deal with some of the legislation with which I have been involved has, at times, been high. However, it has been an enormous challenge and privilege. I wish your Lordships well for the future. I am slightly fearful as to how things will "pan out", to use the vernacular. However, I pray that wise counsel will remain with those in this House to continue the independence of view that has always been its hallmark. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.
<P>

<A NAME="91109-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Grantchester </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government how their proposals for the milk industry and in particular for the supply of raw milk will affect the rural economy.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I rise to introduce this short debate tonight on the milk industry rescheduled after the tragic event of last Friday. I am grateful to all noble Lords who are to contribute. I declare an interest as a dairy farmer in Cheshire and chairman of a small, direct supply producer group, the South West Cheshire Dairy Association. I welcome my noble friend the Chief Whip who will be replying to the debate on behalf of the Government.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para1"></a>Agriculture continues in deep crisis. Dairy farming, some 16 per cent of agriculture, yet crucial to the livestock areas of the western side of Britain, has seen its profits fall 36 per cent in the year to April 1999, following a fall of 41 per cent the previous year. Deregulation of the milk industry occurred in 1994. Dairy farmers enjoyed barely two years of increased returns. There followed four years of accelerating decline. The average dairy farmer has seen his profit fall from a high of around &#163;36,000 in 1995 to this year's figure of &#163;12,000, with further falls in prospect. The smaller farmer is already making losses.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para2"></a>Commercial dairy farming has three income sources--milk, mature livestock sales, most notably the end cull cow sale, and calf sales. The withdrawal of support to those two livestock markets post-BSE has revealed that markets have yet to recover. The calf processing scheme, which paid &#163;90 per calf in 1996, ended on 31st July this year with the result that the dairy bull calf is now a drain on a farm's resources as the dairy farmer has to dispose of the animal as best he can. The welfare implications have been highlighted by the national media.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para3"></a>In the cow market, with the loss of export trade, farmers are receiving around &#163;300 for the cow carcass through the over thirty months scheme--less than half the price of four years ago. In Germany and France, cull animals are worth up to 30 per cent more than four years ago. The Government have already withdrawn support to the calf market, revealing an absence of internal UK demand. Can my noble friend give a clear assurance today that the over thirty months scheme will continue until export markets re-open for trading and that it will not be curtailed overnight? Can he confirm that the Government will seek a smooth transition, for example by increasing the age specification from 30 months, or by ending the rolling nature of the scheme?
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para4"></a>The dairy farmer has increasingly to rely on his main source of income; namely, milk. This is why perversely production keeps increasing, maintaining pressure on quota prices. In the four years since 1996, farmgate price has fallen 28 per cent, equivalent to 7p per litre, and is still falling. There are three basic reasons why milk prices have fallen so alarmingly: first, poor <P>


<a name="column_1306"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1306</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>markets in the European Union and the world; secondly, the strength of sterling; and, thirdly, the poor negotiating strength of dairy farmers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para5"></a>Dealing with the international market, the economic problems in Asia, Russia and South America have meant export volumes have shrunk and world market prices are down by over 30 per cent for butter and skim milk powder and by over 20 per cent for cheese and whole milk powder. With some 20 per cent of European milk exported, those price and volume falls have undermined European domestic market prices, with butter prices down 30 per cent, cheese down 17 per cent and other products down by between 5 and 10 per cent.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para6"></a>In the United Kingdom, even with about 50 per cent of milk going to the liquid market, average prices will have dropped by about lp per litre before currency movements. Sadly for UK agriculture, sterling has been extremely strong. The effect in the milk market can be measured by the movement in the intervention milk price equivalent (IMPE), which has also dropped by 30 per cent. However, the sterling effect has little impact on the United Kingdom liquid market which suggests that the average milk price drop attributable to sterling is about 4p per litre. Against the overall drop in prices of 7p per litre, 5p per litre can be attributed to the first two reasons; namely, market conditions and the strong pound. This leaves a balance of 2p per litre--28 per cent of the price fall--which appears to be due to the superior bargaining position of milk buyers since deregulation.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para7"></a>That brings us to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) report on the milk industry. In the days of the Milk Marketing Board, UK farmgate prices were next to bottom in the European milk price league. In 1998, according to ZMP, the United Kingdom had become bottom of the league with a farmgate price of 18.6p per litre, standardised at 3.7 per cent butter fat, against a top price of 24.5p per litre received in Italy. In 1994, the old MMB milk-selling price was 6.5 per cent above IMPE. In its first selling round in 1994-95, Milk Marque achieved an average selling price of 14.8 per cent above IMPE. This year, Milk Marque's average selling price was back at 7 per cent above IMPE.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para8"></a>Looking at it another way, Stock Exchange listed dairy company margins have fully recovered from the post deregulation milk price hike. For example, Express Dairies' margin fell from 9 per cent in 1993-94 to 6 per cent in 1996-97 but has recovered to 8.5 per cent in the past two years. From Robert Wiseman's annual report, earnings per share, at 7.3p in 1995, have risen to 16.5p, and operating profit has increased from &#163;7 million to &#163;19 million over the same period. Following through to the supermarket shelf, dairy farmers' share of the retail price of milk has fallen from 38 per cent to 33 per cent over the past two years. Consumer butter and cheese prices are 6 per cent and 8 per cent higher, while whole milk prices are down 5 per cent. If the idea of getting rid of the milk board was to get milk prices up, then it has manifestly failed. With <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Dairy Crest, MMB's value-added arm, also floated off, the experience of Milk Marque has been a bitter one for members.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para9"></a>Against that background, the MMC report on the supply of raw milk was a bitter blow for dairy farmers, alleging that consumers pay more for fresh milk than they should. I shall not discuss the report at great length. To summarise, the MMC found that Milk Marque is a scale monopolist by virtue of its share in the supply of milk and able to exploit its position by using its selling system and engaging in various practices to artificially raise prices. From the definitions and assumptions of the report, that may well be correct. But that has inherently been the case since vesting day and suggests that MM was fundamentally flawed from the outset.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para10"></a>The reality is that, in practice, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has been dictating what MM can and cannot do since at least February 1996. The strategy of a single national co-op that could and would abuse its dominant position has been a historic mistake, bought at huge cost to the farming industry. The OFT has been operating as the industry's regulator. If milk prices in the shops have not fallen as much as they should, that has been due to the actions of dairy companies and retailers. In the summary section, paragraph 1.2 of the report states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Milk Marque effectively sets the floor price of milk for producers in Great Britain, because of its membership policy and its high market share. Since purchasers of milk must offer producers a higher price than that offered by Milk Marque if they are to attract and retain those producers, milk prices throughout Great Britain are higher than they would otherwise have been".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-14_para11"></a>
That is a strange description of an abusing monopoly. At present it can be concluded that Milk Marque is failing to deliver to its members a fair milk price, even bringing down everyone's milk price. It is losing membership as fast as members can find alternative buyers. The long-term future of the co-operative must be in doubt. With only a single national co-operative, milk buyers have been able to place Milk Marque in the position of being a marginal milk supplier behind their directly sourced supplies. As buyers cherry pick their milk supplies, Milk Marque is progressively weakened by its own cost structure. With operating costs at 2.2p per litre against other dairies sourcing direct supplies at lp to 1.5p per litre, Milk Marque's costs as a percentage of the milk price are disastrously about 12 per cent of today's price at 18.5p per litre and can only worsen as prices continue down.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para12"></a>UK dairy farmers have been drawn inexorably into milk processing to add value to their commodity. Dairy farmers throughout the world, except in the UK, have invested in milk processing with mixed results. MD foods in Denmark and the big Dutch co-ops appear to have paid farmers very good prices. In contrast, Irish co-ops have paid comparatively poor milk prices. Co-ops dominate the New Zealand market, yet farmers are paid disastrously low prices. The trend everywhere is for co-ops to dilute their farmer shareholding to raise funds to invest in value-added businesses. But in the UK, the MMC report would not allow an intact, national Milk Marque to enter processing.
<P>


<a name="column_1308"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1308</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para13"></a>The MMC recommended the restructuring of Milk Marque by dividing it into independent and competing quota-holding bodies able to sell milk on a commercial basis and therefore able to engage in milk processing. The Secretary of State did not accept this recommendation. To remain intact, Milk Marque would lose control of its selling system and its ability to expand into processing. The reaction of Milk Marque is that it would rather be broken up, to allow it the freedom to operate. This was endorsed by its membership last Thursday.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para14"></a>Alarmingly, dairy companies immediately pressed home their advantage on publication of the MMC report, as prices to farmers since July have fallen a further 4 per cent. Can my noble friend anticipate today that the break-up will relieve Milk Marque of the requirements laid down in the MMC report? Will the selling arrangements of the successor bodies be circumscribed in any way? New arrangements are certainly needed to deliver a sustainable milk price to dairymen.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para15"></a>The headline figure is that &#163;1 billion will have disappeared from the rural economy due to falling milk prices from 1996 to the year 2000. This figure has been quantified by Deloitte & Touche from the 1998 National Dairy Council's publication Dairy Facts & Figures. The loss of calf income has been calculated at &#163;170 million, and this figure will increase now that dairy calves are at nil value. In my north-west region, this equates to a loss to the rural economy of &#163;160 million due to milk price falls, and &#163;30 million due to calf price drops. The upstream and downstream effect magnifies the falls: 18,000 jobs were lost in farming last year.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para16"></a>While it can be argued that the effect in the north west may be dampened because agriculture is but a small part of the local GDP, in prominently agricultural counties like Cumbria, Pembrokeshire, Devon and Cornwall, the impact is considerable. To Devon and Cornwall, the withdrawal of &#163;110 million through loss of dairy income out of the rural economy will impact significantly, especially this year when I understand tourism has also been hit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para17"></a>Income tax repayments are now a major factor in keeping farming afloat. In a Written Answer last month, the Treasury estimated that repayments through profit averaging and losses increased nearly threefold to about &#163;80 million in 1997-98 from &#163;30 million in 1996-97. This money coming back into the countryside does not reveal the extent of falls in profitability and losses already suffered. Tax definitions are notoriously difficult. My local agricultural accountancy firm responded that this year it had reclaimed &#163;&#189; million for its clients. Significantly, these are one-off payments. What happens next year?
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para18"></a>The pressure on farming families to diversify and to find alternative sources of income is immense. The second income for farmers' wives is often all that families have to live on. Parcels of land and barns are being sold to supply capital for alternative enterprises. Planners need to look sympathetically at the many innovative schemes put before them. The environmental impact must be carefully considered.

<A NAME="91109-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Monk-Bretton: </B>   My Lords, I should like to start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, for providing us with this opportunity to talk about milk; indeed, I feel that we are doing so not before time in a very fast-moving situation. I should also declare a remaining interest in dairy farming since retiring. It is smaller than it was but, at any rate, I still have some knowledge of what goes on.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para20"></a>I should like, first, to emphasis the word "opportunity" because not all of the world's milk can be produced in New Zealand, which has the ideal climate. We in this country have a tolerably useful climate. We have good on-farm equipment and larger herds than Europe. From that point of view, we ought to be highly competitive in dairy products in Europe, if not beyond. However, to do this our dairy processing infrastructure and our milk marketing must be right. The great worry is that they are not right and that this opportunity is being lost.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para21"></a>Milk has always been,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the sheet anchor of British farming".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-14_para22"></a>
It is pretty widespread, except perhaps in the major arable farming areas. It is axiomatic that dairy farmers will not be able to look after the environment if they cannot make a living. With milk at 17 pence a litre, it is currently considered that only the 10 per cent most efficient can make a profit. I believe that the usual exodus from dairying per annum of 3 per cent to 4 per cent will, in all likelihood, now triple because dairy farming is undoubtedly in serious trouble; and that matters for the countryside.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para23"></a>The report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, is my next item. The report found against Milk Marque and the Secretary of State for the Department of Trade and Industry accepted it. Producers were indeed disappointed. They had already seen that Milk Marque had virtually been driven on to the rocks--and pretty much driven there by the determination of the dairy industry's federation, with the help of certain government action in altering the method of the selling round of Milk Marque. I believe that that loosened the headstone of the arch by which Milk Marque was supporting prices.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para24"></a>I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, who is to reply to the debate, will be able to comment on some of the questions asked by producers. For example: does not all this contrast strangely with the analysis of the problems of milk marketing made in 1933, when it was decided that monopoly should be met by monopoly? Perhaps that analysis was not far out because the Milk Marketing Board lasted for 60 years with no little success.

<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para25"></a>As regard the MMC's report, I ask: are we over-interpreting our competition law? Alternatively, does our competition law discriminate too much against the primary producer? I feel that there is something in one or other of those questions. It seems that we are back to the old UK problem of a significantly wider difference between farm-gate and retail prices than is the case in Europe.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para26"></a>I should like to draw attention here to my particular dislike of paragraphs 2.190 and 2.191 of the MMC report. To me, these paragraphs effectively say that the European Community's support price mechanism for milk should protect the dairies, not the producer. This may be satisfactory in Europe with the vertically integrated co-op industry, but, to my mind, it is not satisfactory in England. I believe that that support was intended for farmers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para27"></a>At the United Kingdom Milk Group Conference in September, which the noble Lord, Lord Carter, and I attended, we heard a good address from Mr Randall Torgenson of the United States Department of Agriculture. That is a paper well worth studying by all those involved in dairy processing. I trust that Her Majesty's Government will also study it closely. Some 82 per cent. of milk in America is handled by co-operatives. We asked Mr Torgenson a question at the end of the address which does not appear in the paper. That is why I draw attention to it. We asked whether, supposing the United States anti-trust laws applied in England, Milk Marque would have passed muster? Mr Torgenson replied emphatically, "yes". He stressed particularly that US rules took into account the weak position of a large number of producers as against a small number of processors. He does not think that what has happened here would ever have happened there.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para28"></a>The Minister has now given Milk Marque what I regard as a "Hobson's choice" of dividing into three co-operatives, each handling 1.6 billion litres of milk per annum. I have serious concerns about this--and I am not alone--because it goes against the trend in dairy processing. Everyone else is merging to get bigger while we fragment. I mention MD Foods handling 90 per cent. of all Danish milk and Arla of Sweden handling 60 per cent. of all Swedish milk. Both co-operatives are merging. The new co-operative will handle 7 billion litres of milk per annum. I wonder how they get away with that when our laws state that we cannot. I think one might well ask that. The German co-operatives are merging into strong groups. There are many such moves afoot among co-operatives everywhere and among private enterprise dairies in the UK. The message regarding our industry in the UK from the Milk Group Conference is that much consolidation and modernisation must be undertaken if UK processing is to be an efficient competitor in Europe. One can only hope that our new co-operatives can help to achieve this.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para29"></a>I return to the MMC report. I draw attention to paragraph 2.382 on page 94. I do not like that paragraph because it prevents the new co-operatives from combining to operate processing facilities. I wonder how rigidly this measure would be interpreted. <P>


<a name="column_1311"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1311</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I think that some shared plants as between the new co-operatives must and should be allowed. I believe that we are light years away from producer-processors really creating major competition for the big five dairies. It must be emphasised how difficult it will be to establish co-operative processing anyway. We are 60 years behind Europe; we have to find the capital--and where from?--Milk Marque has little money; and the producers do not have much either, particularly under present circumstances. One has to remember that co-operative processing can prove to be risky. It may or may not be a successful venture, as has been shown elsewhere.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para30"></a>Bearing in mind the hold that the big five dairies have on producers and the hold that the supermarkets will increasingly have on the five dairies, will either group deal with a producer co-op? They may decide that they want to oppose producer co-ops in the same way as they opposed Milk Marque. There are great worries as regards all this. It is pretty certain that things can only get worse before they get better, but some assertive thinking is needed to achieve rapid results. Certainly the Government must be flexible and helpful to co-operative effort. Producers feel, not unnaturally, that the Government have got them into this mess. Some catalyst may be needed to get all this moving if disaster is to be avoided. When I mention a catalyst I am asking for something, be it tax remission or a tax holiday, but something to get co-operative producer processing going.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para31"></a>Finally, our UK dairy herd is not large. It is far smaller per head of the population than is the case in most other countries in Europe. I would like to see us exploit our opportunity for British dairying and not see it sink and suffer because our marketing is not right. That is the end of my remarks, but I wish also to say goodbye. It is likely that the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, who initiated this debate, and I will no longer attend this House. I am delighted that a maiden speaker is to speak after me. I hope that he will carry the torch for British dairying.

<A NAME="91109-14_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </B>   My Lords, in the legal profession to which I belong there is a technique called confession and avoidance. I notice that my first confession, that of being a member of the legal profession, causes a frisson in your Lordships' House because there are so many members of that profession here.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para32"></a>My second confession is probably even worse; namely, that of having spent 14 years in another place. However, in those 14 years I learnt at least one good habit: to walk down the corridors and across the Central Lobby to visit this House from time to time to listen to the debates. Without gratuitously criticising the House of Commons, after my experience there it is with real diffidence that I make my maiden speech in your Lordships' House. I hope that as the years pass I may reach that standard of informed debate which has been the norm here--a standard less often reached in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>the hurly-burly there. The demand-led aspects of direct electoral accountability do not always have reason as their handmaiden.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para33"></a>I hope that my two-and-a-half years of largely rural home leave, or, as it is sometimes called domestically, parole, since I retired from the other place, may have chipped away some of the more combative, rougher edges of what I learnt there. I hope, too, that those two-and-a-half years enjoying my home in rural Wales will have added to my knowledge of the problems that face rural areas, and particularly the milk industry. It is with a sense of irony that I come, after that interval of two-and-a-half years, from a House which is self-evidently too large, too undemocratic in its content, composition and operation and manifestly in need of reform, to a House which has faced historic reform, despite its record--some would say in the teeth of its record--for rationality and the exchange of sound argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para34"></a>I am delighted to see in his place my noble friend Lord Hooson who was my senior supporter when I took my place in this House. For 31 of the 35 years from 1962 to 1997, he, and then I, represented Montgomeryshire in the House of Commons. During those 31 years he and I have shared a passion to bring forward before Parliament the condition and the needs of rural areas. They have become a subject of highest importance to me and, I know, to the noble Lord also.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para35"></a>As I say, I live, and when I can, work in rural Montgomeryshire. In addition, outside my legal practice I declare a interest as a director of a company--originally a farmers' co-operative, but now converted to plc status very successfully--that serves and therefore mirrors the core industry of the area.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para36"></a>Perhaps that brings us to a key question. What is the core industry of an area like rural mid-Wales? Over the years we have all read about and seen the great efforts of organisations like the Welsh Development Agency and the now lamented Development Board for Rural Wales in which my noble friend took such a great part in encouraging its formation. But even after decades of economic development, when one asks what is the core industry of an area like rural mid-Wales, the answer is one word: farming. It always has been farming. It remains farming today and whatever economic developments, which of course we welcome, are brought to rural areas like ours, farming will remain the core industry for the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para37"></a>The farmers whose land I see from my home and who are my friends are not merely the curators of rural Wales and of the hills and hedges, though I believe that some, particularly those living and spending most of their lives in the cities, believe wrongly that that is the farmer's role. In round figures 70 per cent of the local economy of rural mid-Wales still depends on the activity of farmers and those who work for them. The cohesion of villages and market towns and therefore the visual and perhaps above all the social integrity of the countryside, depends on their continued reasonably successful economic activity. The milk industry is a key part of that.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para38"></a>Of course, in all walks of life there is greed and there is a good deal of mythology--some of it justified--about the greedy farmer. However, in the present state of the farming industry one is as likely to find a hungry farmer as a greedy farmer. One is much more likely to find an angry farmer than a greedy farmer. What has happened to them? Their incomes have dropped by 62 per cent over the past three years. What other industry, what other profession, has had to put up with that kind of reduction in income without any measures--structured measures at least--being taken to alleviate that. Investment in farming is at its lowest level (again in round figures) for 20 years. If that were happening in any of the other core industries of this country we would be wringing our hands. But when it comes to farming we seem to shrug our shoulders.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para39"></a>The common agricultural policy is part of the problem. In my view it served the farmers well for years. Now it has become their bogey. It is bedevilled by the inflexibility and the reluctance of European Union member states to redesign it from first principles. That means new principles applicable to a widening, deepening union. In terms of food production, Welsh farmers cannot compete with the vast breadbaskets of central Europe. Common agricultural policy reform must recognise the consequent economic and social strains that our rural areas face.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para40"></a>The milk industry is a key factor for the survivor of our rural life. If farmers continue to suffer price falls and if the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report and the Government's reaction to it, is allowed to place producers in other countries at an unfair competitive advantage compared with our own farmers, then the repercussions for the British countryside will be dire.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para41"></a>Farmers realise of course that nobody owes them a living, but what they ask is simple and, I would suggest, reasonable. Where necessary--they will always say this first in my experience--"Give us the means and we will diversify if you can present to us a justifiable case based on recent evidence that that is what we must do". But what farmers also say is this: "Please do not regulate us, nanny us or force us, through economic correctness, out of the opportunity to meet the reasonable public demand for choice in milk, including raw milk, and other potential on-farm products". We do seek a Government reaction which bears some hope for a reasonably prosperous future for the farmers and for the most important and good reason that our communities should survive.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para42"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, on his success in bringing these important matters to the House. He and the noble Lord, Lord Monk Bretton, will be missed. I hope that their departure and that of other enlightened and substantial farmers in this House, will not result in these issues becoming neglected. I hope to join and perhaps initiate similar debates in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, it gives me immense pleasure to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, on his eloquent and passionate maiden speech. It will be a joy to have him with us in this House. He brings to this Chamber many years of parliamentary experience, having represented Montgomeryshire for 14 years. From his speech today we know that his experience in the legal profession will make him a great adversary across the Chamber, too. We thank him for his very thoughtful contribution on rural matters and look forward to hearing from him on many occasions in the future, particularly in our farming debates. I offer a warm welcome to the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para43"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, raises this question at an important time and I congratulate him on so doing. As of this morning, it appears that Milk Marque is intending to establish three competing businesses. This is roughly in line with the Mergers and Monopolies Commission recommendation and against the original ruling of the right honourable Stephen Byers. However, positions can change and have changed dramatically, in a short space of time. This debate is crucially timed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para44"></a>As the Minister and other noble Lords present will be only too aware, farm incomes are at an all-time low. In the past two years incomes have halved and halved again. As the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, said, 18,000 jobs have been lost in farming in the past year.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para45"></a>The MMC report, as other noble Lords have mentioned, began in 1997, and at the time of its release the statistics were already out of date. It even suggested that milk prices have risen when, as we all know, the opposite has happened. The average producer price was 25p per litre in 1996, 19p per litre in 1998-99 and is currently about 17.58p per litre for the majority of dairy farmers. That is below the cost of production and has triggered an unprecedented increase in the number of farmers quitting the industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para46"></a>According to the data supplied by ZMP, UK farmers were at the bottom of the price league in Europe in 1998. Italy was on top with an average price of 23p per litre. That situation is likely to worsen.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para47"></a>The report concludes that Milk Marque's planned increase in its milk processing capacity may be expected to operate against the public interest. Now that Milk Marque no longer has a monopoly, that conclusion is surprising. It is perfectly legitimate that dairy farmers should own the means of processing and manufacturing. Perhaps the Minister will expand the Government's thinking in this direction when he comes to reply. I understand that in Denmark, MD foods holds a 95 per cent stake in its dairy industry, as another noble Lord said.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para48"></a>We on these Benches believe that Milk Marque should be allowed to develop added value to raw milk. Its market share is down now to some 37 per cent and it seems fair that dairy farmers should have some processing capacity, as is common with other northern European states.
<P>


<a name="column_1315"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1315</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para49"></a>The more efficient farmers--who are often the bigger ones--have left Milk Marque and formed their own milk groups. These are independent co-operatives which are able to operate more successfully than Milk Marque. The greater the number of groups formed, the greater the strain on Milk Marque, through which the smaller, more rural farmers often have to sell. I suspect that that is true in Wales. I understand that even now Milk Marque has to charge some farmers for milk collection from their farms.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para50"></a>The Government's response to the MMC report is that Milk Marque should not be broken into smaller units, nor should it be allowed to go in for further processing. The NFU is challenging both the report and the decisions. It believes that the report is ill-conceived, out of date and does not reflect the realities of what is happening in the dairy industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para51"></a>I understand that the NFU's action will centre on two aspects of European law. Firstly, that the report neglects the special exemption that agricultural co-operatives are given under EU competition law; and, secondly, that it places insufficient weight on the provisions of the EU milk regulation to establish the target price as the aggregate of producer prices.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para52"></a>It could be argued that the splitting of Milk Marque into smaller units will put each at a competitive disadvantage because each will carry fixed-term management fees. Some would argue that it would be better for them to remain together in order to lessen the impact of those fixed costs. However, greater organisational freedom is required if Milk Marque is to move into a variety of value added products.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para53"></a>I turn now to the second part of the noble Lord's Question. He asks how the Government's proposals for the supply of raw milk will affect the rural community. He is right to be concerned. The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, reflected on that matter very accurately. I believe that we would see more small dairy farmers quitting the industry. That would have great implications for each community which is threatened. As we all know, they are not merely suppliers of milk; they are businesses. They are at the very heart of our rural areas. It is crucial that they should be maintained.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para54"></a>In addition to this particular problem which threatens our rural communities, I should like to speak on another matter which, so far, other noble Lords have not addressed. If I am a little wide of the mark, I apologise, but I feel I should mention the issue of bovine TB. As noble Lords who have spoken in these debates in the House will know, bovine TB is spreading rapidly throughout the United Kingdom. It started in the south west, moved up the west side of the country, is very prevalent in Cheshire, and we also have this problem in my own area of Leicestershire.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para55"></a>Agricultural employment may be a fraction of what it once was but for our farming population it still provides the economic, social and environmental basis of country life. Farm incomes support those who work as equipment manufacturers, suppliers, mechanics, shopkeepers and vets, to name but a few. Over the years farmers have been the guardians of our countryside. If they go, who will take up this role?
<P>


<a name="column_1316"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1316</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para56"></a>In his very good opening speech, the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, touched on the question of dairy bull calves. He explained the issue so well that I will not go into detail. He asked whether the Government would consider continuing the 30 months scheme until exports have been re-established. I, too, will listen with interest to the Government Chief Whip's reply.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para57"></a>Perhaps I may now pose one or two questions to the Government Chief Whip. First, does he accept that small dairy farmers would continue to be squeezed out of existence if Stephen Byers' original ruling had prevailed? Secondly, does he accept that the groupings of the more efficient farmers--which have already taken place and which will continue to take place--will place a greater strain on those who have no such choice, especially those who live and work in rural areas?
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para58"></a>Thirdly, what hope has the Minister to offer small producers of dairy products? We have spoken about raw milk but not specifically about those who might wish to go into producing more dairy products in their own right.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para59"></a>Fourthly, will the Minister confirm that the Government will push ahead with trial badger culls regardless of the animal welfare lobby and the other difficulties which I know they are currently encountering? That is a very important issue which has huge implications for our dairy industry.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para60"></a>Fifthly--other noble Lords have already mentioned this matter--does the Minister accept that the outcome of this year's CAP reforms were a disaster for our dairy farmers, while other countries, particularly Eire, enjoy rising quotas? There will be no improvement for British farmers until, at the earliest, 2008. For many farmers that is not an option.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para61"></a>We have spoken very clearly about the issue of raw milk and the implications that the MMC report has for all farmers. We have talked also about the implications for the rural community. As I come to the end of my speech, I, too, would like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester. I have been an Opposition spokesman on agriculture in this House for a year. It has been a pleasure during that time to look across the Chamber and to know that on the Government Benches there was someone who spoke with great knowledge. It has been a joy to have him participate in many agriculture debates during the past year.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para62"></a>I also wish to thank my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton. Like the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, he said that this will be his last opportunity to speak in the House. Their contributions and their expertise in the topic will be a great loss to this House. They will both be missed. On behalf of these Benches, I wish them every success in the challenges they will face.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para63"></a>This has been an important debate. As I said, it could not have come at a better time. We were all very sad that the debate had to be postponed from last Friday. We on these Benches extend our support and sympathy to the family concerned. We thank the Government for giving us the chance to have the debate at this important time. I look forward to hearing from the Minister.

<P>
<A NAME="91109-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to my noble friend Lord Grantchester for giving us the timely opportunity to debate this important subject. I should declare a former interest. I was a shareholder and director of a farming company with a number of dairy units before I became a member of the Government. I no longer have an interest as a director and shareholder--which I am coming to believe is extremely fortunate timing with the way matters have gone.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para64"></a>All noble Lords who have spoken have shown by their contributions the importance of the Question tabled by my noble friend. It is particularly pleasant to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew--I hope that I have pronounced it correctly--on his outstanding maiden speech. He comes to the House with a distinguished parliamentary and legal background and we look forward to his contributions in the future. I was much taken with his reference to the process of "confessional avoidance", as I believe I heard him say. As a Chief Whip, I am familiar with that technique. I shall try to deal with all the points that have been raised in the debate. If I do not cover all of them in the time available, I shall write to noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para65"></a>The Act which abolished the Milk Marketing Board and set up Milk Marque started in this House. As the agricultural spokesman at the time, I dealt with it for the Opposition. I must say that, sadly, when one examines what has happened in the milk industry, some of the fears expressed at the time by myself and others have been borne out.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para66"></a>The United Kingdom dairy industry is arguably the most economically important agricultural sector. Over 30,000 holdings produce around 14 billion litres of milk each year, approximately half of which is sold as liquid milk and the rest in the form of a wide variety of dairy products. Milk production is worth, at farmgate prices, some &#163;2.5 billion. Those holdings are predominantly in the west of the country and in Wales, as we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Carlile. The holdings are often found in areas where alternative farming opportunities are perhaps not as attractive at the moment as they once were and where alternative sources of employment outside agriculture may be scarce. The concern at the effect of current developments on the economy in these areas is therefore understandable. I am sure that all UK dairy farmers are acutely aware of the old saying that they buy retail, they sell wholesale, and they pay the transport both ways.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para67"></a>As we have heard today, this large and vital industry is currently facing extremely difficult economic prospects. There is no one single reason for that, but essentially the difficulties result from the operation of the free market in so far as the common agricultural policy allows this. We know that markets in Russia and in south-east Asia have declined sharply, leading to a surplus of milk or milk products chasing a market which, even in the UK in the case of drinking milk, is certainly declining. That in itself is a classic recipe for <P>


<a name="column_1318"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1318</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>falling prices. At the same time, noble Lords know that sterling has been particularly strong against the euro. This has meant that support prices such as the intervention prices for butter and skimmed milk powder, which are set in euros, have fallen in the UK. This has led to further downward pressure on the raw milk price as the floor in the market provided by intervention has been progressively lowered and prices throughout the system have followed.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para68"></a>The Government understand the current difficulties of dairy farmers. That is why my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food announced recently that cattle passport charges will be deferred until 2002-2003 at the earliest. That is a considerable benefit to the dairy sector. I have heard the argument that this is not real aid because the charge is one that had not yet been imposed and was in any case a piece of unnecessary bureaucracy. I am afraid that that is nonsense. The cattle passports form an integral part of our battle to ensure that UK beef is not only the safest in the world but is recognised as such. That carries a benefit to dairy farmers and they would have been expected to bear their part of the costs. However, that is now alleviated.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para69"></a>At the industry's request, we also recently conducted a poll of dairy farmers to see whether they supported the proposal that the Milk Development Council should have its remit extended to include the generic promotion of liquid milk. Despite the cost to them of such activities--which might have been seen as a barrier at times like these--I am pleased to say that those farmers who voted were overwhelmingly in favour. On 28th October my right honourable friend the Minister of Agriculture announced that we would be preparing legislation to bring the proposals into effect. On the general subject of development councils, I have long been a supporter of them as the best way of effecting agricultural improvement. They are funded in an industry containing many small producers by means of a statutory levy on all the producers who will benefit from that improvement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para70"></a>It is proposed under the MDC that producers should enter into a promotional campaign along with processors with equal funding from the two parties. Given the tensions that have existed in the industry in the past, that co-operation between, as it were, the two sides must be a positive sign for the future. No one is nai
ve enough to believe that such a campaign will turn the tide of profitability overnight but research carried out by producers' representatives leads them to believe that it will have a real and positive impact on demand. That is why they are prepared to commit funds to the exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para71"></a>Over the past year there has been very rapid growth in the demand for, and the supply of, organic produce. The growing interest of the major retailers reflects a substantial and apparently continuing growth in consumer demand. The retail value of organic dairy products in the UK has increased from an estimated &#163;15 million in 1997 to &#163;54 million in 1998-99. That is a substantial and rapid increase. Approximately 60 per cent of the UK market is <P>


<a name="column_1319"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1319</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>supplied by home production and there is clearly an opportunity for further expansion by the dairy industry to meet that demand.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para72"></a>The Government have given substantial financial support--around &#163;16 million in England--to aid the conversion to organic production methods. Some 40 per cent of applications for conversion aid in England relate to the south west where, as we know, there is a strong dairying tradition. We have recently announced the provision of &#163;10 million of new money for conversion aid, and regulations allowing the scheme in England to be reopened were laid before Parliament on Wednesday of last week.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para73"></a>This work on promotional issues and the interest in organic production are positive signs for an industry which is looking forward and trying to find ways to adapt to the harsher economic pressures which now face it. Each in itself will not solve the problem but they are indicative of an industry which is not prepared to give up.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para74"></a>I turn to some of the questions raised in the debate. My noble friend Lord Grantchester asked whether, on the break-up of Milk Marque, to which I shall refer later in my remarks, it would be relieved of the constraints that have been placed on it. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced last Friday that he had withdrawn his previous request for interim measures and changes to the Milk Marque selling system.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para75"></a>My noble friend Lord Grantchester, the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, and the noble Lord, Lord Monk Bretton, referred to the position of Milk Marque in regard to the comments of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report. Both Milk Marque and the NFU have instituted a judicial review process on the detail of the evidence in the report. I am advised therefore that the detailed consideration is sub judice and it would be inappropriate for me in my role as a Minister to comment on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para76"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, said that Milk Marque would like better to utilise its processing capacity. I agree that that may be the case, but not if it uses that overcapacity to exploit its monopoly position, which had been the fear with Milk Marque before it was split. The big co-ops in Europe generally do not supply the market with milk in the same way as Milk Marque but process the milk themselves, which is a very different prospect.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para77"></a>Turning to the question of the possible involvement of the three new regional co-operatives which are to succeed Milk Marque and their possible investment in processing, for over 30 years I was a director of a farmers' co-operative. If a true co-operative is established, is engaged in processing and is run as a mutual fund, that co-operative can invest with gross funds; namely, it need not use taxed income. Funds retained in a mutual are not taxed in the hands of the mutual. Tax is paid only when money is distributed to the members. However, that could be a useful source of funds if these new co-operatives decided to go into processing.

<A NAME = "91109-14_para78"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, stated that we should not over-regulate. I think that we would all agree with his words. The whole question of regulation is currently being examined by MAFF with the help of the industry itself. Three groups are looking at the intervention system, the meat industry and IACS. The three groups are chaired by well known figures in the industry: Norman Coward, Robin Pooley and Don Curry, the outgoing chairman of the Meat and Livestock Commission. They have been asked to report to MAFF as quickly as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para79"></a>I turn to the report from the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on the supply of raw milk in Great Britain. I do not propose to go into the report in detail but to recall a few of the basic points. First, the MMC found that Milk Marque was exploiting its monopoly position. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry accepted the findings of the report but not the recommendation that he should compel Milk Marque to split, believing that a wider debate leading to a consensus provided a better way forward. Faced with the prospect of tighter controls on the selling system and a ban on new operations--that is, processing--Milk Marque has, as noble Lords know, itself decided to split into three successor bodies. As I said, the Secretary of State has rescinded his previous request for a change in the selling system.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-14_para80"></a>I commend the decision to split, which I emphasise again is one which the industry itself has taken. It does not represent a government proposal for the milk industry. So far as concerns the future, I would quote the Milk Marque chairman, an old friend of mine, Mr Poul Christensen. In a message to his membership he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The restructuring proposals offer us the opportunity to create three new dynamic businesses, large enough to protect your interests"--
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-14_para81"></a>
that is, the members' interests--
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in the market place and free to grow and develop commercially".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-14_para82"></a>
That was a historic decision for the dairy industry in this country. Milk Marque members have shown their commitment to build a new future for themselves. The radical steps they have taken give the commercial freedom they need to meet the challenges of today's market place and to find new ways of doing business. The Government certainly wish the new businesses every success.

<A NAME="91109-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Monk Bretton: </B>   My Lords, what would happen if a major opportunity occurred? This is a fictional example, but it might occur. If M.D Foods decided to withdraw to Denmark and its enterprise here suddenly came up for sale, and the three successors to Milk Marque had the money to get hold of it--I do not know how they would find the money but let us assume that they did--how would that tie in with the difficulty we have about interpreting the MMC report? I know that the noble Lord cannot say too much about that report. Nevertheless, I hope that these big possibilities <P>


<a name="column_1321"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1321</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will be borne in mind, because a big possibility like that would really get co-operative producer processing on the move in this country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, any one of the three groups will now be free to invest in processing if it wishes to do so. In the hypothetical situation which the noble Lord poses of all three getting together again to invest in milk processing, I would imagine that they would have to clear that with the Office of Fair Trading and the MMC before they could indulge in that, because it would reproduce the situation which was frowned on in the MMC report and which led to the break up of milk marketing into the three businesses.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Monk Bretton: </B>   My Lords, would two be allowed to do that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-15_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, I really cannot answer that question off the top of my head. It would depend on the size of the investment and the share of the market that was involved. But the three new businesses are now clear of any of the constraints that were on Milk Marque under the previous system.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-15_para0"></a>I was about to quote from Poul Christensen. At the special general meeting last week, when the decision was taken by the Milk Marque members, he said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Now is the time to put the past behind us. We must look beyond the traditional division between producer and processor to create a new industry based on partnership, ready to face the global challenges ahead. It is only by working together in large and in market-focused groups that farmers can provide the quality, the service and the value which is needed to flourish".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-15_para1"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91109-15_para2"></a>The future lies very much in the hands of these three new co-operatives and with individual dairy farmers. Perhaps they will invest in processing facilities themselves; perhaps they will seek more strategic alliances with existing processors, which will now be possible for any one of the three but was not previously possible with Milk Marque; or perhaps both those things or some quite different strategy. Whichever avenue they choose, I see no reason why they should not succeed on behalf of their members. I am not suggesting that the milk market will turn around overnight. Of course it will not.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-15_para3"></a>The Government's priority is a thriving dairy industry which can compete on world markets. But we must recognise that, regardless of the position on CAP reform, it seems both desirable and inevitable that the next WTO round will lead to further liberalisation in world trade, which will include the dairy sector. In the coming years we face the prospect of increasing pressure on EU and dairy prices as a result of several factors. We therefore attach considerable importance to the mid-term review of the dairy regime which is due to take place in 2003. But to reform the CAP dairy regime and to phase out milk quotas, which has long been the policy of this Government--and indeed the previous government--we will need to achieve substantial support from the Commission and from our European partners.

<P>

<A NAME="91109-15_spnew4"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   My Lords, I understand that in the view of the NFU of Scotland the way these new <P>


<a name="column_1322"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1322</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Milk Marque businesses will avoid regulation is by commanding only 25 per cent of the production of milk in the country. When one hears the evidence produced by my noble friend Lord Monk Bretton about the size and the control of milk industries in other countries, one wonders whether they will be able to compete on an international scale.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-15_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Carter: </B>   My Lords, that is a fair point. I am not quite sure from where the figure of 25 per cent comes. They cannot each have 25 per cent because at the moment Milk Marque in total is 37 per cent. They will be smaller businesses. They will be able to invest in processing. I suspect that they will be faster on their feet. Only time will tell. I know there is a view that one needs to be extremely large to succeed in this field, but there are some smaller organisations throughout Europe which are extremely successful in this field. We shall have to see how the market works out.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-15_para4"></a>We have the basis for a dairy industry where at least some of the uncertainty which has existed for the past couple of years has disappeared and whose producer co-operatives can operate free from detailed monitoring by the Office of Fair Trading. Now that they are no longer in a monopoly position--at least from next April--they are subject essentially to the same general competition rules as the dairy processing companies. I see no reason why these changes should prove to have any long-term adverse effect on milk producers, on the rural economy or on the supply of raw milk.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-15_para5"></a>In conclusion, perhaps I may add my own thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Monk Bretton, and to my noble friend Lord Grantchester. Those of us who over the years have been engaged in the House in agricultural and food subjects form a small and intimate group. We all know each other and we always used to speak in the same debates. I am extremely sad to see them go. I wish them both well in the future.

<P>
<A NAME="91109-16_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Strange: </B>   My Lords, we are very disappointed that once again the Government are not prepared to save taxpayers' money by accepting the amendment that I moved yesterday with splendid support from your Lordships, particularly my noble kinsman Lord Russell whom I always hope has more jolly limericks, if not mice, up his sleeve. I particularly thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, for all the help and support that she has given me in this matter. There has been more than a whiff of unpleasantness in the air--never a very nice smell--but despite this the amendment has come back from the other place a third time. It would not be constitutional to send it back again. Unlike some noble Lords, I always abide by what is constitutional. I believe totally in our constitution and therefore I shall withdraw my objections this time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-16_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, Mr Frank Field, whose support this House may again be proud to have received today, once remarked that if the House of Lords should spot so much as a grammatical error in an Act of Parliament a government whip would be found to rise to move that that House do disagree with the Lords in the said amendment. Today, I was very much reminded of that remark. I listened to Ministers with considerable care to find out why they saw fit to reject the amendment. Their formal reason was privilege, but the Minister said that clearly it was not a perfunctory matter of &#163;3 million. I hope that I have his words correctly since I was not allowed to write them down.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para0"></a>We are told that a review is necessary. It has never been explained to this House or, as far as I could hear, the other place why a review is necessary. They tell us that it will be completed in the summer. A question was raised as to when that would be. Summer is a movable feast, regrettably sometimes by as much as 12 months in the British climate. I heard that they rejected the amendment because they felt like saying no. If that is incorrect I should be extremely grateful to be told why. Relations between the Houses do not work in this spirit. If we want a bicameral parliament we need rather better communication than this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I shall not detain the House for more than a moment. The House will be grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Strange, for the way in which she pursued the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para1"></a>I turn to the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, as regards the timing. The Government have said clearly that they are carrying out the review. As the noble Baroness pointed out, it is concerned with timing, context, ring fencing and fairness. But if the matter is to be pursued with suitable urgency, to wait <P>


<a name="column_1326"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1326</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>until next summer seems an excessively long period. Perhaps the Minister can indicate that it can be done in a shorter timescale.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-16_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, as I think the opinion of the House reflects tonight, I believe that we have taken the matter as far as possible at this stage. I am very grateful, as I am sure is the House, for the great dignity, courtesy and charm with which the noble Baroness, Lady Strange, has fought the corner on behalf of a group of women with whom, in particular this week, we deeply sympathise and whom we respect.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para2"></a>I have had the pleasure--it is a pleasure--of working with the War Widows Association over the past couple of years, led by the noble Baroness, Lady Strange. I think that they are as brave and gallant wives and widows as the spouses they lost; we pay tribute to them tonight.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para3"></a>I am grateful that the noble Baroness is not taking the issue further. We have argued from the Dispatch Box that we do not think an amendment to a welfare reform Bill is the appropriate vehicle for an issue which is essentially about the occupational pension provision of the Ministry of Defence. We believe, as we argued at the time, that this should be embedded in a wider review of the MoD, which is happening at the moment and which will become public and available for consultation in the summer. I expect that the noble Baroness--perhaps I may call her my noble friend--will be leading the case for war widows on that consultation exercise.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para4"></a>The House of Commons rejected the amendment on financial grounds. Your Lordships will know, because we quoted the Red Book last night, that this is the conventional formal ground for disagreement. However, two issues remained, and this is what I think persuaded the Government that at this stage they should resist the amendment. First, although the sum of money involved for this group, &#163;3 million, is a modest sum in the context of government expenditure, although perhaps not by other standards, there is a real difficulty of ring fencing, as the noble Baroness must accept. One cannot seriously ring fence for attributable widows but not the other service widows who have suffered as great a loss. Therefore, the repercussions for them and, beyond that, for public service pensions are very considerable. That there may need to be a debate at some stage about public service pensions will be for your Lordships to determine in due course.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para5"></a>The second point I wish to make as regards war widows is that, given that the MoD is having its review, that it will be published this summer, and that there will be plenty of other opportunities for the noble Baroness to pursue her case--we are delighted that she will remain in your Lordships' House--I am sure that we shall revisit the issue. At that point, we should have behind us, or with us, the position of the MoD as reflected in the review, which may change the context.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para6"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness. I am sure that I speak for the entire House in expressing appreciation for the way in which she handled the issue. I do not <P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para8"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, in moving this Motion, I speak also to Motion 43J. I suggest that we discuss the two together. It is impossible for me to compete with the felicity of the compliments offered to the Minister and vice versa. I sat in awe listening to the gracious compliments passing back and forth and know that my comments are crude by comparison. I have enjoyed crossing swords with my noble friend Lady Hollis.

They were bad in principle and damaging in practice. But I am a political realist and, despite what my wife says, I am also a very reasonable man. Being so reasonable, I decided to make a concordat with the Government, despite the Chief Whip's icy stares at me, and I offered a reasonable compromise to the House.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para10"></a>Regrettably, the Government took a stony view of these realistic, honourable compromises and said, "Thank you, but no thank you". The compromise <P>


<a name="column_1328"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1328</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>amendments were therefore rejected in the other place, not in the House of Lords; and I greatly appreciated the support I received from all sides of the House for those amendments. But, equally, being realistic, I recognised that the Government's massive majority in the House of Commons meant that however enlightened the House of Lords was--and it was very enlightened by comparison with the Commons--in its judgment of the amendments, the Government, with their massive majority, would override them. And so they did.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para11"></a>We are now left with the regrettable--to put it mildly--government statement, "No compromise. Full stop". That is one of the worst phrases ever to emanate from 10 Downing Street, from where so many fine, splendid initiatives for disabled people have emerged. The Government have a wonderful record of helping disabled people and I have been more proud than anyone to advocate and support them. But they have blotted their copy book and spoiled the record with their provisions on incapacity benefit. When they say "No compromise. Full stop", I say that that is no way to conduct democratic discussions on an important issue affecting 310,000 severely disabled people.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para12"></a>Where do we now stand? The choice for helping disabled people on incapacity benefit is strictly limited, especially because so many supporters of the amendments on both sides of the House are away. Furthermore, a number of Peers have indicated to me that they are not prepared to vote. But there is scope for movement, so perhaps I may modestly offer further amendments.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para13"></a>They are, first, that the period when disabled people need to have worked and paid national insurance contributions to qualify should be not seven years but four. Secondly, the disregard should be not &#163;128 but &#163;100. That means that the level at which people start to lose incapacity benefit would be &#163;8,723 rather than the Government's figure of &#163;7,943 and that incapacity benefit would not be withdrawn until it was &#163;12,142 rather than the Government's &#163;11,362.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para14"></a>At that level of income those small amounts matter to poor people. That is why I am pressing these further amendments. If the Government tonight reject those very modest amendments, I believe they would damage themselves even further. I also believe that the Government will eventually regret that refusal. That is my modest judgment.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para15"></a>Secondly, I believe that these last amendments are the last chance for the Government to give any worthwhile concessions. We are very close to the wire tonight: this is a last chance. Next, this is a glorious opportunity for the Government to heal the breach with disabled people and the organisations representing disabled people. The breach is a very wide one--everyone is aware of that--and the Government can now move forward. I hope that they will.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para16"></a>The acceptance of these amendments would demonstrate the Government's willingness to listen and to respond. In a very curious way--I do not know how it has happened--this controversy has caught the <P>


<a name="column_1329"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1329</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>nation by the throat. It is remarkable how people's imagination has been stirred by the controversy in the House of Lords. The way these profound and fundamental controversies have been conducted is a credit to the House of Lords. The Government need to have regard for public opinion, because I believe that public opinion is with these amendments. I believe that public opinion is behind the House of Lords, and undoubtedly parliamentary opinion is behind the House of Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-16_para17"></a>So these amendments are offered in a really constructive spirit so that we may end this Bill on a happy, co-operative note. I suggest no vote this evening. We have had enough votes and I have explained why we do not want them. These amendments are put forward in a spirit of amity and constructive good will. I hope that my noble friends will be able to accept these amendments in the spirit of good will in which they are offered.

<A NAME="91109-17_spnew0"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Hear, hear!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-17_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, he has put before us a series of issues on which, whatever we may think about them, there was plainly a great debate to be had. That debate has been had and it does Parliament credit, but it is coming to a very sad end.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para0"></a>I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, said about voting, but nevertheless I very much hope that the Government will show a desire to co-operate by accepting the very modest amendment that he puts before us. Tonight, the issue has become bigger.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para1"></a>It has been my dubious privilege to listen to the Secretary of State addressing another place on the Motion to reject our amendments of yesterday. The Secretary of State did not address that Motion. He was called to order by the Chair for failure to address that Motion but, rather than going on to address it, he thereupon sat down. That does not suggest to me that the Secretary of State was full of arguments about the iniquity of the amendments put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke. The Secretary of State devoted his whole speech to the need to secure the passage of his Bill. He is perfectly entitled to want the passage of his Bill, and those who remember what I said yesterday--which is not that long ago after all--will remember that I was not attempting to obstruct the passage of that Bill.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para2"></a>What the Secretary of State said was that he was not prepared to consider any further concession or compromise whatsoever: that he would either give in or lose the Bill. That is a reaction which I described yesterday as "petulant". Having listened to him today, I do not believe that that description was inappropriate. The issue is now not merely the Bill, nor the Weatherill amendment--we can let that go if we must. It is not even the future of the next Session. The issue is nothing less than whether the Government do or do not want a bicameral Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-17_spnew2"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Rubbish!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-17_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   The noble Lords opposite say, "rubbish". That is not what they said before 1997. This House is supposed to be a revising Chamber. All governments while in office accept that, provided that we revise Bills only in the points that they want the Bills revised. Every government want their Bills revised when they believe that it is right for them to be changed. However, one does not actually have a revising Chamber unless it possesses sufficient bargaining power occasionally to induce governments to change things when they do not wish to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para3"></a>Of course, there is no question of the ultimate supremacy of another place. The Parliament Acts see to that, and it is quite right that they should. We on these Benches, of all people, are in no position to challenge that and have no wish to do so. However, before it comes to that point, it is as we see it only right that the Secretary of State's supremacy in the name of another place should be exercised not arbitrarily but according to rules.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para4"></a>According to those rules, there was still time for further proceedings in this Session. When we get onto numbers, as the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, has illustrated, there is always room for movement towards compromise. Compromise could have been had. If your Lordships look at the list of proposed forthcoming business, you will see that there was provision, if necessary, for proceedings as late as Friday. When the Secretary of State talks about the "death of the Bill", I am reminded of Mistress Quickly's remarks on the last days of Falstaff:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"So a'cried out 'God, God, God!' three or four times [and I said] I ... hoped there was no need to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-17_para5"></a>
The Secretary of State's comment was distinctly premature. It is a great contrast with a remark once made to me by a Minister in the previous Government. He said to me that all governments must bargain and compromise and that all governments must be defeated in the House of Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para6"></a>I took that not only for a piece of political wisdom, but as I had just that moment assisted in inflicting an embarrassing defeat on him in the Lobbies, I took it for a remarkable act of political generosity. It was a private remark, but as I had the Minister's permission to name him in this context and I have done so in print, I might as well do so here. It was the noble Earl, Lord Caithness. I should have liked to hear that note from a member of this Government. I have not yet done so. I <P>


<a name="column_1331"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1331</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do not withdraw what I said. The Ministers have made generous concessions for which I have thanked them, but they have not been prepared to go in for compromise at the point of the Division Lobby.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para7"></a>Before we move to stage two, there must be some serious thought about this issue. When the Government do not have, to coin a phrase, Dick Hereditary to kick around any more, they will have to rethink the purpose of this House. People will not come here for snobbery. They will not come here unless they have a decent job of work to do. They will not feel that they have a decent job of work to do unless occasionally they can change something. I come here because I know that perhaps once every two years I can change something which appears in legislation. Were we to have the arbitrary version of the supremacy of the other place taking over and should that cease to be true, I should begin to wonder what useful purpose I was serving by attending this House. I should regret that. Therefore, before we go into stage two, I believe that we must think about whether or not we want a revising Chamber which is capable of checking a government who do not want to be checked.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para8"></a>That is a constitutional issue. Now, it is being made a constitutional issue by the Secretary of State and I reply directly to what the Secretary of State has said. My views on the amendment are well known and they have not changed since yesterday. I have said that the question now is whether the Government want a two-Chamber Parliament. I do not know the answer to that question. Before the end of this debate I should be awfully glad if I did, but I do not expect miracles.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   My Lords, last night in this House I stressed the fundamental importance of testing the opinion of the other place on the fair and balanced compromises of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, with the Government's proposed cuts to incapacity benefit. I should like to pay tribute to the noble Lord, who has steadfastly campaigned with immeasurable integrity for the interests of disabled people throughout the United Kingdom. I pay tribute also to those Members of the other place who, equally steadfastly, continued to support the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley. I share his view that the government reforms to incapacity benefit are morally unacceptable. I support him in his continued opposition to them. As I explained to the House last night, his mandate--indeed, that of all of us who represent disabled people--derives from genuine representation of 8&#189; million disabled people across this country. That is indisputable, as is his argument for compromise on the disregard and taper affecting the means testing of incapacity benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para9"></a>The noble Lord has made it abundantly clear that his concessions seek to protect incapacity benefit claimants who are at the lower end of the income scale--at the poverty end. I for one make no apologies in supporting him in safeguarding their interests. The new amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, represent a somewhat diminished but still genuine <P>


<a name="column_1332"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1332</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>compromise towards effective targeting of resources to protect the poor. That is not an incapacity benefit free-for-all, as the Government seem to fear.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para10"></a>We have heard that the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, does not seek to divide the House tonight. If the Government's present figures for tapering of incapacity benefit remain on the face of the Bill, whichever government are in power after 2001 will find out the hard way about these clauses. The real statistics will emerge when the number of those condemned to a life on income support is revealed. That will be when the anxious letters which we have had in our postbags over the past few weeks and months become future case work for constituency representatives in another place. I am no Jeremiah but I suspect the worst, and I wish them well in their new role as Sisyphus.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-17_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, I acknowledge the unfailing courtesy of my noble friend Lady Hollis in her approach to all our debates on this Bill. She and all your Lordships will appreciate the depth of my interest in these amendments as the architect, 25 years ago, as the then Minister for Disabled People, of disability benefits affected by the Bill's provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para11"></a>While I know that we shall be repeatedly told, as we were again by the Secretary of State in another place this evening, that the amendments to the Bill approved by this House on 13th October led to marked improvements in the Government's original proposals on incapacity benefit, I am dismayed that we have not been able to do more. In these final moments of our consideration of the Bill it would be wrong and dishonourable not to say so, just as it would be wrong of anyone here to question the ultimate supremacy of the other place, in which I had the honour of serving for 33 years for the same Manchester constituency.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para12"></a>I hold it to be grossly unjust to cut the benefits of people who have been saving for a personal pension, week by week and from meagre wages for perhaps 30 years or more, by 50 per cent of any amount over &#163;85, and I believe that Parliament will come to regret its decision. For a disabled person who has saved for a personal pension of &#163;100, the loss will be a punishing and totally unmerited cut of &#163;7.50 per week. But a millionaire, living on dividends and bank interest and with no need of a personal pension, would suffer no cut in benefits.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para13"></a>It is wrong also to alter the contribution conditions for incapacity benefit in the way the Bill proposes and I am sure that this too will come to be strongly criticised by Parliament as it is already now by every major disability organisation in Britain. If private insurers altered benefits and rules of entitlement in the same way, they would be subjected to bitter public and parliamentary criticism. And I can see no justification for double standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-17_para14"></a>As I made clear to the House yesterday, I speak without animus in stating my objections to the Bill's provisions on incapacity benefit. At the same time I make plain my warm support for many features of the Bill. My sole purpose in acting as I have done has been <P>


<a name="column_1333"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1333</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to reduce the handicapping effects of their disabilities for people who deserve much better of Parliament than cuts in benefits and tougher entitlement conditions for help of crucial importance to their well-being.

If, in revenge, a mean-spirited Government were to refuse to accept the Weatherill amendment and all the hereditary Peers were to go, so be it. We should at least go with honour. But if, in order to save our puny skins, we did not vote against this mean legislation, it would be to our eternal shame.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I join with those who have paid tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, for the way in which he has pursued this matter. When we first discussed it I said that I believed the clauses we are seeking to amend were wrong in principle. Since then he has sought to move various amendments designed to achieve a compromise. That has been so again this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para0"></a>I believe that your Lordships' House was absolutely right yesterday to say that the House of Commons should have an opportunity not only of debating but of voting on the proposals he then made. When I raised this matter with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, yesterday, she replied:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"My Lords, if the other place had wanted these amendments, it could have voted down the Government's proposition and voted for the other amendments on the Order Paper put by Mr Roger Berry, which were basically the same as my noble friend's amendments. The other place chose not to do so. To suggest that the Commons had neither the wit nor the intelligence to see that strategy is ... condescending to Members of the other place. They knew what they were doing. It is an act of self-deception by your Lordships to suggest [otherwise]".--[Official Report, 8/11/99; col. 1208.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<A NAME = "91109-18_para1"></a><P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para2"></a>With great respect to the noble Baroness, they did not have an opportunity to vote until today. The guillotine Motion which the Government imposed in rather unusual terms prevented them from so doing. Therefore your Lordships were right yesterday to give the other place the opportunity to consider the amendments moved by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para3"></a>I felt it right to listen to the debates that took place as a result of that. In many ways it was an extraordinary debate this evening in another place. As the noble Earl, Lord Russell, rightly pointed out, the Secretary of State made no attempt whatever to address the amendments. His sole object appeared to be to say that the Bill was a good Bill and therefore it ought not to be opposed. That is common ground. The noble Lord, Lord Ashley, myself and others have all said that we do not wish to kill the Bill. But the fact that the Secretary of State put forward that argument in no way meant that there was not scope for improvement.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para4"></a>The reality is that these clauses are inconsistent with the Bill as a whole, particularly in relation to pensions. The Bill is largely designed to promote people taking <P>


<a name="column_1334"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1334</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>out pensions, but the clause before us from the Government means that if people in receipt of disability benefits take out a pension they will lose out. It is that inconsistency in government policy which is increasingly of concern to the House, not least in the light of developments since yesterday. We find more and more a tendency of the Government to means test--as they do in the clause we are now discussing--contributory benefits and not to means test benefits which are not contributory. We had an announcement this afternoon that there are to be free television licences for the over-75s--not means tested--whereas the people affected by these clauses will be means tested. Similarly, many of us in this House will receive cold weather fuel payments, not means tested, but the people affected by these amendments and these clauses will be means tested even though their incomes are likely to be a great deal lower than the incomes of those who receive cold weather or winter fuel payments.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para5"></a>The Government's policy on these issues has simply not been thought through. That is certainly so in relation to these clauses. Therefore I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, is right even at this late stage to suggest that the Government ought to come forward and accept his amendments. Of course I made it clear yesterday and I do so again that at the end of the day it is a matter for the House of Commons to decide. But it is right that we should give them the opportunity of thinking again on these important issues which will affect the disabled, including those who by any standards cannot be regarded as rich.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para6"></a>We wish to reach a conclusion on this matter. It is a matter for the Commons ultimately to decide. The noble Lord, Lord Ashley, is right, in putting forward his amendments this evening, to say that it would be inappropriate to vote on them. I share that view. I made that clear in my remarks yesterday. But I remain puzzled--the sums involved in these amendments are not enormous compared with the kind of figures the Chancellor of the Exchequer was discussing this afternoon--as to why the Government should decide to penalise this particularly disadvantaged group in the way they have in this Bill. Even at this late stage perhaps one may hope that they will be prepared to accept the latest suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Ashley. If not, then those who have said that the Government will live to regret this are right. It will be shown, against the spin-doctoring statements on the need to help the old, the pensioners, the disabled, the bereaved and so forth, that the reality of the situation is that they should be judged not by what they say, but by what they do. What they are doing in these clauses is wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-18_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, perhaps the House will allow me to make a brief point. It is extremely important for us to recognise that when we voted yesterday--indeed, whenever we vote in this House--it is irrelevant whether we are hereditary Peers or life Peers. In fact, as I understand, even had the hereditary Peers not voted yesterday, the noble Lords, Lord Ashley and Lord Morris of Manchester, would have won. It is very important that we should <P>


<a name="column_1335"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1335</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>regard ourselves as Peers; we are all the same. We vote on the merits of the case. It is most important for us to continue to be seen as doing so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may begin my remarks by saying that, despite the great respect and affection that I and the Government hold for my noble friend Lord Ashley, we cannot accept his amendments tonight. Before I respond, perhaps I may correct something I said last night. I attributed to my noble friend Lord Morris remarks about the incapacity benefit caseload, which were in fact made by my noble friend Lord Ashley. The names got transposed. However, as my noble friends are such solid friends, I know that they will both treat this as a tribute to each other.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para7"></a>Noble Lords will recall that we had a lengthy debate on these amendments yesterday. The House was then concerned that those in the other place had not had sufficient opportunity to express their views on my noble friend's proposals; indeed, that was the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. As your Lordships accept, the other place has now had a chance to debate and vote on similar amendments put forward by my noble friend. Those amendments were defeated today by 314 votes to 234. So those amendments were given full exposure. At that point, the other place chose to support the proposals put forward by the Government. I suggest to your Lordships that it is now time for this House to accept the views of the elected Chamber.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para8"></a>We have made it clear all along that we believe that incapacity benefit needs to be reformed: the debate between us is in what way that should happen and the degree to which it should be accepted, whether along the lines proposed by my noble friend or by way of the Government's proposals. I believe that the Government's proposals strike the right balance.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para9"></a>Many noble Lords tonight have talked as though, somehow, there has been no compromise and have suggested that the only person offering compromise has been my noble friend Lord Ashley. That is simply not true. Perhaps I may remind your Lordships--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-18_spnew3"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I should like to put the record straight. I did not say that there had been no compromise in the past. I said that the Secretary of State had ceased dialogue at the present time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, compromising stops at a certain point and you then have an agreed or defined position. The noble Earl, Lord Russell, seems to believe that whenever a compromise has been offered, you then restart the process and negotiate another one. This then continues through the Division Lobbies, incrementally, salami slice after salami slice, as though, somehow, the right and proper way for a government to determine public policy is by haggling in the Division Lobbies, without consideration either to the prudent use of public finances or to the proper read-across to other government policies. We do not believe that that is the right way to proceed.
<P>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1336</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para10"></a>I return to the charge from my noble friend Lord Ashley--not that made by the noble Earl, Lord Russell--that our changes have been hopelessly inadequate. They have not. We have made it clear all along that existing claimants will be protected. Indeed, despite some myths to the contrary, there was never any question of taking away benefit from people already receiving it. On the measure to reduce the overlap between IB and early retirement income, we have now made it clear that no one with a private pension of less than &#163;85 a week, not &#163;50, will be affected. Further, as a result of pressure, partly from your Lordships' House, we are exempting altogether people with the most severe disabilities from any of the effects of these tapers.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para11"></a>I turn now to the second part of my noble friend's amendments dealing with the contribution conditions. We have addressed concerns that the original proposal would hit people with limited employment prospects by extending the qualifying test from two years to three years and by extending the protection that we are giving to former carers to people on disabled person's tax credit. So let there be no talk that the Government have neither listened nor compromised. We have. Reducing the numbers as a result of our compromises has taken something like 100,000 people out of the reach of the Government's original proposals and reduced the savings by over &#163;200 million. This is a significant movement, significant compromise, significant concession and I think that the Government are entitled to some credit for having listened to views, including the views of your Lordships' House, and responded to them.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Rix, said that he felt that in 2001 more people would be coming on to income support as a result of our changes and that as a result the Government would live to rue this day. Of all the people in your Lordships' House tonight the one person who should know that there will be fewer people on income support as a result of what the Government have done is the noble Lord, Lord Rix. Who are the main beneficiaries of the changes among disabled people? They are those same children and young people who have perhaps been born with a disability--it may be Down's syndrome, severe learning difficulty or cerebral palsy--who at the moment "bump along" on income support with never a chance to enter the labour market and never a chance to build up savings. These are the people--the poorest and the most severely disabled--who under the Government's Bill will no longer have to "bump along" on income support but will be passported onto incapacity benefit to the credit of an extra &#163;26 a week.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-18_para13"></a>I hope that my noble friend will acknowledge--I refer to the noble Lord as I would not like to call him my noble friend--that we are doing exactly what he would wish us to do and exactly the opposite of what he fears we are doing. We are helping those on income support to come off it and onto IB.

<a name="column_1337"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1337</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>done so consistently through every single debate on incapacity benefit. I have said all along that young people with a learning disability in particular would benefit from the changes in this Bill, as will, I hope, widows benefit from changes to SERPS in this Bill. However, I must point out that many people who will seek incapacity benefit in the future are older people who will become ill, perhaps with multiple sclerosis, ME, or other conditions which will greatly reduce their earning capacity as the years go on. Furthermore, they may have small pensions and their incapacity benefit will be tapered rapidly after that time. Those people will eventually suffer from the clauses in this Bill; not the young people with a learning disability but people who become ill and disabled in their thirties and forties.

I do not want to take up your Lordships' time by taking the noble Lord through the changes that relate to DPTC for those people below the lower earnings limit and those people with progressive illnesses. We have addressed those matters in debate. I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Rix, that he has perhaps misunderstood the impact of the Government's proposals together with the changes the Government have made in response to some of the fears he has expressed. His fears in this respect are groundless.

<A NAME = "91109-19_para0"></a>As I say, we have moved considerably on this matter. The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, emphasised that the Government were increasing means testing. That is a bit rich when in 1979 when the noble Lord's party was in government something like 13 per cent of social security was means tested and in 1997 the figure was something like 34 per cent. If any government has moved away from contributory benefits to means testing, it was the previous administration. Under this administration the amount of benefits being means tested has fallen, mainly because the Government have expanded access to non-contributory, non-means tested benefits. In this Bill the contributory principle is being extended to widowers for the first time. Therefore, I hope that in the light of those comments the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, will reflect that perhaps his fear, too, is groundless.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-19_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. The point I was making concerned the inconsistency of government policy in relation to these amendments. These amendments extend means testing to particular disadvantaged groups. But at the same time the Government are spending money in areas where people are not means tested on a substantial scale. We are getting government by sound-bite as regards that particular concession while overlooking the inconsistency in the clauses that we have before us this evening and the way in which the Government are approaching policy generally.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-19_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, that comes from the Opposition Front Bench which was <P>


<a name="column_1338"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1338</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>responsible for reducing unemployment benefit from a contributory benefit of 12 months to six months and, what is more, tapering it out when an occupational pension was &#163;50.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-19_para1"></a>As regards the second point raised by the noble Lord that we are extending television licences without means testing, is he seriously saying that we should be means testing the rights of people to have free television licences if they are over 75 years of age? I did not hear that from the Front Bench when I was in the Gallery today. I did not hear Mr. Willetts ask whether he had permission to say that the position of the Tory Front Bench is now that one should means test pensioners before they have a winter fuel payment or free television licences. Is it now the policy of the Opposition Front Bench that pensioners should be means tested if the Labour Party proposes it, but they should not be if the Tory party proposes it? I suggest that the noble Lord opposite offers some consistency in his arguments tonight.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, with great respect to the noble Baroness, that is not the argument. We understand what is being done as regards the benefits to which she has just referred. But the Government are means testing people who are on disability benefit. That is what we are debating this evening, not what happened in the past. The amendment before us means tests people who have an occupational pension and that is wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I have the greatest respect for the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, but his position on the Front Bench seems to be to own up to nothing that was done by the previous administration since he was last a Minister under the Heath government. I suggest that he takes some collective responsibility for the things done by the previous government rather than making charges against us which are ill-founded.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-19_para2"></a>I am sure that the House would wish me to return to the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Ashley. We still believe that our proposals and not those of my noble friend--

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Rix: </B>   My Lords, I am sorry to return to this matter. In the debate last night in this House the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, quoted figures showing that there are 310,000 poor people likely to be affected by loss of incapacity benefit. That is the figure I was proposing to carry forward to the year 2001--people who may eventually require income support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-19_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am absolutely baffled by what the noble Lord, Lord Rix, has said. The people affected by the government changes are those who have an occupational pension well above the income support rates together with IB which will taper out for most of them at somewhere between &#163;12,000 and &#163;14,000 according to family circumstances. Income support is simply irrelevant to the argument. If a person has the kind of occupational pension we are talking about, 90 per cent of those on <P>


<a name="column_1339"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column 1339</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>incapacity benefit will not be affected by the government changes because either they have no occupational pension or only a very modest one. The only people affected are those with an occupational pension of &#163;85 or more. At that point the taper begins. That is already floating them above income support levels as a single person. I repeat that the fears of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, are groundless. I believe he misunderstands the relationship between income support, occupational pensions and incapacity benefit.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-19_para3"></a>As regards the government amendments, we are exempting a further 120,000 people, which is the nature of our change. But tonight we are not really talking about numbers. We are discussing whether this Bill should be delayed still further as compromises go to and from the other place. My noble friend has suggested that perhaps the other place should be given yet another opportunity to consider yet another amendment or, to quote the noble Earl, Lord Russell, there is still time for further movement. I point out to him that through a succession of three votes the number of Labour rebels in the Commons has fallen progressively from 67 to 53 and then to 42 and the Government's majority has risen progressively from 40 to 60 and then to 80.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-19_para4"></a>Let us be clear: the House of Commons is content with the Government's position and has made its contentment clear on three occasions. I suggest to your Lordships that it is now quite clear that any amendments--new amendments, repeated amendments, fresh amendments, discovered amendments--will not reduce the Government's majority; on that pattern, they will probably increase it.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-19_para5"></a>I repeat what my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has said on many occasions, including today: there are no further concessions. The Government have compromised; the Government have moved; the Government have listened; and this is the Government's position. I gently suggest to your Lordships that we should not delay proceedings any further; delay will not extract anything further for disabled people.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-19_para6"></a>To repeat, this is a good Bill. We have listened and we have moved on disability benefits. In addition we are also producing the opportunity for stakeholder pensions for 5 million people for the first time. We are setting up the new ONE service, which will bring opportunities for work and employment to some of the most marginal people in our society. We are extending bereavement allowances to widowers for the first time alongside widows. Above all--this is something that is very dear to my heart and, I know, to your Lordships--we are putting pension sharing on divorce on a statutory basis. Each year, as women and men together face the tragedy of divorce, they will at least know that they will have a fairer disposition of marital assets. We fought for this in opposition--all of us around the House fought for this in opposition. The great lady Nancy Seear was one of those who led us. I am delighted to see it in the Bill now.

<A NAME = "91109-19_para7"></a>This is a good Bill. It helps women, it helps the low paid, it helps those who are most severely disabled, it helps the poorest disabled, it helps women facing divorce, it helps men facing bereavement. We have discussed this; the Commons has considered it; I know that my noble friend is not pressing his Motion to the vote. I would, therefore, urge your Lordships, with good grace and generosity, to move the Bill on and send it forward to Royal Assent.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lady Hollis has raised 100 Aunt Sallys. It would be my joy and pleasure to knock all of them down. But my judgment now is that enough is enough.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-19_para8"></a>None the less, my noble friend yesterday had the opportunity to reply to the fundamental and important issues raised in debate by many speakers. She failed to do so. Anyone who doubts that statement can read Hansard. Many of the fundamental issues raised in the debate yesterday by most of the speakers were not answered by my noble friend. She has made a good fist of trying to respond to several of the issues tonight, but yesterday was her chance to give answers so that we could take them into account. She failed to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-19_para9"></a>As I say, enough is enough. To me, her answer has been disappointing. I believe that my noble friend Lady Hollis and the Government as a whole are compounding their failure, their political miscalculation, by saying "No, no, no, no". We saw it in detail with the so-called concessions yesterday. We explained how inadequate they were--and now my noble friend has repeated them again and again and again. We spoke about the figures yesterday and proved how inconsequential they were. But she raised them again and again and again. However, I do not propose to go into them now.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109-19_para10"></a>All I now wish to do is to say thank you very much indeed to all the speakers--including especially my real friend, my noble friend Lady Hollis, with whom it has been a genuine pleasure to work.

<A NAME = "91109-19_para12"></a>Before I speak to this Motion I cannot resist the opportunity to pay a tribute to my noble friend Lord Ashley. I know he recognises that the Government's position is different from his own, but he has fought a gallant and generous-spirited campaign on behalf of disabled people as he sees it. We agree to disagree but I am sure that your Lordships will join with me in recognising the spirit in which he has conducted that fight.

The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will submit two memoranda to the FAC. The first is a history of the crisis in Kosovo in 1998-99 and of the background to it. The second deals with lessons learned and implications for future policy. The Ministry of Defence are also providing a memorandum for the HCDC on military aspects of the crisis and lessons learned.

In the light of the other provisions of the Outer Space Treaty, particularly Article I, the generally accepted view is that outer space is res communis like the high seas.

Since the dialogue began there have been significant moves by the Chinese Government, including the signatures of the International Covenants on Civil and Political Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the visit to Peking and Tibet in September 1998 by Mary Robinson, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.

Each OSCE participating state is free to raise any issue it sees fit during its plenary address.

<A NAME = "91109w03_para8"></a>The sanctions that can be applied to claims, which take the form either of reductions in payments or of administrative penalties, are laid down in the EU IACS legislation. If farmers wish to seek redress against sanctions, they may appeal directly to their RSC to senior officials or through their Member of Parliament to Ministers, or apply for a judicial review of the Ministry's decision. If they feel that their case has not been properly administered, they can ask their MP to raise it with the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.

<A NAME="91109w04_wqn0"></A><B> Earl Russell </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether women's refuges are classified as "hostels" within the meaning of the Housing Benefit (General) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations (S.I. 2401/1999).[HL4520]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109w04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Social Security  (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  Some women's refuges will fall within the definition of "hostels" within the meaning of the Housing Benefit (General) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1999.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109w04_para0"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to make it easier for rough sleepers to gain access to hostel accommodation and to claim Housing Benefit. Many people in this position have drug, alcohol or mental health problems and are not in a position to supply a National Insurance number or sufficient information for one to be traced in support of their benefit claim. The amendment therefore underpins our commitment to reduce rough sleeping.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109w04_para1"></a>Women entering refuges should be able to supply such information even if they have left their home without being able to remove any personal possessions. Women entering refuges that do not fall within the definition of "hostels" should not, therefore, be disadvantaged.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109w04_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Under the Government's original proposals for taking some account of occupational and personal pensions in Incapacity Benefit, it was estimated that benefit expenditure would be reduced by &#163;45 million in Year 1, &#163;120 million in Year 2, &#163;190 million in Year 3 and &#163;550 million in Year 10 (net of tax &#163;40 million, &#163;100 million, &#163;150 million and &#163;410 million respectively). Revised savings esitmates are now &#163;25 million in Year  1, &#163;75 million in Year 2, &#163;120 million in Year 3 and &#163;330 million in Year 10 (net of tax &#163;25 million, &#163;60  million, &#163;90 million and &#163;260 million respectively). These estimates take into account both the exemption of people receiving the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance, and the increase from &#163;50 a week to &#163;85 a week in the threshold above which pensions begin to be taken into account for other recipients. Within this, the reduction in savings as a result of the Disability Living Allowance exemption is about &#163;5 million in the first two years, &#163;10 million in year 3 and &#163;20 million in Year 10.

<A NAME="91109w04_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Rix </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
 
<P>
<UL>What are the savings to public funds as a result of tax liability from substituting Incapacity Benefit for Severe Disablement Allowance for severely disabled people under the age of 25.[HL4342]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="91109w04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Under the proposals in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, people disabled before the age of 20 (or 25 in some cases) will in future be able to receive Incapacity Benefit, at a long-term rate more than &#163;26 a week higher than the rate of Severe Disablement Allowance. The cost of extending Incapacity Benefit to this group is estimated at &#163;180  million in the long-term.
<P>

<A NAME = "91109w04_para2"></a>Incapacity Benefit is taxable, whereas Severe Disablement Allowance is not, but the available data on Severe Disablement Allowance recipients aged under 25 suggests that the great majority have no income other than benefits. Since the relevant rate of Incapacity Benefit is less than the single person's allowance, most young people who become entitled to Incapacity Benefit in future will not be liable to pay tax. The tax revenue from this measure would therefore be minimal; less than &#163;100,000 per year in the short term. There are insufficient data to support a long-term estimate.

<A NAME="91109w04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:  </B>  Subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimates for Class II, Votes 1 and 2, the Department of Health Departmental Expenditure Limit for 1999-2000 will be increased by &#163;109,984,000 from &#163;40,345,035,000 to &#163;40,455,019,000. The increase is the net effect of changes to Class II, Vote 1 (Hospital, community health, family health and related services, England) of &#163;207,861,000 made up of &#163;114,058,000 in respect of the take-up of end year flexibility as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 27 July (Official Report, col. 393) and &#163;100,000,000 for the take-up of departmental unallocated provision. In addition the following transfers will take place; &#163;1,177,000 from Scotland (&#163;47,000 for the High Security Infectious Diseases Unit and &#163;1,130,000 for out-of-area treatments); &#163;877,000 from Wales for out-of-area treatments and &#163;7,464,000 from Class II, Vote 2 (Department of Health, administration, miscellaneous health and personal social services, England) (&#163;662,000 for the Public Health Development Fund and &#163;802,000 for regional professional development projects).

<P>
<A NAME="91109w04_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister for Science, Department of Trade and Industry  (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  In the case of beef hormones the Appellate Body commented on the relationship of the precautionary principle to the WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) in the following terms:
<P>

<A NAME = "91109w04_para7"></a>"First, the principle has not been written into the SPS Agreement as ground for justifying SPS measures that are otherwise inconsistent with the obligations of Members set out in particular provisions of that Agreement. Secondly, the precautionary principle indeed finds reflection in Article 5.7 of the SPS Agreement. We agree, at the same time, with the European Communities, that there is no need to assume that Article 5.7 exhausts the relevance of a precautionary principle. It is reflected also in the sixth paragraph of the preamble and in Article 3.3. These explicitly recognise the rights of Members to establish their own appropriate level of sanitary protection, <P>


<a name="column_WA149"></a>

<B>9 Nov 1999 : Column WA149</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which level may be higher (i.e. more cautious) that that implied in existing international standards, guidelines and recommendations. Thirdly, a panel charged with determining, for instance, whether "sufficient scientific evidence" exists to warrant the maintenance by a Member of a particular SPS measure may, of course, and should, bear in mind that responsible, representative governments commonly act from perspectives of prudence and precaution where risks of irreversible, e.g. life-terminating, damage to human health are concerned. Lastly, however, the precautionary principle does not, by itself, and without a clear textual directive to that effect, relieve a panel from the duty of applying the normal (i.e. customary international law) principles of treaty interpretation in reading the provisions of the SPS Agreement. (Paragraph 124 Appellate Body Report)".
<P>

<A NAME = "91109w04_para8"></a>This ruling gives the current Appellate Body interpretation, and does not imply that the Appellate Body interprets the precautionary principle as requiring evidence of certainty of harm, nor does it imply that the Appellate Body is adducing "absence of evidence of risk" as "evidence of absence of risk". The European Community is bound by virtue of its membership of the WTO to comply with rulings of the WTO Appellate Body and to bring any measures which are found to be WTO incompatible into line. It is not therefore possible for the European Community to reject the Appellate Body's rulings.
