<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spopq0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What progress they have made on policy for the Children's Fund.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Education and Skills   (Baroness Ashton of Upholland): </B>  My Lords, I am pleased to report that we are making good progress on the Children's Fund. The first wave of areas, which includes some of the most deprived communities in England, is beginning to implement increased and better co-ordinated services for children at risk of social exclusion. Second-wave areas have now submitted their proposals, and we are on course for the Children's Fund to reach all parts of England by 2003-04.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Andrews: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that helpful Answer. It is good to know that the Children's Fund is beginning to reach the children at risk for whom it was intended.
<P>

<a name="20321-01_para0"></a>My concern is that services for disadvantaged children must be carefully co-ordinated. I would be grateful if the Minister could say what contribution the Children's Fund is making to a more coherent provision. Is the Children and Young People's Unit beginning to make progress in joining up services?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the Children and Young People's Unit is leading the development of an overarching strategy for children and young people. The unit has consulted widely on a document setting out, for the first time, our vision for all children in the country. The overarching strategy sets out that vision and the principles that, we believe, should apply to all government services. It proposes six key outcomes: health and well-being; achievement and enjoyment; participation and citizenship; protection; responsibility; and inclusion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that children in the age range covered by the Children's Fund&#151;5 to 13&#151;and younger children are most vulnerable to physical abuse? How much of the Children's Fund has gone&#151;and is intended to go&#151;into parenting education, including the teaching of disciplining strategies other than physical abuse, so that the repetitive cycle of abuse can be broken?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the proposals for the Children's Fund are worked out by <P>


<a name="column_1464"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1464</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>local partnerships, as the noble Baroness will know. As for the way in which the money is distributed, it is for local partnerships to come together and build on existing services to develop the strategies that are most applicable to their communities. I cannot give the noble Baroness details of a specific amount of money, but I can point her to the way in which partnerships are developing services to ensure that children are less vulnerable.
<P>

<a name="20321-01_para1"></a>The process is geared towards protecting children, by recognising when children are about to be at risk and intervening with children and their families as early as possible, to make sure that they remain safe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that a great deal of the money&#151;&#163;450 million over three years&#151;is being dissipated by the bureaucracy in the bidding process for securing money at local level? That &#163;450 million is yet more money that is being held back at the centre and not going in at school level.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the figure that I have is &#163;380 million, available over three years. That money is available to the partnerships, and those partnerships will involve the work that goes on in schools. I disagree with the noble Baroness's claim that the money is being used in a way other than being given to schools.
<P>

<a name="20321-01_para2"></a>It is important that the money that is built into the services is used to bring together health, social care and education services. For the children concerned, it is crucial that we have integration, early intervention and early recognition. That is a fundamental part of what the Children's Fund is attempting to do. The money is reaching the partnerships; they are coming forward in three waves, and money has gone out, in order to ensure that we achieve the fund's objectives.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Pitkeathley: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say what use is made of the Children's Fund by children with disabilities and their families? I am sure that she will agree that they are a particularly disadvantaged group.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I am happy to do so. Children's Fund partnerships are required to carry out an analysis of the need for and gaps in preventive services for children in their area. It must focus on children who are at risk of social exclusion. I understand that a substantial number has identified children with disabilities as a particular priority group in the development of Children's Fund work. There are examples of that in Bristol, Bradford and Birmingham.
<P>

<a name="20321-01_para3"></a>Among the services that are being developed are services that are designed to provide additional support directly in schools&#151;that is also relevant to the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch&#151;as well as improving access to leisure and cultural activities, additional family support and information services.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Minister say how many partnerships are now in operation and how much money has, so far, been distributed to the partnerships or through them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has not missed anything; I had not given those figures. There are 40 partnerships in operation in the first wave. We plan to cover all local authority areas by 2003-04. The average allocation is about &#163;1 million. The largest allocation has been given to Birmingham, which has received about &#163;6 million.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend the Minister say whether young people have been consulted, as part of the consultation process for partnerships?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, young people and children have been involved in several ways. Some partnerships have employed participation workers specifically to make sure that they work with children. Other ways have been developed, including fun days for children, festivals, theatre groups and music and talent shows. In some areas, young people are directly involved in steering groups. In some cases, young people have been included in the process of recruiting staff. Young people are involved in various ways.

<A NAME="20321-01_spopq1"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Why they have reversed their previous policy of seeking to minimise the exclusion from school of disruptive pupils.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, we have not reversed our policy on exclusions. We no longer have targets for permanent exclusions, but our revised draft guidance restates that, in most cases, before excluding a pupil, a range of alternative strategies should have been tried. However, some incidents may be so serious that permanent exclusion may be appropriate for a first or one-off offence. The new guidance helps to ensure that a balanced approach is taken on this issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply and am reassured by what she had to say. Does she agree that, at a time when there is concern about rising street crime, it is extremely important that we make sure that young people who are excluded from school&#151;who often come from deeply disturbed backgrounds&#151;are given the chance to have full-time schooling and are not just put into units where they are, perhaps, given only two or three hours' education a week?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I agree entirely. We must strike a balance between ensuring that children who can be educated in mainstream education are educated in that way and recognising that, for some children, that is impossible. From September, we will work towards the position in which full-time education will be provided for all children who are excluded. The most important part of the strategy, in many ways, is preventing children getting to the stage at which they are excluded.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that, in the autumn, we would be working towards a position where we would get all children who are excluded into full-time education. I thought that we had been working towards that for some years. Can she tell us what effective steps have already been taken and what proportion of excluded children are still free to roam the streets without supervision?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-01_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, let me make it clear that by September 2002 we expect all children who have been excluded to be in full-time education. We have made that commitment. We are working with local education authorities to ensure that they have the right kind of provision. Noble Lords will be aware that for some children the appropriate provision will be pupil referral units, with the anticipation that children will move back into full-time education. For others it may be simply a different school, with additional support. For yet others, it may the provision of other kinds of educational support. It is a broad range. I did not wish to give the impression that we have not arrived at that point, but rather that we are ensuring that we have in place the breadth of provision that is needed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Baroness agree&#151;from what I know of the noble Baroness, I am sure she will agree&#151;that a particular problem with regard to disruption in the classroom is that occasioned by young people with autistic spectrum disorder? That very often results in disruption in the classroom. What is really needed is more screening and earlier intervention so that such children are not simply dubbed as disruptive and then left to the devices of a pupil referral unit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I could not agree more with the noble Baroness. It is absolutely right and proper to ensure that children with special educational needs are identified early, that support is provided for them within the classroom and that the right kind of support is provided for teachers so that they understand the needs of such children. We also need to ensure that, by working together, those children can enjoy a happy and fulfilling life at school and thus are able to remain in mainstream schooling, where that is appropriate for them, throughout their education.

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that one of the most difficult problems, if not the most difficult problem, for teachers is that of dealing with disruptive children? It may well be&#151;I am sure my noble friend will agree&#151;that exclusion should be used in certain circumstances and for a certain time. Is any research being done and training given to overcome the increasingly difficult problem of dealing with disruptive children?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, we are very concerned about disruption in schools. Within the department I chair a group which is looking specifically at behavioural issues. We are working with colleagues across departments, particularly those in educational psychology and those from the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Unit at the Department of Health, in order to achieve solutions.
<P>

<a name="20321-02_para0"></a>It is worth saying to my noble friend that we are also interested in looking at those schools which have been very successful at ensuring that children are not excluded through working with, for example, learning support mentors and establishing learning support units on site. We are developing a range of strategies which will enable our children to be in mainstream schools, while also supporting our teachers, for whom this is a serious issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Pilkington of Oxenford: </B>   My Lords, in view of recent press reports, has the Minister paid attention to what teachers have to face in the classroom when dealing with disruptive children? There are times when children need to be referred to pupil referral units, but I gather that the units in East London are small. I speak from anecdotal evidence, but I understand that in Hackney and Tower Hamlets, there are hardly any such units. How are teachers to deal with pupils who curse and defy them when all they can do is to refer them for counselling and so forth? Attention must be given to providing sufficient referral units, and after that of course bringing children back into the mainstream. Can the Minister tell the House what attention is being given to the provision of referral units?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for his questions. We are ensuring that we have on the ground in local education authorities the right breadth of provision and support for students. Pupil referral units are an important part of that provision. We are ensuring, through the allocation of resources, that we do have in place the right level of support for young people.
<P>

<a name="20321-02_para1"></a>However, this problem also concerns preventive measures in the classroom. It is about ensuring that our children receive the right kind of support and, I would argue, it is about parental involvement. We must ensure that parents work with schools, that they send the right messages to their young children about the role of schools, that they work with teachers and are seen to be supportive and respectful of schools.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Walmsley: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister confirm that learning support units in schools, to which she referred in an earlier answer, often provide an easier route back into the mainstream after a temporary exclusion has been, it is hoped, successful? Can she tell the House a little about the balance between the two? Are learning support units always the first recourse, with exclusion units being the last recourse for children who cause disruption in the classroom?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, the answer to the noble Baroness's question depends partly on what resources a particular local education authority has put in place. We believe that learning support units are making a big difference and we are particularly interested in their work in inner-city schools. However, they are not yet in place everywhere and so they will not be available for every school.
<P>

<a name="20321-02_para2"></a>However, decisions also depend on the reason for the exclusion. I think that noble Lords would agree that, wherever possible, we want those children who come out of mainstream education and into a unit to be able to return to school in due course. That also applies to special schools when considering behavioural issues in children. Among their criteria for success is the number of children they are able to reintegrate into mainstream education.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has told us that the Government have abandoned a system of targets in relation to children excluded from school. Does the Minister agree that that system has proved totally unsuitable? In certain areas of activity, targets can be really very damaging to the work of professionals on the ground. Will she agree to bring to the attention of her right honourable friend that there are other areas in education where targets might well be damaging and, indeed, other areas in government, such as the National Health Service? It is only too easy to set targets and think that one is managing from the centre, but they can do a great deal of damage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Ashton of Upholland: </B>   My Lords, noble Lords will know that I have been on the receiving end of many targets in the course of my professional life. I have to say that targets play an important role in ensuring not least that the Government do what they say they will do. Noble Lords in this House will certainly ensure that the Government report back on the targets they have set. Indeed, for many organisations, including schools and&#151;if I may trespass into another area of public sector life&#151;the health service, it is important that we set ourselves the right kind of targets. With regard to education, we are discussing here the one chance that young people have to receive a good education. I think that we should set targets for ourselves.

<P>
<UL>How much the National Health Service has paid out in early retirement costs and compensation payments for those forced to leave their jobs due to latex-related allergies.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  My Lords, information on the costs of early retirement or compensation payments due to specific medical conditions is not available centrally, although the extra cost of retirement through ill health in the NHS has been calculated at &#163;60,000 per employee retired. Of the 4,482 staff who left the service on grounds of ill health during 2000-01, some 1.7 per cent were due to skin allergies, some of which may have been attributable to latex.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Is he aware that many workers in the health service are extremely worried about latex allergies? It is not only a question of latex gloves, but also of the latex used in many other areas of a hospital. Does he agree that, since alternative materials are available&#151;for example, for latex gloves&#151;it would be wise for hospitals to provide such alternatives for those workers who are worried about exposure to latex? To inform the House, I should say that latex can cause skin disease, but it can also trigger conditions such as asthma and other respiratory problems.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend is right to suggest that latex is a sensitiser and that it can pose some risk to NHS staff. However, that risk is posed to only a minority. I should also say to my noble friend that some of the alternatives to latex products also contain chemicals which can cause allergic reactions in both staff and patients. The European Commission working group on latex is confident that the current directive provides sufficient protection for patients and staff if it is fully and properly implemented. However, in the light of the Question put by my noble friend and the concerns that she has expressed, the Government are announcing today their intention to reissue guidance to the NHS, thus drawing employers' attention to the problem and to the alternatives to latex that are now available. The guidance stresses the need for staff and management to work together to assess the risks in each case.

<P>
<P>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1470</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>central action in the health service. A central purchasing agency making decisions at central government level provides the option for the NHS to enter individual contracts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Pitkeathley: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend ensure that when the alternatives are available they will be offered also to patients' visitors? In cases where people are being barrier nursed, visitors have to put on gloves and aprons.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   My Lords, that is a very useful suggestion. It is one of the considerations that local employers should take into account when implementing the guidance that we issue to the NHS and in developing a risk assessment strategy.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, Post Office Limited is undertaking a programme of cash machine installation with a view to installing 3,000 machines at post offices by the end of 2002. These machines are being provided as an additional service available at some post offices to enable customers to withdraw money from their bank accounts. Wherever possible, the Post Office seeks to arrange for cash machine transactions at post offices to be free of charge. However, in some locations it would not be financially viable to install a machine without a charge being made.
<P>

<a name="20321-03_para0"></a>This programme is separate from arrangements for universal banking services, which will enable all those who wish to do so to continue to be able to collect their benefits in cash at post offices.

<FONT SIZE=3>machines in some post offices have been part of a transaction to sell off a major part of the Post Office&#151;a transaction which has recently fallen through? Can the Minister tell the House whether or not there have been recent negotiations to sell off a major part of the Post Office to an overseas buyer? A "yes" or "no" answer will suffice.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the supplementary question is rather different from the Question on the Order Paper. I have heard of no such suggestion. If one looks at the financing of the rural postal network, not many people would be in the business of buying it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Greengross: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that some of our poorest citizens live in rural areas and that many of our rural post offices and sub-post offices are disappearing? If you are able to draw out only &#163;10 or &#163;20 at a time, &#163;1.25 in charges is a substantial amount. Elderly and disabled people cannot always get to the nearest supermarket in order to benefit from cash-back schemes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I had hoped that I had made the point that this is an additional service. As is common across the whole of the commercial world, where there is a large through-put of people the service is provided free. But where it cannot be justified on that basis, charges are made. In such circumstances, part of the charge will go to the postmaster or postmistress. It is an additional service which can only add to customer facilities. In that sense, it is a commercial decision for the Post Office to take.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Razzall: </B>   My Lords, notwithstanding the announcement that he made last year, to a fanfare of musical trumpets, of the subsidy proposals to help rural post offices, does the Minister accept that the deterioration in the rural post office network has continued rapidly since that announcement? Does he further accept that unless the Government's proposals are accelerated there will hardly be a rural postal network left?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the situation is not as the noble Lord suggests. There has been a slowing down of the closure of rural post offices, but we should not be too optimistic about that because special factors are involved. As to the question of subsidies, which arose from the PRU report, it was always made clear that they were to deal with the transitional arrangements until 2003 when ACT is due to come in.

<A NAME="20321-03_spnew11"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   My Lords, does not the Minister think it slightly unfair that post offices which have a relatively large through-put will not need to charge anything, and yet post offices in the rural areas, which are more necessary but have fewer people to look after, will nevertheless charge? One would have thought that it is those people who should not be charged.

<FONT SIZE=3>transactions where there is a small through-put the charges are higher. This is a commercial facility provided by the Post Office. It is common across the country that where there is a small through-put for cash machines which are provided on, essentially, a convenience basis, charges have to be made. Otherwise, there would be no service at all.

<A NAME="20321-03_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Clarke of Hampstead: </B>   My Lords, before I ask my question, I should like to place on record my delight that my noble friend has given an unequivocal answer to the suggestion that a part of the Post Office was going to be sold off to a foreign competitor. It was a rumour that was going around last weekend and I am delighted that he has been able to say that no such negotiations were known to him. I am also pleased that we have not yet heard the dreaded word "Consignia".
<P>

<a name="20321-03_para1"></a>In view of the repeated assurances from the Government that people will be able to get their benefits paid in cash through the sub-post offices, especially in rural areas&#151;it has been repeated many times&#151;can my noble friend assure the House that in no way will people be advised when they go into their rural post offices that these machines are the means of getting their cash?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I can give that assurance. We remain fully committed to meeting the Prime Minister's clear pledge that those who wish to do so will be able to continue to get their benefits in cash at post offices, in full and without charge.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Swinfen: </B>   My Lords, the Post Office operates universal postal charges throughout the whole country. Why can it not do the same with cash machines?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew19"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, there is a long tradition of the universal postal service which is written into the latest Post Office Act. That states that a service will be provided across the country under a one-payment system. The provision of cash machines is an additional service which does not have to be provided under the universal postal obligation. It is a commercial transaction which will be operated on a commercial basis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Livsey of Talgarth: </B>   My Lords, is not the imposition of a charge of &#163;1.25 for the use of cash machines a breach of the principle of providing a universal service to all users of the Post Office? This is <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-03_spnew21"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, the Post Office has a universal service obligation in relation essentially to the mail service. That obligation does not extend to all services. I do not believe that it should. If extra services are provided, they are provided on a commercial basis. That is entirely in keeping with what has gone before.

<A NAME="20321-03_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that the supplementary question of my noble friend on the Front Bench was irrelevant to her Question. But the viability of the Post Office in the future is very relevant, and that is the point made by my noble friend. Can the Minister confirm unequivocally to the House that on which he has been congratulated by the noble Lord, Lord Clarke&#151;that is, that there have been no negotiations whatever with a foreign company&#151;for example, a Dutch company&#151;in recent times that have failed?

<P>
<A NAME="20321-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, as I said, I came to the House prepared to answer a Question about cash machines. I therefore did not ask or inquire about any negotiations which may or may not have taken place. If I am wrong, I shall obviously make it clear in a future communication to the noble Baroness. But, I repeat, I know of no negotiations which are taking place to sell the post office network, which I assume is the point of the question. I have no indication that any negotiations have ever taken place on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I simply said that this may be part of a transaction to sell off the Post Office&#151;which transaction has failed. That was the point that I made recently. I wanted to know whether the Minister could confirm that negotiations were going on to sell a majority share in the Post Office to a company overseas. That was my question.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I can only repeat what I have said&#151;which I thought was very clear given the extent of my knowledge on this subject. If it is a question of the financial viability of the rural post office network, this particular move can only help, because a part of the fee goes to the post offices themselves.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, does not the Minister know that the whole future of the Post Office is a very live issue and one which, I am sure, concerns all of us in this House? We had a debate on the future of Consignia some six weeks ago. At the end of the debate, because we ran out of time, I asked the Minister whether he would answer in writing the questions that had been raised. I then wrote to him, about three weeks ago. I have still not heard from him. <P>


<a name="column_1474"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Is it the case that the Minister does not know what is going on in the Post Office, as he has more or less said to my noble friend Lady Miller?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, I apologise if answers to those questions have not been received. I shall immediately make certain that they are answered. However, if noble Lords opposite want to know what negotiations have taken place, or are going to take place, on Consignia, the proper approach would be to table a Question on that matter, and not focus on the subject of cash machines, which is a quite separate issue.

<P>
<UL>
<a name="20321-04_para3"></a>"With permission, I should like to make a Statement on Zimbabwe's suspension from the Commonwealth.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para4"></a>"As the House will be aware, a Commonwealth 'troika' consisting of Presidents Mbeki of South Africa and Obasanjo of Nigeria and Prime Minister John Howard of Australia was authorised by the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to review the outcome of the Zimbabwe elections in the light of the Commonwealth observers' report, and to decide on any action.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para5"></a>"The troika met in London on Tuesday. It had before it the final report of the Commonwealth observers group. This confirmed the findings of the preliminary report which I put before the House in my Statement last Thursday. The group concluded that,
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2>"the conditions in Zimbabwe did not adequately allow for a free expression of will by the electors".
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para6"></a><P>


<a name="column_1476"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1476</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<UL>
<a name="20321-04_para7"></a>"The troika accepted the conclusions in full and decided as a result to suspend Zimbabwe from the councils of the Commonwealth for one year with immediate effect. This issue will be revisited in 12 months' time, having regard to progress in Zimbabwe, based on the Commonwealth Harare principles and reports from the Commonwealth Secretary-General. I am sure the whole House will join me in expressing our appreciation to Presidents Mbeki and Obasanjo and Prime Minister Howard and in expressing our full support for their conclusions.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para8"></a>"Three months ago, on 20th December, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, of which I was a member, concluded that Zimbabwe was in 'serious and persistent violation' of the Harare principles. It was my view at that stage that Zimbabwe should, then and there, be suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth. I made this case again at CMAG at the end of January, as did my right honourable friend the Prime Minister at CHOGM itself in early March. As the situation in Zimbabwe has deteriorated day by day since December, it follows that we believe that suspension now is fully justified.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para9"></a>"The Commonwealth depends above all on its moral authority, and on the force of the principles which it codified in Harare itself in 1991. That is why the decision was so important for the Commonwealth as a whole, as well as, of course, for Zimbabwe. And that moral authority is what gives this decision its force.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para10"></a>"I am in no doubt, from the way in which the Government of Zimbabwe had sought actively to divide the Commonwealth, that they were, and are, profoundly concerned about the international isolation which suspension signals. Tuesday's decision was, therefore, significant in many respects: above all, for the fact that leaders of two key African nations have taken a clear and definitive stand in defence of the Commonwealth's fundamental principles. They have also underlined Africa's commitment to the universal and indivisible principles of democracy and human rights.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para11"></a>"Suspension is one of the strongest measures the Commonwealth can impose. In the past, countries have only been suspended after the violent overthrow of their elected governments. Zimbabwe's suspension is, therefore, a new departure.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para12"></a>"Moreover, the Commonwealth's decision is in addition to the targeted sanctions which the European Union, the United States and now Switzerland have imposed against the leaders of ZANU-PF. EU Heads of Government also decided, at the European Council in Barcelona last weekend, to ask Foreign Ministers to look at options for further measures.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para13"></a>"What has happened in Zimbabwe is a tragedy, imposed on this once prosperous land by Robert Mugabe. Our commitment and that of the Commonwealth to the people of Zimbabwe remains <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1477"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1477</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>as strong as ever. We have made it clear, since 1997, that the case for land reform in Zimbabwe is very strong, and that we were willing to provide considerable financial support to a land reform process that was transparent, lawful, and which gave priority to the needs of Zimbabweans in overcrowded communal lands. This was a position supported by the international community but rejected by the Mugabe regime.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para14"></a>"At Abuja, in early September last year, we agreed a pathway for Zimbabwe which would have allowed for a resumption of international aid, including from the United Kingdom, for a programme of sustainable land reform implemented in accordance with the rule of law. Respect for the rule of law, and a return to democratic principles and to sensible economic policies, is the only way back. We remain ready to do all we can to achieve this; and we will continue our programmes of assistance for humanitarian and HIV/AIDS projects. But I must tell the House that in the short term the prospects in Zimbabwe look bleak, underlined by the murders since the election of MDC activists and a commercial farmer, and the fact that the opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has now formally been charged with treason.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para15"></a>"Today, it is all the more urgent that the Government of Zimbabwe commit themselves&#151;as the leaders of the Commonwealth have called for&#151;to healing the divisions in the country and taking the path of genuine reform and national reconciliation. We shall do all that we can to support Presidents Mbeki and Obasanjo, and other African partners, in their efforts to bring stability back to Zimbabwe. This is what the people of Zimbabwe desperately need. Today, the whole of the democratic world supports them in this goal".
<P>

<A NAME="20321-04_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the noble Baroness for repeating the Statement. We fully share the welcome that she and the Foreign Secretary gave to the conclusions of the Commonwealth troika. We look on those conclusions with a feeling of relief, because if they had gone otherwise the future of the Commonwealth would have been threatened. This is a good moment in an otherwise dark scene. I also share the Minister's desire to pay tribute to Prime Minister Howard and Presidents Obasanjo and Mbeki for having the courage to reach those conclusions, which are said to be already of immense comfort to the brave people of Zimbabwe.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para17"></a>I am sure that the noble Baroness recognises that the conclusions come too late for the murdered farmer, Terry Ford, and for all the other victims of multiple murders. They come too late for all the farm workers who have been beaten to pulp, too late for the security guards who tried to defend the farms and too late for <P>


<a name="column_1478"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1478</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>those Zimbabweans who may be dying of starvation. However, better late than never, I suppose. This is a positive move, without doubt.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para18"></a>Has the noble Baroness noticed that the US State Department, which usually moves very slowly, has already come out with a strong statement condemning the intimidation and underscoring the illegitimacy of the Mugabe regime? The Statement that we have just heard speaks of the need to do all that we can. Can we have an assurance that there will be real, positive and continuing efforts to form a coalition of democracies to maintain all possible pressures, including the targeted sanctions and other measures&#151;of which we would like some indication of the nature&#151;to ensure that the Mugabe regime remains under pressure until there is agreement for fresh and democratic elections and a new approach? Does she agree that any arrangement that ended up with some kind of sordid deal with Mr Mugabe and anything that legitimised him would be completely unsatisfactory and would continue to threaten the stability of the region?
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para19"></a>What will be done about Mr Tsvangirai, who is mentioned in the Statement? He has now been threatened on trumped-up charges. Can something more be done to prevent this brave man being caught up in the vindictiveness of Mr Mugabe? Do the Government agree that the only discussions that there should be with Mugabe are about the arrangements necessary for new and democratic elections?
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para20"></a>Does the noble Baroness agree that southern Africa will recover from its present dire straits only if justice returns and Mugabe goes? Can she explain how it is that, while Mr Mbeki has courageously supported the conclusions, the South African Parliament apparently recognises the legitimacy of Mr Mugabe, which is a fatal move? Does she recognise that the new African economic partnership&#151;NePAD&#151;will succeed only if the rule of law is properly and firmly restored in southern Africa?
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para21"></a>Can the noble Baroness tell us about the status of our high commission in Harare now that we no longer recognise the legitimacy of the government there? There are brave public servants in our high commission who are doing valuable work. If we are to maintain the humanitarian aid to starving Zimbabweans that will be needed, presumably we shall reinforce the staff there. Will she confirm the status of the commission and whether we shall be enlarging it if we can so that it can help people in their dreadful plight?
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para22"></a>Does the noble Baroness accept that before we do any of that, we need an honest government in Harare&#151;which at the moment we have not got?

<P>
<A NAME="20321-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Wallace of Saltaire: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Government for the Statement. I recognise that the British Government, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, have worked extremely hard on the issue and that we have limited influence over events in Zimbabwe. The older Members of this House may remember that in 1965 some members of my party <P>


<a name="column_1479"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1479</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>were in favour of direct intervention in what was then Rhodesia to prevent a unilateral declaration of independence. I am not aware that any party in this country, even the Conservatives, now proposes such direct intervention. We have limited influence and we have to recognise the need to work with others multilaterally to bring what influence we can to bear. The Government have done well in that task. This is a good day for the Commonwealth. Despite the gloomy predictions from the Conservatives in both Houses of the impending dissolution of the Commonwealth, that prospect is clearly past for the time being.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para23"></a>How active a role is it intended that the Commonwealth, and in particular the troika, will retain over the coming months as a watching brief, in view of continuing developments in Zimbabwe? In particular, what contingency plans are we making against the prospect of a further deterioration of the Zimbabwean economy in the coming months, with the likelihood of a spillover of refugees into neighbouring countries? That clearly threatens to destabilise the weak economies of southern Africa as a whole. It therefore seems extremely important to work with the neighbours, particularly Mozambique and South Africa, on limiting the damage to the region and, whenever possible, to provide food and aid. We all recognise that we have to contain a possible further collapse of the Zimbabwean economy. In that context, using the Commonwealth and our other multilateral relations, we should continue to promote good governance as the path to development in Africa, in particular through the New Partnership for Africa's Development.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para24"></a>I have one small partisan point to make. I hope that Anglo-Saxon interventions in promoting good governance in Africa will have an element of humility. A strong comment was made by the US Administration against the idea of fixing elections rather than allowing full democracy. I am conscious that there is sometimes a tendency in this country to demand that other countries should have clear democracies that represent the will of a majority of the people. We do not have that in this country, so perhaps we should be a little more delicate in how we promote standards of democracy higher than our own.

<A NAME="20321-04_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lords, Lord Howell of Guildford and Lord Wallace of Saltaire, for their responses. Of course, like the noble Lord, Lord Howell, I fully support the views of the troika. That was clear from my right honourable friend's Statement. The noble Lord then said that it came too late for many of the victims of the violence in Zimbabwe. I hope that he does not think that statements in themselves would have stopped the murderous intent of the regime in Zimbabwe. He cannot really believe that more statements would have been enough. Goodness knows, many Statements were made from this Dispatch Box and in another place about the contempt felt for some of the acts of the Zimbabwean <P>


<a name="column_1480"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1480</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government. To imply that statements in themselves stop murderous intent is not fully to appreciate the position.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para25"></a>I agree that the statement made by the US State Department is very welcome. I wholeheartedly agree with the noble Lord that honest government in Zimbabwe must be the first priority. As my noble friend has said on many occasions from this Dispatch Box, we must not forget that we are dealing with a sovereign government in Zimbabwe and that we do not have the ability simply to say what should be done there and expect that it will happen as night follows day.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para26"></a>As both noble Lords have said, we must look to what can happen next. The EU heads of government instructed Foreign Ministers last weekend to consider further what measures can be taken in Zimbabwe, including possible further sanctions. The United States Government, with whom we are in close touch, have said that they will increase sanctions. The Government of New Zealand have said that they are considering imposing sanctions. The Government of Switzerland have already imposed sanctions, which bring them into line with EU sanctions.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para27"></a>As the Commonwealth troika conclusions made clear, Presidents Mbeki and Obasanjo are working hard on a programme of reconciliation. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary will be working to ensure that we give what support we can to Zimbabwe, but, touching on some of the economic questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, we shall also look to the IMF and the World Bank to deny the current Zimbabwe regime access to financial support. I am sure that the House would expect no less in terms of sanctions. Given events not so much in the elections but in the run-up to the elections, Mugabe has to be denied what would normally have been his right.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para28"></a>I do not think that we should be in any doubt about this: it is going to be a very long haul indeed. President Mugabe, as he has demonstrated all too clearly, is determined to cling to power for as long as he can. I hope that I have indicated some of the ways in which Her Majesty's Government are working with others to ensure that that is for as short a time as possible.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para29"></a>I thank the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, for his comments not only about my right honourable friends in another place but about my colleague in this House, Lady Amos. I wish that she had had the pleasure of making this Statement today. I believe that her endeavour in so many ways&#151;working tirelessly not only in the multilateral forums, one of which she is attending today, in Monterrey, but with many leaders in Africa&#151;has been a key element in bringing us to where we are today. I acknowledge that fully, and I hope that the House will join me in that acknowledgement.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para30"></a>We have to examine what can be done to distinguish the regime in Zimbabwe from the people of Zimbabwe. As the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, said, Zimbabwe's economic position is appalling: unemployment is currently 60 per cent; <P>


<a name="column_1481"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1481</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>inflation is 112 per cent; 35 per cent of the adult population are suffering from HIV/AIDS; and 63 per cent of the population are below the poverty line. All that is occurring in a country that was once a hallmark for prosperity in Africa.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para31"></a>The suspension of technical aid is one of the sanctions attending Zimbabwe's suspension from the councils of the Commonwealth. That does not involve the suspension of aid which might help in the restoration of democracy. The Commonwealth has drawn that distinction in determining how the suspension will work. It is therefore very much to be hoped that the money for the restoration of democracy will continue to be provided.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para32"></a>As for the arrest and charging of Mr Tsvangirai, Mr Tsvangirai is now out on bail. We can, however, do only a limited amount in a sovereign state. Although we can monitor events, comment, and bring pressure to bear, as we have already done, the Government of Zimbabwe are continuing to harass leaders of the opposition. They must face the consequences of so doing.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para33"></a>As for the status of our mission in Harare, the mission remains, and there is no question of withdrawing any of our diplomats. Some 40,000 British citizens are in Zimbabwe and they will need the protection of our mission there more than ever. I hope that all noble Lords send them a strong message of support from this House for the sterling work they are doing.

<A NAME="20321-04_spnew12"></A><B> Lord St John of Bletso: </B>   My Lords, I join in welcoming the Statement from the Foreign Secretary, and particularly the fact that it has restored the Commonwealth's credibility. I should like particularly to commend its call for the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Government of Zimbabwe to commit themselves to healing the divisions in the country and taking the path of genuine reform and national reconciliation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-04_para34"></a>
In that regard, can the Minister outline what measures the troika and Her Majesty's Government are taking to encourage a government of national unity in Zimbabwe?
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para35"></a>I also commend the work of the noble Baroness, Lady Amos. I should, however, like to make one slight alteration to an answer which she gave me in reply to a question I asked her on Tuesday, when I contended that the South African observer mission's report had been politically rigged. The noble Baroness said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the South African parliamentary observers team has dropped its conclusion that the elections were substantially free and fair".&#151;[Official Report, 19/03/02; col. 1230.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-04_para36"></a>
That is not the case. The South African observers mission has not dropped its contentions, but President Mbeki has dropped certain comments on his website.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para37"></a>I also revert to the question from the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, who asked how the Government of Zimbabwe can heal the division when the MDC leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, and the MDC secretary-general, Welshman Ncube, have been <P>


<a name="column_1482"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1482</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>formally charged with treason. Moreover, in South Africa, the ANC secretary-general has recently described Morgan Tsvangirai's arrest and charging as "part of the healing process". Surely that is extremely worrying.
<P>

<a name="20321-04_para38"></a>Finally, will the Minister outline what action is being taken to alleviate the severe food shortage, the prospect of mass starvation, and the refugee flight to South Africa which is likely to ensue if the situation is exacerbated?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-05_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso. He is quite right. There are enormous problems in achieving genuine reform&#151; particularly national reconciliation and a government of national unity&#151;when it is so painfully evident that the current government do not want to be a party to anything of the sort, and when they&#151;as the noble Lord rightly reminded us&#151;have not only arrested but charged Morgan Tsvangirai and Welshman Ncube. That is why it is so important that the troika has agreed that work on these issues should be taken forward by Presidents Mbeki and Obasanjo.
<P>

<a name="20321-05_para0"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that, immediately after the election in Zimbabwe, there was some confusion about what was thought by a very small number of people to have been a fair election. When the more substantial reports were properly examined, it was decided that that was not really the case. I remind him of the statement made by the SADC parliamentary forum observer on 13th March:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The climate of insecurity obtaining in Zimbabwe since the 2000 parliamentary elections was such that the electoral process could not be said to adequately comply with the Norms and Standards for Elections in the SADC region".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-05_para1"></a>
I think that that is an extremely reassuring statement.
<P>

<a name="20321-05_para2"></a>I fully take the noble Lord's point that we must now be very vigilant. The issue of what is to happen to those arrested and charged with treason&#151;although, as I said, they are out on bail&#151;is another reason for maintaining the full strength of our diplomatic mission in Zimbabwe. We shall be looking for regular reports on those issues.
<P>

<a name="20321-05_para3"></a>The food shortages are causing great worry and concern. Donors are already providing supplementary feeding through the NGOs. Our own Department for International Development has given &#163;4 million of assistance to some 300,000 people. Additionally, last month, DfID made a &#163;6 million contribution to the UNDP's humanitarian assistance and recovery programme for Zimbabwe. I am sure that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State will be keeping that issue under constant review.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hughes of Woodside: </B>   My Lords, I join those who have congratulated the Government on the part they have played in bringing about the troika's decision to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. However, no one who is a friend of Zimbabwe takes any pleasure from the suspension as it marks a very serious situation. Does my noble friend agree that the attacks on the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions and on trade unionists trying to exercise <P>


<a name="column_1483"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1483</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a legitimate right to strike concerns everyone, and that the clearly contrived charges brought against the MDC leaders do not help the situation? Does she also, however, agree that sanctions are not the magic bullet which will suddenly transform Zimbabwe from its currently parlous state into a world democracy? Should we not also recall the other part of the troika's statement&#151;that it and the Commonwealth need to remain engaged with Zimbabwe?
<P>

<a name="20321-05_para4"></a>The Opposition spokesman seemed to suggest that in no circumstances should we have any contact with anyone in the Zimbabwe Government. Taking that view to its logical conclusion, should he not be advocating withdrawing Britain's mission, unpalatable as that may be? My noble friend has said that the opposite action is required. Can my noble friend assure the House that, as well as the sanctions which have to be applied, every possible means and method of discussion and dialogue will be used to bring about a resolution as early as possible?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend draws an important and valuable distinction when he refers to suspending our contacts at an official level with the Government of Zimbabwe while at the same time trying to have proper discussions with those with whom we can do business there. If it is possible in future to have discussions with those in the Mugabe regime who are willing to talk in terms of reconciliation for the future, that would be valuable.
<P>

<a name="20321-05_para5"></a>I agree strongly with my noble friend's remarks regarding the violent attacks on trade unions. The NGO figures suggest that about 73 per cent of the perpetrators of violence appear to be affiliated to ZANU-PF, and 16 per cent are police officers, which is extremely worrying. As your Lordships may know, between 1st January and 28th February this year, 31 people were killed in politically-motivated attacks. Nearly all of those were black Zimbabweans. As we have seen, three members of the MDC have been murdered since the election and one commercial farmer tragically lost his life.
<P>

<a name="20321-05_para6"></a>My noble friend is right. Sanctions are never a magic bullet, but they signify an important measure of outrage and disgust about what has happened in Zimbabwe. It is worth noting what suspension from the councils of the Commonwealth will mean. It means that there will be no participation by the Government of Zimbabwe in intergovernmental meetings, but it does not deprive the people of Zimbabwe of cultural and sporting activities which may be organised by the Commonwealth.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-05_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Park of Monmouth: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that it was enormously fortunate and right that the Government increased the number of Commonwealth observers? We have seen what a happy result that gave. However, there is a lesson to be learnt. I entirely share&#151;as we all do&#151;the Minister's admiration for what the mission in Zimbabwe is doing. I hope that we shall not only leave it in place but greatly increase it. The only thing we can do, which no <P>


<a name="column_1484"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1484</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sovereign government can refuse, is to observe and report and be seen to be doing so, particularly now that the laws against the media are being further tightened.
<P>

<a name="20321-05_para7"></a>I hope that it will be possible for there to be an element of observation from the high commission of the dispensing of our humanitarian aid, for instance, so that it is not taken over by ZANU-PF and used to reward its people. My other point is that I hope that we shall persuade the rest of the EU to stay and report. I was rather concerned to see that the Danish mission is withdrawing. The one thing that can be done is to stay and report and be seen to do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-05_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, perhaps in turn I may thank the noble Baroness for her timely intervention on the subject of Commonwealth observers. Your Lordships may remember that, as always, she was forthright in pointing out some of the shortcomings in the number of Commonwealth observers. I was delighted that the Government were able to increase the numbers significantly. I agree that we should keep the numbers in our mission in Zimbabwe under constant review. It is enormously important that their role in observing what is happening on the ground is maintained. The noble Baroness spoke about how aid might be used in a way not intended by the donors. We shall have to keep that in mind, as I am sure my noble friend Lady Amos would agree.
<P>

<a name="20321-05_para8"></a>The noble Baroness is right. We should try to persuade others not to withdraw their mission. She will know that withdrawing a mission is a potent signal of disapprobation that governments use to indicate the depth of their anger about what has happened within a country. I understand the motivation of our Danish friends in acting as they have. However, my own view is that we should like to see many of our colleagues who value the principles of democracy and humanitarian assistance stay on the ground. That will strengthen those who are able to give honest reports about what is happening in Zimbabwe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-05_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords, we should not underestimate the horrors which have occurred in Zimbabwe. However, should we not look ahead on a wider basis to consider how the atmosphere might be changed for the better in the whole of southern Africa? Is not the main and most urgent problem facing all the SADC countries that of economic reconstruction so that they can play their part as a whole in the New Partnership for Africa's Development? As that will require substantial changes in policy, not least in Zimbabwe under whatever government, will it not require outstanding leadership? Is there not an outstanding leader available in southern Africa&#151;I hope that he is available&#151;in the form of Nelson Mandela? Would the Government, with our European allies, consider whether that is a thought which might be pursued?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-05_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, will know that the NePAD initiative is designed to help southern Africa, both in <P>


<a name="column_1485"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1485</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>terms of resources and expertise, to achieve much-needed economic reconstruction. An element of that will be that those who receive such aid and resources should embrace not only the spirit and instruments of democracy but everything that is implied by civil government and the rule of law. In a nutshell, that is what is being negotiated. I am sure that my noble friend will pursue that agenda in her discussions in Monterrey today. Leadership is an important and extremely potent factor in making such an initiative work. A number of individuals in southern African may be able to contribute to that. Given the enormously high esteem in which he is rightly held, not only on the continent of Africa but throughout the world, I am sure that the blessing of Nelson Mandela would prove enormously important to the initiative and its chances of success. However, more than one or two leaders will be needed to ensure that the initiative is a real success.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-05_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Thomson of Monifieth: </B>   My Lords, as someone who was Commonwealth Secretary during the period of UDI, perhaps I may suggest to the Minister, echoing the words of my noble friend Lord Wallace, that the role of Her Majesty's Government in this difficult relationship with Zimbabwe is best played with a degree of humility about the past. Is the Minister aware how much the success of the troika will be welcomed in deciding to suspend Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth for one year? That will allow other members of the Commonwealth to take a more high-profile role in dealing which such problems, while behind the scenes, and maintaining our own mission there, we play a less prominent role. The Zimbabwe problem is a Commonwealth problem of great importance, but it is one for the Commonwealth as a whole. The more Her Majesty's Government play their role with some delicacy and a low profile, the more successful the outcome may be.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-06_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, there is an enormous amount of wisdom in the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Thomson. I hope that the Government have been seen to be firm in their resolve. My noble friend and my right honourable friends have done their best to work behind the scenes to secure the objective about which we have been clear. As the Statement indicated, we have been working for suspension from the councils of the Commonwealth for a matter of months. The noble Lord is right. This cannot be seen to be a one-country show.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para0"></a>As the Statement indicated, it was clear early on in the discussions that the Zimbabwean Government would do everything that they could to make this an issue between the white Commonwealth&#151;those predominantly from the European-based nations&#151;and those from the African-based nations. That would have been an extremely damaging development had it had any success. But it was not successful, which is exactly the point. The value of the troika was that President Obasanjo and President Mbeki both have great wisdom and experience. It will now be extraordinarily difficult for Mr Mugabe to claim that <P>


<a name="column_1486"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1486</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>it was some sort of conspiracy led by the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom took no part in the troika. We are also extremely grateful for the part played by Prime Minister Howard.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para1"></a>It is right to ensure that this is not seen as the United Kingdom being out alone on the issue. We have a special relationship with Zimbabwe. We have a historical relationship and 40,000 of our citizens live in that country. We have particular responsibilities, which none of us want to set on one side. Having said that, we have constantly made it clear that this is a matter for the whole Commonwealth. I am delighted that the Commonwealth has acknowledged that and that it will be working in the next year to try to bring the Government of Zimbabwe to a more sensible course of action.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness has done well to remind us that there are 40,000 British citizens still living in Zimbabwe. We also know from experience that Mr Mugabe and his party are spiteful. In the event of their taking out their spite on those 40,000 British citizens, are there contingency plans to make sure that they will be rescued and defended?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, there is a contingency plan, but I stress to the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, that there is a similar contingency plan for many other countries. As many of your Lordships will know, we have a warden network around the country to enable us to maintain good communications with the resident British community. I assure your Lordships that that civil contingency plan is reviewed and updated regularly.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para2"></a>The responsibility for ensuring law and order in Zimbabwe cannot be shouldered by the British mission in Zimbabwe. The responsibility lies full square on the Zimbabwean Government's shoulders. I should not want anything that I have said about civil contingency plans&#151; important though they are&#151;to be thought in any way to be relieving the authorities of that country of their obligation to look after all citizens, irrespective of their nationality or where they live. I hope that that message will be firmly understood.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lady Saltoun of Abernethy: </B>   My Lords, following on from what the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, said, how can the Government ensure that any financial support given to restore democracy in Zimbabwe is used for that purpose and does not go towards lining the pockets of the present government?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-06_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, in countries where we have had the problem of the possibility of governments diverting aid funds from the legitimate purpose for which they were sent and using them for illegitimate purposes we have channelled funds through non-governmental organisations. I am sure that that issue is under review by my colleagues in the Department for International Development. It is another of the functions of our <P>

<P>

<a name="20321-06_para3"></a>I am sure that none of your Lordships would wish to imply that we should not send much-needed aid for food. As I tried to explain, the levels of hunger and food shortages are enormously difficult problems in Zimbabwe. It is right to send what aid we can to ensure that democracy, fragile as it is, has a chance to flourish and that civil life has a chance to grow as well. We try to do what we can through the NGOs but we also keep very close observance on the ground about what happens to our funds.

<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 7, line 17, after "is" insert "issued,"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-06_para9"></a><P>

<a name="20321-06_para10"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to the remaining amendments in this group.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para11"></a>The proposal that there should be local health boards in place of the existing health authorities in Wales is controversial for a number of reasons. Amendment No. 76 proposes that there should be consultation before an order establishing a board is issued by the National Assembly for Wales. There is already provision for consultation in the event of variation or revocation of a local health board order. In our view, prior consultation is essential before boards are established.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para12"></a>If the boards are to be coterminous with local authorities, there will be more of them than the present five area health authorities. There could be as many as 22&#151;one for each local authority. I should have thought that the Assembly would seek to avoid such proliferation if only for reasons of economy in terms of staff and resources. There will obviously have to be consultation with the existing health authorities, local authorities and health trusts before the final geographical map of health boards is decided. It is important that the map is the best that can be devised and that it is satisfactory to all concerned.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para13"></a>I can recall the reorganisation of local government in the early 1990s when the present 22 unitary authorities were established. Indeed, I can remember the previous reorganisation in the 1970s. My enduring <P>


<a name="column_1488"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1488</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>memory of both is the difficulty that we had in getting proposals accepted and boundaries agreed. These new proposed health boards will prove just as contentious when the Assembly gets down to the business of deciding the precise localities that they are to serve. People are naturally very sensitive about such issues.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para14"></a>There is a further complication that not all the boards will have the same functions. They will have a variegated pattern of functions and responsibilities. Some will have major hospitals within their areas, and others will not. Again there will be considerable scope for argument and the Assembly would be well advised to consult before the pattern is imposed which, I dare say, will happen.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para15"></a>Many people in Wales, both within the National Health Service and outside it, have grave doubts about the practicability of the new system. For it to have the smallest chance to succeed, there must be extensive consultation with all the parties involved. We would be foolish not to provide for it in statute, especially when the Bill already provides for consultation in the event of variation or revocation of an LHB order.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para16"></a>The Minister may say that of course there will be consultation before an LHB order is issued and that we can take that for granted. I do not think that that is an adequate reply to the argument. Without the amendment we shall be storing up trouble for the Assembly and for the National Health Service in Wales.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para17"></a>Amendment No. 77 is a probing amendment. It seeks to find out how the Assembly proposes to direct the local health boards at national level. In other words, who precisely in the Assembly is to issue directions? Presumably they will be authorised by the Minister in the Assembly on the advice of the NHS directorate. We should like to know more about that top structure.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para18"></a>I imagine that there will be an infinite variety of directions related to different aspects of the NHS. Some will be purely local and apply only to a particular board or boards; others will be national in scope. As we have said before, the NHS in Wales will clearly need an all-Wales dimension, which is currently not defined in the Bill. It is very important that we have some idea as to what that all-Wales structure will be. We debated this point last Thursday when we considered the new clauses proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para19"></a>I had ministerial responsibility for the NHS in Wales between 1979 and 1983. That was a period, I am glad to say, of extensive new hospital building and innovative strategies such as our mental handicap strategy which pioneered the transfer of people with learning difficulties from hospital into the community. We did not have a regional health authority in Wales; the regional authority was the Welsh Office and its Ministers. So I have some idea about the enormous range of NHS activity in Wales even 20 years ago.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para20"></a>It is quite clear that the thrust of the Welsh provisions in the Bill is to devolve responsibility to local health boards, but it is also clear that there will have to be some central direction in order to ensure a <P>


<a name="column_1489"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>degree of uniformity and fairness all round. It is therefore necessary, as I have said, for us to know what kind of structure the NHS will have at Assembly and ministerial level.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para21"></a>I referred a few moments ago to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, who introduced new clauses asking for a national health agency for Wales. The noble Baroness not only enjoys an international reputation, but she has a high reputation in Wales as vice-dean of the University of Wales College of Medicine and as honorary professor of palliative medicine. In short, she knows the NHS in Wales. She knows the scene very well indeed.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para22"></a>Last week the noble Baroness told us of the concerns expressed at the conference of Welsh local medical committees as recently as last Wednesday. She said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"They cannot take on the huge number of functions about to be devolved to them".&#151;[Official Report, 14/3/02; col. 994.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-06_para23"></a>
She went on to say that GPs wanted a primary care directorate, but that is now in doubt. What is proposed are six directorates for renewal, policy, finance, quality, human resources and facilities&#151;all six presumably overarched by the existing NHS directorate.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para24"></a>As the noble Baroness hinted in the debate last week, there is a threat of fragmentation here and, I would add, an incoherent, possibly conflicting guidance to local heath boards from the various directorates. I hope that further consideration will be given to the single primary care directorate and the significant body that the local medical committees want,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to handle contractor services to protect both professional interests and those of patients".&#151;[Official Report, 14/3/02; col. 994.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-06_para25"></a><P>

<a name="20321-06_para26"></a>With regard to secondary and tertiary care, it is proposed to strengthen the Specialised Health Services Commission for Wales, to commission tertiary care and advise, guide and facilitate the commissioning of secondary care. But the remit is still being worked out, as the noble Baroness told us. The noble Baroness, Lady Farrington, confirmed that the Specialised Health Services Commission for Wales is to be given an enhanced role. But that is as far as we got in learning about the national structure.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para27"></a>So what can we make of that? The structure of the NHS in Wales is being built from the bottom up. That makes sense, provided that the builders know how the structure is to be completed. The foundations have to match the superstructure, and vice versa. That is where the current problem lies. There seems to be no clear idea as to what the final structure will look like or how it will work. Any help that the Minister can give on this matter will be most welcome.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para28"></a>Amendments Nos. 90 and 91 are different in character from previous amendments but still deal with local health boards. I have tabled Amendment No. 90 to seek clarification on certain aspects of local health board expenditure. My understanding is that they will have very little income, other than the allocations given to them by the Assembly. Such <P>


<a name="column_1490"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1490</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>allocations will be the major part of their revenue. Clause 10(9) defines general Part 2 expenditure under the Act. That means expenditure in connection with the council for the regulation of health care professionals, and appeals. My amendment deletes subsection (2) of Clause 10(9) which excludes four kinds of expenditure that may clearly be incurred by local health boards; otherwise they would not be specified for inclusion in the way that they are. This subsection must be read in conjunction with new Sections 97H and 97G which deal with resource limits of local health boards and their financial duties. Subsection (2) of new Section 97H states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"no account shall be taken of ... general Part 2 expenditure",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-06_para29"></a>
as defined by a board in carrying out its duty not to exceed its expenditure limits.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para30"></a>My first question is: why is Part 2 expenditure open ended? Is it demand led? It does not say much for the Assembly's sense of priorities that regulatory expenditure is open ended.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para31"></a>Secondly, why are there the four specific exclusions from the definition? They are a mixed bag. I hope that the Minister will comment on each. I am particularly interested in Clause 10(6)(b), which refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"remuneration referable to the cost of drugs".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-06_para32"></a>
What does that specific exclusion mean in practice? Does it mean the perpetuation of postcode prescribing in Wales; that certain drugs will be available under one board but not another, depending on whether it has the resources and the will to provide them?
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para33"></a>Finally, who, if not the local health board, will pay for these excluded items? I am bound to say that the whole of the resource and expenditure situation of local health boards is complex, to say the least, in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para34"></a>Amendment No. 91 seeks to introduce the principle of equity into the National Assembly's annual apportionment of remuneration for the cost of drugs. Drugs expenditure is clearly no longer demand led and open ended. There is no commitment here on the part of the Assembly to meet a local health board's drugs bill in its entirety and whatever it may be. Indeed, under Clause 10(9), new paragraph 6C(4) states explicitly that the Assembly will exercise its discretion in paying for drugs ordered by a board on its own account. That seems a shot across the bow for boards that respectfully follow clinical judgment in drug prescribing. The same applies to primary care trusts in England.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para35"></a>I hope that I have properly understood the financial provisions and that the Minister will be able to answer some of my queries. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20321-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Those of us who are particularly interested in the workings of devolution are bound to be interested in this part of the Bill, which establishes for the first time an arrangement set up by Westminster in Wales&#151;upon which the National Assembly will make many decisions and within which framework it will operate.
<P>


<a name="column_1491"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1491</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para36"></a>There are many provisions in the Bill for secondary legislation. The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, of which I am a member, examined that aspect of the Bill with care and on the whole&#151;as the Minister knows&#151;the Committee is satisfied with the way in which the secondary legislation is arranged. It seems to have been well drafted.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para37"></a>The Bill allows the Assembly enormous freedom to make the arrangements to which my noble friend referred in the way that it wants and which suits Wales. Far be it from me even to imagine the scene, because I have not seen the Assembly in action, but it should be having an interesting time.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para38"></a>Westminster must decide what should be on the face of the Bill and what should not&#151;and what consultation should be set out by Westminster. Defining the board areas is obviously important. My noble friend made a good point when he said that there must be consultation before orders are made, not just the varying of orders afterwards. Amendment No. 76 probably has a lot going for it. It will be interesting to hear the Minister's response.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para39"></a>The clause about which I believe many of your Lordships are doubtful emanates from the arrangements for England and Wales&#151;as does much of the pattern of the Welsh clauses. We must be sure that the pattern that is right for England is right for Wales.
<P>

<a name="20321-06_para40"></a>The clauses in question imply that the Assembly will have enormous freedom to spend money on the health service in Wales in the way that it wants. How will the Government fix the Assembly's block grant in relation to health? I do not know whether my noble friend disagrees but that seems so open ended that it might be difficult to do. We need to know whether there is any basis for knowing the overall sum within which the Assembly will have to operate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-07_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   I thank the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, for his generous comments about me. I appreciate them enormously and feel humbled by them.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para0"></a>After last week's debate, I wanted to feel in tune with the views of general practitioners across Wales in relation to the proposed arrangements, so I attended a joint meeting of the Royal College of General Practitioners and the General Practitioners Committee of the British Medical Association in Wales. The turnout was so great that the room booked for the meeting was too small&#151;which reflected a surprising concern among GPs about the changes that they are facing.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para1"></a>I shall not reiterate the whole meeting, which lasted two and a half hours, but there was resounding concern that the new local health boards would have great difficulty coping with the workload that they are expected to take on and the speed. The new general practitioners' contract, which is currently being negotiated, aims at attracting back into the profession groups who are currently not working&#151;particularly young women&#151;through family-friendly policies, which are to be welcomed.
<P>


<a name="column_1492"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1492</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para2"></a>There is concern that the different arrangements for local health boards will present them with great difficulties in commissioning secondary care. There is concern in the secondary care sector that some of the arrangements could precipitate a destabilising crisis.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para3"></a>Concern is felt among patients about the loss of collective memory among those who administer community health services, particularly primary care. They have often provided a safeguard and acted as a point of detection when problems have arisen. I do not want to overplay the problems but one patient said to me at the weekend, "The NHS is working very well in Wales. Why does everybody knock it and need to rearrange it?" The overwhelming experience of patients is that they are getting a much improved service.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para4"></a>At the meeting that I attended, it was estimated that there would be only two senior administrative managers who really understood the ins and outs of primary care as it has existed. Much work has been done on setting standards across Wales and it will be important to ensure uniform measurement of services against standards.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para5"></a>Equity is absolutely crucial. It is crucially important that there is no return to the feeling of rationing by postcode. Patients feel that they are being rationed even when they are not and lose confidence in the service. It is not uncommon for patients to ask me whether the failure to offer them a particular form of treatment is because the NHS cannot afford it. When I point out to patients that the treatment was not offered because it would not do them any good&#151;otherwise, they would certainly have been offered it&#151;they often look surprised. Then they comment to the person next to them that they might get extra treatment if they paid for it. There is a perception of rationing even though that may not be true, so it is important that equity is firmly embedded in any new arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-07_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   This has been an important debate and I am particularly grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy. Because of her interest in devolution, we spent many hours debating not only the Bill establishing the Assembly but also that which established the Scottish Parliament. No one appreciates more than the noble Baroness that many things have changed.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para6"></a>As to Amendment No. 76, it is precisely because of the changes in responsibility and accountability that we are not able to accept that amendment. It is for the National Assembly to consider such matters as part of its devolved function. The only practical effect of Amendment No. 76 would be to fetter the devolved powers granted under the Government of Wales Act 1998. I am sure that no one wants to unravel the devolution settlement.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para7"></a>I hope that I shall give the assurance that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, are seeking by saying that the clause has been drafted to reflect the full and open consultation that the Assembly has already undertaken on the establishment of local health boards. In addition to <P>


<a name="column_1493"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1493</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consultation, the secondary legislation necessary to implement local health boards will also pass through the Assembly's scrutiny procedure before it is made, thus allowing Assembly Members an opportunity to comment further on it.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para8"></a>Imposing a further consultation requirement would seriously delay implementation of local health boards, which are a key feature of the strategy for reform of the NHS in Wales voted for by the Assembly. That would frustrate the intentions of the democratically elected devolved administration which, under the devolution settlement, is responsible for such policy matters.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para9"></a>Amendment No. 77 is again a matter for the National Assembly to consider as part of its devolved function. Its only practical effect would be to fetter the devolved powers granted under the Government of Wales Act 1998 and prevent the National Assembly from giving directions to local health boards as to how they should exercise any delegated powers&#151;a function that the National Assembly will retain with regard to health authorities. The amendment is therefore prejudicial in relation to England, as the Secretary of State will retain various powers of direction over the equivalent English bodies.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para10"></a>Directions in relation to the conferring of functions on local health boards must be made in regulations, which will be subject to the secondary legislation scrutiny procedures of the Assembly. They will therefore not be issued directly by the Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services but made by the Assembly under its own processes.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para11"></a>I turn to Amendments Nos. 90 and 91. Proposed new Section 97F confers a general power on the National Assembly for Wales to determine the treatment of discretionary and non-discretionary expenditure in relation to local health boards. That power currently exists in respect of health authorities, and we intend to transfer it to local health boards. To remove the power would be most unhelpful and unjustified.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para12"></a>Schedule 12A to the Health Act 1999 provides the mechanism by which the National Assembly for Wales determines the treatment of discretionary and non-discretionary expenditure. It has always been for the National Assembly for Wales to decide on such treatment, subject to the usual constraints, as it is for the Secretary of State in England. Those powers must be exercised in accordance with the principles of administrative law. We therefore cannot agree to limit the powers of the National Assembly for Wales.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para13"></a>However, some specific reassurances were sought. In answer to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, the strengthened Specialised Health Services Commission for Wales will support the local health boards with advice and guidance on commissioning, in addition to its role in commissioning tertiary and other specialised acute services&#151;a point also raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para14"></a>In answer to the question about the post code lottery asked by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, clearer priorities are emerging through the plan <P>


<a name="column_1494"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1494</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>implementation process. Priorities are increasingly delivered through national service frameworks that set clear minimum standards to be applied across Wales. Local health boards will be responsible for assessing the health needs of their populations and securing the range of services to meet those needs. The block vote is given to the Secretary of State for Wales. It is passed to the Assembly after allowing for his expenditure in running the Wales Office. The Assembly then decides how that funding is allocated across its functions. That is decided at a plenary session of the Assembly.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para15"></a>Local health board budgets will be prescribing budgets. They are currently dispensing at health authority level. Action is in hand to move towards a needs-based allocation. The report debated in plenary session of the Assembly last week determines that direction and was overwhelmingly accepted, I believe.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para16"></a>Finally, in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, we intend commissioning partnerships between local health boards, local authorities and NHS trusts to be formed as collective organisations. They will have geographical proximity and common patient flows and we expect there to be between 10 and 12 such partnerships in Wales. A typical partnership could be composed of two local health boards, two local authorities and one NHS trust. Partnerships will not be viewed as organisations but mechanisms for effective commissioning.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para17"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, raised the issue of the number and role of local health boards. The boards will be coterminous with local authorities in Wales. Identified benefits include: enabling the development of new and better ways for the NHS to work with local government to implement the health and well-being agenda for Wales; facilitating the requirement for LHBs and local authorities to assess the health and well-being needs of their population; sharing a population focus to provide more flexible services; providing a shared focus to address the determinants of health, which span NHS and local government responsibilities; and providing more flexibility in the use of staff and resources and clear accountability to the local population between statutory bodies.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para18"></a>The 22 health boards proposed for Wales are a natural development from the 22 local health groups that already exist as sub-committees of the health authorities. Local health boards will pay for admitted Part 2 items. Contracts for primary care contractors will be held by the Assembly, but financial control and scrutiny will be exercised via the local health boards.
<P>

<a name="20321-07_para19"></a>I hope that I have answered in some detail the points raised. I return to the fundamental point, which is that unfortunately the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, would undermine the devolution settlement agreed to by your Lordships.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-08_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sit down, in relation to Amendment No. 76, she said a good deal about how times have changed and that the matter is up to the Assembly. We know that, but we must consider what Westminster has to do <P>


<a name="column_1495"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1495</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>by way of constructing a framework within which the Assembly will work. Proposed new subsection (4) states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"If any consultation requirements apply, they must be complied with before an LHB order is varied or revoked",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-08_para0"></a>
Why should that not apply when an order is issued, as my noble friend Lord Roberts suggested? The Minister made a somewhat specious argument.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-08_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I am sorry if the noble Baroness feels that the argument is specious. These matters are rightly for the Assembly to determine. Unlike that which established the Scottish Parliament, the settlement gives the National Assembly for Wales the power to develop its own instruments and orders in secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="20321-08_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, presses us to accept that, as it were, a member of our family has reached the age of majority, but that we should still control the way in which he exercises his adult rights. The primary contractor contracts will be held by LHBs. I hope that that is an additional piece of information for the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay.
<P>

<a name="20321-08_para2"></a>I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy of Lour, that we are being extremely careful to ensure that during the passage of this legislation Members are kept informed about the degree to which consultation forms the ethos of the exercise of the Assembly's devolved powers.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   We are all grateful to the Minister for her comments. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour and to the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, for illuminating us on the feelings of GPs, particularly in Wales. I listened to her with great care. She talked about their concern, not only on this occasion but also last Thursday, as a result of their meetings. I know that such concerns about the formation of these boards are real in Wales.
<P>

<a name="20321-08_para3"></a>It is all very well for the Minister to say that the Assembly must consult if an order is varied or revoked, because that is required here in primary legislation. But the Assembly does not have to consult when an order is issued, which is what the amendment seeks. There is a contradiction in the Minister's approach, which states that we ordain in primary legislation that when a local health board is varied or revoked, the order must be consulted on, but that there is no need for consultation before the first order is issued. The Minister says that consultation has taken place. I am sure that there has been endless talk within the NHS in Wales, but there is still a considerable degree of dissatisfaction among professionals there.
<P>

<a name="20321-08_para4"></a>My experience of local health reorganisation and also local government reorganisation in Wales on more than one occasion is that public consultation is essential, otherwise discontent prevails and the system fails to work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   It may help the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, to recall, as I believe he knows, that I was involved as the leader of <P>


<a name="column_1496"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1496</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Association of County Councils during the period of local government reorganisation in Wales. I was assured by the noble Lord's government when in office that everyone had been fully consulted. I fear that occasionally, irrespective of who carries out the consultation process, some of those consulted will never accept that it took place unless they obtain the results that they want. Sometimes there are conflicting demands and it becomes impossible for everyone's views to be met.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   I accept that one cannot please everybody; one cannot please all the people all of the time, but we hope to please some people some of the time. That does not dispel the need for consultation. In such an area, where we are establishing totally new local health boards&#151;22 in place of the existing five&#151;there is a duty on the Assembly to ensure that the orders establishing the boards have been well and truly consulted on.
<P>

<a name="20321-08_para5"></a>If there is no such consultation and ensuing satisfaction, the worst fears expressed within the NHS in Wales&#151;that the system is impracticable&#151;may be realised. We are not fettering the Assembly in any way as it is already obliged to consult if the order establishing an LHB is varied or revoked, as I pointed out. We will not fetter it additionally by inserting the word "issued". Perhaps the principle should have been established earlier, in new subsection (2), but it is here. It fits into that subsection.
<P>

<a name="20321-08_para6"></a>We are still unclear about the top end of the NHS in Wales and how it will be constructed. We know a great deal about the lower end of the spectrum&#151;the local health boards, and so on&#151;but little about what is meant by the Assembly and the Minister and the form of organisation within the Assembly. I am not altogether happy with the Minister's answer and I shall test the Committee's opinion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for Rural Affairs in another place. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<a name="20321-09_para2"></a>"Mr Speaker, our manifesto gave a commitment on hunting with hounds. We said:
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2> 'We will give the new House of Commons an early opportunity to express its view. We will then enable Parliament to reach a conclusion on this issue'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-09_para3"></a><P>
<UL>
<a name="20321-09_para4"></a>"I have been given the responsibility of leading that enabling process.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para5"></a>"In reaching my decision on how to proceed, I have listened carefully to what has been said in the debates.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para6"></a>"The votes this week leave the two Houses diametrically opposed. Indeed I have rarely seen an issue where greater divisions exist. It is precisely for that reason that it is right to see how it can be resolved with as much agreement as possible.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para7"></a>"We want to respect all views but that has to start with respect for the strength with which the Commons made its views clear on Monday.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para8"></a>"I promise to engage with everyone who has an interest in this issue in order to make the legislation practical and robust. I promise to bring to the House of Commons a Bill that will deal with this issue effectively once and for all and make good law; and I earnestly hope that we can do so on the basis of as much common ground as possible.
<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1499"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1499</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para9"></a>"I propose a process of consultation on the practical issues of detail with a wide variety of interested parties. This period will last no more than six months, including work on drafting a new Bill.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para10"></a>"But we promised in the manifesto that it will be resolved. Should there be no way through and should the new Bill be frustrated in its passage rather than scrutinised and improved, the Government could not properly stand in the way of the application of the Parliament Act, which again of course would be a matter for this House.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para11"></a>"So the Government would prefer for the Bill to proceed by debate and a search for common ground wherever possible, with conflict tempered by tolerance. If that process is frustrated and the Bill rejected, we would reintroduce the Bill as quickly as possible to this House. It will then be for this House and its procedures&#151;and indeed for Mr Speaker&#151;to determine whether the Parliament Act applies.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para12"></a>"However, the reason for re-engaging in a process to try to achieve wider agreement is precisely because we recognise that there are legitimate concerns in the countryside about pest control, about land management and about other practicalities and we want to address these issues in the Bill. These concerns were raised both in this House and in another place.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para13"></a>"Let me also reiterate our manifesto commitment that:
<P>
<br>
<FONT SIZE=2> 'We have no intention whatsoever of placing restrictions on the sports of angling and shooting'.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-09_para14"></a><P>
<UL>
<a name="20321-09_para15"></a>"And I also want to stress to everyone in the countryside that hunting is at the margins of the real debate about the priorities that we set out in the Rural White Paper. Those of ensuring that people in the countryside get access to good public services, proper investment, sound environmental policies and sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para16"></a>"On the content of the Bill itself, I believe that some common ground can be achieved best by focusing on two general principles. The report by Lord Burns on hunting with dogs examined in great detail the principles of cruelty and utility. We propose to frame legislation that prohibits activity based on those two principles rather than simply setting out a list of activities to be banned.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para17"></a>"But the Burns report did not provide a route map. That is why further thought needs to be given in applying these principles and that is what I shall be looking at over the next few weeks.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para18"></a>"I am sure the House will have noted the very clear assurances I have given today about timing and outcome, as well as engagement which will involve those campaigning for a ban on hunting, and Members of this House, as well as those involved in land management.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para19"></a>"Inevitably, I recognise that this is a difficult issue, especially as we all know that there are pressing issues of legislation that also demand our attention on crime, health and education. We must deliver on our central promises to deliver reform and investment in our public services.
<P>
</UL>

<a name="column_1500"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1500</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para20"></a>"Mr Speaker, I ask the House to trust me to deliver and to join me in a process which is guaranteed to achieve an outcome as soon as possible. I look forward to engaging with colleagues on all sides of this House and in another place.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para21"></a>"The process I am setting out today will ensure that we deliver on our manifesto commitment to resolve this issue during the lifetime of this Parliament".
<P>
</UL>
<a name="20321-09_para22"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_time1"></a><H5>5.13 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place earlier today.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para23"></a>We congratulate the Government on recognising the need to make good law and on their determination not to place restrictions on angling and shooting. I recommend the Government wholeheartedly on this point of good law because it is at the heart of the issue. As many of your Lordships commented during our debate, it would be wrong to distract our police forces, to whom I pay tribute for the job of stemming the rising tide of crime. This is one aspect of a wider issue. The Government's continuing determination to give a ban on hunting the highest priority when so much else is clamouring for attention is a disgrace.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para24"></a>The Statement requests this House to trust the Minister to deliver. Does this mean that the Prime Minister has given him carte blanche to achieve a solution? Although the Statement declares that the two Houses are diametrically opposed, will the Minister accept that on a free vote in this House and in another place earlier this week the two Houses declared themselves to be in favour of a middle way?
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para25"></a>We do not accept that this is a black and white issue. It is a wide continuum, with many people sitting in the middle; and that fact tends to go overlooked. Is the Minister not willing to concede that the Statement he has given us today, while seeking views, also carries an uncanny unveiled threat that the Government will use the Parliament Act, and that even prior to us knowing what is going to be in the consultation document?
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para26"></a>I turn now to the consultation period. Are these consultation papers ready? If not, how long will it be before they are issued? Mindful of Easter and the Jubilee celebrations coming, will there be time for the Minister to fulfil his promise to engage with everyone who has an interest in this issue?
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para27"></a>Earlier this afternoon in another place the Minister seemed to suggest that the noble Lord, Lord Burns, had had his shout and that further interpretations by him of his report would not be considered. Are we to understand that the new round of consultation that is proposed will involve only those interests which have not already been expressed? Are we also to understand that the noble Lord, Lord Burns, will have no further input into the definition of "cruelty" and of the other word used in the Statement, "utility". Can the Minister explain to the House a little more about what is meant by "utility"?
<P>


<a name="column_1501"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1501</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para28"></a>I point out to the Minister that while the rural White Paper might be highly valued by the Government, as indeed they keep telling us, it was produced back in November 2000. It has not even been debated in this House and its implementation seems to be entrusted to many of the regional development agencies. Those have only one rural member on each board. Is it any wonder that the Government have had to use the Statement to point out to us and to the wider world that hunting is not a central issue in the countryside?
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para29"></a>While the Minister is pressing the issues for legislation referred to in the Statement we are still awaiting the Government's response to the Curry report and indeed to the reports that have been produced by the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, who I do not think is in his place today, on better regulation and on the response to the FMD prices in Cumbria. These are just a few. There are many other reports waiting in the wings.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para30"></a>Finally, I ask the Minister where the newspapers obtained their most authoritative articles published today in advance of the Statement, which rather suggests insider knowledge. Were there any briefings and did they take place before the Minister rose to speak in another place?
<P>

<a name="20321-09_time2"></a><H5>5.18 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, I would not pretend to speak for all voices in my party because in my party too we have diametrically opposed views. However, following the Statement, which I am glad the Minister has been able to make this afternoon, we can be certain of one thing, which is that we are not entirely clear what it means.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para31"></a>Having said that, I welcome the fact that it makes clear that the Burns inquiry is to be taken seriously. I welcome also the fact that the Government, having commissioned an inquiry, are going to take notice of it. I would certainly interpret the cruelty and utility part as exploring the balance between pest control and sport. That is a very important balance which should be thoroughly explored.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para32"></a>I, too, should like to know more about the timescale for the consultation and also whether local views will be taken into account on a locality basis or a regional basis; and, if so, what bodies will be consulted locally. That is particularly important because of the practical issues&#151;if the Government are thinking of restricting hunting to certain areas, for example, uplands. The over-use of those upland areas is a matter which bodies concerned with them will no doubt want to consider as well. It would be reassuring if the Minister could, at some stage, give us an indication of how the consultation document will dovetail into the recommendations made in the food and farming report. Indeed, as the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, observed, we have not yet received any response to that report.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para33"></a>The economic and social aspects would be well addressed on a regional basis. There are also issues of compensation for those who will be put out of <P>


<a name="column_1502"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1502</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>business, as was mentioned during the passage of the fur farming legislation in this House; and, indeed, as regards housing. I believe that the time-scale involved is most important. It means that we shall finally have definite answers. That is as crucial for rural areas that will be affected, as it is for those who would like to see a ban imposed.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para34"></a>Further, it is important to ensure that the sort of turn-out that we saw in this House last Tuesday will be repeated and exercised on other issues in the future. One way or another, it would be pleasant if the hunting debate could be put to bed once and for all in a satisfactory manner.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_time3"></a><H5>5.21 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate the response to the Statement and the questions that have been raised. I believe that some of those questions seemed to suggest that the way we do these things is slightly misleading. The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, seemed to think that I have been empowered by the Prime Minister to carry through the process. However, I am the mere representative in this House of my right honourable friend Alun Michael who&#151;thank goodness!&#151;is the person who will have that responsibility. Nevertheless, I shall be responsible for processing the matter through this House.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para35"></a>In his Statement, my right honourable friend made it clear that he would wish to engage with Members of this House, those who expressed views in the debate in another place on Monday, and, more widely, with the interest groups involved. It is not a question of the views already expressed being taken as written, including those of the noble Lord, Lord Burns. We shall facilitate the process so that anyone else who wishes to do so may participate in the consultation. I cannot give an answer on precisely when the consultation documentation will be produced, but, following the Easter Recess, we shall start engaging in the process of consultation.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para36"></a>In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, I should point out that this matter needs to be very much separated from other consultations that will take place in terms of how we proceed with the Curry report, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, also referred. The initial response to that report will be available shortly. However, as I have already indicated to the House, we wish to engage in a programme of regional discussion over the spring and summer. The final response to the report will be produced in the autumn, by which time we shall have the advantage&#151;if I may put it that way&#151;of finalising the spending review and other decisions of government. We are, therefore, aiming to produce a White Paper in the autumn.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para37"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Byford, made a few aspersions in relation to some reports in today's newspapers. I can assure the noble Baroness that there was no such briefing; indeed, when I left my department at 1 o'clock this lunch-time, the Statement had not been finalised. Therefore, it would be impossible for anyone to have received it before that time. I believe that we can ignore that aspect of the matter.
<P>


<a name="column_1503"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1503</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para38"></a>However, the more important accusation that the noble Baroness made related to fact that, by this Statement, we are threatening further action. Everyone has known the potential constitutional position both on the previous, and on any new, legislation. The noble Baroness introduced the rather novel constitutional precept that I have heard repeated quite widely around the House over the past 48 hours; namely, that we would add up the scores of this House and those of another place. As noble Lords well know, that is not the way that the procedure works. Both Houses have to reach their conclusion, and it is to be hoped that we reach a conclusion that is at least acceptable, even if it is not entirely what either wants. However, if that process fails, the Government&#151;or, more accurately, the House of Commons, as it will be on a free vote&#151;would have the option of invoking the Parliament Act.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para39"></a>We believe that this issue has been around for long enough. We have had a sufficient number of debates on the subject, in which everyone has expressed his or her point of view. If, following the consultation&#151;and, it is to be hoped, the taking on board of many of the points raised&#151;the Bill then produced is adopted by the House of Commons, we are indicating that we would not stand in the way of the other place using the Parliament Act finally to resolve the issue, and thus meet our manifesto commitment that we would solve the matter in this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para40"></a>Mention was made of the definition of "utility". Clearly, the prime reason for hunting tends to be pest control. However, there are other potential benefits from hunting, including economic considerations, that will need to be taken into the balance. The main concern among those who wish to promote a restriction or a ban on hunting is, of course, cruelty. When the noble Lord, Lord Burns, referred to "cruelty", I believe that he did so in the context that we already have a definition in existing legislation. The issue is whether the consideration of other factors means that the definition of the word has at least to be modified in the light of aspects of utility. We are not balancing one against the other, but we must also take issues of utility into account. That is the basis of the approach to drafting the new Bill.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para41"></a>The response to the Statement indicates that we still have a long way to go in the consultation process, in the re-engagement of the various parties&#151;both parliamentary and otherwise&#151;and in the drafting of the Bill. We have given an indication of the time-scale on which the Bill will be produced&#151;namely, six months&#151;and of the process that will ensue if, regrettably, we still end up in a deadlock. That is simply a statement as to the reality of the situation. I hope that we can move to more of a consensus on the issue. However, if we cannot, the use of the Parliament Act is, therefore, promised.
<P>

<a name="20321-09_time4"></a><H5>5.28 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hurd of Westwell: </B>   My Lords, it seems to me that the Minister has not fully understood the point made by my noble friend on the Front Bench about the leak of information. She was not suggesting that the <P>


<a name="column_1504"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1504</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>contents of the Statement had been leaked: I believe that my noble friend was referring to the very detailed accounts to be found in several newspapers this morning. Such reports referred not to the Statement but to the Bill that will eventually be introduced. Is that not rather a serious matter?
<P>

<a name="20321-09_para42"></a>When repeating the Statement, the noble Lord talked about certain principles and a process of consultation after which time a Bill will be produced. However, it is quite evident that someone connected with government has been reassuring those in favour of a total ban that their wishes&#151;90 per cent according to one report&#151;will be met. That reflects quite a different, divisive and belligerent approach, and, indeed, one quite contrary to what the Minister has been trying to convey to the House this afternoon. Can he clarify the position?
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020321/text/20321-10.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I can assure the House that no Bill exists; nor does even the outline of such a Bill exist. However, all of these issues have been fairly well aired, and, in the light of the contrary decisions of the two Houses, they have been discussed widely in political and journalistic circles. I assure the House that there has been no decision on the nature of the Bill pending the consultation, and there has been no spelling out to journalists or anybody else what the nature of that Bill will be. My Statement today clearly indicated the process. Also, it is stating the obvious to say that we know where the House of Commons stands and we know what will be required to meet many of the present concerns in the House of Commons. We have a consultation period to undergo, during which we can perhaps establish more common ground on which a further Bill could be based. In any case, the position taken by the other place the other night would need to be translated into legislative terms and there are different ways of doing that.
<P>

<a name="20321-10_para0"></a>So, in relation to belligerence, I am afraid that I have to make it clear to Members of this House that, at the end of the day, their votes cannot be added to those of the House of Commons and, if the normal process fails, the will of the House of Commons will prevail.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hoyle: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the early response from the Government. I also welcome the fact that, if a real debate does not take place, the Parliament Act will be used and the fact that due weight will be given to the views of the elected House. I hope that the spirit of libertarianism that was shown in the House the other day continues for a long time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I accept the welcome from my noble friend. There will be different interpretations of precisely what he meant by his last sentence. No doubt, he will enlighten us.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord King of Bridgwater: </B>   My Lords, the Minister rightly said that it could not be guaranteed that the votes of this House would be counted equal to those of the House of Commons. However, he gave the House a pledge on behalf of his colleague, Mr Alun Michael&#151;who, as he said, is in charge of the matter&#151;<P>


<a name="column_1505"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1505</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that the views expressed in this House would be carefully considered before any decisions were taken. I am sure that the Minister gave that pledge in good faith, but it has been dishonoured by the Statement.
<P>

<a name="20321-10_para1"></a>There is no secret about it. Anyone who has been around for any time in government or Parliament knows what the Statement means. The views of the House have not been taken into account, and that is the worst possible prelude. The Minister pleads for understanding, co-operation and proper consultation, when the first process of consultation&#151;a proper debate in this House and a proper moment for the assessment of our views&#151;has been so manifestly dishonoured.
<P>

<a name="20321-10_para2"></a>The Statement was fairly opaque in places. On the second page, there are clear assurances about timing and outcome and that there will be engagement with those campaigning for a ban on hunting, Members of the House of Commons, Members of this House, and those involved in land management. There is no indication that there will be any engagement with those who happen to regard the policy&#151;if the newspaper reports of it are accurate&#151;as a disaster for many parts of the country. They would expect to be fully engaged in the process.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, my right honourable friend made it clear that he would engage with all sides of the argument. The Statement refers to Members of the House of Commons and the view that they took. It was, after all, a Statement to the House of Commons, which has made its views clear, and the Minister is responsible to that House. It also said explicitly in the Statement that he would take into account views that had already been expressed here in the debate and views that might be expressed during the six-month period.
<P>

<a name="20321-10_para3"></a>The Statement is not opaque. At least, it is no more opaque than many government Statements. It is fairly clear that the process of consultation will take place; that there will be an assessment of the views that are put to Alun Michael during that period; and that the Bill will be drafted in the light of those opinions. It is a political reality that the House of Commons has made its view clear, as of now. It is also clear that there will now be a period of reflection and consultation, before we produce the legislation. When we produce the legislation, it will go through the normal process. I hope that we can establish other principles and bases for that legislation. The only thing that is spelt out&#151;it is blindingly obvious, not opaque&#151;is that, at the end of the day, we think that the issue has gone on for too long and the Parliament Act might be invoked.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Greaves: </B>   My Lords, I shall take up the point made by&#151;I was going to say, "my old friend", but that is not appropriate in this House&#151;my old sparring partner, the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle. Up to now, this has been a matter for a free vote, here and in another place. That was true of the previous Bill, in which there were three options. People were able to vote for what they wanted. It has also been true of the debates in this Parliament.
<P>


<a name="column_1506"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1506</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-10_para4"></a>Are the Government saying that they will introduce a government Bill that will represent their settled view, after the six months' consultation, and that they will do what they usually do with government Bills and apply the Whip, in this House and in another place? If that is not the case, what guarantee is there that the Bill that arrives in this House from another place will be the Government's Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, contrary to what the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, suggests, we have made it explicit that, although the Government will produce the Bill, it will be the subject of a free vote in both Houses, as was the Private Member's Bill and as were the Motions debated this week. The principle of a free vote throughout Parliament still applies: Whips will not be applied on this side of the House or, I suspect, in other parties.
<P>

<a name="20321-10_para5"></a>I hope that that clarifies the situation. Of course, the Bill that arrives here will be the House of Commons' Bill, which may not be the same as the original government Bill. That is stating the obvious.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend on the Minister's decision to have a period of reflection, rather than follow the line of a "virtual ban", which was apparently briefed overnight from somewhere to the newspapers. That is a positive move.
<P>

<a name="20321-10_para6"></a>Following up what was said on the Benches opposite, I ask the Minister for a positive assurance that the final Bill, which will include the Government's decisions, will, in the search for common ground&#151;a crucial part of the process and a good objective&#151;include not only the views of this House as part of Parliament but those of the people in the countryside who will be most affected by a virtual ban, should the Government pursue that policy.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I cannot predict the extent of support for the common ground that will emerge from the process. All I am saying is that it will be the objective of my right honourable friend to seek what common ground there is, before producing a Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, the Government have accepted the principle that foxes must be controlled and seek to implement the principle that unnecessary cruelty should not be inflicted, with which one cannot quarrel. Can the Minister give an undertaking that no law will be passed that substitutes a more cruel or equally cruel method of control than fox hunting?
<P>

<a name="20321-10_para7"></a>The Government said that they,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"could not properly stand in the way of the application of the Parliament Act",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-10_para8"></a>
if the new Bill were to be frustrated in its passage, rather than&#151;I emphasise&#151;"scrutinised and improved". Will the Minister undertake that, if the role of this House is restricted to scrutiny and improvement, the Government will properly stand in the way of the application of the Parliament Act?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, as I said, the Bill will go through the normal process. If improvements are <P>


<a name="column_1507"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1507</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>introduced in this House during that process and they are acceptable to the House of Commons, they will be accepted in the Bill. However, were there still to be deadlock, the situation that I described in relation to the Parliament Act would apply. If the question is whether it is worth while for this House to scrutinise and attempt to improve the Bill, the answer is that it is. That is part of the process of trying to reach as much common ground as we can through parliamentary and other processes.
<P>

<a name="20321-10_para9"></a>I am not sure that I can give the noble Lord, Lord Elton, a straight answer to his first question. After all, as my noble friend Lord Hoyle and others said, only about six per cent of the control of foxes is through hunting with hounds. There are subjective arguments about whether that is more or less cruel than other forms of controlling foxes. The question is whether that six per cent should continue to exist, be reduced or eliminated. The balance may well depend on the exact outcome and the exact law. I cannot give a clear assurance on that either way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-10_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell-Savours: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend will be aware that some of us who are opposed to hunting are nevertheless concerned about the impact of a ban on the foot and fell packs in some of Britain's national parks. I refer in particular to the Lake District National Park where special conditions exist, most especially in the area of lambing. Can my noble friend give an assurance that during the course of the consultation, adequate regard will be given to those difficulties?

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, local concerns will be taken fully into account during the consultation. I should have made that point clear in my response to the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, because she too asked whether local concerns would be taken into account. Although we may not put in place an entire structure of local consultation, we shall need to take into consideration the conditions and problems peculiar to certain parts of the country, including the Lake District.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   My Lords, are the consultation documents ready for publication? If not, when will they be ready? Once they have been prepared, when will they be circulated?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I regret that I cannot give the noble Baroness answers to her questions. The documents are not ready; they are not even at an early stage of drafting. However, following the Easter break we shall be very much engaged in the process and documentation will form a part of that. Although the documents do not exist at present, they will do so very shortly. More than that, I cannot say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Monson: </B>   My Lords, in the Statement the Minister proclaimed that hunting is on the margins of the real debate about the priorities set out in the rural White Paper. While that may be true or partly true, <P>


<a name="column_1508"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1508</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will he accept that hunting is not by any means on the margins of the real debate about the growing threat to British traditions of individual freedom?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I do not accept that. Hunting is an issue which can cause great excitement on all sides of the argument and therefore its importance is exaggerated by those both for and against it. That is the case in all kinds of contexts, including those of human rights. I do not believe that whether or not we ban hunting has any serious implication for other aspects of life, whether rural or in our more general civic society. Views on hunting are minority opinions on both sides of the argument, although both sides believe that it is extremely important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Golding: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend say when the period of six months' consultation is to start? It was made clear in the other place that it was due to start now. However, if the consultation papers have not yet been sent out, or if they have not even been prepared, then when will the six-month period begin?
<P>

<a name="20321-11_para0"></a>Can my noble friend also tell the House who, once the submissions have been made, is to consider them?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the six-month period does indeed start now.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew7"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, there is no inhibition on Members of your Lordships' House or on anyone outside this place with regard to expressing their views before they have received a particular document. This issue has been around for so long that it is not necessary to consult a document in order to express views.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Byford: </B>   My Lords, I think that the noble Lord has been a little disingenuous to the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   My Lords, order. This is the time allotted to Back Benchers for questions.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   My Lords, it seems that the root problem for the other place is the fact that people enjoy hunting with hounds. Can the noble Lord assure the House that, should the three million anglers who go fishing begin to show the slightest sign of enjoyment, they too will be in trouble?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I share with the noble Baroness her incredulity that any enjoyment can be <P>


<a name="column_1509"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1509</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>derived from angling. Nevertheless, we have made it absolutely clear that no such intention will be pursued in relation to shooting or angling.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Golding: </B>   My Lords, the Minister did not respond to my second question. Who will consider and prepare the legislation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, it is intended that the Government will consider the matter and produce the Bill. It will then go through the process that I have already described.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Monro of Langholm: </B>   My Lords, the Minister said that there will be no restriction on shooting, but day after day restrictions are being imposed by stealth. It is becoming harder than ever to acquire a shotgun certificate, in particular for young applicants. Ultimately shooting will be dramatically affected by such practices.
<P>

<a name="20321-11_para1"></a>Can the Minister give me an assurance that he will speak to the government business managers of another place and say that we do not expect another place to guillotine the Committee stage, guillotine the proceedings on Report, guillotine the Third Reading and then send on to this House an absolute shambles of a Bill? We want to hold a proper, democratic debate so that each side is given a fair amount of time. In that way we shall be able to make progress in this House. However, that will not be achieved under the authoritarian attitude with which legislation is presently dealt with in another place.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Whitty </B>   My Lords, I would not dream of trying to instruct the business managers of another place. That has long been the tradition of this House. If the converse were the case, this House would rightly resent it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Palmer: </B>   My Lords, could the noble Lord explain once more to the House why hunting with dogs should take precedence over all the other desperately pressing problems facing the country? Many people do not understand why hunting is so much more important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I appreciate that many Members of your Lordships' House find it difficult to understand this matter. Nonetheless, hunting has been a major political issue for over two decades in this country. It is time that it was resolved. In our manifesto, for which people voted rather overwhelmingly, we gave a commitment that the question would be resolved during this Parliament. We are therefore fulfilling our promise.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew19"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the request for trust put forward on the part of his colleagues has been made on rather shaky ground, given that both sides of the argument can claim to have been badly misled by the Government in their handling of this issue over the past four years? Does he <P>


<a name="column_1510"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1510</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>further agree therefore that the period of consultation needs to be transparently fair, thus ensuring that no complaint can be made by either side about its ability to have its opinion heard, and so that there is no temptation to indulge in extra-parliamentary action? It is very important that Parliament should handle this issue&#151;on which great emotions are felt on both sides&#151;so that both opinions are assured that here, in Parliament, they have had a chance to state their case.
<P>

<a name="20321-11_para2"></a>When I spoke in the debate the other day, I put forward a proposal to set up a pre-legislative Joint Select Committee. Whether that was effective, I do not know. However, some means must be found to ensure that the campaigning groups outside this place are given access in the most transparent manner before legislation is brought forward. At the moment, the Government's record on this is very shaky indeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I do not accept the first or the last points put by the noble Lord. We have genuinely endeavoured to find a solution. I can assure him that the consultation process will certainly be transparent. It will be accessible to all the groups to which he referred, as it will be to all parliamentary opinion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, we have had 20 minutes of questions on the Statement from Back Benchers, but I feel that the House would like to hear from the noble Lord, Lord Denham, if he can keep his remarks fairly brief.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew23"></A><B> Lord Denham: </B>   My Lord, I am most grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Leader of the House. On a point of order, the noble Baroness stated that 20 minutes are allotted to Back Benchers. The first proceedings on a debate of this kind are taken by the Leaders of all sides, and responses are given to them. It is then the turn of Back Benchers for the following 20 minutes.
<P>

<a name="20321-11_para3"></a>I should like to ask for clarification. I have never understood that it would be out of order, if a point arose during the time allotted to Back Benchers, for someone on the Front Bench who had spoken previously to rise to query a minor point? I had not realised that he or she would be out of order in so doing. Is that right or is that wrong? I should not like to make a point of order "on the hoof", so to speak. Perhaps we should consider whether or not this is wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-11_spnew24"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the basic answer to the question put by the noble Lord, Lord Denham, is to be found in paragraph 4.81 of the Companion:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The period of questions and answers which then follows for backbench Members should not exceed 20 minutes from the end of the minister's initial reply to the Opposition spokesmen".

<a name="column_1511"></a>

That is the principle. I do not think that it deals particularly with the noble Lord's question because I do not believe that specific guidance can be found. What I try to do is to meet the wishes of the House as appropriate.

<P>
<A NAME="20321-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy </B>   moved Amendment No. 84:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 28, line 30, at end insert ", and indicate which authority is to take the lead in the formulation of such strategies"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-12_para0"></a><P>

<a name="20321-12_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 84 relates to Clause 22 and deals with health and well-being strategies. The concept of such strategies drawn up by local authorities and local health boards is attractive. We are all aware of the relationship between people's health and their physical and mental environment, and of the inevitable overlap between the health sphere and the sphere of local government.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para2"></a>There are some areas&#151;I am thinking particularly of social services&#151;where there is a close relationship which is to be found in all parts of Wales. The relationship may be particularly important where there is a high proportion of elderly people in the population, as in the retirement areas of North Wales. There are other areas, such as the valleys of South Wales, where the working environment and its legacy may still be an important determinant of people's health. I am sure that there are other areas where housing conditions are a primary concern. We still have a great deal of pre-1918 housing.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para3"></a>Health and well-being strategies are therefore likely to vary in their priorities in different parts of Wales. Obviously, they will also have much in common, such as health promotion, but my main concern is to establish through the amendment which body is to take the lead in drawing up such strategies.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para4"></a>The clause opens by laying a duty on both types of authority&#151;local government and health authority&#151;to act jointly in formulating and implementing strategies. But, as I am sure the noble Baroness will realise, the danger is that neither will get far without one or other taking the lead, depending on what is perceived to be the major problem of the area and whether it is clearly in the health field or a local government responsibility. The clause is silent on that point. I shall be interested to hear what the noble Baroness has to say. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   The noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, has raised an important aspect of the Bill in terms of the way in which the formulation of policies will occur within the local <P>


<a name="column_1512"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1512</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>health boards. The effect of the amendment would undermine the principle of joint ownership of each health and well-being strategy and the partnership principles which underpin the NHS Plan in Wales.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para5"></a>The National Assembly will give advice in guidance about how the responsible bodies should work jointly to formulate and implement the strategy. In doing so, the National Assembly intends to leave as much as possible to local determination. Local partners, therefore, will determine the local arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para6"></a>It is the wish of those involved in developing the proposals in Wales that these partnerships will be across local government and the voluntary sector and, as the noble Lord recognised, develop in line with the circumstances prevailing in particular health board areas.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para7"></a>However, I am able to reassure the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Conwy, that should any problem arise where a particular health and well-being strategy was not being progressed under the joint requirements, the National Assembly would seek to work with the relevant authorities to find a solution. It could ultimately use direction-making powers were they to be necessary. In the light of those assurances, I hope that the noble Lord will not press his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-12_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, perhaps she will try to imagine the situation that will arise when this part of the Bill is implemented. I am sure that she is well placed to do so. Would it not be helpful to the Assembly if it was required to decide who was the lead authority? There could be a problem in this area, and all that my noble friend is suggesting is that the Assembly should be required to do that&#151;naturally in consultation. To leave it out would be asking for trouble for the Assembly.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-12_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Farrington of Ribbleton: </B>   I have failed to make clear the position which is being taken by the Assembly following detailed consultation. It is taking the view that it is not for the Assembly to direct who the lead authority should be but that that should develop at local level. The local partnership should bring in all parties to consider how best to develop the health and well-being strategy. The view that one authority must be the lead authority imposed by the Assembly is in conflict with the whole ethos of the development of the health service strategy in Wales.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-12_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Roberts of Conwy: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for her reply. I made the point simply to highlight the possibility that there could be difficulties so far as leadership was concerned in formulating these health and well-being strategies. She has reassured me. Indeed, I am reassured by the contents of the Bill because Clause 22(6)(b) refers to the fact that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The regulations may, in particular, make provision as to ... steps which the responsible bodies must take before formulating the strategy".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-12_para8"></a><P>

<a name="20321-12_para9"></a>I heard what the noble Baroness said about the fact that if there is difficulty the Assembly can step in, but it is quite clear&#151;I do not think that she will dissent from <P>


<a name="column_1513"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1513</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>what I said earlier&#151;that the primary concerns of these strategies will vary as between different areas. It is important that that point is taken on board and that the Assembly, if necessary, can give guidance as to who should take the lead. Having been reassured by the noble Baroness, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

"( ) the imposition of a duty on the responsible bodies to include steps to improve the eye health of, and the provision of eye care to, the public in the area."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-12_para12"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 85, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 87 and 159. The Minister will note that this is my one foray into Welsh health matters. I do so only because of the importance of the issue of visual impairment. The amendments cover both England and Wales in different ways.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para13"></a>Clause 22 imposes a duty on local authorities and local health boards in Wales to formulate and implement a health and well-being strategy for their area. Amendment No. 85 would help to ensure that regulations made by the National Assembly for Wales could include provision for a duty to be imposed on both to include steps to improve the eye health of, and the provision of eye care to, the public in each area.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para14"></a>Amendment No. 87 is designed to ensure that any health improvement plan drawn up under the Health Act&#151;I apologise if I have confused the Minister. There is a misprint in the amendment. The reference should be to the Health Act 1999, not the Health and Social Care Act 2001. The Bill should include a strategy,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to improve the eye health of, and the provision of eye care to, the public in the area",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-12_para15"></a>
and, of course, that applies to England. These two amendments are promoted by the Improving Lives Coalition, which is composed of over 100 organisations in the field of visual impairment.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para16"></a>Why are the amendments necessary? Eye health is accorded low priority at primary care level and has not been a major feature of health improvement plans. Despite the prevalence figures, eye health has been accorded woefully little importance by primary care planners.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para17"></a>One of the reasons for this is that there is a mistaken assumption that visual impairment is a low incidence disability. That is not correct. Two million people in the UK are affected by uncorrectable sight loss; two-thirds of these have another disability or a serious health problem such as deafness, arthritis or diabetes. Currently, 90 per cent of blind or partially sighted people are aged 60 and over. One in five people over 75 has a sight problem. Within the next 30 years, about 40 per cent of the UK population will be aged 60 and over, which means that 2.5 million people will be living <P>


<a name="column_1514"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1514</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with a visual impairment. Over two-thirds of those who are eligible are not registered as blind or partially sighted.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para18"></a>There is strong evidence that adults in the UK are at risk of developing eye disease and other sight problems because they are not regularly having check-ups. Services have failed to pick up at least 1 million people with an eye condition which is either treatable or remediable, or which could be compensated for in some measure by rehabilitative services and equipment. Eight-five per cent of people over 65 who have cataracts and 75 per cent who have glaucoma have no contact with eye specialists. The number of overall sight tests since the extension of free eye tests to the over-60s has risen by only a small amount. People from certain ethnic backgrounds&#151;for example, Afro-Caribbean and South Asian&#151; are at greatly increased risk of glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy. One in five school-age children have undetected poor sight. People on low incomes are unaware of the exemption categories and low-income concession scheme and are not having sufficient eye tests. Further evidence can be obtained from a recent report from the Patients Association which demonstrates the inadequate information and access to treatments for major causes of blindness and visual impairment.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para19"></a>The detection of eye disease and low vision happens at primary care level&#151;critically, through the NHS sight test, which is also an eye health examination. But unless and until this matter is re-prioritised in local health strategies, and proper monitoring and targets are put in place for addressing under-identification and low take-up of services by at-risk groups, people will continue to lose their sight unnecessarily.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para20"></a>The cost to the NHS of failing to re-prioritise eye health at primary care level will be huge. The risk of hip fracture is doubled in people with poor and moderately impaired vision. The cost to the National Health Service of treating sight-related falls and injuries among older people is estimated at &#163;221 million, as against &#163;25 million for rehabilitation and prevention.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para21"></a>Amendment No. 159 seeks to insert a new clause setting up low vision committees. It would require,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"each local authority in England and Wales; and ... each Primary Care Trust in England and local health board in Wales, jointly to establish and support a Low Vision Committee ... for the purpose of co-ordinating multi-disciplinary low vision services for persons with low vision".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-12_para22"></a><P>

<a name="20321-12_para23"></a>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that low vision services become more uniformly available and are better co-ordinated across England and Wales. Low vision affects nearly 2 million people. Low vision services are crucial for rehabilitation, the prevention of accidents and the amelioration of general health. They depend on effective, patient-centred, inter-disciplinary working.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para24"></a>There is a nationally agreed framework in England and Wales respectively for the way in which the disciplines can work together to provide effective care for people who lose their sight. However, without statutory provision for low vision committees, services will remain extremely patchy and unco-ordinated.

<P>

<a name="20321-12_para25"></a>What is a low vision service? It is a rehabilitative process which provides a range of services for people with low vision to enable them to make use of their eyesight to achieve maximum potential. It involves assessing the person's visual function. It involves providing aid, such as hand and stand magnifiers, telescopes, spectacle mounted aids, task lights and so on. It involves addressing psychological and emotional needs and facilitating modification to the home, school or work environments.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para26"></a>Who provides these services? There are a huge range of practitioners involved in delivering them. Ophthalmologists undertake the clinical diagnosis; optometrists will be involved in low vision assessment, and often the provision of low vision aids. GPs need to be able to refer patients quickly. Rehabilitation workers and local societies for blind and partially sighted people provide advice, information, low vision aids and training. Other specialist practitioners need to be involved; for example, to deliver an effective children's low vision service. I could continue. There are a number of other professionals involved in the process.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para27"></a>Research by the RNIB has found that more than half of the low vision teams contain only one type of professional group. One team in 10 has no link with any other agency. The amendment specifies that the membership of low vision committees must include a range of professionals such as the ones I have mentioned.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para28"></a>Why is the amendment necessary? A lack of low vision services will mean more residential care and attendance costs for local authorities. Such a core rehabilitation service should be uniformly provided in the UK; but two out of every five potential service providers do not deliver any low vision services whatever, with some areas of the country left out altogether.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para29"></a>Challenging AMD in Europe, a report from the AMD Alliance UK published in September, indicated that the UK was among the worst of the countries surveyed in providing rehabilitation services to people with age-related macular degeneration&#151;the leading cause of sight loss in the UK.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para30"></a>Current government initiatives relating to community equipment, pooling budgets and joint assessments&#151;valuable though they are&#151;will not make sufficient impact in this area because they are too generic and do not give a strong steer to PCTs and social services departments to prioritise low vision services. The National Assembly for Wales has begun to address the need for a low vision framework in Wales; but again, without any statutory requirement, services may be slow to develop.
<P>

<a name="20321-12_para31"></a>Three years ago, a report was published by the Low Vision Services Consensus Group, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding. I am delighted to see the noble Lord in his place. It involved all the voluntary and professional interests engaged in these issues. Its central recommendation was for low vision committees to be established in every local area. A similar report was subsequently issued in Wales.
<P>

<P>

<a name="20321-12_para32"></a>The then Health Secretary commended the report to primary care groups, hospital eye departments, social services and voluntary agencies. If the Government still agree with every agency in the visual impairment field that low vision committees provide the best means of ensuring an integrated model of service, they should accept the amendment and insist that such a provision is written into the legislation. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Jenkin of Roding: </B>   I completely agree with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has said&#151;with the exception of his ever-generous reference to myself. I did not chair the committee that produced the recommendation, although I played some part in its being set up. Perhaps I may weary the Committee with just a couple of sentences of reminiscence.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para0"></a>I had been invited to join the council of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in the late 1980s. That brought me into contact with a number of other national voluntary organisations for the blind and partially sighted. There was no machinery at all for trying to bring those bodies together, although many worked for the same ends. I set up and chaired for 10 years the visual handicap group, which consisted of those national voluntary bodies. We produced a report on better services for the visually handicapped, which was widely received and commented on favourably, not least by the Department of Health. We produced another report on the training of people to work with the blind and visually handicapped&#151;an issue that had fallen through the wickerwork since the old blind workers disappeared with the Seebohm changes in social work.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para1"></a>We also produced a report on low vision&#151;the subject of Amendment No. 159. To many of us&#151;this is not meant to be a pun&#151;it was an eye-opener to see how inadequate services were across the country for people with low vision. Many patients who were examined by an ophthalmologist were simply told, "I am afraid that there is nothing more that medicine can do for you. You are going blind. Have you got somebody to take you home?". As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, it is a terrible shock for a patient to be told that they have an irreversible condition&#151;although many people would now argue that some conditions are not as irreversible as they were once thought to be.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para2"></a>We found that in many cases across the country there were virtually no services to pick up those people and make sure that they were given the help they needed. Some areas were lucky in having an effective voluntary organisation. A year or two after we produced our report, I was presiding over a meeting of the Wanstead and Woodford association for the blind and partially sighted. A consultant from Chelmsford told us what the Essex Voluntary Association for the Blind was doing. He spelt out almost exactly the contents of Amendment No. 159. That was being done in conjunction with the health authority and the local authorities. However, that situation was exceptional. I am not in the least surprised that the body that followed on from the visual handicap group&#151;the <P>


<a name="column_1517"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1517</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>body that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred to&#151;came to the conclusion that something more positive is now needed to ensure that there are services to pick up and help patients who are diagnosed as having low vision. Many of them are elderly, but not all.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para3"></a>I strongly support Amendment No. 159, because it seems to be the way ahead. I probably said when I was on the ministerial Bench that we already have a plethora of committees. I have some sympathy with that view, but I am convinced by the evidence that has been produced by Robin Birch and his Low Vision Services Consensus Group. The issue will be dealt with effectively only if every area has to have a low vision committee.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para4"></a>I am not wedded to the full details of Amendment No. 159. It is a brave start, but the issue needs to be discussed fully with Ministers and other bodies to ensure that the provision is effective and workable and not too expensive. However, it is clear beyond peradventure that there is a need for something. The amendment gives us a chance to express a view in support of that. I hope that we shall do so. As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, those with a visual handicap have not been properly recognised in services. There are individual services such as sight tests and people can get glasses, but so much more needs to be done to allow those with low vision to be able to play their full role and develop their potential in the community and to allow old people to live independent lives. We need to address that. It is good that the amendment does so and I therefore warmly commend it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-13_spnew1"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I have added my name to the amendments, which raise issues with far-reaching implications for the health service that I believe are of the highest importance for patients. I endorse everything that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and my noble friend Lord Jenkin have said. It is difficult to overstate the extent to which eye disease and visual impairment impact on the lives of those so afflicted. As my noble friend has graphically described, to lose one's sight is a deeply traumatic event, which in many cases is a precursor to all kinds of misery, such as unemployment, state dependence and mental illness. As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, informed us, many people in this country are affected by uncorrectable sight loss and the numbers are growing.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para5"></a>Much eye disease is treatable and preventable if caught early. However, compared with some other countries, we are not nearly as good as we should be in giving eye health appropriate priority at primary care level. Partly because the scale of the problem is not sufficiently appreciated, we tend not to be good enough at bringing information and help to those visually impaired people who need it.
<P>


<a name="column_1518"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1518</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para6"></a>Information for the blind is not an add-on extra; it is an essential part of good quality care that can result directly in improved recovery from illness, the more effective use of health services and the avoidance of serious medical accidents.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para7"></a>In recent years, there has been what I can only call an abdication by some health authorities and trusts of services tailored specifically to the needs of the blind or partially sighted. In the face of that, it is difficult to have confidence that PCTs will be able to establish any more creditable track record without a bit of gentle prodding. If the relevant services are to improve, we need to ensure that there are people tasked specifically with making the right things happen at local level. Low vision services committees provide an ideal mechanism for taking that mission forward. As we have heard, those committees emerged out of the very useful work of the Low Vision Services Consensus Group three years ago, for which my noble friend Lord Jenkin deserves a great deal of personal credit. Since then they have been encouraged by grant funding from the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para8"></a>There are two elements to the rationale for those committees. One is to bring together all the key stakeholders in the delivery of services&#151;doctors, ophthalmologists, social services, specialist workers, service users and others&#151;so that everyone communicates properly. Without such grouping, there is inadequate co-ordination. The second might be called commissioning muscle. Users and voluntary organisations need to be assured that their voice will be heard and their needs will be fully taken into account by PCTs and local authorities when services are being planned. I am convinced that a statutory duty to establish and support those committees would make a huge difference to the current unsatisfactory pattern of services.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para9"></a>What about providing accessible information to the visually impaired? The work of charities such as the RNIB in monitoring the provision of such services goes largely unsung. It should not be up to voluntary organisations to shoulder the task on their own. It should be done at national level, preferably by CHI. Health authorities and trusts are on the whole very dilatory about identifying those in need and having proper procedures and training. We need national benchmarks.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para10"></a>For those reasons I urge the Government to take the amendments seriously. The Minister may say that these are essentially matters for local decision-making, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, pointed out, the current mechanisms, such as pooling budgets, will not be enough on their own to do the trick, because they do not send out specific messages about the importance of low vision services.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para11"></a>I hope that the Minister will at least reflect on the amendments in a positive spirit before Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   This has been a very interesting debate. I think that we are all at one in wanting to ensure that good eye care services are available throughout the National Health Service. I <P>


<a name="column_1519"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1519</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>am very much aware of the recent survey by the Patients Association which suggested that provision of ophthalmic services is variable across the country and that, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said, eye care is not always seen as a priority by health authorities. I very much agree with the general sentiments that have been raised in this short debate.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para12"></a>I have problems, however, with the suggestion that primary legislation is the route we should take to improve services. I also have problems with the suggestion that we should single out eye care services above all others to include in primary care legislation. I am sorry that the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, is not with us today. In one sense, this debate seems to take us back to our earlier debate&#151;which now seems a long time ago&#151;on Clause 1 and the dilemma of developing policy and targets for the health service. The criticism in that debate was that the Government are setting the NHS too many targets, offering it too much guidance, and trying to constrain its functions and responsibilities in far too many ways. It is now being proposed that, in primary legislation, we should be very directional by telling the health service what it should do in particular spheres.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para13"></a>Noble Lords' reasons for wishing to do that are quite understandable. I am sure that all noble Lords wish to see improvement in eye care services. However, I am sure that noble Lords will also appreciate that the more we seek to constrain the work of the NHS, the more we shall have a problem of too many targets and too many priorities. It is a dilemma. I should therefore like to explain in a little detail the Government's work on eye care services, and then deal with the work on developing the eye committees which have been established in various parts of the country.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para14"></a>The Government's first action was to restore the free NHS eye test for everyone 60 and over, at a cost of &#163;50 million annually. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, suggested, that group is most vulnerable to eye disease and stands to benefit most from regular eye examinations. In 1999-2000, there were more than 2 million extra NHS sight tests, following the extension of eligibility for free tests. We are also taking steps to improve cataract services and have allocated an extra &#163;20 million over two years to fund the capital costs of 60 schemes to improve treatment facilities and reduce waiting times. We believe that this investment will considerably improve the standard of eye care and greatly improve the quality of life particularly of older people. I am also glad to report that the number of NHS consultants in ophthalmology has increased by about 4 per cent in each of the past four years and will increase, from the current level of 651, to 895 by 2010.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para15"></a>I therefore hope that noble Lords will accept that the Government are committed to ensuring that good standards of eye care are provided for the population. As I said, I am not at all convinced that this group of amendments would help to improve the position. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has corrected the amendment&#151;which was new Clause 24&#151;and that he intended to require that health improvement plans should include strategies for improving eye health and eye care services. That would <P>


<a name="column_1520"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1520</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>require an amendment to Section 28 of the Health Act 1999, which places a duty on each health authority to prepare a plan that sets out a strategy to improve the health of those for whom they are responsible and the provision of healthcare to those people.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para16"></a>I stress that health improvement plans&#151;HIMPs&#151;are strategic documents. We believe that, as such, it would be inappropriate for them to contain a lot of detail on specific activity in the health system. Surely it should be for localities to decide how to meet the identified priorities. I also question whether prescribing from the centre what HIMPs should contain would be contrary to the underlying principles of shifting the balance of power to the local level. All noble Lords seemed to agree with those principles when we debated them 10 days ago.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para17"></a>The HIMP process has to work effectively. In future, local voluntary organisations, service users, carers and the public will have a greater role to play in the development of the HIMP. The Health and Social Care Act 2001 underpins the patient's and the public's involvement in the development of the HIMP. The Act places a duty on NHS bodies to involve patients and the public in the planning and development of services. We shall also eventually, although probably not tonight, debate the issue of patient forums which will be established for every trust. They will play a very valuable role in discovering what patients think about the quality of local services, monitoring quality from the patient's perspective, and working with the local trust to bring about improvements. That, too, will inform the local priority-setting and planning process.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para18"></a>The position in Wales is similar. In line with the principle of devolution, the National Assembly will determine the form and contents of health and well-being strategies. The National Assembly intends to give advice about how the responsible bodies will work jointly to formulate and implement the strategy. The Assembly will also determine how prescriptive the regulations and guidance should be. Where possible, however, we hope that local partners are able to determine arrangements according to local priorities.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para19"></a>New Clause 159 would require each primary care trust in England or local health board in Wales, and each local authority in both countries jointly, to establish a low vision committee for the area for which that primary care trust or local health board was established. As mentioned, a report in 1999 by a consensus group of organisations on the future of low vision services recommended the establishment of local vision committees for the purpose of ensuring that services in the UK are provided in accordance with the report's recommendations. I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, for his role in the establishment of that group. However, having seen him play a starring role last night in the parliamentary choir's performance of "Messiah", I realise that he has very many hidden talents.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para20"></a>The Secretary of State for Health commended that report to the NHS and local government. As the noble Earl, Lord Howe, suggested, the department is contributing a grant of &#163;120,000 over three years to <P>


<a name="column_1521"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1521</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provide an implementation officer from the voluntary sector to help in setting up local committees. Good progress is being made. My understanding is that, at the start of the year, 24 committees had been set up, and a number of others are under consideration. The noble Earl also suggested that some gentle prodding is needed. The implementation project is set to run for another 18 months. My view is that it would be inappropriate now to impose a requirement for primary care trusts and local authorities effectively to establish statutory low vision services committees. I think that it would make sense to allow the project to continue and for an evaluation of the committees' impact on service provision to be carried out by the implementation group at the end of that 18-month period.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para21"></a>I would also caution against an overly prescriptive approach. It may be possible to have a good, multi-disciplinary, low-vision service without a formal committee. In some areas the primary care trusts may not always cover the area that is sensible in terms of linking and providing low-vision services, and other models may emerge. Under the present arrangement, the committee is not in the ownership of one body, and that emphasises the essential joint working, which would be important for the successful functioning of any of those committees.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para22"></a>In the light of the debate tonight, the department will monitor what is happening and the progress by the implementation group. We already monitor the uptake of sight tests by eligible groups, and waiting lists. Sites that have been allocated funds for cataract improvement, for example, will also submit progress reports.
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para23"></a>We are represented on the low-vision services implementation group, which receives progress reports on setting up local committees at its meetings two or three times a year. In addition, there is a requirement for the group to make six-monthly progress reports to the department. I assure noble Lords that the department will continue to take a close interest in the progress of the implementation project. I take the view that legislation is not the appropriate route down which we should go, but I hope I have reassured noble Lords that we take a keen interest. I accept that having made progress in the past two or three years, more progress needs to be made.

<A NAME="20321-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply which, in its latter parts, was positive and helpful. In one way it was the reverse of what I expected him to say. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for their supportive comments. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, was clearly so enthusiastic and such a major contributor to the group that the people who briefed me thought that he chaired it. I suspect that that was a sign of his influence on them. I took the point he made that we should not expect to replicate best practice in a voluntary sense; we need an engine to spread it in a more statutory way.

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1522</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-13_para24"></a>I turn to the points made by the Minister on the health improvement plan. If we are not careful, as the Bill goes through the House the Minister will accuse all those who believe in having a pro-active set of national standards of being centralisers. I do not believe that the essence of devolution is to simply wriggle about and say, "I'm sorry; this is not really something we can legislate for or be prescriptive about". "Prescriptive" is a weasel word which has perhaps come back to haunt this side of the Chamber. In the past, we have accused the Government of being over-prescriptive. But there is a median way. The detailed implementation in a decentralised system is a matter for the local primary care trust and the people on the ground. However, when it comes to stating national standards as to how one produces a health improvement plan and what it can contain, one can be entirely strategic in those circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, for giving way. I do not disagree with him when he says that it is right and, indeed, a duty for the Government to set the strategic framework in which HIMPs are developed. That is what we seek to do in the planning priorities guidance that we issue to the health service. That attempts to give a strong steer to the health service on the core priorities it needs to develop. I said earlier that Members of this place can raise a matter which they feel is important&#151;we all agree that eye services are important&#151;but the cumulative effect of treating every service with the same degree of priority would be to end up with a situation in which the health service is presented with 300 different priorities. As we have already discussed in our debates on Clause 1, that would mean ending up with a situation in which there are no priorities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I entirely accept that. I have read all the previous public health White Papers and Green Papers and know about the four key areas of government concentrations and so forth. The argument is not about setting priorities in those terms but about how many targets we set to try to get those priorities implemented. That is where some of the argument about micro-management is concerned. The setting of broad priorities for action is entirely satisfactory. Perhaps the essence of the argument today in terms of low-vision services is to try to push them higher up the agenda in the health service. That is an appropriate way to proceed. I detect that in the second half of his response the Minister accepted some of the argument in that respect.
<P>

<a name="20321-14_para0"></a>Therefore, it is not inappropriate to consider that health improvement plans should address that issue. We believe that they should cover a wide range of matters. Expecting them to cover this matter without stating the way in which they should deal with it or the priority it should be accorded is perfectly proper and an entirely strategic way to approach the matter.
<P>

<a name="20321-14_para1"></a>I turn to more positive ground. I believe that the Minister gave quite a lot of encouragement in response to the gentle prodding point raised by the noble Earl, <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Howe. It would be inconsistent of those on this side of the House to expect PCTs, on top of all the other matters with which they have to deal&#151;we have dealt with that in earlier parts of the Bill&#151;to be over-prodded at this stage in terms of those services. However, I welcome the Minister's commitment that at the end of the 18-month evaluation period by the implementation group there will be a review to see how those services are developing, to see whether the voluntary approach has worked, and then to report back. It is important that the six-monthly progress reports are published and that there is proper dialogue with all the groups to which I have previously referred. That is a fairly formidable coalition. It is highly significant that that has now been formed.
<P>

<a name="20321-14_para2"></a>I take encouragement from the Minister. However, I believe that we may well need to return to the matter, depending on the evaluation that takes place after that period. We can always guarantee that there will be a health Bill passing through this place again. Even if we do not return to the matter on Report, we may well return to it in a future Bill.

<a name="column_1524"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1524</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>instinctive reaction to any problem is to set up one or more new bodies. Since 1997 they have created a long list of bodies: the Human Genetics Commission; the Genetics and Insurance Committee; the NHS Information Authority; the Commission for Health Improvement; the National Institute for Clinical Excellence; the Health Development Agency; the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency; the NHS Logistics Authority; the General Social Care Council and its equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; the National Care Standards Commission; and the National Patient Safety Agency. There are probably others which I have missed.
<P>

<a name="20321-14_para8"></a>In this Bill alone we have a multitude of patients forums, far more than the CHCs which they will replace. We have the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health and the council for the regulation of health care professionals. Since the Bill has been published, the Government have announced, in their response to the Bristol report, the setting up of a council for quality of healthcare. In January, the Chief Medical Officer announced a new national infection control and health protection agency. Only a week or so ago the Secretary of State announced a new board of patient choice trustees. There is no sign that the Government's zeal for new quangos is diminishing.
<P>

<a name="20321-14_para9"></a>I am not seeking to debate the merits of any of those bodies individually. The amendment merely asks for an annual report setting out who the bodies are, their relationship with the Secretary of State, the money provided to them and where their annual report and accounts may be obtained. Importantly, the report should also give the Secretary of State's opinion as to the continued need for the body. If nothing else, it would be an opportunity for the Secretary of State to reflect on the size and nature of his quango empire. It would also give both Houses of Parliament the opportunity to consider the issue too.
<P>

<a name="20321-14_para10"></a>I am aware that much of this information is already available in other places, for example, in an annex to the Department of Health's explanatory plans and information on the Cabinet Office website. The aim of the amendment is to bring together all relevant information relating to the Department of Health once a year and, crucially, to ask the Secretary of State to give his views as to the continued need for the bodies. That, in turn, would approve the accountability of the Secretary of State for the bodies that he has created. I hope that the Minister is in favour of increased accountability and will support the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-14_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   I support the amendment as it is an exceedingly good idea. I went to the launch of a new body last night. It was launched most eloquently by the Minister. It was to do with safety, but I cannot remember the full title.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-14_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   It is the National Patient Safety Agency.

<P>
<P>

<a name="column_1525"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1525</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be useful to have a list of quangos, as it is useful to know how important they are. On matters such as the control of infections in hospitals, for example, we could see how they were doing and the progress on all sorts of issues such as food and so on. The amendment is an excellent idea which I hope the Government will support.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-14_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Pitkeathley: </B>   I cannot see the need for this information because it is already available. I was not sure whether the noble Baroness wanted more information, different information or more information in a different form.
<P>

<a name="20321-14_para11"></a>I currently chair a non-departmental public body which is sponsored by the DCMS, and I am the former chair of a Department of Health-sponsored body&#151;the GSCC. My experience is that NDPBs and all other bodies already produce huge amounts of information, all of which is available to the public. They are required by the Secretary of State to produce strategic plans, business plans, annual reviews and they must meet all kinds of performance targets, including administration costs.
<P>

<a name="20321-14_para12"></a>Clearly they are responsible to Parliament through the Secretary of State. Their boards are appointed through open advertisements by an independent panel and then approved by the Secretary of State. In terms of justifying their continued need, I believe that adequate information structures and systems already exist. I am reluctant to see further requirements being imposed on them, so that they have to spend more time reporting than doing the job that they were set up to do.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-15_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I agree with the noble Baroness about that, but the point of the amendment is probably that it is very much easier to set up a quango than to close it. I do not know whether the noble Barones has ever chaired anything that the Secretary of State tried to close. I have, and the Secretary of State did not close it. It is really quite difficult to shut something down.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para0"></a>We cannot have an ever-expanding empire when some bodies have passed their sell-by date. Whether or not the amendment is the right way to do it, the point is that subsection (3)(f) would require the Secretary of State to say whether the body was still necessary and, if not, what he will do about it. He has to say it with the knowledge of Parliament because the matter will be laid before Parliament. That is the point of the amendment, and if some way could be found to keep that requirement, it would be very helpful. A mushrooming of quangos is not a good idea if some of them are no longer necessary.

<A NAME="20321-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   Clearly we do not want unnecessary quangos. I accept that, and it is important that all the activities of non-departmental bodies are kept under close review.

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1526</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bodies are no longer required because life has moved on, I am all in favour of bringing their activities to an end.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para1"></a>The Government have looked at many non-departmental public bodies and have made changes. For example, we debated the proposals of the Chief Medical Officer on Monday on the surveillance and public health arena. It is proposed that one agency should be established in place of four existing agencies. There are other examples of the Government looking at rationalising non-departmental public bodies.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para2"></a>It is also significant that a number of the bodies to which the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, referred&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, also mentioned the National Patient Safety Agency&#151;carry out important functions in terms of national standard setting. I am thinking about NICE or the Commission for Health Improvement investigating the quality of services at local level, or the National Patient Safety Agency to which National Health Service organisations will report adverse events. From that reporting, we hope to learn ways of improving the quality and safety of healthcare services. Those are important matters that need to be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para3"></a>I would also argue that, having established such national bodies, enabling us to develop national standards, to which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred in the previous amendment, we are then in a much better position to decentralise. We can allow, within that national framework setting, National Health Service organisations at local level to have a much greater ability to decide their own destiny. Throughout the Bill we shall continually debate the balance between national standard setting and local determination. I am convinced that the establishment of a number of agencies at national level will allow us to decentralise more decision-making to local level.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para4"></a>I also agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that openness about the roles and responsibilities of non-departmental public bodies is desirable in health, as across government generally. The Government's wish to promote increased accountability and openness for all quangos led to the publication of the measures in Quangos: Opening the Doors. Considerable progress has been made in this area in the past four years.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para5"></a>As my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley suggested, there does not seem to be much point in publishing again, in another format, information about the Department's quangos that is already available from other sources. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, mentioned the Cabinet Office's annual publication, Public Bodies, which already contains the majority of information dealt with by the amendment, including that for all the Department of Health's non-departmental public bodies.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para6"></a>In addition, the bodies themselves publish their own annual reports, including on the Internet, which gives that much more detail than is contained in the Cabinet Office's publication. Ministers remain accountable to Parliament for non-departmental public bodies. That includes informing Parliament about decisions <P>


<a name="column_1527"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1527</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>relating to the reviewing and abolition of such bodies. It is notable that the Select Committees of your Lordships' House and in another place frequently examine the performance of those non-departmental public bodies. They frequently call in the chair and chief executive of those bodies for what can only be described as fairly searching examination. In addition, if the Secretary of State were to issue any written directions to these bodies, that fact would be published in the department's annual report. We would expect that the bodies concerned would wish to make a similar statement in their own annual reports.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para7"></a>I am convinced from my own experience in dealing with a number of the bodies mentioned in the debate that each of those bodies is under no illusion that we consider it very important that they are open about their activities; that they constantly examine the work that they do; and that they are encouraged to ensure that reports about their activities are published and put into the public domain. On that basis, I do not think that the amendments, while I understand their thrust, are necessary.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Masham of Ilton, and my noble friend Lady Carnegy of Lour for their support for the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para8"></a>In tabling the amendment I was trying to draw attention to the multiplicity of the created bodies. The Minister referred to the 2001 publication, Public Bodies. It shows that the Department of Health had at that time 69 bodies. The number is sure to have increased since then. The empire is growing. I understand and do not dispute that having certain kinds of agencies could lead to the ability to support further decentralisation. Indeed, at this stage I am not seeking to dispute the merits of any one of the bodies that I have mentioned or any one of the 69. My point was to draw attention to the increasing number of bodies and the increased use of non-departmental public bodies to undertake functions at the core of the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para9"></a>I am grateful to the Minister. I shall think carefully about what he has said. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

 "NHS REGISTERED MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS

<a name="20321-15_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendments Nos. 88 and 89 are quite closely related amendments. They spring from a perception of the minefield that any UK citizen who qualifies in a medical school abroad has to step through before he or she can practise in this country.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para14"></a>Amendment No. 88 deals with the International English Language Testing System, the IELTS. Section 19(1)(b) of the Medical Act 1983 stipulates that an applicant for full and provisional registration must satisfy the registrar of the GMC,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that he has the necessary knowledge of English".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-15_para15"></a>
IELTS was adopted as a means of assessing linguistic proficiency following a recommendation from a Department of Health working group. It assesses skills in reading, writing, speaking and listening to English. But nationals of the EEA member states, other than the United Kingdom and others with what are called "enforceable EC rights", are exempt from having to demonstrate proficiency in English as a result of amendments to the Medical Act 1983.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para16"></a>The GMC admits that it would prefer to test EEA nationals but it is illegal to do so because EU laws prevent discrimination against EU citizens on the basis of language. Therefore, the people who have to take the test are by and large any UK citizen who qualified outside the EEA and any non-EU citizen who qualified outside the UK. That means that someone who is British but has trained outside the EEA&#151;loosely speaking the EU, but slightly wider&#151;has to take an English language test. That is rather an absurd anomaly that our amendment seeks to get rid of.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para17"></a>It should be noted that there is actually no legal requirement for a Briton who has trained outside the EEA to take the language test. It was the GMC's decision to adopt the language test. It is not mentioned as such in the Medical Act. All that is legally required is for the GMC registrar to be satisfied that a test would be a waste of time and money. So it would be possible for the GMC in these circumstances to get rid of the IELTS requirement.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para18"></a>I do not know whether the Minister has had the opportunity to look at the table produced by the GMC of the tests that are required. The table covers both the PLAB and the IELTS tests. It is almost completely incomprehensible to a lay person. Therefore, we have this absurd situation which I have outlined. We also have the potentially problematic situation of an EU national&#151;no matter where in the world he or she qualified&#151;who speaks no English at all, starting a job in a British hospital without taking any kind of language assessment. It is not possible to get rid of this because of the EU anti-discrimination aspect, but at least we can get rid of the situation where a UK citizen has to take the test even though English is his first language. The amendment would change that situation so that UK citizens would not have to take the language test no matter where they trained.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para19"></a>I move to the second amendment and turn to the PLAB exam. I want to use the example of a medical school that is well known to many Members of the Committee. I see that the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, is in his place. I know that a number of noble Lords have connections with St George's University School of Medicine. I want to use it as an example of some of the problems that arise as a result of current requirements.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para20"></a>St George's University School of Medicine is 25 years old. This international school boasts an extremely high standard of education for medical <P>


<a name="column_1529"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1529</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>students from the USA and from some 30 countries in the world. The standard of success of students can be measured by equating the results of the intermediate examinations which have to be undertaken by American students&#151;currently, 70 per cent of students come from America&#151;compared with USA standard schools. Last year, the results of the two examinations show that St George's has an equal if not improved pass rate in these relative exams. Basic sciences are taught on the islands of Grenada and St Vincent. Following that, students have an option of completing their clinical training either in the USA or in the UK.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para21"></a>What then follows for students who have qualified at St George's University and who then want to practise in the UK? They are able to come and practise in the UK in two ways. First, they must pass what is called the UEB examination. That examination is set and examined by the Society of Apothecaries. Hitherto students who wished to take the examination were assessed by certain UK universities. Having been signed off by the local dean as satisfactory, students were permitted to take this examination. Passing it gave the students registration with the GMC to work in the UK.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para22"></a>The second method of being able to practise in this country is taking and passing what is called the PLAB exam. That examination is set and examined by the GMC and consists of a theoretical and practical examination. In addition, all doctors applying for limited registration with the GMC must have obtained a satisfactory score, as I described earlier, in the academic modules of the IELTS.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para23"></a>The UEB examination in its present form will be changed dramatically. It will not, it now seems, be applicable to St George's students. All students from St George's have been told that in future they will have to take the IELTS and PLAB examinations in order to practise medicine in the UK.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para24"></a>So the spotlight then turns on to PLAB and the requirements for taking that exam. Older, traditional Commonwealth universities whose students have automatically received full registration in the UK include countries like South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, and the University of the West Indies. They were not required to take the PLAB exam. But the GMC has intimated that it wishes to discontinue with this so-called "&#233;lite" group of universities to level the playing field, so that overseas applicants who wish to work in this country will all have to take the PLAB examination.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para25"></a>It seems rather topsy-turvy to get rid of this group. One may not think that it is appropriate to have a specific &#233;lite group of universities drawn from a very narrow group of traditional universities, but we on these Benches, together with St George's University, feel that the standard of medicine as taught by the medical school at St George's is such that it is at least equal to this &#233;lite group.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para26"></a>Instead of disbanding that group as giving automatic exemption from PLABs, it should be increased so that a number of international medical <P>


<a name="column_1530"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1530</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>schools with sufficiently high standards, as approved by the GMC, are able to gain full registration. The reason is that we have an acute shortage of doctors in this country. The Government are trying to increase the number of medical school places but that will take time. Meanwhile, 10,000 new GPs are needed and another 7,500 home-grown consultants by 2004&#151;the Government's target. All that the Government are doing in recruiting consultants abroad will not plug the gap. To meet present contractual arrangements, an extra 3,500 physicians are needed at this moment&#151;which does not include any consideration of the working time directive.
<P>

<a name="20321-15_para27"></a>Along with other medical schools world-wide, St George's University School of Medicine has the capacity and expertise to train UK students who are unable to start training, perhaps because of a lack of available slots in the United Kingdom. It seems sensible to bring some order to the process whereby UK students do not have to take the IELTS and the PLAB if their medical school is of a sufficient standard. I hope that the Minister will consider the amendments, perhaps discuss the subject with the GMC and look favourably on the principles involved. I beg to move.

Did not the GMC bring that aspect into the consultation?

<A NAME="20321-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   The amendments are not directed at a UK citizen practising within the EU as regards PLAB but only as regards the IELTS.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-16_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   But presumably a European Union citizen practising in this country would be affected by that directive.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   The two amendments only relate to UK citizens, not to cross-border working by EU citizens outside the UK.

<P>

<a name="20321-16_para0"></a>The noble Lord clearly explained the intricacies of British graduates returning to this country from medical schools overseas. In the past, I have been associated with the University of the West Indies. Graduates from that university's medical schools on <P>


<a name="column_1531"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1531</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>three islands can come to this country without let or hindrance in many ways. It is anomalous that graduates of a school in Grenada of equal quality cannot do so.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para1"></a>By virtue of the fact that we are short of medical graduates, one could at the stroke of a pen increase the number available and the number going for training. St George's is already set up. If the amendments were carried, it is likely that a greatly increased number of British graduates would take a medical degree at St George's University.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para2"></a>I remind the Committee that the medical programme at St George's is to take the pre-clinical and some of the para-clinical teaching in Grenada. Then the clinical students are farmed out to selected clinical departments in the United States and this country. There is of course a tendency for the United States students to go to the US and for the British students to come here. When graduation takes place, we have British graduates who have been trained at clinical level in British medical schools. Consequently, they are entirely familiar with medical issues, programmes and problems in this country. Such a development would certainly be convenient to the medical profession in terms of supplying well-trained graduates for our health service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-16_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Howells of St Davids: </B>   I support the noble Lords, Lord Clement-Jones and Lord Soulsby. I am confident that my noble friend the Minister is aware of concerns that the provision in question exists for one purpose only&#151;to discriminate unfairly against individuals who obtain their medical degrees outside the so-called white Commonwealth. I understand that the GMC is concerned about that distinction at a time when we freely speak about globalisation. I trust that my noble friend the Minister will undertake to look again at that suspect wording because I understand that the GMC would like the distinction abolished.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-16_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   The amendments raise interesting and important issues in the context of the NHS seeking to ensure an adequate number of trained professionals.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para3"></a>It has been recognised in statute for some years as right and necessary that the GMC should satisfy itself about the English language ability of a person who qualifies in medicine overseas. The only exception is our treaty obligation to our European partners to allow freedom of movement by EU nationals. That does not mean that a French doctor would be able to practise in the UK if his English language skills were poor. He would have a right to register with the GMC but it would still be perfectly possible for a health authority or health trust seeking to employ such a person to satisfy itself that he was suitable by having adequate fluency in English. We need not be fearful that the measure is leading to something grossly inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para4"></a>To be fair to all who apply for registration, it is right that the GMC must have a rule of some kind and that it should have as few exceptions as possible. For example, the rule should apply also to people who are British citizens. One can imagine cases where a British <P>


<a name="column_1532"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1532</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>citizen emigrated at a young age and may not have the facility in English needed to be a doctor in this country. The GMC wants to be as helpful as possible, both to be fair and because it appreciates the value to the UK of people with overseas qualifications who want to work here. While we do not think that the amendment is the right route, it may be helpful to get the GMC to reconsider how it satisfies itself under its obligations of English language ability. The standard test may not always be necessary, but that is a matter of GMC policy rather than law. I understand that the GMC will follow carefully today's debate and take from it lessons for consideration.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para5"></a>The new clause is also wrong to confine itself to people wanting to work in the NHS. There should be one standard for registration, regardless of a person's intended employment in health professions. So while I cannot support the amendment, I understand the sentiments that motivate it and hope that a solution can be found as I have suggested. If the Government were persuaded in future, in the light of fuller consideration by the GMC, that a change in the law was necessary, an order under Section 60 of the Health Act 1999 would provide an appropriate vehicle.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, is correct to say that there is no legal requirement for a British citizen to take a language test. The Act requires that the registrar of the GMC is satisfied that applicants&#151;including British citizens, unless they have EU rights&#151;have the necessary knowledge of English. The test itself is not a requirement of the Act.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para7"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Carnegy, raised the issue of the directive. We think that it is probably the directive on the mutual recognition of medical qualifications. No, it is not. We shall keep searching.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-16_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Carnegy of Lour: </B>   I am sorry for raising the matter without having checked it. I thought that it might be helpful to ensure that the Government had considered that in replying to the amendment. I am sorry if I have wasted the Committee's time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-16_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   We shall have a further opportunity to reflect on that and, if appropriate, give a subsequent answer. We will of course need to check the specific relevance to the issues we are discussing today.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para8"></a>Amendment No. 89 is also unnecessary. It would compel the GMC to maintain a list of recognised overseas qualifications. As the Committee will know, the GMC already does so and I am unaware of any case in which people seeking a registration or wanting to check a doctor's registration have had any difficulty getting the GMC to share the list with them.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para9"></a>However, this is a good point at which to say something about the substantive issue of recognised overseas qualifications, which several Members of the Committee have raised. There have been concerns that provisions of the Medical Act 1983 discriminate unfairly against those who obtained their medical degrees outside the so-called white Commonwealth. My noble friend Lady Howells was clear on that point. The GMC would like that distinction abolished and, <P>


<a name="column_1533"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1533</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>broadly speaking, we share its view. It proposes&#151;and we support it&#151;to abolish the status of recognised overseas qualification that degrees from 22 universities currently hold. Graduates from those universities will then be in the same position as those from the hundreds of other institutions world-wide whose medical courses are recognised by the World Health Organisation. They would have to demonstrate their competence at the point of registration&#151;as do graduates from the United States or, say, India, currently.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para10"></a>The Government, in the light of the GMC's consideration, will use the next suitable Section 60 order to make the necessary amendments. Discussions with the GMC have already begun on that, and we plan to lay the order before Parliament later in 2002 after full consultation in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para11"></a>Some important points were raised about St George's. My noble friend Lord Hunt recently met representatives of St George's Hospital and a group of hospital friends in the UK. He has asked departmental officials to consider the issues raised. He recognises the potential and quality of the medical education at St George's. While the Government's approach is not exactly the same as that proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, in Amendment No. 89, we feel that it is an appropriate manner in which to proceed. It will ensure that there is no unfair discrimination and that suitably qualified medical people are able to practise in the UK. I urge the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-16_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   Before the Minister sits down, perhaps I may ask him whether the provision includes doctors from South Africa.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-16_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I am fairly certain that the system that I described would apply to doctors from all around the world, and would therefore include those from South Africa.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-16_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply, which, as he said, was not entirely in line with what I want. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howells, for their support for the amendments. They seek to ensure that we make the best of a potential pool of properly qualified, well-trained graduates and that there is no discrimination in favour of white Commonwealth universities&#151;a phrase used by both the Minister and the noble Baroness. It is important that we are not in the business of levelling down. That is where the current GMC proposals and what the Minister had to say are unsatisfactory.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para12"></a>I understand the issue about the IELTS. It may well be possible to persuade the GMC not to apply it to UK citizens. I take the Minister's point about it being up to hospital trusts to vet their doctors, but there is considerable pressure on trusts to take on doctors. If they are already registered on the basis that they have a somewhat rudimentary knowledge of English, it is <P>


<a name="column_1534"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1534</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>difficult not to accept them. The essential check is on registration, and UK citizens are being required to take a language test at that point. That seems rather anomalous.
<P>

<a name="20321-16_para13"></a>I agree with the Minister that it is perhaps not entirely appropriate to legislate on the matter, but he then went on to say that a change may be made by regulation under Section 60 of the Health Act 1999.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-17_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for giving way; perhaps I can remark on one or two points. First, British citizenship is not a guarantee of adequate fluency in English. Secondly, a health authority or trust would be grossly irresponsible if it sought to employ someone who did not appear to be sufficiently fluent to carry out his medical duties. There is no more to be said on that. They must act responsibly; they are public protectors. We should rest with comfort that those people treat those responsibilities seriously. Finally, after due consultation, the House will have an opportunity to consider any proposed order, as is right and proper.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-17_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I thank the Minister for that clarification. But what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. If we believe that hospital trusts have the appropriate mechanisms to vet those doctors who have been registered and apply to them for vacancies&#151;in other words, that they are capable of assessing their language skills&#151;why should that not apply to UK citizens as well? UK citizens are labouring under a disadvantage. If citizens of Italy or France do not have to take the IELTS and we rely on the hospital or trust to vet them, why cannot we do the same for UK citizens, who, percentage wise, have a far better chance of speaking English? The Minister has made my case in his intervention.
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para0"></a>Secondly, the GMC may be barking up the wrong tree. I have had some discussions and I believe that the levelling-down point is important. To say that the concept of an &#233;lite group of white Commonwealth universities whose product is regarded as fulfilling the requirements and, ipso facto, does not have to take the PLAB exam is clearly discriminatory and therefore should be abolished seems to be going in the wrong direction. There should be a broader, more inclusive group of universities, such as St. George's, which I described, which qualify as far as the GMC is concerned and whose graduates are not required to take PLAB.
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para1"></a>This is a minefield. We must recognise the quality and potential of individuals coming out of those universities. That would best be done by exempting them from the PLAB examination. The purpose of encouraging UK citizens to take up places at those high-quality universities is lost if there is the major disincentive of two hurdles to overcome: first, the IELTS, and secondly, the PLAB. I could quote examples of constituents of honourable friends in the other place, who have been offered jobs in hospitals but find that they are unable to find a place for a test. Therefore the hospitals lack their presence and in some <P>


<a name="column_1535"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1535</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cases such doctors may lose their jobs due to the bureaucracy of the exams and the shortage of time or place for them to sit them in order to qualify.
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para2"></a>That is a significant disincentive for a young student considering where he is going to qualify and undergo his medical training. A good deal more discussion needs to take place. The passage of the Bill may not be the best place for it, but the airing of the subject today has been valuable. I thank the Minister for his consideration and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="20321-17_para8"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "REGIONAL STRUCTURE
<br>
(1) If in any year the Department of Health has directors of health and social care who have regional responsibilities or if it has regional offices, regional directors or any other regional structure, the Secretary of State shall lay before both Houses of Parliament each year a report containing the matters set out in subsection (2).
<br>
(2) The report shall contain&#151;
<br>
(a) the names and qualifications of the relevant directors;
<br>
(b) the geographic regions covered by the relevant directors;
<br>
(c) a description of the functions, responsibilities and accountabilities of the relevant directors;
<br>
(d) the number of staff reporting to the relevant directors and details of the functions of those staff;
<br>
(e) details of the premises occupied by the relevant directors and their staff;
<br>
(f) the total cost of the work of the relevant directors and their staff;
<br>
(g) a description of the relationship between the relevant directors and the National Health Service trusts, Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities within their regions;
<br>
(h) a description of the relationship between the relevant directors and the Secretary of State;
<br>
(i) a description of the targets or objectives which have been set for the relevant directors and their staff for the year which is covered by the report;
<br>
(j) a description of the manner in which the relevant directors and their staff have conducted their functions during the year, including whether they have met the targets and objectives set for them; and
<br>
(k) a description of the targets or objectives which have been set for the relevant directors and their staff for the following year.
<br>
(3) In this section "relevant director" means a person who is designated a director of health and social care with regional responsibilities or a person who is in charge of a region, regional office or other part of a regional structure of the Department of Health."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-17_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment seeks to introduce an annual report on the activities of the new directors of health and social care and any other regional directors that exist or may exist in the future. In the days which some of us now refer to as "the good old days", there was a regional tier in the NHS. There were 14 regional health authorities with full boards <P>


<a name="column_1536"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1536</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and local accountability. For good reasons, that tier was largely removed in the 1990s, although many of the activities formerly carried out by the staff of the RHAs continued to be carried out under a new guise, with the staff becoming the eight regional offices of the NHS Executive, each led by a regional director.
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para10"></a>Now the regional directors have disappeared, or are in the process of disappearing, and there are four directors of health and social care covering four areas of the country, although I understand that the regional offices will not disappear until March 2003.
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para11"></a>Although not called "regional directors", these directors carry regional responsibilities. They are described on the Department of Health's website as being,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"4 Regional Directors (who) will provide a link between the Department of Health and the frontline NHS and social services".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-17_para12"></a>
That link is important and needs to be made transparent.
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para13"></a>I know that on our first Committee day the Minister was at pains to say that the new directors of health and social care are not an extra tier in the NHS but are really a part of the NHS headquarters&#151;a sort of headquarters in the country. Amendment No. 92 does not rest on whether that is a tier as such. It rests on the very existence of the posts which have a potentially significant role in how the NHS operates in practice.
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para14"></a>The directors of health and social care have the potential for great influence within the NHS. They generally operate out of the public eye, but occasionally we get a glimpse of what they do. A recent example is a letter written by Mrs Carnall, the director with responsibility for the South, who told her health authorities and trusts that a projected &#163;60 million overspend was "totally unacceptable" and that they must find "solutions". I ask the Minister in whose name the regional directors describe matters as "totally unacceptable"? We have to assume that they speak on the Secretary of State's behalf. That is why we need to see what they do and how they do it.
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para15"></a>There is a description of the activities of the four directors in Shifting the Balance of Power, but it is difficult to see these activities providing much for the directors to do, let alone the 40 staff that each of them will have, and that number excludes staff who will work for the regional directors of public health. But "trouble shooting" is listed as one of the roles. Will the directors troubleshoot strategic health authorities, primary care trusts, NHS trusts, general practitioners, or all of those? What powers will they have? How will they in practice carry out their tasks?
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para16"></a>Many questions can legitimately be asked about the four directors. Amendment No. 92 seeks to put some basic facts into the public domain about the directors, their staff, what they do, how they do it and how much they cost. I see that information as shedding light into a corner of the Department of Health which has become obscure over the years. It will provide a good springboard for the Health Select Committee in another place to look at what the directors do and it <P>


<a name="column_1537"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1537</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>may also provide an opportunity for your Lordships' House to debate the role and function of that part of the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para17"></a>But it is not only the relationship of the directors to the NHS that is important. The Local Government Association has expressed its support for the amendment as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"one way of tackling the lack of clarity that currently exists in relation to the social care remit",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-17_para18"></a>
of the directors. It has welcomed the opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="20321-17_para19"></a>I hope that the Minister will clarify the role and purpose of the four new health and social care directors and describe how they relate to the existing regional offices. I hope that he will also describe how and to whom they are accountable. I hope that he will welcome the increased knowledge of their work which would come about if the amendment were accepted. In the interests of transparency, I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20321-18_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Smith of Leigh: </B>   I share some of the concerns of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes. However, she is looking in the wrong direction to some extent. We should be looking at the role regional authorities can play in England in managing matters themselves. The noble Baroness is right that those bodies could have influence in the regions. Health matters and decisions about spending affect local areas significantly. They affect employment, regeneration and other matters important to the regions. It is vital that regional health strategies meet the strategies of other bodies that affect the regions.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para0"></a>Regionalism in England is on the march. Regions are beginning to recognise what they are missing out on. A BBC opinion poll in my region of the North West today states that 72 per cent of people would welcome the setting up of devolution in England. In answering the question, I hope that my noble friend will assure us that once devolution for England is proposed in the forthcoming legislation, health in those areas will not be forgotten. Meanwhile, I hope that the health bodies will talk to their regional partners to make sure that the strategies line up.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   That was fighting talk from the Back Benches opposite. It is great to see such support for regionalism from the Government Benches. Sometimes one does not see quite the same level of enthusiasm from the Front Bench.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-18_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I shall pass on the issue of regional government, though I warm to the noble Baroness's sentimental look back at the good old days of regional health authorities. I am beginning to think she should form an annual dinner where we meet to celebrate the past successes of those wonderful organisations.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para1"></a>Of course, it was the previous government who removed the old regional authorities, set up regional offices and then kept this rather peculiar role and <P>


<a name="column_1538"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1538</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>office of regional chairman to straddle alongside the regional offices, which frankly did not work. I note also that the previous government did not feel it necessary to put into place the kind of reporting mechanism which the noble Baroness is suggesting today.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para2"></a>I want to make it clear, as I did in our earlier debate, that these directorates of health and social care are headquarters directorates of the Department of Health. It would not be appropriate for them to be the subject of separate processes of annual reporting.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para3"></a>I know the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, disagrees with me about the significance of those directorates not being a separate tier of the NHS. But it is an extremely important issue. The four directorates of health and social care are members of the Department of Health's management board. They will between them have the main responsibility for working directly with the NHS and performance managing strategic health authorities.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para4"></a>That role will involve the oversight and development of health and social care, ensuring that local health and social care communities are developed in an integrated way to deliver modernised services and supporting the Chief Executive and the Chief Inspector of Social Services at the Department of Health in assessing the performance of the whole system. In public health, the director for health and social care will have a regional director of public health and public health team co-located with each government office. I have already made clear that the regional directors of public health will be jointly accountable to the directors of health and social care, and to the Chief Medical Officer. They will be managing, as part of a national programme, the appointment, development and succession of senior management staff. They will be supporting Ministers through casework, ministerial visits and local intelligence.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para5"></a>As the noble Baroness said, they will deal with troubleshooting. I am fairly clear what that means. It means getting involved when things look as though they are going wrong; banging heads together&#151;as the noble Baroness will be aware, I am very keen on that&#151;and dealing with issues as they arise within the region for which they are particularly responsible. In the first instance they play a major role in developing the new organisations, maintaining close involvement, whenever necessary, with strategic health authorities and focusing very clearly on performance management.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para6"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked a number of questions about the specifics of how it will all work, or at least her amendment seeks to adduce that information in the fullness of time. First, she is right that regional offices will not be formally wound up until March 2003, but the new directors start their work formally from April this year. The 12-month period is merely a transition to deal with any overlap. Obviously we want to avoid any duplication of effort between the regional offices and the new directors.
<P>


<a name="column_1539"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1539</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para7"></a>In 2002-03 the running costs will amount to roughly &#163;30 million rising to &#163;34 million in the next two financial years. Clearly a number of matters have not yet been settled and I would not want to be held exactly to those figures.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para8"></a>The other point I would make is that those people are national directors. As I said, they have seats on the departmental board and we will expect them, alongside their regional responsibilities, to contribute to national work as well. It will be quite likely that a director of health and social care will also take on lead responsibility for national work as well. That reinforces my point that this is not an additional tier; these are merely senior officials of the Department of Health with specific responsibilities as part of their duties for a specific region in England. Accountability is quite clear. They will be accountable to the Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para9"></a>From what I have said, I hope that Members of the Committee will agree that it would be inappropriate to single out just four members of the management board of the Department of Health for special treatment in that way. I invite the noble Baroness therefore to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-18_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply and for the information contained in it.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para10"></a>Perhaps I should say at the outset that, though I was grateful for the comments of the noble Lord, the amendment was not tabled with any zeal for regionalisation, as he might imagine. It was tabled with a zeal to understand the interface between the Department of Health and frontline NHS and social services, to use the language of the department's website.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para11"></a>I hear what the Minister said as to what will be happening. It will be interesting to see how it works out in practice, which is why the amendment was moved. I hear what he says about this not being a tier, though that is not important. What it encourages me to do is to look at the information available as to what all members of the Department of Health management board do; perhaps it should not be confined to these four directors of health and social care. More light perhaps needs to be shed on the workings of the management board in general. I should like to think about that further. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20321-18_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham) </B>  rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 28th February be approved [22nd Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para15"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords,this draft order is technical in nature so I shall be brief. It makes changes to the list of organisations that will be liable to provide information to the department and to local authorities for the purposes of combating benefit fraud. But it does not add any new categories of organisations to the list. It makes some changes to the definitions of organisations included, to bring them in line with current legislation, and it clears up some uncertainties and omissions from the original list, for the sake of clarity and the avoidance of doubt. An Explanatory Memorandum has been provided to assist your Lordships and I hope it has been of use.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para16"></a>The measures contained in this draft order are: first, to add the "Director of National Savings" to the list of those who may be required to provide information; secondly, to redefine banks and insurers so as to take account of recent changes brought about by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000; thirdly, to add distributors of gas and electricity to the list of information providers.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para17"></a>I can quickly deal with each of those in turn. First, with regard to the Director of National Savings, it was always our intention that we should be able to obtain information about national savings products using these powers. We believed that by including "any bank" in the original list of information providers&#151;Section 109B(2A) of the Social Security Administration Act as amended by the Social Security Fraud Act&#151;we were also including national savings. However, while the definition of "bank"&#151;in subsection (7) of Section 109B&#151;embraces the National Savings Bank, it does not extend to cover other national savings products such as premium bonds, national savings certificates, pensioner bonds, deposit bonds or capital bonds. Inserting a reference to the "Director of National Savings" in the list contained in Section 109B(2A) will enable authorised officers to obtain information about the full range of national savings products in line with our original policy intention.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para18"></a>Secondly, in terms of these regulations, the section on banks and insurers was also intended to be a purely technical change. We were aware at the time that the Social Security Fraud Bill was passing through its parliamentary stages, between December 2000 and May last year, that the coming into force of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and the repeal of the Banking Act 1987 and the Insurance Companies Act 1982 would necessitate new definitions of "banks" and "insurers". This took place last year and the new definitions are a consequence of the coming into force of the 2000 Act. This is achieved in Article 2(b) and Article 3(a) and (b) of the draft order.
<P>


<a name="column_1541"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1541</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para19"></a>The third push of these regulations concerns gas and electricity distributors. Over the past few months officials have been having meetings with those organisations affected by the new information gathering powers. In discussion with utility companies it has emerged that some clarification is needed. Following changes brought about by the Utilities Act 2000 there is now a clear demarcation in both the gas and electricity industries between companies who supply gas and electricity and companies who distribute these products. No one company can do both. For example, a distributor of electricity will carry electricity from the national grid to a particular property while a supplier will bill the householder for the electricity consumed.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para20"></a>While the fraud Act will allow for information to be obtained from a gas or electricity supply company, powers do not yet exist to require distribution companies to provide information as to the supplier to a particular household. The draft order provides for that to take place.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para21"></a>To conclude, we are making good progress in tackling fraud. Our latest figures show that in the two and a half years to March 2001 we have reduced the level of fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance by 18 per cent, well ahead of the target we had expected to achieve by then. We expect this good progress to continue, but we need the tools to do the job, in particular access to information.
<P>

<a name="20321-18_para22"></a>I repeat that these are technical, tidying up regulations. I shall do my best to answer questions. If not, I shall write to noble Lords. I commend the draft order to the House.

<A NAME="20321-19_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, as always, the noble Baroness has been helpful. We on this side of the House, like the Government, are against fraud. The noble Baroness and I spent many long hours improving the Social Security Fraud Act. It was certainly a great deal better when it went back to the Commons.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para0"></a>As she rightly points out, these proposals are essentially technical in nature and cover three main areas. I was puzzled at first as to why, since it was the Social Security Fraud Act 2001, we had not taken into account the changes which took place in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. There is no reason why one should not proceed by regulation but I was surprised that the same sdituation existed in relation to the Utilities Act 2000 and the electricity and gas distribution companies. The blame, if there is any, for what appears to be a failure to act, lies as much on this side of the House as on the other. We certainly need to tidy up the matter now.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para1"></a>With regard to banks and insurers, extension is clearly appropriate. As the noble Baroness has pointed out, this concerns a series of organisations where <P>


<a name="column_1542"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1542</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>authorised persons&#151;I gather about 175 of them&#151;are able to obtain information on individuals, which may seek to confirm the firmly held belief by the department that someone is guilty of fraud. I have no points to make at all about banks.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para2"></a>So far as the electricity and gas distribution companies are concerned, the noble Baroness pointed out that the change in the structure means that the distribution companies would not be available, if that is the right expression, for inquiries to be made appropriately. Again, I see no problem with that; similarly as far as the Director of National Savings is concerned. The prospect of someone engaging in fraudulent activity by investing heavily in national savings seems to me a little unlikely. I suppose so far as premium bonds are concerned, to the extent that any gains are outwith the tax system altogether, that may prevent them from falling into the clutches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Inland Revenue.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para3"></a>I have only two other points to make. The boundary between the Department of Social Security and the Treasury gets more and more obscure&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-19_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Because we no longer have a Department of Social Security.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-19_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   But, my Lords, as the noble Baroness knows, it seems to me much better title than "Work and Pensions" which sounds rather sordid. Anyway, all of this refers to the Social Security Administration Act which, if the department has disappeared totally, seems a little strange, but I leave that on one side.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para4"></a>I was saying that I have only two points to make. As the boundary gets more and more confused, am I right in thinking&#151;I believe I am&#151;that, for example, working families' tax credit is not caught by the provisions of the Social Security Fraud Act? Perhaps the noble Baroness can tell us how it is to be dealt with.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para5"></a>In our debates on what became the Social Security Fraud Act we gave attention to the issue of credit rating agencies. I have become increasingly concerned about the way they operate. The noble Baroness will recall that it was agreed, rightly in my view on reflection, that the Government would not give information which it had to the credit rating agencies but would use credit rating agencies in the kind of inquiry we are discussing on the order.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para6"></a>My concern, reinforced by a recent article in Which? magazine, relates to the inaccuracy of the information which credit rating agencies provide and, more particularly, the delay in ensuring they give information only on the individual about whom the inquiry is made. At the moment they are still giving information on everyone else at the same address and all the other family members.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para7"></a>To the extent that both the noble Baroness and I were anxious to avoid fishing expeditions, we need to look carefully at the way in which these agencies operate and the action which is taken under the Social Security Fraud Act in making use of their services, no doubt paid for by the taxpayer.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para8"></a>The noble Baroness is absolutely right. These are largely technical measures. We believe they will make the Act more effective and to that extent we support them.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-19_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her clear introduction to the order. Seeing all the regulations worried me at first. Reading through them, I discovered that it is merely a tidying up exercise and what the Minister said has certainly allayed any fears I had.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para9"></a>We have one or two slight moans about basic principles. The idea of needing more tax credits may make more fraud possible overall, but that is probably not a matter best discussed at this point. I am content with the explanation given by the Minister.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-19_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to your Lordships for the response. In reply to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, about the Financial Services and Markets Act, I am not sure that I have an entirely persuasive answer but, with the help of my noble friend on my right, reinforced by help from my left, naturally on my left, I am told,&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-19_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   I am much more naturally on your right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-19_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I carefully did not gloss that statement when I talked about my noble friend. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 did not come into force until after the Social Security Fraud Act was passed. It came into force fully on 1st December 2001. That is not an explanation about the drafting but the fact that they were running coterminously was, I suspect, part of the problem.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para10"></a>Obviously, tax credits are not benefits; they are credits. Therefore they do not come under the social security legislation. I realise that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, has a different view about nomenclature here but, as a temporary member of the nomenklatura, I continue to insist that we are dealing with benefits here, not credits.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para11"></a>The noble Lord talked about credit rating agencies. He is right. He will know, I am sure, that in the last 18 months or so the regulation of these bodies has passed to what was the Data Protection Commissioner, now the Information Commissioner. I find that she herself has produced leaflets on complaints about credit reference file information and what should be done about it.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para12"></a>I do not know whether this is familiar to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins. She says that the most common complaints about credit reference files relate&#151; it seems that the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is the recipient of all the complaints in that sense&#151;to the amount of data which appears and particularly the fact that there may be information about a person other than the applicant for credit, the accuracy of the entry and the length of time for which the record appears to continue on the file. Therefore, the noble Lord's concerns are absolutely right.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para13"></a>She goes on to specify there what must be done. She has already taken some enforcement action, and she shows how people may complain about the agency and not merely correct their information. I am very happy, if the noble Lord thinks this helpful, to make sure that such a leaflet is put into the Library of the House for general information. I think it is important to draw this to people's attention. I agree that it is a very serious matter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-19_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness. Yes, I have been in telephone conversation with the office of the commissioner. It has been immensely helpful. If the Government are making use of this information, they should take it with a very considerable pinch of salt. My own experience recently, not necessarily personal but otherwise, is that much of the data is very poor indeed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-19_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   My Lords, I accept that entirely. The noble Lord will recall our discussions during the passage of the fraud legislation. I said then that we would go to those agencies not only when we had found a discrepancy but also when we had strong grounds to believe that there was an irregularity that we wished, possibly, to clear up with the individual concerned&#151;if he or she were the right person to give us the information. If not, we would consult other legitimate information providers. Therefore, we would only consult Experian, Equifax, or the like, in certain appropriate circumstances. That is only part of the range of materials we might need. Given the known unreliability in some cases of information received, I should be surprised if that was sufficient basis to do anything other than contribute to a jig-saw puzzle, if you like, of information.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para14"></a>The noble Lord is right to give us warnings in that respect. On the basis of what he said, I shall telephone the office tomorrow to see what information is held about me. We shall see whether my experience is the same as that of the noble Lord. Given those points, I hope that noble Lords will be content to pass the order tonight and thereby allow us to proceed on our way. I commend the order to the House.

<P>


<a name="column_1545"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1545</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para17"></a>I should, first, affirm that the provisions in the first order are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para18"></a>First, the order will reduce, from 11.9 to 11.8 per cent, the rate of secondary Class 1 contributions payable by all employers from April 2002 to recycle revenues arising from the introduction of the aggregates levy. It will thereby help to protect UK competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para19"></a>Secondly, for the self-employed, it raises the small earnings exception below which, depending on the level of profits, they may claim exemption from Class 2 contributions. The exception will rise next April broadly in line with prices, from &#163;3,955 to &#163;4,025 a year. Given that the rate of Class 2 contributions for 2002-03 will remain at &#163;2 a week, which is a reduction in real terms, it may be that many people will choose to pay the contributions in order to protect their benefit entitlement.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para20"></a>Staying with the self-employed, the draft order also sets the profits limits between which Class 4 contributions are paid. The lower limit at which contributions become due, and the upper limit, will increase broadly in line with inflation. The lower limit will rise in line with the income tax personal allowance, from &#163;4,535 to &#163;4,615 a year. At the other end of the scale, the upper profits limit will continue to match the upper earnings limit for employees, at &#163;30,420 for 2002-03. This ensures that the self-employed pay Class 4 contributions on much the same range of earnings as employees liable to Class 1 contributions, and is an essential element in making the national insurance system fair for everyone.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para21"></a>Thirdly, the draft order deals with the weekly rate of voluntary Class 3 contributions, which help those with insufficient contribution records in any given tax year to make up a "qualifying year" for benefit purposes. The rate of Class 3 will rise next April by 10 pence to &#163;6.85 a week, a standard re-rating in line with prices.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para22"></a>The review of contribution rates is accompanied by a report from the Government Actuary detailing the effects of the draft order, and the draft order up-rating benefits, laid by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, on the National Insurance Fund. I am pleased to say that, for the fifth year in a row, there is no expectation that the fund will need a Treasury grant. Nevertheless, a prudent minimal provision is made in line with advice from the Government Actuary.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para23"></a>As happened last year, there is a single draft order for both Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland has a separate national insurance scheme from Great Britain, but the two schemes are closely co-ordinated and maintain parity of contribution rates. Following the transfer of policy, Northern Ireland's social security legislation was amended to enable the draft re-rating order to include corresponding measures for the Province.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para24"></a>I move now to the Tax Credits Up-rating Order 2002. Again, I confirm that the provisions in this order are compatible with the European Convention on <P>


<a name="column_1546"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1546</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Human Rights. The order increases the main rates and thresholds of working families' tax credit and disabled person's tax credit from 9th April this year by 1.71 per cent, in line with the increase in the Rossi index. In addition, as part of a package of more help for families with children with disabilities, it increases the disabled child tax credit and the enhanced disability tax credit for children within working families' tax credit and disabled person's tax credit by an extra &#163;5 a week above indexation. These increases will boost the incomes of 1.3 million low income working families and disabled people who work.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para25"></a>Perhaps I may explain the provisions in a little more detail. The order increases the amount of credits for an adult, child, or young person, including the extra "30 hour" tax credit that a family receives when one earner works at least 30 hours a week, and the disabled and enhanced disability credits. These credits determine the maximum working families' tax credit or maximum disabled person's tax credit that the family or disabled person may receive.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para26"></a>The order also increases the income threshold for working families' tax credit and the thresholds for disabled person's tax credit. The thresholds&#151;or "applicable amounts"&#151;are the levels over and above which income begins to taper away the maximum award of the tax credits. The increases will provide a minimum income guarantee of &#163;227 a week for a family with one child in receipt of working families' tax credit, &#163;172 a week for a single person on disabled person's tax credit and &#163;260 a week for a couple with one child on disabled person's tax credit. These figures are based on one earner in full-time work, working 35 hours a week and earning the national minimum wage.
<P>

<a name="20321-19_para27"></a>The order ensures that the differentials between in-work tax credits and out-of-work benefits are maintained. It provides extra help, over and above indexation, for families with children with disabilities. It reflects this Government's commitment to encourage people into work, to make work pay, and to target extra support to those who need it. I beg to move.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-20_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Higgins: </B>   My Lords, the House will be grateful to the Minister for his explanation of these two orders. It is helpful to take both orders together. As I said in the previous debate, a problem arises because of the extent to which the Treasury has taken over many of the former activities of what used to be called the Department of Social Security. As a result, there is now a considerable amount of overlap and confusion between the two departments.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para0"></a>We have before us an order that is a Treasury order&#151;the draft Tax Credits Up-rating Order 2002&#151; which uprates those benefits. Noble Lords on this side of the House certainly welcome the improvement made to the disabled person's tax credit and to the position of certain children and disabled adults, and so on. Indeed, that is certainly welcome. Of course, the <P>


<a name="column_1547"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1547</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble Baroness and I debated a corresponding order on 17th March&#151;I refer to the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2002&#151;which uprated a number of other benefits.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para1"></a>If we take those two lots of uprating together on, so to speak, the expenditure side, we must then consider what is happening on the income side. It seems to me that is the more interesting aspect of the matter. It is embodied in the Social Security (Contributions) (Re-rating and National Insurance Funds Payments) Order 2002, which we are debating this evening. That covers the income side, rather than the expenditure side. I leave unanswered why it is that the order should be headed "Social Security", rather than "Work and Pensions" or why it is not the Work and Pensions (Contributions) and so on Order. That is a debating point that it would be rather sordid to raise.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para2"></a>There are important issues to be raised on the contributions side. Our debate on the matter on 7th March was wide-ranging, as is traditional. I do not propose to go anywhere near as wide this evening; I hope to keep within the confines of the matters raised by the order. I shall, however, make one point. There have been suggestions in the press in the past few days that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is likely to increase national insurance contributions in order to fund increased expenditure on the National Health Service. I was rather surprised by that speculation&#151;no doubt, it is speculation&#151;because, as I understand it, national insurance contributions are nothing to do with the NHS, although they both originate in the Beveridge concepts. Perhaps, the Minister can confirm that.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para3"></a>On the contributions side, there is a report by the Government Actuary's Department. I find myself being increasingly suspicious of actuaries, particularly with regard to that report. We are told that it is based on the same assumptions as were made by the Chancellor in his pre-Budget statement, and it is apparent from the report that, as a result of the increases in benefits, to which I have already referred and which are partially covered by the other order, benefits will increase in the current year by &#163;1,730 million. On the other hand, the re-rating order reduces the amount of revenue by &#163;317 million in some areas and by &#163;242 million in social security contributions. That is a total of &#163;559 million. Expenditure has gone up by &#163;1,730 million, and the contributions are going down by &#163;559 million.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para4"></a>In a well worn phrase, the Minister described the fund as being at a reasonably prudent level. In fact, it is not. The actuary says that a reasonable working balance would be one sixth of annual expenditure. One sixth is a singularly inconvenient fraction if one wants to convert something into percentages. If we do convert them, we see that the balance for this year is, in fact, 52 per cent of benefit payments. The Minister says, "Oh well, it's a reasonably prudent balance at the moment", when the actuary regards it as one sixth and, in fact, it is over 50 per cent. That suggests that the balance is too high. Perhaps, the Minister might reasonably have recommended, had he been an actuary for a company pension scheme, that there <P>


<a name="column_1548"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1548</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should be a contributions holiday, preferably not for the Treasury but for those who contribute. I should declare my interest as chairman of a company pension scheme.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para5"></a>We seem to be accumulating more and more in the fund; so much that the Government Actuary's estimates are considerably out, when compared with what he said last year. The increase in the fund this year was, as he says in the report, substantial. He estimated that it would go up by &#163;2.5 billion; it has gone up by nearly &#163;5 billion. Not only is the balance, which is said to be prudent, way over what the actuary regards as prudent, but it has increased over the past year by nearly &#163;5 billion. We are entitled to some explanation of why the contributions are being changed as they are, if that is the situation.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para6"></a>I have one or two other questions for the Minister about the Government Actuary's figures, on which the orders are based. On page 7 of the report, the actuary refers to an item that relates to what I have just said. The balance at the beginning of 2001-02 was &#163;19,399 million, but, for 2002-03, it is &#163;24,192 million. That confirms what I said.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para7"></a>Of particular interest are the questions raised in the Government Actuary's report and reflected in the orders about the state second pension. In paragraph 9 of page 5, the actuary says that the state second pension is, of course, about to come in in place of SERPS. The report says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The new accrual regime for the State Second Pension, which was introduced by the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, will come into force in April 2002. Earnings-related pension will accrue at 40% of earnings".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-20_para8"></a>
I shall not burden the House with the detail of what is said. However, the fact is that those accruals will go into the fund as such, without any distinction. The Government's declared intention is to switch from a situation in which 40 per cent of pensions are covered by the private sector and 60 per cent by the Government to the reverse situation. Perhaps, the time has come for the Government seriously to consider whether there is not a strong case for segregating the contributions that will be put into the state second pension, so that they are an identifiable fund.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para9"></a>There has been a mass of publicity in the past few days relating to the auditor's report and the rebates that are mentioned in it, suggesting that people ought to go back from a company system into the state second pension&#151;or SERPS, at the moment. It is highly undesirable to have people switching back and forth between the state second pension and company pensions. It is because of the way in which the Government act in reaction to the Government Actuary's report that we find ourselves from year to year being unclear about whether the rebates are sufficient to push people in or out of the state second pension. A degree of stability would be desirable, as would a move to greater funding.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para10"></a>Those are my main points. I shall briefly ride my usual hobby horse. The whole of the Government Actuary's report is concerned with receipts and payments, not with the overall balance sheet of the fund. That still does not exist. I repeat my plea, which <P>


<a name="column_1549"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1549</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Minister will have heard on several occasions, that it is high time that the Government Actuary was asked to estimate the liabilities of the fund. At the moment we have no clear idea of that. Given his previous commercial experience, I am sure that the Minister will agree that an operation which concerns itself only with receipts, payments and cash-flow and not with the balance sheet does not a give a clear indication to shareholders or, in this case, to taxpayers, of what is the actual underlying situation.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para11"></a>Having said that, although I have expressed some doubts with regard to the re-rating order, I certainly welcome the improvements in benefits on the other one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-20_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, the emphasis of my remarks will turn more to the second of the two orders, on which I have more distinct views. When it comes to national insurance orders, I always regard them as those addressing the tax that, in effect "dare not speak its name". When we change the figures, it is always important to bear very much in mind the general taxation position.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para12"></a>I am glad to say that we welcome the uprating of benefits. However, I have one query to put to the Minister about the general thinking behind the uprating. As a Treasury-based calculation, does it pay enough attention to general poverty rates and issues related to that?
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para13"></a>Having made those few comments, we find nothing basically objectionable in the orders.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-20_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords for their reception of these two orders. I shall try to respond to the points that have been made.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Higgins, began by referring to speculation over recent days with regard to the rates and upper limits of national insurance contributions. Within a week of the Budget, the noble Lord will not expect me to make any comment on matters which are properly for the Budget, but he will be aware that ever since the election we have been consistent in our approach to these matters.
<P>

<a name="20321-20_para15"></a>The noble Lord asked me a very interesting question about national insurance contributions and the National Health Service. It is a historical fact that part of the receipts from national insurance contributions goes to the National Health Service allocation. That figure this year is &#163;7.3 billion. A comparable figure goes to the National Insurance Fund. I do not know how far back through the sands of time that division goes, but I rather like it as a concept. Indeed, I feel a little sentimental about it, just as I feel sentimental about the term "social security", which of course was originally Beveridge's phrase, but was changed to "national insurance" by post-war governments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, it is more complicated than that. A different proportion of each of the amounts goes to the National Health Service according to contribution rates. Again, I believe that there are historical rather than rational reasons for that, and thus there is no single figure. However, I have said that, broadly speaking, some &#163;7 billion will go to the National Health Service allocation while, I think, a comparable figure will go into the National Insurance Fund. But it cannot be tied down to any particular contribution.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para0"></a>The noble Lord asked me about the balance on the National Insurance Fund and quoted from the report of the Government Actuary. Of course the figure of one-sixth of expenditure to which the Government Actuary refers is a minimum figure. The fact that the figure, at &#163;24 billion&#151;which the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, is quite correct to point out is substantially larger than that fraction&#151;is the result of the fact that the balance on the fund is the difference between two very large figures indeed. Even what seems like the large figure of &#163;24 billion is not such a large figure as all that. This is the fifth year that we have seen an increase in the balance of the fund. The point I wish to make here is that what we do about income and expenditure from the fund has to be consistent over a period of years.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para1"></a>If we were to over-react to a particular surplus in one year by allowing, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, a benefits or a tax holiday, that would be extremely dangerous. I do not believe that any government of the noble Lord's persuasion would want to do that either. We should remember that in 1993-94 there had to be a very substantial Treasury grant, which at that point in the economic cycle was not particularly appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para2"></a>The noble Lord also asked me about the state second pension and the case for an identifiable fund for it. He made the point that switching between the two schemes is undesirable. To an extent, I think that we have to admit that switching in and out of the state second pension, or in and out of its predecessor, SERPS, is to some extent inevitable if we have a situation such as that which pertains at the moment; that is, where the number of final salary schemes is reducing. If we see a much longer trend of people changing jobs a number of times during their working life and thus making final salary schemes less attractive, then clearly there will be more switching in and out. What we are much more concerned about is to ensure that, wherever it comes from, people should be making adequate provision for their pensions. The fact that those pensions might be made up from more than one source is not necessarily a bad thing.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para3"></a>The noble Lord's final question concerned the estimate of the liabilities of the fund. We are now just about within a week of moving over to resource accounting and the almost complete abandonment of cash accounting in the public accounts as the main <P>


<a name="column_1551"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1551</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>measure. The point made by the noble Lord about having a balance sheet as well as an income and expenditure account is, to my mind, well made. It is one which I think should be brought up and deserves parliamentary time as we move towards the new method of public accounting.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para4"></a>Turning to the second order, I was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, whether we were using the correct index from the point of view of poverty. The point about using the Rossi index, which is RPI with certain housing costs excluded from it is, first, that it has been used for this purpose since 1983. There are advantages in consistency. Secondly, it maintains the differential between in-work and out-of-work provisions, as I hope I made clear when introducing the order. Different measures are used for different benefits and purposes in government.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para5"></a>Again, some of those measurements exist for historical reasons rather than for reasons which we could now rationally justify. For example, the fact that sometimes we take prospective RPI and sometimes past RPI is difficult to justify rationally, except on the basis of using a swing from one measure to another for base party political purposes. We are not doing that here.

<P>


<a name="column_1552"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1552</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para15"></a>The purpose of the amendment is simple. The danger is that CHI will spend its time inspecting the work of hospital and primary care trusts; but the trusts are simply doing what the department is asking of them.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para16"></a>Obviously, the Government must set priorities in the NHS. That is what they are elected to do, and they will be called to account at election time. But quite how their policy towards the health service is implemented depends a great deal on how the department itself operates.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para17"></a>If, as the Government claim, they do indeed manage to de-centralise, and also&#151;as we seek&#151;more proposals are brought directly to Parliament for approval, or if the NHS is put at arm's length from government, the role of the department might not be so critical. However, that is not the case&#151;and will not be the case even if this Bill as drafted completes its passage. Therefore, the amendment explores the idea that it is also of key importance to patient care to see whether the actions of the Department of Health are also in the best interests of patients.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para18"></a>The Audit Commission has a remit over the Department of Health in terms of how resources are spent. So, for example, the Audit Commission has commented adversely on resources used to reduce waiting lists when these did not greatly assist in patient care. It was also argued by the Minister in the other place that CHI could comment on the commissioning procedure. But that is at a stage down the track from the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para19"></a>We in Parliament clearly have a key role to play in bringing the Government to account for actions within the Department of Health. But if it is indeed appropriate for the Audit Commission to assess whether the department is spending its resources wisely, then surely it is also worth considering having expert assessment of whether the Department of Health, in its priorities and procedures for running the health service, is actually acting at all times in the best interests of the patients.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para20"></a>It is often difficult to gain access to that information as parliamentarians. I point to a report in today's Guardian on the Commons Science and Technology Committee, investigating what is happening to resources for cancer. I have raised this matter previously, and sought Written Answers from the Minister last September. My question was: precisely what happens to money earmarked for cancer since so little of it seems to be reaching its intended target&#151;this despite a government fanfare on the matter. The Guardian article quotes Gordon McVie, of Cancer Research UK, as wondering whether the money,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"has been absorbed like creosote into the fence post of the administration of the health service".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-21_para21"></a>
Quite so.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para22"></a>The Science and Technology Committee reports the difficulty of getting any information on this matter out of the Department of Health. Clinicians on the ground dare say little, lest they offend against all the rules barring them from commenting. Surely there is a case for an inspection body having the right and the duty <P>


<a name="column_1553"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1553</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to go into the Department of Health to make its own investigations and recommendations. It might well say that the department had failed in the way that it had dispatched the money to protect it from marauding administrators trying to fill black holes. Or it could conclude that ring-fencing, when there were so many desperate needs in the health service, was inappropriate. Either way, its expert investigation and report would help to inform both parliamentarians&#151;and indeed the electorate&#151;who are supposed to be able to bring the Government to account.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para23"></a>I do not expect that the Minister will consider the amendment to be a very good idea; nor may those advising him. But while we seek ever more transparent and effective scrutiny procedures in the rest of the NHS, and of those working in the health professions, surely the Minister must also give consideration to such scrutiny closer to home. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-21_spnew4"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I add my support to the amendment. I completely endorse everything that the noble Baroness has said. The odd thing about Section 18 of the Health Act 1999 is the narrowness of its compass. The duty of quality created in that section falls on health authorities, PCTs and NHS trusts. It is expressed as a duty,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to put and keep in place arrangements for the purpose of monitoring and improving the quality of health care which it provides to individuals".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-21_para24"></a><P>

<a name="20321-21_para25"></a>That section is one of the most important in the Act, yet something big appears to be missing from it. Like the noble Baroness, I am struck by the absence of any duty on the Department of Health or the NHS as a whole to promote quality in healthcare.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para26"></a>The Minister's reply is likely to be that the department as such does not deliver healthcare services. There are two rejoinders to that. One is that, while it may not deliver services at the front line, it is instrumental in providing those services&#151;which is the term used in Section 18. I am thinking in particular of the public health role of the CMO. When we debated public health earlier this week, the Minister made it clear that the CMO was ultimately accountable within the body of the NHS for the effective delivery of the Government's public health policy. It seems strange that only lower down the NHS chain of command should a duty of quality be laid down. I might have expected a government amendment to this Bill creating a duty of quality on the NHS as a whole, including the Department of Health, accompanied by a power for the Secretary of State to devolve or delegate that duty to NHS bodies at the front line.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para27"></a>If the Department of Health has been exempted from the duty of quality because it does not commission healthcare services, the same could be said of strategic health authorities, but I take it that they, as successor bodies to health authorities, will be subject to the duty. Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para28"></a>The second rejoinder to what I suspect the Minister will say is to point to the multitude of powers that will continue to reside with the Secretary of State, <P>


<a name="column_1554"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1554</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>notwithstanding the devolutionist flavour of the Bill. Those powers include an ability to intervene directly in the affairs of PCTs, the power to impose targets on the health service, the power to dispense or withhold money according to how well or badly those targets have been met and so on. If there is no duty of quality on the Department of Health, as I read it the centre can legally direct PCTs and trusts in a manner that need take no account of the duty of quality, yet expect PCTs and trusts nevertheless to adhere to that duty. An obvious example springs to mind&#151;the waiting list initiative. If such an initiative obliges PCTs and trusts to override clinical priorities so that those waiting longest, and not necessarily the sickest patients, are treated first, it is very difficult to see how PCTs and trusts can claim, while fulfilling that directive, to be improving the quality of healthcare that they provide.
<P>

<a name="20321-21_para29"></a>The noble Baroness has pinpointed an interesting and potentially far-reaching anomaly in the Bill and in the 1999 Act. It will be illuminating to hear what the Minister has to say.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-22_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I have been rather surprised by the suggestion that quality is not at the forefront of all the department's thinking in its strategic leadership for the health service. That is why we have set up so many of the bodies that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, referred to earlier, such as the National Patient Safety Agency and the Commission for Health Improvement and various other mechanisms. One of the Government's key aims, through the department, has been to improve the overall quality, safety and standard of services to the public.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para0"></a>Section 18 of the 1999 Act came up with the duty of quality to rectify an anomaly that had existed in the NHS for far too long. Although there were financial duties on NHS organisations, before 1999 Act there was no statutory duty on the NHS relating to the quality of the patient care that it provided. That is but one action that we have taken to improve quality generally in the health service. The department has set and implemented an integrated programme of measures to monitor and improve the quality of the healthcare provided by the NHS, as set out in A First Class Service in 1998, strengthened in the NHS Plan in 2000 and taken further still through the recent listening exercise involving patients and the public in healthcare. It is why we also established the quality taskforce in the department, under the co-chairmanship of the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Nursing Officer. Quality permeates all the department's thinking and policy development. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, has debated waiting lists with me on a number of occasions. He will know that we have made it abundantly clear to the health service that, in meeting waiting list targets, clinical priorities must always come first.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para1"></a>On the duty of quality and the issues that the noble Baroness has raised, surely we need to go back to <P>


<a name="column_1555"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1555</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Section 1 of the 1977 Act, which in large part replicates the original 1946 Act, setting out the key aim of the health service. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is the Secretary of State's duty to continue the promotion in England and Wales of a comprehensive health service designed to secure improvement&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-22_para4"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>and for that purpose to provide or secure the effective provision of services in accordance with this Act".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-22_para5"></a>
I emphasise the words "designed to secure improvement in". That is a broad description of what we are seeking to do, which entails within it issues to do with quality and everything else that is important to the development of the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para6"></a>As for Amendment No. 93, the risk seems to be that it would get in the way of the Department of Health's accountability, via Ministers, to Parliament on all aspects of securing healthcare for those who need it. My experience of the past three years is that Department of Health Ministers are very accountable to Parliament. When I think of the number of Parliamentary Questions answered daily, the number of debates in your Lordships' House, the vigour of the Select Committee hearings that I have attended, I am absolutely certain that Parliament has endless opportunities to hold Ministers to account and for Ministers to come to both Houses to explain their own performance.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para7"></a>Although of course I accept that parliamentary scrutiny of a publicly funded NHS is crucially important, I do not believe that the amendment as proposed would help that. I think that, in some ways, it would detract from ministerial accountability to Parliament. Surely our parliamentary democracy must rest on that direct line of accountability.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-22_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe, for his very detailed support. The Minister's comments seemed to bear out some of what I was saying. He referred to the original 1946 Act and also to the 1977 Act, and yet, in the 1999 Act, it was felt necessary, despite that previous legislation, to establish a duty of quality. As the noble Earl pointed out, it is very striking that it includes health authorities, primary care trusts and so on, but does not include the Department of Health, which established the duty. It seems a trifle odd that the department should not be included.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-22_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The department's overriding responsibility was enshrined in the 1946 Act and confirmed in the 1977 Act. The duty of quality was established for NHS organisations because, as experience has shown, discussions in the boards of NHS organisations revolved primarily around management, finance and human resource issues but only very rarely touched on quality issues. Consequently, the specific duty of quality was introduced. In its reviews of clinical governance, CHI has focused particularly on the degree to which the <P>


<a name="column_1556"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1556</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>boards of those NHS organisations have addressed clinical governance and quality issues. That is why NHS organisations were dealt with in that way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-22_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   I thank the Minister for that comment. I should be very interested to see the agendas within the Department of Health, but I do not suppose that they are available. I also wonder whether they include items contributing to the quality debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-22_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I assure the noble Baroness that quality and patient safety issues are paramount in the many discussions held on the fourth floor of Richmond House. As I said, the Chief Nursing Officer and the Chief Medical Officer&#151;who are very powerful individuals with very distinguished records on quality and safety&#151;are leading our quality programmes. I can therefore assure the noble Baroness that quality is a full part of all our considerations in developing policy and managing performance in the NHS.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-22_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. I would not in any way wish to detract from what has been done in trying to introduce a duty of quality in other parts of the health service. If anything, as I said, I should like that duty to be extended. I shall read what the Minister had to say. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para8"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-22_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Northover </B>   moved Amendment No. 94:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 17, line 31, at end insert "including the provision of accessible information for patients, and monitoring the provisions of health and safety legislation and infection control measures"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-22_para9"></a><P>

<a name="20321-22_para10"></a>The noble Baroness said: This amendment seeks to ensure the provision of accessible information to patients and also the monitoring of health and safety legislation and infection control measures. All those elements are important to the quality of patient care. We should perhaps have dealt with them in separate amendments, but, if we had, it would have made the night even longer.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para11"></a>Clearly it is vitally important that information is accessible not only to parliamentarians but to patients. As we shall undoubtedly hear when we discuss patient complaints, things often go wrong because information is not available. Not only should patients be physically well treated, but their more general welfare should be addressed. Access to information is a part of that.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para12"></a>Health and safety regulations relate particularly to staff, and it is essential that they are properly addressed and assessed. The BMA has concluded, however, that, despite existing legislation and guidance, health and safety are still not universally guaranteed throughout the NHS. The NHS has a responsibility under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, and various other regulations on the management of health and safety, to ensure the safety of all employees, contractors, and members of the <P>


<a name="column_1557"></a>

<P>

<a name="20321-22_para14"></a>
I am rather concerned by those provisos.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para15"></a>As part of its inspection process, CHI would be in a prime position to observe whether premises, equipment, practices and procedures in each trust are sufficient to enable best clinical practice. It seems reasonable, therefore, that the Bill should be amended to ensure that that function is covered by CHI.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para16"></a>Although infection has&#151;as Nightingale made clear&#151;always been an issue, it has become a key one in recent years. However, post-antibiotics, there was certainly an optimism that infection was well and truly under control. That optimism has long since passed. Problems such as new variant CJD have introduced areas of concern. It is clearly essential that infection control is properly monitored. One issue which arose in dealing with the problem of disposable instruments, once it became evident that instruments could be a means of infection, was that many hospitals simply did not know which instruments had been used on whom. However, some did know. Clearly, one of CHI's functions should be to spread and encourage best practice. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-22_spnew7"></A><B> Earl Howe: </B>   I am delighted, once again, to support the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, in this amendment. In reading Subsection 4 of Section 18 of the 1999 Act&#151;again we are hampered by not having the wording fully in front of us&#151;I cannot help thinking that much hinges on the meaning of the word "services". Healthcare is defined in that subsection as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"services for or in connection with the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of illness".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-22_para17"></a>
The noble Baroness seeks to add to that definition,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the provision of accessible information for patients".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-22_para18"></a><P>

<a name="20321-22_para19"></a>I should have thought that, on a strict legal interpretation, that was a service, and that that part of the amendment is therefore unnecessary. If the emphasis is on the word "accessible", again, I should have thought that accessibility was bound up with the notion of quality. However, having uttered that caveat, I have much sympathy with the suggestion that those words should be included. It is not so very long ago that patients were expected to accept the treatment they were offered by doctors and be grateful for it. The idea of informing patients about the treatment they were receiving or might receive or about services that they could access was considered somewhat eccentric. So, despite any strict legal interpretations, I am in favour of making this provision explicit, if only as a means of recognising that we are trying to move away from paternalist medicine.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para20"></a>The next part of the amendment has an even stronger claim to our attention. Monitoring the provisions of health and safety legislation and <P>


<a name="column_1558"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1558</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>infection control measures does not seem to me to be a service. However, it is an integral part of being a good employer, as the noble Baroness pointed out, and providing public health services in the broadest sense. As we were informed by the Minister on Monday, much of the monitoring function in the public health context will rest with the PCTs. My only faint worry here is that if we pursue the amendment to its logical end there would be a duty on PCTs and trusts to make arrangements to monitor the quality of monitoring. It is perhaps for discussion what we might understand that to mean.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para21"></a>While the duty of quality already extends to monitoring the quality of healthcare, the noble Baroness made a good point in drawing our attention to health and safety requirements&#151;which surely do not constitute healthcare&#151;and measures which might be in place to deliver the public health agenda, which again need not in all cases fall under the heading of healthcare.

<A NAME="20321-22_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   I support the amendment and, in so doing, ask the Minister who will be in overall charge of infectious control and send out the guidelines to our hospital trusts? With the increase of tuberculosis, it must be a health and safety issue to nurse someone in an open ward. I am sure that the Minister knows of the case of the young girl a few weeks ago who was diagnosed with pneumonia. She had tuberculosis; she was sent home and died. This is an important issue. Such infectious diseases are on the increase.
<P>

<a name="20321-22_para22"></a>Can the Minister tell us the position regarding matrons? We were promised matrons. I believe that someone has been appointed in Birmingham. Matrons have much to do with cleanliness, which concerns the importance of the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-23_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I rise briefly to strongly support the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lady Northover. I do so firstly because of my connection with Cancer Bacup, which has a strong ethos of provision of information to cancer patients, not only by telephone, which is accessible, but through written printed information available in hospitals. It is important that hospitals ensure that such information is available. That seems to me to be a key function to allay some of the fears cancer patients have about the treatments they are undergoing. My second reason is to point out a number of issues which the Improving Lives coalition has brought to my attention in relation to those who are visually impaired.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para0"></a>There is a clear link between how well health services meet disabled people's requirement for accessible information and the quality of care offered to such groups. Indeed, failing to provide accessible test results or to ensure that patients have timely and accessible information about appointments or information leaflets about their condition can have a potentially devastating impact on the health of visually impaired patients and their ability to manage their own health effectively. It is their belief that the <P>


<a name="column_1559"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1559</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>performance of the health service in that area is wholly inadequate. The existing duties under the Disability Discrimination Act to provide information about services in an accessible format do not appear to be biting.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para1"></a>A number of surveys have been carried out. One in 1997 by the RNIB demonstrated that less than half of the health authorities which answered the questionnaire had guidelines for meeting the health information needs of blind and partially-sighted people. An RNIB survey of over 200 visually impaired eye clinic patients found that six in seven people attending ophthalmic patients' outpatients' departments receive their appointment letter only in normal-size print. One in four people had to get someone else to read their appointment letter for them.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para2"></a>The latest research by the RNIB on accessible information should provide a severe jolt to all health service policy makers and practitioners. It found that more than one in five of the total adult population struggle to read labels and instructions on medicines or letters from their doctor. That rises to two in five of those who are 75 or over and to three in four people with sight problems.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para3"></a>The consequences of inaccessible health information can be severe. There are a number of cases of mixing up medication; taking the wrong drugs and missed appointments. Sometimes, patients are in the position of undergoing procedures or operations without accessible information explaining what will happen to them. On the other hand, the provision of accessible health information has been shown to result in more effective and appropriate use of health services, reduced stress, improved recovery of illness and operations and increased compliance with medication and treatment.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para4"></a>I believe that the case for the visually impaired is particularly strong. The health service is not responding adequately to their needs. It should not be left to charities to be responsible for monitoring provision in this area. We should not place the onus on individual disabled people to continually complain and threaten legal action under the DDA. For those reasons, I strongly support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-23_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I agree with the objectives of most of those who have spoken on the amendment. However, I believe we have adequate statutory provisions in place to address them.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para5"></a>The department strongly recognises the importance of provision of accessible information for patients. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, put it clearly: moving away from a paternalistic service which doled out what professionals thought was appropriate to a much more informed dialogue with patients so that they understand what is happening and are able to participate in that process. That clearly is the goal of the health service to which we are strongly committed. We have taken steps to ensure that NHS bodies make such information widely available. We do not for one second imply that we are where we want to be in terms of fully realising that.
<P>


<a name="column_1560"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1560</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para6"></a>On health and safety, we also recognise the importance of the NHS having in place both arrangements for, first, monitoring the provision of health and safety legislation and, secondly, measures for infection control. Enforcement of the provisions of health and safety legislation which are statutory requirements, is already carried out by the Health and Safety Executive in relation to the NHS. CHI is working to develop a memorandum of understanding with the Health and Safety Executive to further co-operation between the two bodies.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para7"></a>On infection control, the NHS Plan implementation programme makes it clear that hospitals must have effective systems in place to prevent and control hospital acquired infections. This is a core requirement underpinning the targets in the NHS Plan and the department has already taken a number of actions to ensure that these systems are in place. The national standards for hospital acquired infection (controls assurance standard) was revised in December 2001.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para8"></a>Hospital infection control guidelines were published in January 2000 and community infection control guidelines are currently under development. The first two quarters' data of the mandatory surveillance of MRSA were published for the department by the Public Health Laboratory Service in February this year as part of the development of a comprehensive National Health Service surveillance service.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para9"></a>The control of healthcare associated infections was recently highlighted in the Chief Medical Officer's strategy for combating infectious diseases, Getting Ahead of the Curve, and an action plan is currently being developed. The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, asked who is in overall charge of infection issues. Clearly the Department of Health has the overall responsibility. On the distressing case of a nurse with TB in an open ward, the chief executive of every board in that situation is responsible to his board for achieving the appropriate quality and preventing infection in such circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para10"></a>The noble Baroness also raised the important issue of what is happening with modern matrons. A considerable number of them are in post. They are highly relevant to the issue of cleanliness and infection control, as the noble Baroness made clear, and there are positive signs that they are having a good effect. The Department of Health also conducts spot checks on cleanliness, which we believe are necessary.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para11"></a>Turning to monitoring and the improvement of infection more generally, Section 18 of the Health Act 1999 places a duty on those National Health Service organisations providing healthcare to individuals to put and keep in place arrangements for the purpose of monitoring and improving the quality of that healthcare.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para12"></a>The extension of the definition of "healthcare" in Section 18, by Clause 11, means that there will be a general duty on National Health Service bodies, pursuant to Section 18, to monitor and improve the quality of the patient environment. That implies a duty to have regard to the availability of information to patients. I concur with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, <P>


<a name="column_1561"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1561</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that services undoubtedly have to incorporate not just the provision of a technical product or service but the totality of the patient relationship that encompasses the dialogue of requests for information and understanding. One cannot deliver good services for any sector without that sort of relationship being in place. By reason of the extension of the definition, CHI will also clearly be able to comment on these matters in its reports, although enforcement of the health and safety legislation will be a matter for the Health and Safety Executive.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, raised the extremely important issue of visual impairment. That is an example of the sort of issue on which we would expect and hope patient forums to focus. They would look at the quality of service provision, not just to the public generally but to those who need access to a different form of service from the standard service that is good enough for the vast majority. Those who are visually impaired are four-square within that definition. We very much hope that the patient forums will attend to those issues.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para14"></a>NHS Direct also has some relevance. It is by no means a total panacea, but it clearly helps those who are visually impaired to have access to high quality information and advice. As the Committee knows, the progress so far is not perfect, but the service is extremely highly valued by many members of the public. We want to take it further and make it better, which is of enormous relevance to the visually impaired.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para15"></a>Patient surveys are being undertaken in every acute trust, and we expect them to pick up on some of those issues of whether the particular disadvantages suffered by some people are being adequately met by the current services. As the clause already refers to the environment in which services are delivered in general terms, which includes having regard to the provision of information and any hazards or risks of infection, I suggest that the amendment to Clause 11 is not necessary and should be rejected.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para16"></a>The issue is not one of having more statutory definition, which is in place, but having the persistence, resolution and drive from the department, together with the commitment of managers, to make some of those goals that already have statutory effect commonplace and universal throughout the service.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-23_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   I thank the Minister for that sympathetic reply. I also thank other Members of the Committee who have participated in the debate.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para17"></a>Clearly more needs to be done to make information accessible. I am encouraged by the Minister about the direction in which the Government are heading. It also sounds encouraging that CHI will be doing more regarding health and safety.
<P>

<a name="20321-23_para18"></a>One of my concerns about infection control is that there are various other bodies looking at the issue. With these new structures there is a danger that things may become fragmented. I hope very much that the Minister is right that with persistence and resolution <P>

 "INDEPENDENT HOSPITALS
<br>
 The Secretary of State shall by regulations extend the functions of the Commission for Health Improvement set out in section 20 of the 1999 Act (functions of the commission) to any independent hospital as defined by section 2 of the Care Standards Act 2000 (c. 14) (independent hospitals etc.)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-24_para0"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 95 seeks to include private hospitals in the same inspection system as the NHS. I declare an indirect interest as my husband, as well as being an NHS surgeon, is also in private practice at the London Clinic and the King Edward VII hospital.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para1"></a>I was astonished when I first discovered that private hospitals were not inspected in the same way as NHS hospitals. That is quite wrong. The case for bringing private acute care within the same inspection system as that for the NHS has long been argued by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones. I should not be surprised if Members of the Committee thought that they would hear from him on this amendment. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, has also argued this case and the Chamber has approved the proposal. So this issue may be quite familiar to many noble Lords today.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para2"></a>From these Benches we welcomed CHI when it was set up in the Health Act 1999. However, we felt strongly that patients should receive the same high quality care wherever they were treated. Therefore, we felt that it was appropriate for CHI to inspect acute care in private as well as NHS hospitals.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para3"></a>In the Care Standards Bill 2000 we welcomed the regulation and inspection of social care, and private and voluntary healthcare premises. But we argued again that acute care in private hospitals should be inspected to the same level as in NHS hospitals.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para4"></a>Patients really do deserve the best possible protection, whether they are being treated in the NHS or the private sector. I noted earlier with great interest that the Minister, in relation to medical registration and training, stated that there should be the same entry requirements wherever a doctor intended to practise, whether private or NHS. The same principle should apply here.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para5"></a>The Commission for Health Improvement covers independent institutions where NHS patients are treated and private care within NHS hospitals, but not private care within private hospitals. We were concerned that neither of the earlier Bills gave the assurance that a duty of quality identical or similar to that required for the NHS was required for the independent sector. But it is only when things go wrong that people discover that that is so. When one thinks of some of the cases that have come up in recent years, it is clear that those being treated in the private <P>


<a name="column_1563"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1563</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sector thought that they were buying not simply a nice hotel room with its own telephone and TV but the consultant of their choice, backed up by an institution with the highest possible standards.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para6"></a>Many institutions have such high standards, but it remains highly inappropriate for them to be inspected as though they were nursing homes. There are over 200 hospitals in the private sector which comprise approximately 10,000 beds. There are some 800,000 treatments carried out by 17,000 doctors, most of whom also work in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para7"></a>As I have mentioned, in the relevant health Bills in 1999 and 2000, noble Lords supported the proposal that independent hospitals should be brought within the scope of the regulations. In the end the point had to be conceded in the face of government opposition in the other place.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para8"></a>We believe that every patient deserves common minimum standards of care. The Government have a responsibility to ensure that minimum standards are maintained and seen to be maintained. We need consistency in those standards and consistency in enforcement.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para9"></a>The Government have argued in the past that the two healthcare systems under which NHS and private hospitals operate are different; that one is a managed system and the other is a regulated system. But inspection is to do with regulation. It must be right that the Government take appropriate measures to protect their citizens within the private sector and for that sector to come within the thorough inspection system that we have now come to expect, and welcome, within the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para10"></a>In January, Mr Milburn's response to the Kennedy report was that there would be a coming together and better co-ordination of NHS inspection systems; and that the CHI is to be strengthened and made more independent. Now is surely the time, if not before, to ensure that the private acute sector is properly brought within the same kind of inspection system as that which applies to the acute sector of the NHS. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-24_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   We fully support the intent of the amendment&#151;as with the earlier amendment about merging the function of the National Care Standards Commission and the CHI. In Committee on 18th March, the Minister mentioned, in respect of the Care Standards Act 2000,

<br>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-24_para11"></a>
I understand that that would bring the inspection of independent sector hospitals within the remit of the CHI. What precise effect would that have&#151;and to what extent would it meet the excellent points made by the noble Baroness?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-24_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   I, too, support the amendment. Patients can be at risk in a private hospital when they are in single rooms. In an NHS hospital, other patients are around. When a person gets into difficulty and there are no staff around&#151;which often happens when there is a shortage, as there <P>


<a name="column_1564"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1564</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is now&#151;patients help each other. My husband has been treated in NHS hospitals and in a private hospital. In the latter, he got a thrombosis in his leg and was discharged without a proper check-up, which could have been avoided. I feel strongly that minimum standards should apply in all hospitals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-24_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I have great sympathy with the broad thrust of the noble Baroness's arguments but it is a question of timing. The amendment is rather premature, in view of the amount of work that must be undertaken to take forward the rationalisation of inspection agencies at national level to which my right honourable friend the Secretary of State referred following the Bristol inquiry report.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para12"></a>We made provision in the Care Standards Act 2000 for the CHI to exercise functions of the National Care Standards Commission in relation to the independent sector. The noble Baroness kindly reminded me of the debates on that subject. She will recall that, when we enacted the Bill, we considered it right that the regulation of private health care should be different from the arrangements for the independent review of NHS bodies by the CHI.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para13"></a>Life moves on and there have been considerable developments since we debated that point. The Bill gives the CHI a new function of inspection against published standards. That responsibility will extend to services for NHS patients wherever they are treated, including those provided by the independent sector. It is clear from Government action in the past few months that an increasing number of NHS patients are being treated in the independent sector. It is clear also that&#151;particularly during the transitional period, as we try to build capacity in the NHS&#151;we will continue to use the independent sector. While we are clear that private and voluntary health care must remain under a system of regulation or licensing, the time is right for the CHI to inspect independent hospitals on behalf of the National Care Standards Commission.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para14"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, reminded me that I made it clear on Monday night that we will bring Section 9 of the 2000 Act into force shortly and make regulations, so that the CHI may exercise the commission's function of inspection in relation to indpendent hospitals.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para15"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, asked me to fill in some of the detail. Of course, we are still considering that and it will be contained in the regulations. However, essentially, the regulation of private healthcare institutions remains the responsibility of the National Care Standards Commission. We propose that the inspection function itself should be undertaken by the Commission for Health Improvement, but acting within the ambit of legislation that gives the overall responsibility to the National Care Standards Commission. It is a halfway house, as it were. We are trying to get as much consistency as possible in the inspections process, bearing in mind that the current legislative requirement is for the National Care Standards Commission to have the ultimate responsibility for private hospital regulation.
<P>


<a name="column_1565"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1565</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para16"></a>I said that that is a transitional phase because, as my right honourable friend the Secretary of State made clear, we are seriously considering have to obtain closer working and, over time, organisational integration between CHI, the Social Services Inspectorate, the National Care Standards Commission and the Audit Commission so that health and social care services are subject to common standards, whether they are provided by public, private or voluntary sector organisations.
<P>

<a name="20321-24_para17"></a>That is clearly an extensive piece of work to be undertaken during the next few months. That is why it would be premature to legislate in the Bill to bring together CHI and the National Care Standards Commission. As I said, we are bringing Section 9 into operation as a means of having as much consistency as possible between CHI and the National Care Standards Commission. I hope that I have made clear our intended direction of travel. Although I do not recommend that we accept the amendments, I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that we are going in the same direction, but that a considerable amount of work will need to be done.

<P>
<A NAME="20321-25_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   That is about as close to an apology for previous legislation that I have ever heard a Minister give. If the Minister wants to achieve such integration, will not further primary legislation be necessary?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I was simply seeking to suggest to the noble Lord that, since our debates a couple of years ago, life has moved on and there have been developments. The relationship of the National Health Service with the independent sector has evolved. For that reason, it is right to reconsider the issues.
<P>

<a name="20321-25_para0"></a>I accept that primary legislation will be required at the end of the journey to integrate national inspection systems against common standards. It would be premature to legislate in the Bill, because much work needs to be undertaken.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-25_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   I have one further question. Will that be before the National Care Standards Commission is even formed and up and running?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   That is because we generously allowed such a long lead time to allow the commission to establish its work.

<A NAME="20321-25_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   In his speech my right honourable friend did not confine himself to the National Care Standards Commission and the Commission for Health Improvement. He also referred specifically to the Audit Commission and the Social Services Inspectorate. The speech followed up our response to the Bristol inquiry.
<P>

<a name="20321-25_para1"></a>These are complicated matters that need full consideration. Even if we wanted to wave a magic wand and say, "Yes, we'd love to legislate in this Bill", it would not be possible to bring forward carefully thought-out legislation at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-25_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   It strikes me as ironic that it is fine to change the structure of the NHS fairly rapidly, which is a complicated thing to do, but in this area, where the lives of individual patients are affected, it is said to be premature to take action on the proper inspection of hospitals. That surprises me.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-25_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The proposals in the Bill arise from the NHS Plan and Shifting the Balance of Power. They have been given careful thought and consideration by the Government over a considerable period of time. My right honourable friend's speech only a few weeks ago arose directly from the recommendations of Professor Sir Ian Kennedy in the Bristol inquiry, which reported only a few months ago. That is why it is important that we have time to reflect on the best way to achieve integration between these different bodies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-25_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. However, I point out that in this Chamber, which may not be the fastest-moving place, a decision was taken in 1999 and 2000 to include private hospitals in the inspection system. It is a shame that it is taking a while.
<P>

<a name="20321-25_para2"></a>I am encouraged by the Minister's comments. I hope that when the inspection is extended&#151;it certainly sounds as if it will be&#151;it will cover the whole of the private acute sector and not simply those parts in which the NHS is involved. It is important for citizens as a whole&#151;for all patients&#151;to know that they are safe in the institutions in which they are treated. I look forward to reading the Minister's comments in Hansard. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-25_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment seeks to amend Section 20(2) of the Health Act 1999, which deals with the functions of the Commission for Health Improvement. The amendment would allow the regulations made under that subsection to include CHI taking into account the co-ordination of CHI's own visits with those of other bodies carrying out monitoring or inspecting the same premises. Trusts, GP surgeries and so on face a multitude of visits and inspections from various bodies in addition to CHI. There are visits by the Audit Commission, the Royal Colleges, CHCs and, if the Bill is passed, patient forums, and many other bodies, such as the Modernisation Agency.
<P>

<a name="20321-25_para7"></a>My noble friend Lord Peyton of Yeovil told us on the second Committee day that the multiplicity of inspections was described to him as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"death by a thousand visits".&#151;[Official Report, 18/3/02; col. 1203.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-25_para8"></a>
The British Medical Association feels strongly about the issue and supports the amendment. I hope that the Minister will say whether the Government intend to do anything to streamline the visits and relieve the burden on doctors, other health professionals and their staff.
<P>

<a name="20321-25_para9"></a>The bottom line is that every minute spent on such visits is a minute not spent on patient care, and anything that can be done to minimise their impact will be welcomed. The amendment does not seek to cure the totality of the problem but seeks to co-ordinate visits which are focused on monitoring and inspection. It is a modest contribution to the problem and I hope that it will commend itself to the Minister. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-25_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   I support this amendment. We all agree that CHI is a welcome creation doing a good job. However, given the duplication&#151;no doubt other Members of the Committee will have a copy of the chart from the BMA of the various ways in which doctors can be assessed, monitored, checked, revalidated and so forth&#151;the complexity is obvious. We should do all we can to ensure that that duplication and that kind of complexity is made simpler.
<P>

<a name="20321-25_para10"></a>Most of the visits made by those bodies are of course appropriate. But we can try to ensure that there is co-ordination and that inspections by the various organisations do not cause disruption. An interesting analogy was drawn in the other place where they talked of the digging up and re-digging up of roads. If we can simply co-ordinate the various bodies who have to dig up the roads, it would make more sense than endlessly having one digging up a road this week and another digging it up next week. On the basis therefore that we seek co-ordination of this kind of inspection, I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-25_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   From my remarks on our intent to rationalise the inspection mechanism at national level, Members of the Committee will understand that I am sympathetic with the broad arguments of the noble Baroness in terms of a rationalisation of inspectorates at local level.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-25_para11"></a>I make two points. First, the reason why various organisations visit the NHS is to ensure that quality and safety&#151;issues we have already debated&#151;are paramount. One makes no apologies for the extension of those inspection agencies into primary care. However, I fully accept that there must be co-ordination and rationalisation, and that the burden put on busy people operating front-line services is as light as is possible consistent with a rigorous approach to safety and quality.
<P>

<a name="20321-25_para12"></a>The Commission for Health Improvement is at the moment piloting its inspections of primary care trusts. Part of those inspections will involve visits to some individual GP surgeries. In the discussions that the department had with CHI we came to a mutual understanding that those visits will be light touch, for the very reason the noble Baroness put forward.
<P>

<a name="20321-25_para13"></a>The CHI has also taken other steps to co-ordinate activity with relevant bodies. It has already agreed a draft statement of principles for consultation covering how it plans to improve co-ordination with the Audit Commission, including external audit, NHS internal audit, the Health and Safety Executive and the NHS Litigation Authority, including the clinical negligence scheme for trusts. CHI also has a memorandum of understanding with a number of relevant bodies including the commission, the Audit Commission, the Health Service Ombudsman, the General Medical Council, the UKCC, the National Clinical Assessment Authority and it is working to develop others, including the Health and Safety Executive. My understanding is that copies of those memoranda have already been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20321-25_para14"></a>Therefore the Commission for Health Improvement is well exercised of the need to ensure that there is co-ordination and to avoid duplication. We will encourage the commission to continue that good work, which is entirely consistent with what we seek to do at national level. We do not need the amendment as it is tabled. The Secretary of State already has the powers to encourage CHI to continue this process of co-ordination and I am satisfied, from my meetings with CHI, that it is fully cognisant of the need to move in the direction the noble Baroness suggested.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-26_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that. Would he just say how long CHI has been trying to co-ordinate its visits? I ask this because the complaints about the duplication of visits, the multiplicity of visits, and the serial visits, are of relatively recent origin. The source of this amendment was not some long-forgotten complaint; rather it relates to current complaints, in particular by the British Medical Association. Even if CHI has been doing it for some time, it has not been doing it very well; and that makes one think that perhaps an amendment is needed.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-26_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The Commission for Health Improvement has not been in existence for very long, so it is not surprising that there is, inevitably, a learning curve. One expects CHI to learn from some of the concerns that have been expressed. In recent discussions with officials in the department, I have <P>


<a name="column_1569"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1569</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discussed the particular issue of the piloting of the clinical governance reviews of primary care trusts where the issue of light-touch visits to GP surgeries has been raised. I am satisfied that CHI is fully cognisant of the need to try to rationalise these as much as possible.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para0"></a>The process is developing. It takes time to gain experience and for the inspection agencies to learn from that. I believe that learning is taking place. Noble Lords' comments tonight will certainly feed back to CHI and I think they will be very helpful.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-26_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the noble Lord for that, and I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, for her support for this amendment. I am not convinced that the words actually match up with actions on the ground, but I am sure that those who have been particularly concerned about this matter will look carefully at the Minister's words in Hansard, as indeed shall I. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-26_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Northover </B>   moved Amendment No. 97:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 18, line 12, after "(2)", insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-26_para2"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
"(a) paragraphs (a) and (b) are omitted, and"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-26_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 97 seeks to delete two paragraphs of the Health Act 1999 in relation to powers held by the Secretary of State in regard to CHI.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para4"></a>As Professor Kennedy has said, it is essential that CHI,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"should be suitably structured so as to give it the necessary independence and authority",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-26_para5"></a>
to carry out its work. The paragraphs that we seek to delete from Section 20 of the 1999 Act are ones which allow the Secretary of State by regulation to make provision,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"as to the times at which, the cases in which, the manner in which, the persons in relation to which or the matters with respect to which any functions of the Commission are to be exercised ... [and] as to the matters to be considered or taken into account in connection with the exercise of any functions of the Commission".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-26_para6"></a><P>

<a name="20321-26_para7"></a>The Government say that they are making CHI more independent. If so, how does this fit with these lines? They give the Secretary of State power to restrict the ability of CHI to talk to the people to whom it needs to talk, to make investigations and reviews when it wants, and to consider cases as it wants. Nothing, and certainly not a Secretary of State, should threaten the remit, independence, scope and ability of CHI to make such investigations.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para8"></a>When my honourable friend Dr Evan Harris introduced this amendment in the other place, the Minister there argued that removing these provisions cut across the Secretary of State's ability to co-ordinate inspection. However, they do not look to me like a series of powers which ensure co-ordination and, drawn as widely as they are, there has to be a risk that they could be used to undermine the independence of CHI. I therefore flag up this amendment as indicative <P>


<a name="column_1570"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1570</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the kind of area which must be addressed if CHI is to be, and to be seen to be, independent of the Secretary of State and not controlled by him. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-26_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I rise to speak briefly in support of this amendment. To some extent it anticipates a later amendment dealing with the independence of CHI, and we fully support that direction of travel. Indeed, one might say, looking at Section 20 of the 1999 Act, that this amendment singles out paragraphs (a) and (b) but one might even extend it further and look at the whole of Section 20 to discover why a Secretary of State should keep any of the powers to direct CHI in such a detailed way if it is decided to give CHI more independence.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para9"></a>I do not know whether the Minister is going to say that the powers need to be kept in reserve and would be used only in exceptional cases. If he does say that, I think that we have to take it with a pinch of salt because the mere fact of the existence of such powers, whether or not they are used in a formal sense, subtly undermines the independence of such bodies. If a body knows that the Secretary of State can issue directions or make regulations telling it what to do, the mere existence of that power tends to induce compliance and reduce independence. We support the amendment.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I should state clearly to the Committee that we are very keen to enhance the independence of the Commission for Health Improvement. There is no reason for the Government to wish to inhibit that independence. The whole rigour of what we are seeking to achieve&#151;namely, to drive up standards in the health service&#151;depends to a great extent on the credibility of the commission and on the way it is regarded by both the public and those working in the health service.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para10"></a>There simply would not be any reason for the Government to wish to undermine the independence of the Commission for Health Improvement. When we debate Clause 14, Members of the Committee will discover that we are making moves to remove the requirement, for example, for the Secretary of State to consent to the appointment of CHI's chief executive, and the Secretary of State's direction-making power in respect of the terms under which the commission employs people. That is why we are providing for certain of CHI's functions in relation to the collection and analysis of data and performance assessment to be carried out by the Office for Information on Healthcare Performance.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para11"></a>At the same time, the performance ratings that we published last year will, this July, be jointly produced by the department and CHI. In July 2003, the performance ratings will be produced by the commission. We are most anxious that CHI should perform as rigorous a role as possible. There is no question of seeking to interfere in the inspection process that CHI undertakes. We have discussions with the commission about its workload because, from <P>


<a name="column_1571"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1571</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the department's point of view, we have been encouraging CHI to undertake as many inspections as is possible.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para12"></a>Regular meetings take place between the chair and the chief executive of CHI to enable us to engage in mutual discussion about its work and the issues that have arisen. The department's Ministers are most concerned to learn from CHI what it has discovered in the health service. I particularly commend the CHI reports that comment on how much clinical governance, for example, is ingrained within the work of boards, and, indeed, whether boards have information strategies. Many other issues are identified in CHI reports, and that information can then help the department in its performance management of the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para13"></a>I turn to the purpose of the amendment. It seems to me that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, sought to forecast what I would say in response. She is absolutely right in that respect. Ultimately, the Secretary of State is accountable to Parliament for the performance of the Commission for Health Improvement. In the very unlikely event that any serious problem should arise in the way that CHI performed its functions, or in its general operation, the Secretary of State must have a power of intervention. That is why the power is in the Bill. It is no different from many other non-departmental public bodies.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para14"></a>I can assure the Committee that that is why the power is there; it is not there to intervene and to dictate to CHI what should be mentioned in its reports. The power forms a necessary part of Ministers' accountability to Parliament. For that reason, I urge the noble Baroness not to press the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-26_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply, and the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, for her support. I reiterate that we welcome CHI; indeed, we very much welcome the developments that have come in its wake. However, we should consider what might happen as we come up to an election, for example, or consider the case of the Chief Inspector of Prisons. For a while, an inspector's reports may be welcomed, but, later, he may be out in the cold. The first inspections may be considered useful, but if there are repeated poor reports on hospitals, as we approach a general election, the temptation for a Secretary of State who has some direct control over an institution such as CHI will be intense.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-26_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   There are two safeguards against that. First, there is the integrity of the chairperson, chief executive and non-executive directors of the Commission for Health Improvement. Anyone who knows Dame Deirdre Hine, the chair of CHI, or Dr Peter Homa, the chief executive, would quickly come to the view that they are people of great integrity who would not bow to any influence of that kind.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para15"></a>Secondly, if powers of direction had to be issued, that would be in the public domain. I should have thought that that would create a much bigger noise than any adverse report by CHI on an NHS trust. CHI <P>


<a name="column_1572"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1572</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has already produced a considerable number of reports. Some are outstanding reports on hospitals. For instance, CHI produced a report on Addenbrooke's NHS Trust three or four weeks ago, which indicated that the hospital was outstanding in many ways. The reports on other hospitals have been disappointing and negative and have identified areas in which improvement must take place.
<P>

<a name="20321-26_para16"></a>The purpose of setting up CHI was to have a rigorous, independent process that indicated to the public and to the NHS that we had a system that really got to grips with problems in the health service. It is inconceivable that Ministers would wish to interfere with that process.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200102/ldhansrd/vo020321/text/20321-27.htm"/>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   I thank the Minister for those comments. The Government certainly deserve credit for setting up CHI, given that no previous government did so. I am happy to give the Government that credit.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para0"></a>However, if we consider the model of the Chief Inspector of Prisons, we can see what may happen down the track. The Government might be relieved to see the amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay of Llandaff, which really would remove CHI from the control of the Secretary of State and make it answerable to a Select Committee of Parliament. If it were directly answerable to Parliament, there would be no temptation for the Secretary of State to exercise&#151;or otherwise&#151;any influence over CHI, should pressures arise down the track. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-27_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 98:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 18, line 15, leave out subsection (5).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-27_para2"></a><P>

<a name="20321-27_para3"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 98 is a probing amendment. It would remove subsection (5) of Clause 12.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para4"></a>At first sight, the clause is innocuous, simply requiring the Audit Commission to consult the Commission for Health Improvement on its programme of value for money studies in relation to the NHS. However, the Audit Commission is a fully independent body with statutory duties to carry out audit. In arriving at its programme, it consults many people and organisations, as one would expect a responsible public body to do. I hope that few would argue with the proposition that the Audit Commission is an effective and responsible public body.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para5"></a>Why do the Government feel that it is necessary for statute to prescribe whom the Audit Commission should consult? Do the Government feel that the Audit Commission is not doing its job properly? Will the Minister say what the Government's view is? Why is the Audit Commission treated differently from the National Audit Office? The National Audit Office is not required by statute to consult over its audit programme.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para6"></a>Such clauses raise concerns about other agendas. We know from the Government's response to the Bristol report, which has been quoted several times <P>


<a name="column_1573"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1573</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>during our deliberations in Committee, that the Secretary of State does have an agenda with regard to the relationship between the Audit Commission and CHI, because he said that there needed to be closer working and, over time, organisational integration between CHI and, inter alia, the Audit Commission. That raises very serious issues about the integrity of public sector audit.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para7"></a>I ask the Minister to explain what are the Government's precise intentions in relation to the Audit Commission. I ask him also to say what is meant by "closer working" and when "organisational integration" might take place. Can he confirm that no changes are intended which would undermine the independence and effectiveness of the public audit function in relation to the NHS? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   The question of the intention of my right honourable friend since his speech concerning the integration of inspection functions has been made clear in my response to the amendment moved a short while ago by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. I said then that I thought her amendment was premature because the detailed work that will have to be done to develop ideas about future integration has only just started. That is because the Bristol report is not old and we have had to consider our comments on the work programme that needs to follow. In a sense, therefore, I do not think that I can answer the questions raised by the noble Baroness because this is work in hand and we shall need to consider these matters very carefully.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para8"></a>However, I can say to the noble Baroness that of course I greatly respect the work of the Audit Commission. I have had long experience of dealing with the commission and reading its reports. I know of the benefits that it has brought. Equally, as noble Lords themselves have pointed out, and just as the noble Baroness argued earlier, I believe that we need to sort out inspections at local level and national level. We need to avoid duplication. The whole purpose of including the clause in the Bill was not in any way an attempt to restrict the independence or decision-making process of the Audit Commission, but rather merely to ensure that consideration would be made of CHI's work programme so that the organisations themselves could best consider how to avoid duplication and hold general discussions about their respective work programmes.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para9"></a>I should stress that there is no suggestion whatever that in doing this we are seeking to undermine the independence of the Audit Commission, which I agree is an extremely important facet of its work.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-27_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Clement-Jones: </B>   Perhaps I may pick up on a point just made by the Minister. I welcome what he has said about the Audit Commission because I am sure that he is aware that considerable value is put on the commission's value-for-money audits as a specific exercise, quite apart from any health aspect. It has that <P>


<a name="column_1574"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1574</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>specialism. I believe that strong opposition would be brought to bear on any attempt to try to over-integrate in that respect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   One thing that I have learned over the years is that the Audit Commission is a very powerful defender of its own interests. I am sure that in any discussions about its future role, it will be well able to put across its own point of view.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para10"></a>I should also have said to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that I understand that in the relevant section of the Audit Commission Act 1998, we are adding to the names of the Secretary of State for Health and the Comptroller and Auditor-General in relation to the National Audit Office. Given the importance of the Commission for Health Improvement in relation to inspections in the health service, I should have thought that it was appropriate to add CHI's name to that list.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-27_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. I do not feel very much the wiser for it because I still do not quite understand why this particular consultation requirement needs to be put on to the face of the Bill. However, often when we urge the Minister to accept amendments which seek to make things clear, we receive a response which states in effect that of course the Government already do that and so it is irrelevant to put anything on to the face of the Bill. Here we are trying to take something off the face of the Bill in circumstances where a responsible Audit Commission would almost certainly consult, and yet we have the argument put back to us in a different way.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para11"></a>I am very surprised that the Secretary of State could have said what he did on 17th January in relation to the organisational integration between CHI and the Audit Commission, and yet here we are, two months later, and the Minister can give the Committee no details whatever. I find that surprising. I want to reflect further before Report stage. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="column_1575"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1575</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Northover, for having set the scene for the amendment. The Minister referred to the report, Learning from Bristol. That report states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The NHS is quintessentially a statement of political values. Thus, it is inevitable and right that central government should seek to lay down the parameters of the NHS's activities, particularly in the realm of finance and priorities. But, once this is done, the systems for monitoring the extent to which it is meeting its stated aims must, in our view, be de-politicised, so as thereby to rekindle and maintain public confidence in the NHS".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-27_para15"></a>
It is this role that I wish to address.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para16"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for expanding on some of the increased freedom that CHI will experience. I understand that it will be able to appoint chief executives through the commission itself and that its reports are to be laid before Parliament. The Bill will enable CHI to undertake inspections, including where NHS services are provided from premises not directly owned by the NHS. The Minister has clearly outlined the need for CHI to be independent.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para17"></a>All the regulatory bodies concerned with the NHS&#151;which is a national service&#151;must be answerable directly to Parliament. Other regulatory bodies&#151;the professions' regulatory bodies&#151;will be discussed in detail later.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para18"></a>I am suggesting that a parliamentary committee should be drawn from both Houses, ensuring representation from the four countries of the United Kingdom, and that such a committee shall never have a majority of members from one political party. In the event of a coalition of two parties, it would be important to ensure that it did not operate in such a way as to create a majority on the committee. Thus the committee would be politically neutral in terms of pressure prior to an election. It is anticipated that representatives of the government of the day would not constitute more than 40 per cent of the proposed health Joint Select Committee.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para19"></a>Such details are suggestions only at this stage; it is the principle that is of concern. Currently, there is no professional regulatory body for managers. May I preface my next remarks by stating that I work for an NHS trust with excellent management, which maintains an open dialogue with all staff at all grades. However, our recent debate involving research and teaching highlights the need for resources such as rooms, photocopying and IT facilities.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para20"></a>The CHI reports have been excellent. Like the Kennedy report, they have outlined that the state of the NHS is in the hands of managers, and good management is integral to clinical governance. I sincerely hope that the recommendations of the Kennedy report will be followed and that such regulatory bodies will be directly answerable to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para21"></a>CHI inspects the service and recommends improvements. It must be free to exercise its functions with rigour. CHI must report to Parliament in such a way that it can be questioned&#151;it should not simply lay a report before Parliament&#151;and hence the idea of the committee.
<P>


<a name="column_1576"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1576</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para22"></a>Amendment No. 114A seeks to ensure that the organisation referred to in the Bill as the "patients forum", which will have an important function in obtaining the views of NHS users, will also be answerable in such a way. The patients forum must seek the views of NHS users&#151;be they patients, relatives or carers&#151;and it must be allowed to be independent of service providers. I believe that it should have equal standing with the inspection roles of other inspection bodies. Therefore, it should be able to present its report to such a parliamentary committee. While the patients forums will be working with trusts, they must have the ability to be completely independent of the trusts, and of the government of the day.
<P>

<a name="20321-27_para23"></a>Fortunately, the consultation processes that have taken place in Wales, which were outlined earlier in our debates, have been very effective in some areas. We are fortunate to have retained community health councils. I know that we are not to debate community health councils, but the report from such patients forums must have the high status and standing that we have been able to retain in community health councils in Wales. They have recently been involved in two important research projects&#151;one with the Organ Retention Advisory Group, where they sought the views of the general public, and another where they have been working on the standards that patients and their relatives require from the health services in Wales. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20321-28_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   I welcome the amendment. The Select Committees of the Houses of Parliament have already developed an important scrutiny role. They should in future develop that function further, acting on behalf of Parliament, and be able to specialise in particular areas and report to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para0"></a>If CHI answered to a Select Committee such as that suggested in the amendment, the Minister would not need to worry about needing to protest that no undue control or influence is exerted over what all agree should be an independent body. Therefore, I strongly welcome this proposal.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-28_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   This has been an interesting debate about the accountability to Parliament of CHI and of the patients forums, on which we shall no doubt have an interesting discussion in some four weeks' time.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para1"></a>The amendments proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, seek to assume that Parliament would decide to create what is referred to as a health Joint Select Committee. Later, we shall debate also the group of amendments dealing with the council for the regulation of health care professionals in relation to this committee. What in effect the amendments would do would be to have the Commission for Health Improvement and patients forums present their annual reports to the Joint Select Committee.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para2"></a>The current position is that CHI makes an annual report on the exercise of its functions to the Secretary of State, like other non-departmental public bodies. But it is an important measure of its great <P>


<a name="column_1577"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1577</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>independence that, under Clause 14(4), CHI will also in future be required to complete an annual report on the quality of services to NHS patients, which the Secretary of State will be under a duty to lay before Parliament. So, even if Parliament decided to set up a Joint Select Committee as proposed in the amendment, it would not add anything if CHI were to send its report there as well as to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para3"></a>Equally, patients forums will make an annual report to the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health, as well as to the Secretary of State. These reports will feed in to the commission's own annual report, which the Secretary of State will be under a duty to lay before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para4"></a>I understand what the noble Baroness is getting at. However, we are in an extremely difficult position if we seek in the Bill to suggest how Parliament might establish Select Committees in the future. That is not the way in which Parliament operates, and it is not the way in which decisions are made about the agreement to set up Select Committees of either House or Joint Select Committees.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para5"></a>Of course, if Parliament decided to establish such a Select Committee, it would be the duty of NHS bodies to co-operate with it. That is what happens at the moment. For example, the Select Committee on Health is currently undertaking an inquiry into the work of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. I spent two and a half happy hours before the committee a week or so ago undergoing what might be described as effective scrutiny. There is nothing to prevent Parliament holding organisations such as the Commission for Health Improvement to account through its normal processes. Our aim in the Bill is to enhance the reporting of those organisations to Parliament. For that reason, while I certainly understand what the noble Baroness is getting at, I urge her to consider not pressing the amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-28_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   I am most grateful to the Minister for his reply and for his generosity in understanding what I am getting at, as I am a novice to the parliamentary system. I am grateful for his explanation. I shall consider the issues further and may return to them later. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-28_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 99:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 12, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-28_para8"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS OF THE COMMISSION FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT
<br>
 The Commission for Health Improvement shall have such further functions as may be prescribed relating to the management, co-ordination, provision or quality of public health services for which prescribed NHS bodies, service providers, local authorities or other bodies have responsibility."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-28_para9"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would extend the remit of the Commission for Health Improvement to public health. It would enable the Secretary of State to prescribe functions relating to the <P>


<a name="column_1578"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1578</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>management, co-ordination, provision or quality of public health services, for which a wide range of bodies have responsibility.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para10"></a>CHI's functions under the Health Act 1999 are expressed in terms of healthcare, as are the amendments in the Bill. Notable by its absence from CHI's remit is public health, yet public health issues are as important as&#151;some would say more important than&#151;those involved in the delivery of healthcare.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para11"></a>The Committee has already debated the importance of public health in relation to the roles of the strategic health authorities, primary care trusts and regional directors of public health. It is fair to say that our debates on earlier amendments left a number of concerns hanging relating to whether those public health responsibilities would in practice be discharged effectively.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para12"></a>We know that the Government's intention is that PCTs will take the lead on health issues and that they will have a director of public health. We know that they will be encouraged to work in public health networks and that the directors of public health will come new to their responsibilities in PCTs from a variety of backgrounds, some medical and some non-medical.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para13"></a>It seems inevitable that the public health function of PCTs will need some strong oversight. CHI seems the obvious organisation to provide that. However, the amendment is not just about keeping an eye on PCTs and their new public health functions. We know that there are major public health issues to be grappled with. The amendment would give CHI, as an independent inspectorate, the responsibility for finding out what is being done on various public health issues to achieve public health aims, as well as disseminating best practice and reporting when not enough is being done.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para14"></a>I hope that the Minister will accept the amendment as one based on plain common sense. If he resists it, will he explain why public health must remain outside CHI's remit and what alternative arrangements would give the same oversight and rigour? I beg to move.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-28_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Northover: </B>   I support the amendment. Several key issues are emerging as this Bill rolls along. Noble Lords are giving a guarded welcome to the notion of devolving resources and decision-making in the NHS, but there is enormous concern about the speed with which that is happening and whether PCTs are anywhere near being ready to take up their key tasks. There is increasing concern about matters that particularly require a national overview. Public health is one such matter.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para15"></a>Public health&#151;like teaching and research, as we debated the other day&#151;is too often likely to be squeezed out by what seem to be more pressing concerns. Devolution is one thing, but fragmentation is quite another. What we are hearing about the parcelling out of public health responsibilities to one lead official here and one there obviously causes <P>


<a name="column_1579"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1579</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>concern; it is not a recipe for satisfactory co-ordination. Moreover, as has emerged too clearly from the Bristol inquiry, too little data are available in the health service to know what is happening where, and to know what has been happening where. The fact that public health is a key responsibility therefore has to be built into PCTs' remit.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para16"></a>Even then, however, the way in which PCTs exercise that responsibility will have to be carefully scrutinised. I fully agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, that that is where CHI may be able to assist. That is why it is being proposed that CHI's role should be extended to cover the monitoring, inspection, reporting, co-ordination, management and quality of public health. I therefore very much welcome the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-28_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Finlay of Llandaff: </B>   In supporting this amendment, I shall approach it from a slightly different angle: public health's importance, as we have discussed, to national defence. I know that Ministers have recently received many questions on smallpox vaccine. In the event of a sudden catastrophic epidemic of any sort, the public health services will be called on to be the plank on which catastrophic infections are controlled. The public health services co-ordinate, for example, the control of meningitis outbreaks.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para17"></a>The organisation of public health services is absolutely crucial in their ability to respond. I support the amendment because the organisation of such services must be in good order at all times so that they are not found wanting when called on in an emergency.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-28_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   Public health covers so many important aspects. There is a strong feeling that PCTs will be overloaded, but everyone working in the National Health Service and social care should be helping with public health. I am sure that the Commission for Health Improvement can help improve public health as it goes about its work. It can look, encourage and report if not enough is being done. I hope that the Government will support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-28_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I agree that this is a very important matter, although, as the Committee will know, I am more optimistic than some noble Lords about the capability of primary care trusts to accept the very important public health role they are being given. The term "public health services" goes very wide and might include protection against communicable diseases or other hazards to health and health promotion. The ambit of the expression is not entirely clear because the term is not currently defined in the Health Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para18"></a>Noble Lords will recall that on 10th January the Chief Medical Officer announced proposals for a health protection agency to streamline the services involved in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. This agency will provide an integrated approach to all aspects of health protection, including chemical and radiological hazards as well as infectious disease control. The agency will take over functions <P>


<a name="column_1580"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1580</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>currently performed by the Public Health Laboratory Service, the National Radiological Protection Board, the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, and the National Focus for Chemical Incidents. It will also assume responsibility for employing consultants in communicable disease control.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para19"></a>The new agency will work closely with regional and local services and the expert government advisory committees. It will also work with CHI where there are serious deficiencies in standards of infection control in hospitals, primary care or other health service premises. That will give us a great deal of confidence about the national arrangements and the integration of public health protection surveillance services, as well as infectious disease control, about which I know that noble Lords are anxious.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para20"></a>Alongside that we shall have robust performance management of the public health function throughout the National Health Service. From this April the regional directors of public health will design, develop and maintain public health networks. They will be responsible for the overall tackling of the root causes of ill-health inequalities through the health component across government policies. They will manage and co-ordinate the health protection and emergency planning functions in their regions. The focus of the directors of health and social care performance management function will be to take a national overview of performance, negotiating performance agreements with strategic health authorities, holding strategic health authorities to account for performance and supporting the development of individual organisations and the whole system to help them to deliver improvements to patients.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para21"></a>While not duplicating the work of directors of public health in primary care trusts or that of regional directors of public health, strategic health authorities will also have responsibility for performance management of public health action within primary care trusts and in hospital trusts. In future, we shall have a strong performance management system with clear performance management relationships coming down from the regional directors of public health, reporting to the directors of health and social care and to the Chief Medical Officer. That provides an effective way of ensuring that the public health function is properly integrated, managed and monitored.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para22"></a>However, I accept that the noble Baroness raised important issues in favour of giving recognition to the importance of public health service in the way that she suggested. I readily acknowledge that there are complex issues in terms of clarifying the range of public health services that might appropriately be brought within CHI's remit, the relationship between the bodies responsible for those services and those currently responsible for their inspection and regulation. I have already mentioned the creation of the new national agency.
<P>

<a name="20321-28_para23"></a>The view that the Government take is that there are a number of important matters which need to be worked through over the next few months. While I <P>


<a name="column_1581"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1581</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>cannot support the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, I can assure the Committee that the Government are giving serious consideration to how the issues can best be taken forward and to the extent that CHI's remit needs to be revisited in these areas. I shall keep noble Lords fully informed on those matters.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-29_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that response. Indeed, I thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Northover, Lady Finlay and Lady Masham, for their contributions to the debate. I was encouraged at the end of the Minister's comments that this was being kept under review by the Government. It might seem churlish of me to say that what I heard before that perhaps was not so encouraging as it seemed to resist the notion of an independent inspectorate reporting in the successful mode that the noble Lord described earlier today in relation to its other responsibilities. We were trying to take that success and the ability to penetrate to other real issues and to spread that across.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para0"></a>It is not right to pursue the matter today. We shall think further on it in the light of what the Minister said about the Government's future action. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para1"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para2"></a>Clauses 13 and 14 agreed to.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-29_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes </B>   moved Amendment No. 100:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>After Clause 14, insert the following new clause&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-29_para3"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "PATIENT CHOICE
<br>
 It shall be the duty of the Secretary of State in carrying out his functions under the 1977 Act to ensure that so far as it is reasonable for him to do so, persons who receive services under the 1977 Act are given a choice as to the time, manner and location of those services."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-29_para4"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment would insert a new clause after Clause 14 and would place a duty on the Secretary of State to ensure that people receiving services in the National Health Service are given a choice as to time, manner and location of those services.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para5"></a>I shall quote from a recent speech, which states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The balance of power has to shift decisively in favour of the patient ... Patients throughout the National Health Service, helped by their referring GP, will be able to make informed choices about how they are treated, when they are treated and by whom they are treated".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-29_para6"></a>
That could easily have been said by my honourable friend Dr Liam Fox, and it could also easily have been an extract from Working with Patients&#151;the White Paper which heralded the National Health Service reforms of more than a decade ago. But no, it is an extract from a speech made by the Secretary of State for Health in January this year.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para7"></a>Only a few days ago, the Department of Health issued a document entitled, Extending Choice for Patients, which deals only with the rather modest extension of choice to long waiters for heart surgery; but it is a move in the right direction and we welcome it.
<P>


<a name="column_1582"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1582</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para8"></a>Several noble Lords remarked on Second Reading and elsewhere that the Government's policies have moved on in several respects since they introduced the Bill. We think that it is unsatisfactory that when the Bill has completed its passage the National Health Service will still not have a definitive statutory framework representing current government policy. It is not satisfactory for the Government to announce a series of changes that are not reflected in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para9"></a>I am sure that the Minister is aware that we have reservations about many of the Government's policies towards the National Health Service, but we think that this issue of patient choice is one thing that the Secretary of State has started to get right. We agree with it and we want to support him in his new conversion to our ideas by seeing a positive duty to achieve patient choice in the National Health Service legislation.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para10"></a>The Secretary of State said that patient choice would be achieved within four years and I do not believe that that is inconsistent with the wording of the new clause, which refers to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"so far as it is reasonable for him to do so".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-29_para11"></a>
If the Government would prefer a more definite commencement period, I am sure that the new clause could be amended to that effect. I hope that the Government will welcome the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-29_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I warm to the habit of the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, of referring to speeches made by my right honourable friend. I am glad that she finds them so interesting.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para12"></a>The question of patient choice is extremely important. Any vision of a modern National Health Service would need to involve patient choice. The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, referred earlier to information that helps patients to make informed choices. We all agree with that, but I do not think that it would be appropriate to put the matter on a statutory basis. It is much more a question of policy to be decided by the Secretary of State. We have signalled that greater choice is very much a part of what we seek to do.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para13"></a>By 2005 all patients will be able to choose the date, time and place of their treatment. One of the must-do targets set out in the National Health Service plan is that by the end of 2005, all patients will be able to seek treatment at a time that suits them. That is a clear and public commitment. Through the additional resources that we are making available to the National Health Service for the next year, we are demonstrating our commitment by piloting patient choice from July. At that time, patients with coronary heart disease will be able to benefit from patient choice. When a patient has been on an in-patient waiting list for coronary heart disease treatment for more than six months, he or she will be offered swifter treatment in a different National Health Service hospital, or in the private sector, or in another EU country. We are looking to extend the pilots across other specialisms and in different areas. It <P>


<a name="column_1583"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1583</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is important for the patients who will benefit from that pilot, but it will also be a valuable learning experience in terms of where we need to get to by 2005.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para14"></a>As part of our proposals for patient choice, we have made it clear that patients should be able to choose where they are treated. Patients and their doctors will be able to consider a range of options. That might be at the local NHS hospital or at diagnostic and treatment centres or in the private sector or overseas. We want patients to be able to compare different waiting times in different hospitals and across different specialties. We want GPs and referring consultants to be able to book appointments online.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para15"></a>That surely is, as I have said, the vision of a modern health service. I do not think that it is appropriate to place on the statute book in primary legislation the wording that the noble Baroness has suggested. At the end of the day it falls to government Ministers in their accountability to Parliament to decide on the National Health Service. That is what we have done. I have made it clear that patient choice is a priority. I have no doubt that we shall deliver on that. But it is very much a matter for Ministers to make those decisions and in turn to be accountable to Parliament for so doing.

<P>
<A NAME="20321-29_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for those comments. I am perplexed. I had understood him to be moving in the direction of patient choice&#151;that is what he outlined to us&#151;but he said that somehow having the duty of patient choice was not appropriate. I did not hear why it was not appropriate, other than it was something to do with policy decided by the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para16"></a>The Government show a great lack of commitment to the principle of patient choice, if that is something that the Secretary of State wishes to keep to himself and to prioritise or de-prioritise from time to time. In the light of those comments, we should rightly be sceptical of the Government's apparent conversion to patient choice. I want to think about the matter further. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

 "Targets for patients

<br>
(a) no patient should wait more than 48 hours for an appointment to see a general practitioner,

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1584</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
<br>
(e) no patient should wait longer than four hours for admittance to a hospital from an accident and emergency or similar unit after a decision has been made that he should be admitted to a hospital.
<br>
(2) The Secretary of State may by order define how the targets set out in subsection (1) are to be measured.
<br>
(3) The Secretary of State may by order add to the targets set out in subsection (1) or alter those targets so that shorter times are specified.
<br>
(4) The Secretary of State may by order set targets for shorter times than set out in subsection (1) for defined categories of patients or services.
<br>
(5) An order made under subsections (3) and (4) shall not be made unless a draft of the order has been laid before, and approved by a resolution of, each House of Parliament."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-29_para19"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 101, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 102 to 104.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para20"></a>The amendments are important because they deal with patients' experience of the NHS throughout the times that they have to wait at various points in the system. The amendments focus on the areas of patient experience which the Government believe to be important, because they included them in the NHS Plan.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para21"></a>Amendment No. 101 introduces a new clause which sets up the basic framework of targets for patients. It provides that the Secretary of State has a duty to achieve some basic waiting time targets for patients; namely, not having to wait more than 48 hours to see a GP, 13 weeks for an outpatients appointment, six months for an inpatient or other treatment, more than a hour in accident and emergency before being seen or waiting more than four hours for admittance from accident and emergency.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para22"></a>Those are largely the targets which were spelt out in the NHS Plan. The plan referred to a "war on waiting". These targets in the light of our current experience of the NHS might well seem ambitious. However, if one looks to the experience of other European countries the acceptable times are much shorter than the times that we have included. So these are not perhaps very ambitious targets.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para23"></a>Regardless of whether or not the targets are ambitious, it is far from clear whether those set out in the NHS Plan will be achieved. Last year the Audit Commission reported on accident and emergency performance. It noted that waiting times had got worse since 1996.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para24"></a>Professor John Yates, recently writing in the Health Service Journal, noted that some of the waiting time data are showing some worrying trends. One of his conclusions was that the rate of sustained waiting time reductions needed to deliver the targets has never been achieved in the past, with the implication that the targets are likely to be missed.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para25"></a>Patients need to know that these minimum standards will move from aspiration to reality. That is why the proposed clause lays the responsibility on the shoulders of the Secretary of State. It allows him to introduce additional targets and set shorter targets. It is not the Government's intention, I imagine, that the targets in the plan are desirable end states.
<P>


<a name="column_1585"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1585</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para26"></a>Simply placing a duty on the Secretary of State to achieve a target says nothing about what should happen if he fails. Amendment No. 102 requires the Secretary of State to set up compensation arrangements. Patients want to be treated, not compensated for non-treatment&#151;but some form of compensation, which it is left to the Secretary of State to make by order, should concentrate the minds of service deliverers and make it clear to patients that it is their right to receive treatment within certain minimum periods.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para27"></a>The compensation scheme would take effect in 2004, except for the 13-week and six-month targets, which are given a date in 2003. I am sure that the Minister will say that those deadlines are tough compared with the 2005 of the NHS Plan but I doubt that dates alone will be the sticking point with these amendments.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para28"></a>The Secretary of State cannot be expected personally to achieve patient targets so Amendment No. 103 allows him to delegate the duties and compensation scheme to primary care trusts, NHS trusts or strategic health authorities.
<P>

<a name="20321-29_para29"></a>It is no exaggeration to say that patients have been let down by the Government who have promised much but delivered little. The amendments put patients at the heart of the Government's responsibilities to the NHS. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-30_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath: </B>   I am surprised that the noble Baroness should say that the Government have delivered little. I invite the Committee to consider the huge increase in capacity and in the number of medical training places; the 30,000 extra nurses working in the health service; the development of services such as NHS Direct; and the development of a new safety and quality culture. Much has been achieved and we are indebted to NHS staff for their hard work.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para0"></a>I share the noble Baroness's desire to see waiting time targets achieved and we are determined that they will be. That is best done by the setting of targets and effective performance management rather than by laying down limits and targets in statute law. In the NHS those matters have always been the responsibility of Ministers to determine and that will continue&#151;which is why the NHS Plan clearly sets out the maximum waiting time targets that we expect to be delivered.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para1"></a>By the end of March this year, the maximum waiting time for a first outpatient appointment will reduce from more than six months to an absolute of six months. The maximum wait for inpatient treatment will be cut from 18 months to 15 months. Maximum waiting times will continue to fall on a staged basis each year. By 2003, the maximum wait for a first outpatient appointment will be five months; by 2004, four months; and by 2005, three months.
<P>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column 1586</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para2"></a>Similarly, for inpatient treatment the maximum wait will be 12 months by 2003, nine months by 2004, and six months by 2005.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para3"></a>Subject to other NHS Plan targets for increasing capacity, the Government's eventual aim is to reduce the maximum waiting time for all stages of treatment to three months by 2008.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para4"></a>The latest figures for the end of January show that many trusts are on the way to meeting the initial targets that we set. We will continue to press the health service to do everything it can to increase its capacity and to get more doctors, more beds into use and more facilities, with increasing use of the independent sector where it can provide greater capacity. All those efforts are being made by the health service to deliver on the waiting time targets.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para5"></a>The question arises of whether it is appropriate to put a compensation scheme for patients on the face on the Bill. I do not believe that that is the appropriate way forward. It would be wholly a departure in the enactment of health service legislation. I note that when the Conservative Party developed the Patient's Charter, it never proposed that failure to meet Patient's Charter targets should be placed in a statutory framework. If it had, it would have cost an awful lot of money.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para6"></a>Meeting targets is best left to the performance management system of the health service. I am confident that the NHS will deliver on those targets. We as a Government will ensure that the NHS has the resources in terms of training places, money and facilities. I hope that on consideration the noble Baroness will agree that her amendment is not appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-30_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Noakes: </B>   I thank the Minister for that reply. He began by parading some successes of the NHS, as I would have expected. But the plain fact is that non-elective activity reduced last year and the number waiting more than 13 weeks rose by 27 per cent in the first nine months of this financial year. Things are not all moving in the direction of success.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para7"></a>The Minister again says that the amendment is not appropriate. We are told to leave things to performance management, but I put it to the Minister that that is an internal perspective, whereas the amendment would put patients at the centre by firmly rooting a duty to deliver things for them, not considering internal management processes. I feel, as I did about the previous amendment, that the Government have a lot of rhetoric about wanting to meet targets. They have a whole structure based on the plan and its implementation. But when we ask them to put a little more commitment behind that in the form of a statutory commitment, we are told that that is inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para8"></a>I am disappointed. I shall reflect further. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<H4><center>Thursday, 21st March 2002.</center></H4>
<H4><center>The Committee met at four of the clock.</center></H4>
[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Brougham and Vaux) in the Chair.]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-30_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  Perhaps I may remind Members of the Committee to speak standing and that there are no Divisions in Grand Committee. If there is a Division on the Floor of the House, we shall adjourn for 10 minutes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-30_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   Today the Government are to make a Statement in the House on hunting with dogs. It is the result of the debate on Tuesday in your Lordships' House on hunting, which culminated in more than 400 Peers voting. The large number of Peers voting indicates the importance of the debate.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para14"></a>It would seem important that all noble Lords should have an opportunity of listening to this significant Statement, which has so much bearing on this nation and those who work in the countryside. It would be crass, in my opinion, to refuse to adjourn the Grand Committee in the light of the importance of this Statement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-30_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   Although normally I would be happy to agree with a requirement to adjourn by Members of the Committee on the other side, I cannot agree that the Committee should be adjourned for a Statement on the Floor of the House on hunting.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para15"></a>The Employment Bill is a measure of considerable concern to many thousands of workers. My noble friends and I have spent a good deal of time upon it and my noble friend Lord Wedderburn in particular has worked very hard on it.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para16"></a>I therefore could not support the request for an adjournment. We need all the time available to discuss the Bill. I believe that that is also the position of my noble friends.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-30_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   That is certainly my position.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-30_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Sharman: </B>   I rise to support the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick. It seems to me that the issue does not relate to the importance of the Bill: we all agree that it is a very important Bill.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para17"></a>On Tuesday, more than 400 Peers voted on the subject to which the Statement relates. The amount of media coverage further confirms it as an important matter. I would like the opportunity to listen to that Statement. We have already had four days in <P>


<a name="column_CWH264"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH264</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Committee on the Bill and are scheduled to have more days next week. It is not a case of giving the Bill less time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-30_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I take on board what was said by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner of Camden. However, we were initially given three days in Grand Committee. We were then given an extra day and we are now being given two more. Our debate is not being guillotined in any way. In any event, I very much doubt that the two additional days we have been given next week will complete the Bill. We probably would have to have some more time after Easter.
<P>

<a name="20321-30_para18"></a>The idea that we are suggesting that we shorten debate on the Bill in order to hear something else is not correct. But that is all. As far as I am concerned, my noble friends Lord Rotherwick and Lady O'Caithan will go downstairs to listen to the Statement. I shall be sad not to, but that is a fact of life if noble Lords opposite feel unable to agree.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-30_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  We on this side regard it as a matter of principle that one should always try to accommodate people in these circumstances. However, I believe that establishing a precedent that Grand Committees are brought to a halt if Members consider that Statements or other business taking place in Parliament is of more interest to them would be a very unfortunate one to set. Therefore, we on this side would want to oppose the application.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-30_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   I understand exactly what the Minister is saying. It is not a question of establishing a precedent. The fact remains that when a Statement is made in the Chamber, the current business is suspended to allow it to be made. I understand exactly that that occurs because no other space is available, but that is the precedent: when there is a Statement, the current business is suspended so that noble Lords can hear the Statement. I believe that many Members of the Committee opposite, like many of us, did not wish to deal with the Bill in Grand Committee. We would rather have dealt with it on the Floor of the House, in which case we would have had no problem with hearing the Statement. We were pushed into that, as it were. I do not know about Members opposite, as the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, is not looking in my direction, but I suspect that, with the amount of work that he has done, he would prefer to be discussing the Bill in the Chamber. However, we have made our point; it will be reported in Hansard. I think it is most unfortunate.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   I do not wish to push this too far but the precedent has already been set. The noble Lord, Lord McIntosh, brought the proceedings to a halt at an earlier point in order to go down to the Chamber for a Statement. So this has already happened. It was convenient for the government side <P>


<a name="column_CWH265"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH265</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to bring a halt to these proceedings. However, when we wish to do similar, it is not perceived as convenient. I would just make that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-31_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  Anyone can move to adjourn the Committee but, just as an amendment, that Motion cannot be voted on and can be agreed only if totally unopposed. Some noble Lords could leave and the quorum of a Committee is three. Therefore, if three noble Lords are still here, including the Chairman, the Committee can carry on, but obviously those who leave the Committee will miss their amendments.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   Of course, the business in the Chamber has to be suspended to hear a Statement; otherwise, the Statement could not be heard. The Chamber does not have an option. However, we have an option. The fact that we accepted what I considered a rather bad precedent when we adjourned the Committee the other day does not mean to say that it should be set in stone. I believe that we should continue with the Bill. If we do so, perhaps we shall finish the Committee stage in the two days that have been allocated next week.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-31_spmin1"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  Let us see what happens when we come to it. I have explained the position and it is up to the Committee to decide what to do.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para0"></a>Schedule 2 [Statutory dispute resolution procedures]:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 124A:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 66, line 19, at end insert&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-31_para1"></a><P>
<FONT SIZE=2><center><b>"PART 4FAIRNESS</B></center><br>
14 Nothing in the provisions contained in this Schedule shall affect the operation of section 98 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (general)."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-31_para2"></a>The noble Lord said: I only say that I am sorry we see this matter differently from Members opposite but we must push on.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para3"></a>Amendment No. 124A is virtually undeniable in its wisdom because it rests upon the statement of my noble and learned friend yesterday when he said in relation to Schedule 2,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The statutory procedures seek to set out a minimum requirement that employers (in relation to dismissal) and employees (in relation to grievance) have to go through. It is not intended to affect in any way at all the principles that govern reasonableness".&#151;[Official Report, 20/03/02; col. CWH 201.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-31_para4"></a>
It may be that it is not intended to affect them, but there is a widespread doubt shared by a large number of people, including people very experienced in the law to be applied in employment tribunals, that there could be some effect upon the principles as to unfair dismissal and reasonableness which we have tried to summarise by referring to Section 98 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. I could give the Committee many examples of communications but my noble and learned friend may know that we have received a large number of communications which express this worry, let us say.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH266"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH266</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para5"></a>If my noble and learned friend is saying that everybody who has formed such a doubt is so wrong-headed that, if they pleaded such a point, it would be struck out, he takes upon himself a very high burden of proof. I repeat, if they ever mention such a point in pleadings, they will be struck out. Then, of course, there is no reason to insert a provision which, in one sense, is no more than a provision for the avoidance of doubt. If, however, he does not take that burden upon himself, if he is saying that everybody else is so wrong-headed that they would be, as it were, struck out, and if he accepts that it is possible that he may be wrong at the margins at least and that there could be a possible doubt about the matter, it is in the interests of the principles that he pressed upon us so strongly earlier in relation to Schedule 2&#151;namely, the principles of certainty and clarity and of leaving nothing to be litigated that could be avoided&#151;he should at least consider the wisdom of the amendment. It says what he said; that is, that nothing in Schedule 2 is to affect the principles of reasonableness of cases that go to a tribunal hearing.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para6"></a>Of course, we pointed out to the Minister that Schedule 2 is part of the apparatus that may stop cases getting to a tribunal hearing, but he did not like our arguments on that point and insisted that that was so. The amendment accepts what he said and it would build what he said into the Bill&#151;it does no more and no less than that. I hope that my noble and learned friend will therefore accept it. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-31_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   I rise to support my noble friend&#151;the amendment also appears in my name. It would be to the benefit of everybody, in a sense, if Section 98, which is clearly headed "Fairness" in the Employment Rights Act 1996, was restated in this Bill.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para7"></a>On a number of occasions during discussion of the Bill, we have said that there is a widespread view which repeatedly appears in the press and often from people who are normally very well informed. That widespread view is that this section and these parts of the Bill are intended to be obstacles to workers who seek to enforce their rights.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para8"></a>The Minister has informed us on a number of occasions that that is not so&#151;that that is not the Government's intention. One way of asserting that it is not would be to refer to the relevant part of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which sets out very clearly the reasons that are regarded as fair and which an employer has to show before an employee can be dismissed. Section 98 states that a reason falls within its provisions,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"if it ... relates to the capability or qualifications of the employee for performing work of the kind which he was employed by the employer to do",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-31_para9"></a>
or if it,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"relates to the conduct of the employee ... is that the employee was redundant, or ... is that the employee could not continue to work in the position which he held without contravention (either on his part or on that of his employer) of a duty or restriction imposed by or under an enactment".

<a name="column_CWH267"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH267</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
That is a very clear statement, which is headed "Fairness". Our amendment would also import the word "fairness" into the Bill. It would be a good idea if the Government were to think seriously about accepting this amendment.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_time0"></a><H5>4.15 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-31_spmin2"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions   (Lord Falconer of Thoroton): </B>  The amendment seeks to ensure that the statutory procedures have no effect on the operation of Section 98 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, as my noble friend Lord Wedderburn has said. That section sets out the general tests to be applied by a tribunal in determining whether an employee has been unfairly dismissed.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para11"></a>As has been stated on a number of occasions in the course of the passage of the Bill, the inter-relationship between the statutory procedures and unfair dismissal is covered explicitly in Clause 34. There is no need to go over the same ground in relation to the schedule. That would unnecessarily complicate the procedures and introduce inappropriate legal language into the procedures which, as I have said on a number of occasions already, the language seeks to avoid&#151;it tries to be clear.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para12"></a>The amendment is also unacceptable in another sense because it confuses the effect of Clause 34. It seems to ignore the fact that Clause 34 in fact introduces significant changes to unfair dismissal law relating to the statutory procedures that favour the employee. In particular, the clause makes it automatically unfair for an employer to dismiss an employee if the relevant statutory procedure has not been followed. It is an important change, as has been acknowledged. It is brought about by introducing new Section 98A into the Employment Rights Act 1996. The proposed new section in the amendment makes a cross-reference to existing Section 98, but ignores new Section 98A altogether.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para13"></a>The amendment is unnecessary because, in direct response to the point made by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, the statute is sufficiently clear to deal with all the points that he made. It would make it more difficult to understand the schedule and it would make the law more complicated, as would many of the amendments that have been suggested by my noble friend. It would create confusion about the effects of Clause 34 and it could possibly undermine the additional protections given to employees by new Section 98A.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para14"></a>I hope that in the light of my remarks, the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   I intervene to make it clear that the amendment does not appear with my name is because they did not put it on. It is not that I do not agree with it in any way.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para15"></a>I turn to the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, on a very modest little amendment. That amendment sought to put on to the face of the Bill that there should be an <P>


<a name="column_CWH268"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH268</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>investigation to establish the facts. We were, therefore, gratified when the Minister of State, though turning down our amendment, made this very generous statement:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The statutory procedures seek to set out a minimum requirement that employers (in relation to dismissal) and employees (in relation to grievance) have to go through. It is not intended to affect in any way at all the principles that govern reasonableness. As I made clear on Monday afternoon, if there is not an investigation, in virtually every case, the test would make the business unfair".&#151;[Official Report, 20/3/02; col. CWH 201.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-31_para16"></a>
However, his generous statement was in fact a more profound and more general statement.
<P>

<a name="20321-31_para17"></a>Our amendment seeks this time to build on what the Minister has actually said. I do not believe that anyone would find it confusing; they would learn from it what they might not be certain of if they simply read the Bill; that is, that you could not use the minimum procedure in order to get round the way that the criteria between fairness and unfairness and reasonableness, and so on, had been built up on the basis of the other Employment Rights Act and the decisions of tribunals. I do not see any way that anybody would be confused if the very words of the Minister were in effect included as the basis of this statement.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am sorry that my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton will not accept even the spirit of the amendment, although most of his objections were based on its form. As for it being legalistic and therefore not appropriate to Schedule 2, I will make a plea to my noble and learned friend. I plead with him not use this word "legalistic" because nobody is sure what it means. It is rather like "gross negligence", which is negligence with the addition of a vituperative epithet. "Legalistic" is "legal" with a few letters at the end to make it sound nasty.
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para0"></a>There is much that is legal in Schedule 2. It refers to the test of conduct, characteristic or other circumstances in regard to what is to be alleged in regard to an employee's misconduct or breach of his obligations. That statement is taken straight out of Section 98 and will be interpreted by a court or tribunal quite properly by reference to the legal source from which it comes.
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para1"></a>Similarly, almost every other phrase in Schedule 2 is couched quite properly in legal language, and so we drew up our amendment in proper legal language. Quite why the Minister thinks that it refers to Section 98A, or has somehow omitted to notice Section 98A which is introduced by Clause 34, I cannot for the life of me understand. It has nothing to do with Section 98A; it says it is to do with Section 98. I thought the Minister was going to criticise the amendment because it should have been moved in relation to Clause 29 and not to Schedule 2. That is a defect in the amendment and on Report we shall no doubt cure it by tabling a similar amendment to Clause 29, if, after reflection, we conclude that we should do so. In the meantime, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="20321-32_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 126, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 127. The amendments take us into Clause 30, which, as Members of the Committee well know, provides the mechanism for placing the statutory procedures of Schedule 2 into the individual contracts. The clause begins in a nice, unambiguous way by saying that they shall have effect notwithstanding existing agreements to the contrary. That is then reversed&#151;I believe that in drafting terms it is a little cumbrous&#151;by allowing the continuation of agreements,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not inconsistent with, the requirements of the statutory procedure".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

Therefore, the statutory procedure has effect irrespective of what anybody has. However, that is not really the case because if something is not inconsistent with the statutory procedures, that is all right.

<a name="20321-32_para8"></a>We consider the word "inconsistent" to be rather ambiguous. In what way would the requirement be inconsistent? We prefer to make it clear that we want the requirement to be consistent only in one way; that is, not more painful to employees. In other words, we want an agreement which is more favourable to employees. We want an improvement in the dispute procedure. That is difficult to imagine, although I suppose that it is just possible to imagine many existing procedures which are less favourable than the statutory procedures as most will be rather better and certainly more comprehensive. We are saying "Well, they can stand; if they are not less favourable, they can stand". In other words, we are saying that there is an inconsistency, conflict or ambiguity which would make us prefer the word "favourable" to "inconsistent".
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para9"></a>Obviously if one says that&#151;it is not the only example but the most obvious example of what one means&#151;one is referring to any procedure based upon the ACAS code. Although we have done so before, it is worth again trying to bring to the attention of the Government and the Committee the differences between the existing ACAS code&#151;many codes and procedures are better than the ACAS code&#151;and the statutory procedures.
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para10"></a>As I believe I have said before, the key to the ACAS code is a paragraph, which is not very long, setting out the 11 essential features of dispute procedures. I calculate that approximately five of those are not in the statutory procedure. Therefore, we have to ask ourselves whether they are inconsistent with the statutory procedure. Might it be argued that that is the case?
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para11"></a>The first is in many ways the most important. If I were allowed to put one thing into the statutory procedures I might consider this one. However, my colleagues might not agree, and I do not believe that <P>


<a name="column_CWH270"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH270</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the Government would consider it for a moment. It would be the specification and limitation on the management's right to decide discipline; that is, the principle that not everybody can sack. Not everyone in a company or organisation can be allowed to sack people. There must be a specification so that we know who has the right to dismiss. There is nothing about that in the statutory procedure but it is, of course, in the ACAS procedure.
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para12"></a>Secondly, and almost as important, is the principle which is observed in most procedures that I know of; that is, the relevance of the past record of the individual worker. One asks questions about the employee such as: is this the first thing that he did; does he have nine years of exemplary conduct; is this the first offence to come to light; and, if it is, has he received an informal, formal or final warning? If it is the final warning and if the worker commits the offence persistently, then dismissal may well be the appropriate penalty. One will not find any reference to the past record of conduct. Anyone who takes the procedure seriously and says, "That's all they're getting out of me" will say that anybody can sack on the first offence. Certainly, there is nothing in the Act that suggests that that involves rather bad industrial relations. I will not go into the utility of the suspension alternative, which we have debated. Most decent procedures do something about suspension. We have tried to add to the Bill the need for investigation, examination, explanation but nobody has considered that.
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para13"></a>I turn to the special case of gross dismissal. One of the most novel things that the Government have done is to say that where there is gross misconduct justifying dismissal, there needs to be a shortened and simplified procedure. We have asked them to justify that but they have never really done so. I do not know of a precedent. The most complicated, difficult and ambiguous set of circumstances are involved. My noble friend does not even like the phrase, "gross misconduct" but it is used in industry. Most people who use it appreciate that if they are going to sack somebody on the basis of gross misconduct, they had better investigate, take their time, look at the case in an independent way, maybe bring some third party in and use suspension. There is nothing whatever in the stated procedure&#151;the statutory procedure.
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para14"></a>It is worth saying, at the risk of delaying the Committee, that behind all this&#151;behind the differences between the ACAS procedure and many other procedures and the statutory procedure&#151;is nothing less than the philosophy of the treatment of workers. It is not an accident that the idea of a statutory procedure&#151;the essential elements of the statutory procedure&#151;comes from the employers. Discipline is seen as something that can be done by anybody. Discipline does not have to be consistent; it does not have to be based on your past record; and it does not have to be placed on anything else but an exercise of managerial prerogatives. That is the philosophy. The alternative is that discipline could be consistent, that it should fit itself to the individual and that as far as possible it should be remedial and <P>


<a name="column_CWH271"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH271</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>constructive. This is the philosophy of personnel management, not the philosophy of managerial prerogatives.
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para15"></a>We say, therefore, that the approach is not an accident. If the Government are not to line themselves up completely behind the philosophy that regards discipline as something that only management is entitled to do and does not have to justify the use of&#151;if you want to get discipline justified you have to go to a tribunal, because that is the only way you can get it justified&#151;we say that they ought to be prepared to make this significant but small change to Clause 30.

<P>
<A NAME="20321-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   These amendments seek to ensure that any agreed procedures must always be at least as "favourable" to the employee as the statutory procedures. Thus, the contractual or voluntary procedures can be entirely different, provided that they are at least as favourable. The existing wording of the subsection ensures that the contractual procedures must be "not inconsistent" with the statutory procedures. Both formulations are plainly seeking to achieve a similar objective, so this is purely a drafting issue. I believe that the existing wording is to be preferred. I recognise that the intention behind the amendments is to allow employers and employees a greater degree of flexibility in their choice of contractually binding procedures. However, there are problems with the amendments. Deciding whether a procedure operating in a significantly different way from a statutory procedure was or was not as favourable would be a difficult and largely subjective exercise. It would also be difficult to predict the outcome. These amendments introduce a lack of clarity and I believe they can only be undesirable here, if what one is after is clarity. Our test is significantly less subjective and ensures that the contractual procedures must be consistent with the statutory procedures, while allowing the flexibility for the procedures to contain more stages or set out more detailed requirements. I admit this test too involves an element of judgment but I believe that in practice it would be easier to apply. In the light of what I have said, I hope that my noble friend will feel able to withdraw his amendment.

<A NAME="20321-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am interested in that comment by my noble and learned friend. It seems to me that he is in two difficulties. He says that judging whether something is not less favourable to an employee is far too uncertain, it lacks clarity and is subjective. My noble friend touched on one of the two answers to that; namely, that it is also a matter of judgment whether something is inconsistent with something else; it is not necessarily obvious. Of course, there is a judgment to be formed on both applications.
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para17"></a>However, that which is not less favourable to the employee than a particular term or condition of employment has appeared in our employment law on <P>


<a name="column_CWH272"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH272</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>previous occasions. I do not know what precedent my noble and learned friend wishes to cite to show that it was so hopelessly uncertain and lacking in clarity that it could not be applied. It is applied time and again. In Section 185 of the consolidation Act 1992 we come across terms and conditions of employment in an award which must not be ousted by subsequent terms and conditions other than if they are an improvement upon those terms and conditions. That formula is not very different from terms and conditions that are not less favourable. There is nothing in the argument that Amendment No. 127 is so uncertain that it could not be applied.
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para18"></a>My noble and learned friend even appears to accept the argument that the procedures put forward and operated in a place of work by an employer could possibly be less than the statutory procedures in Schedule 2. Perhaps he will give me an example of a procedure less than the modified procedures, for example, which he believes would be a fair procedure for an employer to operate. My noble and learned friend indicates that he did not say that.
<P>

<a name="20321-32_para19"></a>If the employer should not introduce procedures which are worse&#151;I use the word "worse" generally&#151;than Schedule 2, then there is nothing wrong with the formula which states that they should be not less favourable to the employee. They should be as good for the worker as the Schedule 2 procedures, which are, heaven knows, bad enough, especially in the modified procedures, and they must not be worse than the dreadfully unfair procedures that the Government are implying into every contract of employment. That is the sense of Amendment No. 127. I hope that it will be printed in Hansard that instead of the words "not inconsistent with" there should be the words "which is not less favourable to the employee". Nothing could be more just and reasonable than that.

<A NAME="20321-33_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   I want to raise one point with the Minister. He intervened during my noble friend's comments and said, if I have this right, that he believed that there could be procedures which could not be worse. He was then asked to give an example and he said he did not say that. Hansard will tell us what he said.
<P>

<a name="20321-33_para0"></a>However, I believe that the real question is whether the Minister can cite a procedure which would be inconsistent with the statutory procedures. I cannot think of one. If he cannot think of a procedure which is inconsistent, then the phrase means nothing.

Most people would accept&#151;I think the Minister would accept this&#151;for example, that to have different stages in a procedure is a significant change and that to have specification of the use of a suspension is an additional change.

<br>
(b) the relevant statutory procedures as explained to him in writing by his employer where that explanation describes steps more beneficial to, or less onerous upon, the employee."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-33_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: I beg to move Amendment No. 128 which is on a rather similar point. Clause 30, which we are now discussing, says in subsection (1) that:
<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-33_para6"></a>
If obligations are imposed upon an employee, the employee should really be informed about them. One of the reasons for the amendment is that we want the employer to explain in writing to the employee&#151;I stress the words "in writing"&#151;
<P>
<br>

In other words, we accept that there are many instances&#151;and people have written to me about this&#151;where existing procedures are actually better and more beneficial to an employee. A number of people have written to say that they have read about the new Bill but that they are rather better off as they are.

<a name="20321-33_para10"></a>The object of the amendment is to make sure that an employee shall be told of his obligations as regards the relevant procedure and also as regards any procedures that have been freely negotiated and accepted by both sides in the particular enterprise concerned.
<P>

<a name="20321-33_para11"></a>I hope the Government will agree that this is quite obviously a necessary amendment. If people are going to accept obligations, they must know what those obligations are and they must have those obligations in writing. It seems to me it would be entirely legitimate for the Bill to require the employer to explain that matter to the employee. I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept the amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="20321-33_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   Before the Minister responds, may I say that I do not think this is a sensible amendment; in fact, I totally oppose it? This would put a huge burden on small businesses. There are many small businesses employing people&#151;in fact, most businesses are small businesses. I read very carefully what the amendment says. It says that the employer will explain in writing the effect of this matter. However, there will be many cases where the employer himself may not understand it very well. There used to be a concept that everybody understood what the law meant, or was presumed to know what the law meant.
<P>

<a name="20321-33_para12"></a>If this measure is absolutely necessary, then I am sure ACAS must have a budget to deal with it. Posters or leaflets could be placed in employment offices and so on. However, it is absolutely ludicrous to say that the burden should fall upon the employer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-33_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I am on the side of my noble friend Lady Turner in this. My only problem in relation to the amendment is that it is unnecessary because the obligation already exists.
<P>

<a name="20321-33_para13"></a>The noble Baroness's Amendment No. 128 seeks to impose a requirement on employers to inform employees about the existence of the statutory procedures or of their contractual procedures where they are
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"more beneficial to, or less onerous upon, the employee".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-33_para14"></a>
Put aside the fact that we might have a complaint about the uncertainty of the last bit of that phrase, as occurred with Amendment No. 127. As I say, the principle is right but the measure is unnecessary. Under Section 3 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, employers must include details of their disciplinary and grievance procedures, where they are operated, in the "note" included in the statement of employment particulars. Clause 36 of this Bill removes the existing small firms exemption in Section 3&#151;so it will apply to employers of all sizes.
<P>

<a name="20321-33_para15"></a>Clause 30 ensures that the statutory procedures will be incorporated into contracts as an implied term where employers do not already operate more elaborate procedures. This means that all employers and all employees will henceforward have disciplinary and grievance procedures. By the same token, employers will therefore be required to inform all employees about these procedures in the note in the written statement. We have thereby ensured that employees will be made aware of the application of the <P>


<a name="column_CWH275"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH275</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>statutory procedures. In the light of that explanation, which I hope my noble friend will agree exactly delivers the purpose of the amendment, I hope that she might feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-33_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I wonder whether my noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton would pause for a moment on Section 3 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 on which he relies. Section 3(1)(a) says that the employer shall include in what he gives the employee a note,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"specifying any disciplinary rules applicable to the employee"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-33_para16"></a>
that was the bit that I understood my noble and learned friend to rely upon&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"or referring the employee to the provisions of a document specifying such rules which is reasonably accessible to the employee".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-33_para17"></a>
So the employer does not actually have to set out the disciplinary rules. His note can say, "You are governed by Schedule 2 of the Employment Act 2002". In fact, many notes do refer to other documents. For example, they refer to works' rules and very frequently they refer to procedures which are in other documents.
<P>

<a name="20321-33_para18"></a>I hesitate to complicate my noble and learned friend's notes but this matter relates also to Amendment No. 192. I wonder whether he will be resisting our Amendment No. 192 because that says that the employer must set out an explanation of the relevant statutory procedures. If my noble and learned friend does not want to comment on it now, we will come to it, but it links up.
<P>

<a name="20321-33_para19"></a>As the Minister said before, this is a very important introduction, a novel legal introduction, into the contract of employment and into the employment relationship. We wonder whether it is sufficient that the employer should be allowed simply to refer to the provisions of the 2002 Act which is reasonably accessible to the employee. He does not want to be what he calls "legal" or "legalistic", but the employee has to go off and read the Act, and look at Schedule 2 if that is what the note says.
<P>

<a name="20321-33_para20"></a>I do not think that is sufficient. It is certainly not true to say that what we say in this amendment is the equivalent of Section 3. We have very carefully not adopted the option of Section 3 of just referring to any other document that the employee then has to go off and read.
<P>

<a name="20321-33_para21"></a>I am sure that my noble and learned friend will agree that this amendment is not the same as Section 3, and perhaps would at any rate give it a little further consideration.

<A NAME="20321-34_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Let me respond. The effect of Section 3 is as my noble friend read it. It means one has to give a note or refer to a document which is reasonably accessible to the employee.
<P>

<a name="20321-34_para0"></a>The purpose of Section 3 of the other Act is plainly intended to ensure that the employee has a note or reasonable access to the description of the procedure, which is the purpose I believe my noble friend Lady Turner of Camden had in her amendment.

<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 "TERMINATION OF CONTRACT AND NON-COMPLETION OF STATUTORY PROCEDURES
<br>
 Where a dismissal falls within section 97(1)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 (c. 18) (effective date of termination; termination without notice), the effective date of termination shall not take effect before any applicable statutory procedure has been completed."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-34_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: Amendment No. 130 raises a point which I think has not been addressed in the debates on the Bill so far. A large number of legal consequences and consequences in life are dependent upon what is the moment at which a contract of employment terminates.
<P>

<a name="20321-34_para7"></a>The amendment seeks to address a problem which is consequent upon the insertion into the contract of employment, as statutorily implied terms, of the procedures in Schedule 2. Indeed, Government spokesmen have made much of the fact that both sides to the employment contract will now have the advantages. That is as they see it because they do not accept any of the comments on Schedule 2 that its procedures are unfair in various ways. They see the Bill as providing the advantage&#151;and they are right if it solves a single dispute at the work place level, but at what cost?&#151;of having these procedures as the implied obligations of the contract on both sides. The employer must operate his disciplinary procedures in accordance with Schedule 2. The employee must operate the grievance procedures in Schedule 2. They become an inherent part of the employment relationship based on the contract.
<P>

<a name="20321-34_para8"></a>If that is so, normal principle would suggest that the employment contract should be worked through before anyone can arbitrarily bring it to an end. It will be most inconsistent&#151;to use the Minister's word on the previous amendment&#151;to suggest that the employer and employee cannot oust the procedures by <P>


<a name="column_CWH277"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH277</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>agreement while allowing the employer to oust the procedures before the employee has had the benefit of them in terms of his own dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20321-34_para9"></a>On that basis, one could have moved an amendment to suggest that no dismissal should actually reach the effective date of termination&#151;that is in the legal sense&#151;until the procedures have been exhausted. If these are so beneficial at the place of work as the Government seem to think, we really ought to have them worked through, not just before anyone goes to a tribunal but before the employment relationship is shattered.
<P>

<a name="20321-34_para10"></a>In fact, our amendment does not go as far as that. Our amendment concentrates on those parts of the dismissal scenario which fall within Section 97(1)(b) of the Employment Rights Act 1996. When a dismissal is terminated on notice, the effective date of termination is normally the date on which the notice expires. However, under Section 97(1)(b) dealing with summary dismissals, the normal view&#151;and I say "normal view" because there is a doubt here&#151;is that the employer can rupture the employment relationship at the moment of a summary dismissal. I am sorry to detain Members of Committee about that point but there are a number present who will not appreciate what the doubt is.
<P>

<a name="20321-34_para11"></a>The doubt is that under the old law of master and servant, the summary dismissal of an employee, or the summary dismissal of a servant, took effect there and then. There has, however, eventuated a development of contract law that the termination of a contract does not come about in face of a breach on the other side, except it be accepted or elected to accept by the other party.
<P>

<a name="20321-34_para12"></a>There is a whole string of cases on that to which I wish to refer. The most convenient way to refer to them would be to cite a passage in the recent case of Cerberus Software Ltd v Rowley. In spelling it out, Members of the Committee will remember that I try to help Hansard as we do not have a shorthand writer. The case verges on the sticks of legal principle. Lord Justice Sedley in the Court of Appeal ([2001] IRLR 165)&#151;it is not in the Library but I have managed to obtain a copy and I am sure the Minister does not have it&#151;said this:

There is in consequence a longstanding and formally unresolved debate as to whether the contract of employment should be regarded as a legal exception to the general rule.

In Rigby v Ferodo Ltd [1987] IRLR 516, the House of Lords declined to decide the matter, in a case not directly concerned with dismissal but with a cut in wages imposed, in breach of contract, by the employer. However, Lord Oliver said: 'I entirely fail to see how the continuance of the primary contractual obligation can be made to depend on the subjective desire of the contract-breaker and I do not understand what is meant by the injured party having no alternative but to accept the breach . . . I can see no reason in law or in logic why, leaving aside for the moment the extreme case of outright dismissal or [on the other side] walk-out, a contract of employment should be on any different footing from any other contract. . .'

Lord Justice Sedley goes on to say:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Despite this, the application of the elective theory continues to be controversial, and it is unfortunate that the House of Lords did not choose to clarify the law when it could arguably have done so in Rigby v Ferodo Ltd. More recently, in Boyo v Lambeth London Borough Council [1995] IRLR 50, a unanimous Court of Appeal took the opportunity to cast fresh doubt on the elective theory, while at the same time feeling bound to apply the majority ruling in the earlier judgment of the Court of Appeal, Gunton v Richmond-upon-Thames London Borough Council. Gunton, according to the Court in Boyo, had produced law distinctly lacking in rhyme and reason, and was not to be preferred, in principle, to the judgment of Sir John Donaldson P, the president in Sanders v Ernest A Neal [1974] IRLR 236 laying out the case for the automatic theory. Given such dicta, the future of the elective theory can hardly be regarded as assured".

<a name="20321-34_para16"></a><P>

<a name="20321-34_para17"></a>It is important to understand the present position which that represents, because it is a mess. Therefore, in pursuit of the principles which the noble and learned Lord has put before us&#151;namely, of pursuing certainty and clarity&#151;that uncertainty, which will give rise to new litigation and even greater litigation under Schedule 2 even than the present position, really should be cured. It should be cured in favour of the principle that is put into legislation. Indeed, it is the Government's choice to put these procedures in Schedule 2 into the contract of employment by law. That is curious because they could have done so by regulation. They did not have to mention the contract of employment and it would have been a simpler Bill if they had not done so.
<P>

<a name="20321-34_para18"></a>They may well have been right to do so because today statute is implying more terms into contracts and, if they take Schedule 2 so seriously&#151;overlooking its unfairness&#151;I can understand why they did it. However, if they do so, they should recognise the fact that these procedures should be completed before at least a summary dismissal&#151;possibly any dismissal but our amendment says "a summary dismissal"&#151;is effective and before its effective date of termination is in law expressed in the simple fact. What is the simple fact? The simple fact is that the worker is losing his job. <P>

I beg to move.

I will therefore, with the agreement of Members of the Committee, read back into the record the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Brougham and Vaux, regarding the procedural position: "Anyone can move to adjourn the Committee but, just as an amendment, that Motion cannot be voted on and can be agreed only if totally unopposed".
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para1"></a>The Committee may now continue discussion on Amendment No. 130.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Is it working now?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-35_spmin3"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</B>  I am advised that the answer to the noble Lord's question is yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   This amendment seeks to provide that where an employee is dismissed without notice, the "effective date of termination" shall not take effect until the applicable statutory procedure has been completed. The effective date of termination is used in a number of places in the unfair dismissal provisions of the Employment Rights Act 1996 and determines, for example, whether the employee has sufficient continuous employment to claim unfair dismissal and the date from which the time limit for making a claim runs. It is an important date.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para2"></a>We have already discussed gross misconduct in relation to the amendments tabled to Schedule 2 and how the procedures will apply in such cases. Where the full procedure is used, employers should not in any event dismiss until the meeting required by step 2 has taken place.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para3"></a>The amendment in practice is presumably aimed at the case where we intend that the modified procedure should apply; that is, where the employer dismisses more or less instantly, probably for what he believes to <P>


<a name="column_CWH280"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH280</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>be gross misconduct, without giving notice. It would artificially divorce the "effective date of termination" in such cases from the time when the dismissal really takes place. It will not have the result that the dismissal is made unfair if it would otherwise be fair. However, it would, if I understand it correctly, benefit some employees at the margins by securing that they have the necessary continuous employment to claim unfair dismissal when they would not otherwise do so. I have to say that the uncertainty generated by this amendment seems a high price to pay for that small benefit to a marginal number of employees.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para4"></a>However, the thrust of the argument of my noble friend Lord Wedderburn is that there is uncertainty of a legal sort. He read to us an extract from the Cerberus case, which indicates that there is a doubt in the law about whether one needs to accept a repudiatory breach of a contract of employment by an employer, where one is an employee, to bring the contract to an end. That uncertainty in law, he says, means that you should bring clarity to the issue by specifying that the effective date of termination should be once the statutory procedure is completed.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para5"></a>In effect, that would separate the legal date of the termination of a contract from the effective date of termination in the law which, in itself, would bring additional uncertainties. Where one is dealing with summary or instant dismissal, in practice there is very rarely a difficulty about when the contract came to an end. I therefore do not think that the uncertainty which my noble friend identifies is as bad in practice as to justify what would be a quite significant change in the law. If the intention is to prevent dismissal without notice, the amendment does not succeed in that aim in any event.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para6"></a>On the basis, however, that it does succeed, I can only say that we have no intention of going beyond what is in the procedures and providing that the effective date of termination will be delayed until the procedure has been completed or of preventing all dismissals without notice. Our intention is not to prevent summary dismissals but to ensure that, where a dismissal takes place, suitable internal procedures are followed. In our view, different procedures are suitable where a dismissal is instant.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para7"></a>So far as the drafting of the amendment is concerned, as I read it, it says there is no effective date of termination before any applicable statutory procedure has been completed. This would mean that the employer could prevent there ever being an effective date of termination, thereby preventing the employee ever getting to an industrial tribunal, which cannot be the intention of my noble friend.

<A NAME="20321-35_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I was struck by my noble and learned friend's first description of the effects of the amendment; namely, that it affects matters such as continuous employment. He said that its effect would bring a small benefit to a marginal number of workers. What an unthinkable <P>


<a name="column_CWH281"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH281</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>consequence! If that is so&#151;I adopt for the moment the hypothesis that his description is correct&#151;I am not ashamed to move such an amendment.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para8"></a>As my noble and learned friend explained, there are workers whose jobs are being destroyed by summary dismissal. He did not even bother to say it had to be lawful summary dismissal because, of course, the old master and servant rule treats summary dismissal as the end of the job. If that is his understanding of the law, despite the uncertainty in the case law&#151;if the Government are suggesting to us and advising us that the rule is in summary dismissal as it was in the old master and servant cases and as it was repeated in Sanders v Neale&#151;we have to listen very seriously to that.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para9"></a>It is no surprise in the light of that advice that the amendment would bring a small benefit to a marginal number of workers. If I were to exercise judgment on the proposition of the noble and learned Lord, I would think that perhaps the number would be more than marginal and there could be cases where the benefit was more than small. As for the idea that the amendment would stop a case from getting to employment tribunal, I think, with great respect, that that is quite fanciful because, where the job has purportedly been destroyed by an employer who will not go through the procedure, the employee could sue in the county court, quite apart from the tribunal and recover his wages until the end&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-35_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Is my noble friend saying that that would destroy the unfair dismissal claim?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-35_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I do not believe that it would destroy the unfair dismissal claim, but I do not want to prolong the argument on that. I am saying that the employer would still have a remedy and he would be advised he had a remedy&#151;if my noble and learned friend were to advise him, his advice would be that he had a remedy. It is playing about with things to suggest that that is an objection to the amendment. It really will not do to tell me that that would improve the position of workers on their continuity of employment, which is absolutely fundamental to their position at work, that it would preserve their job because the effective termination would be postponed and that these very important procedures would have that great protective effect, whether a marginal number or a large number is involved, but that it cannot be made clear in the Bill that it will have that effect. "We will imply it in your contract", say the Government or the CBI or whoever it was who first thought up this dreadful schedule and this dreadful Bill in this particular part. "We shall put it in your contract, but don't think you can come along to us and make it clear on the face of the Bill that the small benefit that it might bring you will really get to you. You're just a marginal number of workers".
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para10"></a>The philosophy of the Bill, which has been promoted under the guise of helping industrial relations, is in fact going to help neither that marginal number of workers nor&#151;I tell the Government about this sincerely&#151; will it help industrial relations because <P>


<a name="column_CWH282"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH282</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people will rumble it. Someone who is summarily dismissed is going to say, "Well what about this procedure? Why should I be thrown out on the street and thrown to the social security office, where the employer is going to inform the social security authorities that I was dismissed for misconduct, which I deny? It's no good that. I shall have benefits withdrawn from me if I'm dismissed for misconduct. What about this procedure?" "Oh no", say the Government, "Your date of termination of your employment must be immediate. We can't wait for our procedures. That might bring you a small benefit". If that is not the reason, what other reason is there? It is not that the employee cannot get to a tribunal. Here we have the Government saying, "This amendment is preposterous because it will stop a tribunal claim". They were out to stop 40,000 tribunal claims; that is the object of the Bill. My noble and learned friend shakes his head, but if he looks at the Government's response to consultation, he will see that it is stated four times that the effect of the Bill will be&#151;with a time lag possibly of one year&#151;the reduction of employment tribunal cases by 30,000 to 40,000. They also set out the millions of pounds that will be saved. He really cannot shake his head when I mention this inconvenient fact.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para11"></a>This is a most serious step by the Government. Workers will blame their employers unless their unions bring to their minds the effect of a misconduct, summary dismissal, without necessary investigation. We are not now into the question of whether the tribunal finds it unfair. We are dealing with the procedure and the procedure can take place without investigation. Sometimes my noble friends and I forget that we must remind people what happened yesterday. Yesterday it was made absolutely clear that the Government would not insert into the modified procedure the principle of prior investigation. They refused and, therefore, the employer can dismiss summarily for misconduct without investigation. He need not&#151;indeed, no one need&#151;complete or initiate the procedures because they are no good to the employee; his job is finished and he is out on the street.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para12"></a>I doubt that my noble and learned friend was smiling at what I said, but something amused him. I am not amused, and I do not believe that my noble friends&#151;both those who put their name to the amendment and those who did not&#151;will be amused either. This is a most serious matter. At present the law is obscure, although the Government have expressed the view, through my noble and learned friend, that the principle of Sanders v Ernest A Neale Ltd applies and that Lord Justice Sedley is wrong in saying that the position is obscure and uncertain.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para13"></a>That is a most important statement which no doubt we shall have to consider. It will no doubt be cited in relevant cases as the Government's intention behind the Bill on this matter. First, they want Sanders v Ernest A Neale Ltd to apply; secondly, they do not want to agree to an amendment which would cure the uncertainty; and, thirdly, they do not want to cure the uncertainty in a manner which they fully admit would bring a small benefit to workers.

<a name="20321-35_para14"></a>I do not understand why Ministers cannot simply say to us, "We shall take it away and look at it". Were it not my own Government, I would say that it was arrogant. On many occasions in the 1980s I said that propositions that were put to us were arrogant. When Ministers rejected the existence of some causes of action which were in all the books, I said that that was arrogant.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para15"></a>On this occasion, were it not my own Government, I believe I should have to say that it was arrogant to say, "Yes, it is an uncertainty, but we are curing it because Sanders v Ernest A Neale Ltd applies. If you had your way, you would cure the uncertainty which perhaps you say exists, and it would bring a small benefit to workers". No other reason has been given for not at least dealing with the obscurities of when the effective date of termination of contracts of employment and dismissals arises.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para16"></a>No doubt the Court of Appeal will one day be presented with this record. I am grateful to the Deputy Chairman of Committees for making it clear that the recording machine has not broken down again. This record will show just how clearly the Government are committed to every single line of the Bill. It is not only cast in stone; it will be a millstone around their necks unless they go away and reconsider the matter. It will be a gravestone to industrial relations in some areas because workers will know that the Government could not give them a small benefit and, as a result, they are marginalised and out on the street.
<P>

<a name="20321-35_para17"></a>I can do nothing except beg leave to withdraw the amendment. However, I hope that the Government will consider the matter on Report, and I hope that at that stage we shall be able to present them with a more acceptable amendment. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

The recording equipment was also not working when she made her request, as I understand it, at the beginning of this afternoon. On consideration and after consultation, it would seem fair and reasonable&#151;I hope that the Committee will agree&#151;that the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Hendon, should be allowed to repeat the request that she made but restrict herself only to repeating that request without discussion thereon.

As it was, we were made to come here. I understand perfectly well that this Grand Committee will always adjourn when there is a vote&#151;we recently did so. I am sorry that I was not back in time to hear what the Deputy Chairman of Committees said. I also understood that if there was anything of a serious nature, that would be taken into account. I believe that a Statement of this kind, with so many having voted on Tuesday, is a serious matter.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para1"></a>I want to make another point. My noble friend commented on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, who said that there is no such precedent. When the Minister&#151;and indeed the noble Lord, Lord Razzall&#151;had to participate in a Statement, we adjourned without any problems for a while in order for them to do that.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para2"></a>I turn to the comments yesterday of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, about the fact that we do not have a shorthand writer here. We pointed out the difficulties of that. We are in a difficult position. I shall sit down soon&#151;I understand the wish of the Deputy Chairman of Committees not to have any further discussion&#151;but Members opposite will know what they said. I think that they were concerned not to waste time because so many of them had taken a lot of trouble with this Bill. I would not like anyone to think that we criticise anyone for the time taken. However long anything has taken, that is how long it has taken, and we have sat here. Fine; that is what democracy is. I say to them, "You are entitled to do work and go through your amendments in whatever way you wish". We appreciate that. The time spent attending the Statement would not have been time lost to the Committee because we still would have gone through everything.

 "NON-BREACH OF CONTRACT

"238B NON-BREACH OF CONTRACT

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-36_para6"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is grouped with Amendments Nos. 262A and 264, in the name of my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall. All three amendments are about the problem of the dismissal of those who take part in strike action. My noble friend, I think, agrees that it would be quicker for the Committee to understand the meaning and thrust of the amendments if Amendment No. 262A were moved first, with the leave of the Deputy Chairman of Committees. I would then move Amendment No. 131, which will make it absolutely clear how and why we are doing this. With the leave of the Deputy Chairman of Committees, I ask that that amendment, which is grouped with Amendment No. 131, be moved first. I will then move&#151;or, at least, speak to&#151;Amendment No. 131 and explain how it is different.

<P>

<a name="20321-36_para7"></a>Both of these amendments&#151;all three amendments in the group&#151;concern a problem which, some people suggest, is a problem of the past and not of the present. However, events of the past two years&#151;indeed, in view of the situation in Wales, events of the past two weeks&#151;have shown that this is a matter with which there is considerable concern. It involves workers being dismissed from their jobs by reason of taking part in industrial action, even where that industrial action is protected on the part of the liability of the trade union by reason of there having been a ballot, proper notice and other procedures under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. It is important, especially because we are coming at the matter this way round, that I speak to the amendment carefully and make it clear why I have put it on the Marshalled List and why it comes about now in addition to the amendments of my noble friend Lord Lea. I have found by experience over many decades that making the sort of proposal that is in both amendments leads to misunderstanding&#151;it frequently leads to misrepresentation&#151;particularly because of the insular debate that takes place in the United Kingdom, although the matter would not raise an <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>eyebrow across the Channel in most jurisdictions&#151;indeed, in all jurisdictions&#151;of Western Europe. Let me explain.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para8"></a>When a worker takes part in collective industrial action, in the eye of a large number of international standards, which I shall cite in a moment, and of every civilised national jurisdiction of law except the United Kingdom, the person does not break his contract of employment. The reason for that is that a right to take part in collective action is regarded internationally and in most national systems as a basic human right. That is a human right that is effective collectively but which inheres in the individual worker. It is a human right that has been recognised at the international level but never in the United Kingdom. The reason it is not recognised in the United Kingdom is that since 1906 our law has proceeded upon the basis that it is adequate to promote the protection of those who organise strike action or those who induce strike action&#151;that provision was inserted into the Act of 1906 by that great Liberal statesman Sir Charles Dilke.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para9"></a>The difference, of course, between protecting the inducement or organisation for strike action and the action itself in the worker is that, if the trade union or the organisers are protected in a trade dispute as in the United Kingdom, the worker is not; it remains a breach of his contract of employment. In a trade dispute in an action in tort, if all the conditions are satisfied&#151;they are many and complicated today&#151;if there has been a ballot, if there has been adequate notice and if the action is in furtherance of a trade dispute, the union or its officials who organise the action may be protected, but the worker remains in breach of contract. Such a consequence seems obvious to the English mind. It is not obvious to the French mind, the German mind, the Italian mind or, indeed, any other legal mind in Western Europe. What happens in those systems?
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para10"></a>Where workers collectively take part in industrial action as defined by the national system&#151;definitions do change&#151;"What is a strike?" is a favourite area for writing in the vast literature on this subject, which I am sure is all known to the Government. What a strike is is a difficult issue about which lawyers argue&#151;usually passing like ships in the night&#151;since what appears to the Italian mind to be a strike may not appear so to the French mind. The British mind tends to pass both of them because they include almost all industrial action within the compass of these rules.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para11"></a>The other systems suspend the contract of employment in relation to strike action. The French principle, introduced into the Code du Travail, is that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a strike does not break the contract of employment unless the employee is guilty of serious misconduct".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-36_para12"></a>
Perhaps my noble and learned friend will be pleased to see the word "misconduct" in a legal provision. Of course, here it is interpreted to mean, in Article 521, action which is not within the normal course of industrial action. A striker cannot break up the works and then say, "Oh well, it's not a breach of my contract of employment or other fault because I did it in a <P>


<a name="column_CWH287"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH287</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>strike". However, in itself, the strike does not break the contract of employment; the contract of employment is suspended.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para13"></a>It will be an objection to the amendment that we do not say what is to happen, having said that it should not be a breach of contract. It will of course be necessary, if the spirit of the amendment is accepted, to say what happened with regard to the contract of employment in a protected strike. The amendment&#151;I break off to remind the Committee&#151;speaks of a stoppage of work in the course of industrial action which is protected within Section 238A of the 1992 Act. It would be necessary to introduce a provision whereby the contract of employment was suspended. And it would be necessary to provide, as other systems do, that during a strike wages should not be payable and that the employee should not be obliged to carry out the terms of the contract, and so on. Of course, further provisions will be needed.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para14"></a>However, I am emboldened to introduce this issue as a probing matter of principle because in another place on 12th February the Minister, Mr Johnson, said, first, that a review would take place of this whole matter. Then he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The review will include an examination of the law on the dismissal of strikers. We are committed to introducing any resulting legislation within the lifetime of this Parliament".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 12/2/02; col. 155.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-36_para15"></a>
Therefore, it is on the agenda. It is true that it will come in in a review, but it is time that the debate began. As my noble friend Lord Lea will also explain in a slightly different amendment, the Bill raises the issue fairly and squarely before Parliament, and it is time that Parliament began to debate it.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para16"></a>It is time that Parliament began to debate the matter, in particular, because the principle that the right to strike is a right and should not amount to a breach of the individual worker's contract of employment is recognised in a variety of international standards. It is recognised in the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; it is recognised in the Council of Europe's Social Charter; and it is recognised in the International Labour Organisation Convention on Freedom of Association 1948, Convention No. 87.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para17"></a>The bodies in the ILO, such as the Committee on Freedom of Association, the Committee of Experts and the governing body, have always held, since decades past,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"that one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations for the promotion and protection of their economic and social interests as guaranteed by the Convention",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-36_para18"></a>
is the right to strike. All except the United Kingdom have adopted the Social Charter of 1989, which affirms:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The right to resort to collective action in the event of a conflict of interest shall include the right to strike".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-36_para19"></a>
The Charter of Fundamental Rights 2000 of the European Union, Article 28, affirms:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Workers and employers, or their respective organisations, have in accordance with Community law and national laws and practices, the right to negotiate and conclude collective <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_CWH288"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH288</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>agreements at the appropriate levels and, in cases of conflicts of interest, to take collective action to defend their interests, including strike action".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-36_para20"></a>
It is true that that includes the phrase "in accordance with national laws and practices", but a right which is given by the charter in accordance with national laws and practices, is not, most people believe, intended to be abolished by national laws and practices as it is abolished at the moment in the law of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para21"></a>The Council of Europe Social Charter has been interpreted, it is true, as not including certain limited forms of industrial action. It means a complete cessation of work, and that is why we have used the phrase "stoppage of work" in the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para22"></a>It is also true to say&#151;and this is a most serious issue for the Government&#151;that the matter has been considered by the Council of Europe's experts and governing authorities and especially many, many times by the International Labour Organisation's committee of experts and its governing body. The United Kingdom has been condemned by both bodies in respect of its failure to observe the fundamental principle of the right to strike. Indeed, I refer to a recent article in the International Journal of Comparative Labour Law and Industrial Relations for 2002, one of many journals in the scholarly literature which have again and again tried to bring this matter to the attention of the authorities.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para23"></a>Professor Tonia Novitz and Dr Paul Germanotta write at page 75 in spring 2002 as follows:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"UK defiance in the face of international criticism would seem to flow from two complementary and inter-related factors. The first is the limited status of international conventions under UK law: there are no means by which to seek the enforcement of ILO Conventions and the European Social Charter in the national courts.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-36_para24"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The second is the perception that economic dictates must take precedence over international obligations. This can be attributed to the pressures that UK governments have felt to attract and maintain international investment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-36_para25"></a>
They there refer to some of the excuses given by some people for not observing our international obligations.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para26"></a>The French system is clear. The Italian constitution has the strongest right to strike known in western Europe. The German basic law has been interpreted from the beginning as including a right to strike in the proper sense. Furthermore, as my friend, Professor Giugni, has written&#151;and I translate the Latin which he used&#151;a right to strike means that you do not cause legal injury to anyone when you exercise the right. You may do if you go outside it or do something extra, but by exercising a right, you cannot be said to cause legal injury to others for which you can be made liable in the courts.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para27"></a>That scarcely does justice to a voluminous literature, and a vast number of calls upon the Government which have been ignored by both administrations. The worst replies to the ILO and to the European Social Charter were made in the 1980s, which can only be described as quite arrogant refusals to look at our international obligations. In the last decade, there has hardly been a better response from the present Government, I am ashamed to say.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para28"></a>The breach of the contract of employment in Britain, as the Donovan report recognised in one passage, will normally result from industrial action. It is very rare that industrial action does not break the contract of employment. In fact, most people believe that the only occasion in which that can eventuate is where workers take collective action to avoid voluntary overtime, since they are not obliged to work the overtime. Other than that, it is almost impossible to find such a case.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para29"></a>That this has remained for so long is quite astonishing. What I hope to obtain from the Government from this probing amendment is an assurance that they will look carefully at the need to observe our international obligations, of which we have been in breach for so long, and that we will institute if not a right as good as that in the Italian or German constitutions, at any rate something better than total absence of a right for individual workers in the present case. As I said, it is a very practical matter. There have recently been cases where workers have been dismissed and deprived of the rights which the 1999 Act tried to give them with regard to unfair dismissal in Wales by reason of the employer instituting a lock-out.
<P>

<a name="20321-36_para30"></a>How did that arise? It arose in respect of the amendment to which my noble friend Lord Lea will speak; namely, that we amended the law of unfair dismissal&#151;of which I have not spoken at all&#151;to say that in the first eight weeks of an industrial action, if it were protected under the rules of our ballots and the like, workers would be protected by reason of the application of the rules concerned with unfair dismissal. My noble friend will forgive me addressing his amendment before he has moved it but I want to explain why we put our amendment down and did not support his.

<P>

<a name="20321-37_para0"></a>The problem with my noble friend's amendment, which does away with the eight weeks and protects strikers in regard to unfair dismissal without limit of time, is not only the difficulties that that may give rise to in itself but the fact that it will leave those strikers in breach of contract of employment. By not grasping that central nettle, the protection in regard to unfair dismissal will leave them in a highly ambiguous situation.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para1"></a>I understand the argument that employers have put forward that such an amendment would protect workers who go on strike&#151;protected strike and lawful strike as far as the union is concerned. Those who join in that will be protected against unfair dismissal but they will still be in breach of contract of employment. <P>


<a name="column_CWH290"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH290</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>It is, as it were, to close that logical gap that the principle, which is inherent in our Amendment No. 131, says that the breach of contract should be cured. If that could be done, there would be no objection to the amendment of my noble friend Lord Lea. I would join with him in his Amendment No. 262A once that logical gap was closed. It is with that quite inadequate presentation to the Committee of what is involved in this very important, central issue of labour law and labour relations that I beg leave to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-37_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   I rise to speak to Amendment No. 262A in echoing my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. There are unique features of the history of the right to strike in Britain. Indeed, we do not find there is a right to strike. We find that there is protection in the 1906 Act, as he has said, against inducement to breach of contract of employment in consultation or in furtherance of a trade dispute and so forth. That is the line that we have all been brought up to understand. But, of course, it runs into all the difficulties to which my noble friend has referred when it comes to unfair dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para2"></a>One of the things that can be said and no doubt will be said is, "Well, this sort of thing may be true in theory but it does not really happen in practice, does it?". Perhaps I may remind the Committee about the specific case to which my noble friend has referred.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para3"></a>Friction Dynamics is a company in the Caernarfon area. There has been a year long dispute which involves the whole community in that area. Indeed, April is the first anniversary of this dispute. It has not received a great deal of press attention but it certainly is exercising people in that area very considerably. It exemplifies the inadequacies of our employment law. We were pleased to hear Alan Johnson say in the other place that this matter will be reviewed and that action following that review will be taken in the life of this Parliament.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para4"></a>Let me say what happened in this dispute. It involves 87 workers who were sacked by their employer after taking part in a lawful strike. By the way, it is worth reminding ourselves that we now have a very restricted right to strike in a number of other respects in addition to what has been mentioned. I refer to the ballot etc. However, this is a lawful dispute and they were on strike. The industrial action was called by the Transport and General Workers Union, in which I declare an interest as a member of that union, following the serious deterioration in working conditions at the plant, including the proposed removal of statutory health and safety rights, reductions in holiday allowances and changes in shift patterns.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para5"></a>Following the strike, the workers returned to find that they had been locked out of the factory, placed on an enforced holiday and 50 temporary staff had been recruited to fill their places. After eight weeks of stalemate the workers were given an ultimatum to return to work or face dismissal. They were sacked. Members of the Committee will agree that this raises the question in a rather acute form and the example proves it is not theoretical. If it is unfair to dismiss an <P>


<a name="column_CWH291"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH291</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>employee for taking part in a lawful strike during the first eight weeks of a dispute, why is it not equally unfair for the remainder of the strike? The fact is&#151;and we know the history&#151;that eight weeks is an arbitrary figure. It has nothing, on any obvious reasoning, to do with fairness or to do with equity or common sense.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para6"></a>One is conscious it can be argued that this whole matter is not really the territory of the Bill. I have to say I was sympathetic to that argument and, until recently, I was very sympathetic to it. However, the more we have gone into the whole question of unfair dismissal in the previous two or three Sittings, the more it has led me to think we should table this measure even though it entails, as I am advised by the Public Bill Office of the House of Lords&#151;although, oddly enough, that did not seem to be the view of the Public Bill Office in the House of Commons&#151;a change in the Long Title, hence Amendment No. 264. I am certainly on a learning curve on esoteric matters such as that. However, it is important to emphasise that the right to strike in this country is an indirect right to strike. In no other European country is there such a restriction on the length of a strike as we have in this eight week rule. I am not even sure that we can find it in any other part of the world, but I have not done my research sufficiently to do a total dragnet.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para7"></a>The amendment is a probing amendment and the Government have indicated that a great debate has to take place on the matter. I trust that it will not simply be a case of splitting the difference between eight weeks, 10 weeks and 12 weeks. The time has come when we could take a more logical view of where the right to strike fits into our legal structure than has previously been the case. It is in that spirit that I speak to the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-37_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   These three amendments draw us into a debate about the effectiveness of the protections against dismissal for taking certain types of industrial action, which were introduced in the Employment Relations Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para8"></a>As my noble friends Lord Wedderburn of Charlton and Lord Lea of Crondall have said, the issue has come to prominence again because of the dismissal of a group of employees at Friction Dynamics last year. I refer to proceedings that raise the legal issues arising out of that dispute.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para9"></a>This matter was debated at length during the Report stage in the other place. Important undertakings were made in that debate. They are worth mentioning again. The Government believe that the Bill is not the right place to change the law on the dismissal of people taking industrial action. This law has been in place for a relatively short time&#151;in fact since April 2000. The Government fully understand the difficulties experienced by the sacked workers at Friction Dynamics. However, it would be wrong in our view to change the law on the basis of one, unresolved case.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para10"></a>That said, the Government are committed to undertake a review of the Employment Relations Act. We will begin the review in May or June this year. The Government will include within the review an examination of the Act's provisions on the dismissal of <P>


<a name="column_CWH292"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH292</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>strikers. We will consult in full on the issues, in the course of that consultation dealing with the point made by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, who will be free to raise the issues of convention obligations. This should give us a far better basis on which to assess the law's effects.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para11"></a>This is an important undertaking given by my honourable friend Mr Alan Johnson in another place. Should the review contain recommendations to change the law in this or other areas, the Government have committed themselves to come forward with the necessary legislation in the life of this Parliament. In that context, these amendments are premature.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para12"></a>Amendment No. 131 would in effect make it unfair to dismiss any person taking protected industrial action because it would remove the main grounds for dismissal; namely, that the striker has broken his contract of employment.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para13"></a>This is a very radical step. It would in principle overturn long established law on the effect of industrial action on contracts of employment that my noble friend Lord Wedderburn of Charlton set out in full for us. It would make it considerably more difficult for employers to protect what they would regard as their legitimate business interests during prolonged periods of industrial action. It is therefore not an approach that readily commends itself to the Government, but again I refer to the review.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para14"></a>Amendments Nos. 262A and 264 also seek to make it unfair in all cases for the employer to sack those taking protected industrial action. As my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall said, it achieves this end directly by introducing a new clause into the Bill which would remove parts of Section 238A of the 1992 Act which currently qualify the protection against dismissal in these circumstances. The Government have similar concerns to those referred to in relation to the amendments of my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. We have similar concerns about this amendment; namely, that it is premature and probably goes too far.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para15"></a>The text of 238A was inserted by the Employment Relations Act 1999. It was introduced following prolonged and difficult but productive talks with interested parties. Yes, it is possible to say where something is the result of long, difficult and productive talks, it does not measure up to what either side would regard as equitable and fair, but that is the nature of things that come out of long, productive and difficult talks. It represents a compromise that was acceptable to employers and unions at that time. The amendments would unpick that carefully constructed compromise. If a new settlement on this issue is to be reached, we need to involve all parties in deciding which way we should go. As I have stated, the forthcoming review of the Employment Relations Act is the correct place to engage other parties in this exercise.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para16"></a>In light of my remarks, I invite my noble friend Lord Wedderburn to withdraw his amendment and, when the time comes, the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, not to move his amendment.

<P>
<A NAME="20321-37_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Of course, I am not surprised that the Government did not fall into raptures and accept even the probing spirit of all these amendments. However, I am a little disappointed by the terms in which the Government have addressed themselves to the problem at this early stage. It may not be the right place, in their view, in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para17"></a>The problems, in my submission, are not based on a law that has been the law for a short time. Law on breach of contract, if one can transpose it into earlier language of status and property, has been the law since the Statute of Labours 1351. There has been a long time to think about it and a long time to get employers to see what French, German and Italian employers seem able to see. They did not all see it at one point&#151;they have of course resisted it. In the different histories of the industrial legal systems of these countries, employers resisted the application of international human rights to labour relations, but it is not an issue in those countries now. Why are English employers&#151;British employers&#151;thought to be so deficient in common understanding of international human rights that they could not possibly accept what employers elsewhere accept?
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para18"></a>Of course, there is a surrounding panorama of legal provisions which deal&#151;for example, in France&#151;with replacement workers. That is a very relevant point of the dispute&#151;the astonishing and outrageous treatment of workers&#151;to which my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall referred. There was a case in Wales recently in which replacement workers were used and then the workforce was dismissed after waiting for eight weeks. It is remarkable that British employers still engage in that sort of activity. It happens elsewhere, I have to admit, but when it happens the breach of law is immediately apparent.
<P>

<a name="20321-37_para19"></a>Here it seems&#151;although no doubt there will be further consultation on the legal position of this dispute&#151;that it is something that the Government, at the moment at any rate, are happy that they can get away with. The approach in my amendment, said my noble and learned friend&#151;I apprehend I have him right&#151;is not one that readily commends itself to the Government. That will not be good news in Brussels in light of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. It will not be good news in Geneva for the International Labour Organisation, which is fed up with the way in which the United Kingdom Government constantly defy the most basic principles of the Convention on Freedom of Association. It will not be good news to British workers or to British trade unions, which have to cope. They are the people who have to cope with the mess that is caused by this absurd antediluvian, stone-like attitude to international human rights in regard to collective action. I appreciate that there is more protection than there was. In 1999, the Government made a step forward both in regard to recognition and to unfair dismissal. It is a small, teetering little step that does not address the fact that this country is virtually alone in Europe&#151;not, of course, in Latin America&#151;by being in breach of the most fundamental principle of the International Labour Organisation. When the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>review comes, I hope that it will commend itself to the Government to face that very simple fact and to do something about it. This is an early stage. We have put the matter on the agenda. We give notice to the Government that we expect better of a Labour government than merely to look at such principles and have them not commended to themselves at an early stage. Let them keep an open mind on whether they should observe those standards, which are internationally applicable. At the present stage, there is nothing more to be done. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20321-38_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 132:

<a name="20321-38_para0"></a><P>

"( ) The non-completion of a statutory procedure shall not be attributable to a failure by the employee by reason only that he fails to take a step at a time after the date of termination of his contract of employment, unless it appears to an employment tribunal just and equitable to determine otherwise."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="20321-38_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: We now come to Clause 31, which raises the question of the non-completion of statutory procedures with the sanction of the adjustment of awards of compensation if an employee does not complete the steps that he is obliged to take. This is a simple little amendment that addresses problems that occur in real life. The employee may not have sent a letter because he was ill. Yet he may have been treated outrageously and deserve a case and a remedy in the tribunal. His family may have been ill. His wife may have left him. His wife may have come back and caused equal problems! All sorts of difficulties may arise in life and the worker may find himself in a situation in which it is just and equitable to say that he can be forgiven for not taking the bureaucratic step that is required of him before he has access to the portals of judgment in an employment tribunal and before his award is then to be cut down under Clause 31.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para2"></a>The amendment simply states, if it appears to an employment tribunal just and equitable, a failure to take the step that is necessary after the date of termination of his contract of employment is not to be regarded as attributable to a failure on his part. He may have lost his job, his contract of employment may be terminated, he may be in family difficulties or suffering other problems of a real kind that are personal. Although he has a remedy, he can suffer massive cuts in the compensation that is his due. This is a simple little amendment to give the tribunal a discretion. Tribunals are very good at exercising discretion. Employers do not, I think, complain&#151;this is rather important in terms of the opposition to some of our amendments. Employers complain that too many cases get to tribunals. We have already suggested that the statistics on that do not bear out any rational case. But as I understand it, employers have not complained overall about the exercise of discretion by tribunals&#151;at any rate, not in the more sensible <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>literature of which I am aware. Giving the tribunal a little more discretion would not do a great deal of harm here.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para3"></a>If my noble and learned friend says we have got the words wrong in the amendment, or it does not quite apply in the right area, then no doubt he will take it away and look at it. We desperately await the words, "We'll take this away and look at it". We do not hear them very often. I hope we will not get a stony refusal to the spirit of this amendment. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20321-38_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   With some diffidence, I rise to support the noble Lord in his amendment. I rise with some diffidence because I have noticed that when I support amendments from the Opposition side, they do not get very far. On the other hand, when I oppose the amendments that come from that side, it seems that the Government then agree with them. I therefore feel somewhat diffident in supporting the noble Lord's amendment, but I very much do so.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-38_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   I merely want to say that this is the beginning of a whole series of attempts to mitigate the consequences, as we see it, of the non-completion of the statutory procedure. The Government may well decide that they do not like this attempt, but there are many more. This is one of a series of amendments which are all designed in some way or another to mitigate the full consequences for workers of the non-completion of the statutory procedures, some affecting dispute procedures and some affecting grievances.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para4"></a>It may well be that the Government want to say, for the usual set reasons, that they cannot accept this amendment. However, I hope they will not take an equally obscurantist, tough and, as my noble friend says, stone-like defence to all the attempts. There is, after all, a statement or two from the Minister in another place, in which he says he will tell us about all kinds of cases where people will not be involved and where they will not have to complete the procedure or, if they do not proceed to apply part of the procedure, they may find their way to the tribunal. There is therefore some escape and one of the ways of escape is to accept this amendment. I hope the Government will give us the right answer.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-38_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Clause 31 is designed to encourage the parties to an employment-related dispute to use the statutory procedures set out in Schedule 2. It does so, as my noble friend has indicated, by providing for any award made to be adjusted where an employer or employee does not use them.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para5"></a>This is not about deterring claims from going to tribunals but merely about ensuring that parties use in-house procedures first, so making complaint to a tribunal unnecessary where the dispute is resolved satisfactorily. Surely, that must be sensible for all concerned&#151;after all, few people relish appearing at a tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para6"></a>There will inevitably have to be some exceptions to the proposition that statutory procedures will have to be used and completed. Members of the Committee <P>


<a name="column_CWH296"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>will be aware that those who have suffered harassment at the hands of the line manager who will be dealing with a grievance will understandably not be keen to take that grievance forward. Or if they raise a grievance about something and are harassed while attempting to use the procedure, it would be unreasonable to expect them to continue to use it. Regulations which will be made will cover this and other instances.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para7"></a>However, with these limited exceptions, employees and former employees will be expected to have used the statutory procedures or else be subject to the adjustment provisions. Therefore, someone who has been dismissed will normally be expected to have complied with and completed the appropriate procedure, as instigated by his employer, whether full or modified, which applies in his particular case. Regulations made under Clause 31(5) will specify the circumstances in which the procedures contained in Schedule 2 will apply. For example, it was said in the other place that we envisage that the modified procedure will apply to former employees. Where the employer does not instigate the procedure or does not follow it, the employee will normally have his award adjusted upwards.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para8"></a>Because we wish to encourage as wide a use of the procedures as possible, I cannot accept this amendment, which seeks to exclude former employees from having to comply further with the procedures, except where the tribunal determines otherwise.

<A NAME="20321-38_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   Have I got the Minister right? He has said something very similar to something which the Minister in another place said. He said that they were going to exclude certain categories. One of the categories was an allegation of harassment. I have no desire to say anything which would lead the Government to take an allegation of harassment out and say that it must be completed. However, there is a kind of inconsistency. The regulations do not appear on the face of the Bill, but anything based on them are general exclusions. But they are allegations; we do not know whether they are factual or not. Anybody can allege anything.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para9"></a>I could allege harassment and one might examine it and discover that I was not harassed at all and that I did all the harassing. It is an allegation. The Government are prepared to exclude allegations, but we are not talking about an allegation. We are saying in the amendment that there has been evidence. The tribunal comes to the view that in fact there is some case for considering the point. Why can the Government not accept it?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-38_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I have just been saying that that is the same question again.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-38_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   My noble and learned friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton feels he has answered that. Very well.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para10"></a>There are two real problems about my noble and learned friend's reply. The Secretary of State is going to make regulations that will tell us all about this. All <P>


<a name="column_CWH297"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH297</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the problems we have raised are going to be dealt with in regulations. Our first objection to that is that we should have some indication on the face of the Bill in order to be able to discuss Clause 31. Clause 31 says that the employee's award will be reduced in certain circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para11"></a>Let me be more clear. Where a statutory procedure is not completed before proceedings have begun, Clause 31 (2)(c) provides:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the non-completion of the statutory procedure was wholly or mainly attributable to failure by the employee&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-38_para12"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(i) to comply with a requirement of the procedure, or
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-38_para13"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(ii) to exercise a right of appeal under it
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-38_para14"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>it [the tribunal] must, subject to subsection (4), reduce any award which it makes to the employee by 10 per cent, and may, if it considers it just and equitable in all the circumstances to do so, reduce it by a further amount ... up to 50 per cent".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-38_para15"></a>
It has a discretion, but only a discretion one way; it can make it worse and worse and worse for the employee who has not exercised all his rights of appeal or completed all the procedures. I will not repeat that we regard those as unfair; I take it to be an assumption in anybody's mind that our case is that these are unfair procedures in a variety of ways. They are also rather uncertain. Let us put that aside for the moment and carry that assumption. Furthermore, if the employee does not exercise all his rights of appeal, the employment tribunal has the discretion.
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para16"></a>All this amendment asks for is that the employment tribunal should have another discretion in its favour. The words in the Bill are "just and equitable". This is a very modest amendment and applies only when the employee's contract of employment has been terminated. The poor man and woman are out there without work. They are unable to complete the first requirement of the procedure or perhaps to exercise their right of appeal, and the tribunal says, "Well, there were special circumstances here; it was just and equitable in our view that they should be relieved of that, and the words "wholly" or "mainly" attributable to the failure of that employee should be understood to include the discretion in such hard circumstances that they are not to be penalised".
<P>

<a name="20321-38_para17"></a>I cannot for the life of me see what is unreasonable about that, and yet we are not even to have the matter reconsidered. There is no expression of sentiment for the worker in such a circumstance. It is as though I was debating this with Mr Balfour, not my Labour Government. I do not think that we would have received such a hard response to all these amendments in 1901. It really will not do to tell us that there is nothing in this point. I appreciate that my noble and learned friend hinted that he considered the amendment to be rather too narrowly drawn since it applies to cases after the date of termination of contract. We could look at that issue again. We could look at the whole wording again, but surely the spirit of it is reasonable. I am left with no alternative but to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-39_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 134:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 37, line 3, leave out sub-paragraph (i).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para0"></a><P>

<a name="20321-39_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a very simple amendment and it will become more clear when we reach Schedules 3 and 4. As the Bill stands under Clause 31, the list of jurisdictions&#151;that is, the list of the type of case to which this penalty provision applies&#151;is set out in Schedule 3. When we come to deal with Schedule 3, we shall want to test each and every case in that schedule against, first, justice, secondly, common sense and, thirdly, our European obligations. I can speak to that only when we come to Schedules 3 and 4, which are now grouped together.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para2"></a>This provision tells us that the Secretary of State can add any other jurisdiction to the list in the schedule. That is why it is a little difficult to debate this matter before we reach Schedules 3 and 4. However, in our view, Schedule 3 is sufficient. If the Government believe that they will introduce some other employment protection right to which their Schedule 2 procedures will apply, they had better tell us what they think that might be. That is not an unreasonable request. There are things on the horizon. If they introduce employment rights in respect of age discrimination, will they apply the procedures to that? If they introduce other European directives which are on the horizon and implement them, will this provision apply to those so that the Government can add all future employment rights jurisdictions to the list of penalties? No doubt they will add the provision to Schedule 4 as well in respect of prevention of access to justice in the employment tribunals.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para3"></a>Therefore, the amendment seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State does not have the power, by regulation, to add a jurisdiction to the list in the schedule. When some new employment right is created, at whatever level, the Secretary of State should come to Parliament and propose, subject to amendment, in full debate that he wishes to increase his vast powers in this respect.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para4"></a>This provision represents another example of the power by regulation or order to add, in Clause 31, to the disadvantages to workers. It may be said that it is possible that disadvantages will also arise for employers under Clause 31. Theoretically at least, that is true, and I would not favour the Secretary of State having power to add a jurisdiction to the list to disadvantage employers further either. That matter should be fully argued. At this stage of the introduction of the new procedures and all the uncertainties that go with them, I cannot see that new jurisdictions&#151;new employment rights&#151;should be added to a list by a regulation which, as a matter of reality, will not be discussed properly and, more importantly, will not be open to amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-39_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Rotherwick: </B>   As we have already heard, the amendment seeks to prevent the Secretary of State <P>


<a name="column_CWH299"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH299</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adding other tribunals to the jurisdiction of the Act. As Members of the Committee know, we are opposed to the extent to which the Government constantly add to the amount of secondary legislation, as distinct from primary legislation. No doubt the Minister will justify the use of secondary legislation in adding to the already formidable list of tribunals in Section 3 by saying that it will assist if new tribunals are set up in the future by new legislation. However, it only requires a stroke of the draftsman's pen to say in the new Act that Clause 31 and Schedule 3 of the Employment Act 2002 will apply to this new Act. Therefore, on the principle that we wish to encourage more primary legislation and less secondary legislation, I must apologise at this stage to the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn. As my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon said, every time we support an amendment, the Government do not give way but when we disagree with one, they go away and think about it. Therefore, I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn: we are going to support this one.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-39_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   As ever, the fatal hand of the Tories shrivels the amendment. The amendment seeks to remove the power to add jurisdictions. As it stands, as the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, has said, Schedule 3 contains the main jurisdictions under which tribunal claims arise. We would want to assess how this clause works in relation to those jurisdictions before deciding whether to add or remove jurisdictions. If difficulties arise with particular jurisdictions, we may wish to remove them. If a new jurisdiction&#151;this involves the case referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn&#151;is given to tribunals, we may wish to consider adding it to Schedule 3.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para5"></a>I see no sense in removing the power to add jurisdictions, which may be eminently suitable for inclusion in Schedule 3, as the amendment seeks to do. That is why the power is there. What did the Delegated Powers Committee think of it? It thought that it was sensible and proportionate. Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment and I invite the noble Lord to withdraw it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-39_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am grateful to my noble and learned friend for explaining the Government's position but we have not sought to get rid of the Secretary of State's power to remove jurisdictions from the list. What we have objected to is the power by regulation or order to add jurisdictions to the list.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para6"></a>If I caught my noble and learned friend's words correctly, he said at some stage&#151;I think that I am quoting&#151;"We may wish to consider adding a jurisdiction". I have no objection to their wishing to consider it; what I object to is their being able to do so by regulation. They can consider what they like but I object to them having the power to do that by regulation. They should argue their case properly and bring it to the Floor of the House and let it be amended.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para7"></a>As a matter of fact, the amendment point is particularly strong in this regard because we shall have exceptions under any of these jurisdictions. <P>


<a name="column_CWH300"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH300</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Harassment cases will be excluded perhaps not from all jurisdictions, perhaps in regard to sex discrimination cases, race discrimination and possibly unfair dismissal. We do not know; we have not seen the regulations, although now we have been assured in earlier sittings that we will all get 30 days' notice of them. We look forward to that. There are problems about certain jurisdictions under the Tax Credits Act. If a new Act is produced and jurisdiction is to be added to the list, it may be that there will be exceptions to cases under the new Act which are not to come within the purview of Clause 31 or, indeed, by parallel, the purview of Clause 33 and Schedule 4, which is a parallel case. So the case for regulation here is peculiarly weak. The case for saying, "We may wish to consider adding it", is peculiarly Tudor and peculiarly Henry VIII. It involves saying, "When I want to add, I shall add and you can't amend it. You can't move an amendment to my adding a jurisdiction to say that women workers who are harassed or other workers who are treated in a particular way do not fall within these penalties or this prohibition of access to justice".
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para8"></a>This is a serious point; it is a matter not just of machinery but of how governments ought to behave. Labour governments in the past have not always demanded vast powers of regulation in Bills that go way beyond what they say at the time that they are going to use. My noble and learned friend will not even take this amendment away; he just rejects it again. Our amendments are just rejected; they are not even to be considered further. We shall consider the matter further before Report and see whether it would be right to put to the House the issue of deciding whether it should have the competence to consider and amend the detail of a new jurisdiction&#151;a new set of penalties&#151;which will be put upon working people in regard to Clause 33. At the moment, there is nothing more I can do. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<A NAME="20321-39_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton </B>   moved Amendment No. 135:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 66, leave out lines 22 to 26.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para12"></a><P>

<a name="20321-39_para13"></a>The noble Lord said: This is a somewhat complicated group of amendments. Amendments Nos. 135 to 141 are grouped&#151;they concern Schedule 3. But Amendments Nos. 171 to 178 are grouped with them, and they concern Schedule 4. Unless I am mistaken, the same considerations arise in respect of both schedules, although they apply to slightly different parts of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para14"></a>Schedule 3 applies by defining the jurisdictions, as we have just appreciated, to which Clause 31 is applicable; that is, cases in which compensation awards can be reduced&#151;or, indeed, in some cases, increased&#151;where there has been non-completion of statutory procedures. I interpose the remark&#151;almost <P>


<a name="column_CWH301"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH301</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a footnote, but it is important in relation to what has already passed&#151;that in the case of the employee, it is said that he must exercise all his rights of appeal. The burden on the employer in Clause 31 is much smaller and his non-completion may be much smaller.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para15"></a>On the other hand, Schedule 4 is of course the definition schedule for the scope of Clause 33. Clause 33 says that an employee shall not be allowed to present a complaint to an employment tribunal under a jurisdiction to which that section applies if he has not completed a requirement in the relevant statutory procedures. Schedule 4 defines the scope of the range of Clause 33.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para16"></a>These are very serious and central parts of the mechanisms of the Bill. To what may these penalties and prohibitions on access to justice apply? I preface my remarks by pointing out that if I had to choose, I should say that Schedule 4 was more important than Schedule 3 because Schedule 4 can give rise to a prohibition on access to justice. Schedule 3 is bad enough but at least it can only give rise to reductions or increases of penalties.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para17"></a>To what is this set of penalties and prohibitions to apply? I invite Members of the Committee to look at the list&#151;it may be easier to look at page 66 of the Bill than at the amendments because the amendments have to refer to a page and line number in every case. We can see the list more easily on page 66. This is the range of employment protection rights&#151;a list of modern protection rights&#151;across the board. First, it refers to cases on equal pay. You can lose the right to go to the tribunal if you do not do what is required under that provision. I add that this is a place where the right of the employee&#151;the equality clause&#151;is introduced by the 1970 Act into the contract of employment. It is interesting that the Government have used the same formula in this case.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para18"></a>That is the first matter&#151;equal pay cases. Secondly, I refer to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and to cases where, under Section 63, a complainant who alleges sex discrimination can go to the tribunal. A penalty could apply or they can be stopped under Schedule 4 and Clause 33. Yet we are now told that exceptions are going to be introduced. Therefore, anyone who looked at the Bill would be misled unless they looked also at the regulations that are coming on the exceptions. In a future amendment we shall be arguing&#151;my noble friend will move the amendment, I think&#151;that some indication should be given on the face of the Bill of the areas in which this schedule and Schedule 4 will not apply. The Government cannot just leave the matter to regulations. They must tell people that there will be areas where, as the Minister said in another place, the provision will not apply even if they want to put the precise detail into regulations. I refer to Section 54 of the Race Relations Act 1976 and discrimination on the grounds of race.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para19"></a>I now turn to something different&#151;Section 146 of the 1992 Act. This is not simply a matter of a right to bring an action in a tribunal and to get compensation by reason of a breach of the section. That is another section which gives a person a right to be a member of <P>


<a name="column_CWH302"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH302</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a trades union and a right to carry on trades union activities. This section deals with so-called detriment. Detriment, as I have said in a previous debate, is a polite name for victimisation. This is a case where a worker complains that he has been wrongly treated and deterred,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"from being or seeking to become a member of an independent trade union",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para20"></a>
or deterred,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"from taking part in the activities of an independent trade union"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para21"></a>
by reason that he suffered victimisation, or, in the words of the statute,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"by reason of the imposition of a detriment".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para22"></a>
This is someone who has been victimised, yet he has to send a little letter, or a copy of it, saying, "Please, Mr Employer, don't victimise me any more. I want to go to the employment tribunal". And his compensation will be reduced if he does not exercise all rights of appeal, it seems. There is a whole list of jurisdictions here in the two schedules which deal not just with a substantive right to go to the tribunal in terms of the right itself, but the right to go to the tribunal to complain that detriment, or victimisation, has been applied to the employee in respect of the sections involved.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para23"></a>I now turn to Section 8 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. A disabled worker who has been discriminated against has to complete his procedures. He has to send a little letter and say, "Oh dear, I've got a grievance," or, more importantly, "Oh dear, Mr Employer, you have discriminated against me in the employment field", otherwise he cannot go near a tribunal. It is an extraordinary list.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para24"></a>Section 23 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 is a little different. This concerns cases where the employer has not paid the proper wages and has made an unauthorised deduction, as the statute makes clear. We have moved an amendment to suggest that while on the Government's own logic they will make the employee engage in completion of necessary procedures for one deduction, where the case falls under subsection (3) of the section&#151;which is the case where there have been several, or a series, as the section puts it, of deductions from wages&#151;the worker should be allowed to go straight to the tribunal and should not be subject to penalty. That is a rather different amendment but we have considered each of these separately. On the Government's own logic, they may be able to say that Section 23 cases should come within the purview of their rules but, where there has been a series of wage deductions, it is surely not reasonable to make their rules apply in quite the same way.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para25"></a>Section 48 is a most astonishing inclusion. I have to deal carefully with Section 48 because we have moved an amendment that goes to its heart. Section 48 gives the employee the right to complain to an employment tribunal on the grounds that he suffered a detriment&#151;victimisation&#151;in contravention of Sections 44, 45, 46, 47, 47A or 47C of the Employment Rights Act 1996. <P>


<a name="column_CWH303"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH303</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>The list, in fact, under Section 48, is very long indeed, and these are victimisation cases. What are all those sections about?
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para26"></a>The fourth one is about health and safety. I am sorry if the noble Baroness opposite does not think I should explain this, but the Bill has all this detail buried away within it and it is necessary to bring it out and put it on the record. Section 44 concerns the case where an employee has been subjected to a detriment&#151;he has been victimised&#151;when he is a representative or other worker concerned with activities in connection with preventing or reducing risks to health and safety at work&#151;a most important function. He comes along and says, "I've been victimised because I tried to enforce my right to see that the health and safety provisions were put into effect". He is made subject to the procedure and he is made subject to the possibility of penalty.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para27"></a>Section 45, which we deliberately did not cover in our amendment, is about betting workers and Sunday workers in shops. We thought that in that case there might be a possible reasonableness as regards making them take these steps. But Section 45A introduces even greater difficulties. It is concerned with the following. I quote from Section 45A of the Employment Rights Act 1996:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"(1) A worker has the right not to be subjected to any detriment by any act, or any deliberate failure to act, by his employer done on the ground that the worker&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para28"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) refused ... to comply with a requirement which the employer imposed ... in contravention of the Working Time Regulations 1998".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para29"></a>
A number of problems arise here. First, this is a victimisation case. I hope the noble and learned Lord will reply to the point as to why on earth special provisions should be put in, penalising and blocking the rights, subject to their unfair procedures, of workers who have been subjected to detriment. It is as though someone has just gone through all the statutes, looked through all the cases where you could get to a tribunal and said, "Let's knock that one out as well". It is extraordinary and, in this case as in other cases, doubly extraordinary.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para30"></a>I join my comments on that problem with the last one in the list on page 67 of Schedule 3 and page 68 of Schedule 4; that is, Regulation 32 of the Transnational Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 1999. Again, this is a case of detriment where the worker has been victimised for pursuing rights under the European Works Councils Directive, which we have put into these regulations. Where the rights in these schedules rest upon European directives, it is more than doubtful whether the Government can be justified in subjecting them to special penalties and special prohibitions. Every directive requires that the nation state which is a member of the Union should implement the directives in its national system and provide appropriate and effective remedies for their breach&#151;even more, one would be quite clear, effective and appropriate remedies for detriment suffered by the worker in his attempt to enforce the European standard.
<P>


<a name="column_CWH304"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH304</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para31"></a>I am more concerned with what the standard is than whether it is European, but there is legally a special feature in regard to European-based standards. The directive requires that they should be enforceable by effective and appropriate procedures and remedies. It is not simply my doubt but the doubt of a number of people whether something like the trans-national information consultation provisions, as they rest on that basis, could possibly lawfully, in European eyes, be subjected to these special provisions where the worker has been victimised for trying to enforce his rights that derive from a European level.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para32"></a>Going back to the foot of page 66, we see that these provisions are to apply to unfair dismissal. Much of what we have said about Schedule 2 in its application to unfair dismissal cases can be referred to in this debate. Simply to apply it to unfair dismissal without amendment of Schedule 2, we have already argued, is unreasonable.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para33"></a>At the top of page 67, using Schedule 3 as our agenda, we see that the next case is a case of redundancy payments. Where the worker does not complete those special procedures, his right under Section 163 to go to the tribunal in respect of any right to a redundancy payment, or a complaint about the amount of a redundancy payment, is to be specially dealt with.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para34"></a>There are many who regard this as the most important of the cases where Clauses 31 and 33 are objectionable. There are complicated arguments about the amounts of redundancy payments, especially under Clause 31, and this is a commonsense problem. Is it really necessary to impose these new hurdles upon a claim to a redundancy payment on the assumption that otherwise the worker's right to that amount is as he claims it to be?
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para35"></a>Then we have the National Minimum Wage Act and, in addition, a worker who suffered detriment for daring to claim the wage. As a matter of fact, curiously enough, the national minimum wage is also a case where the right can inhere in the contract of employment. But at this level of Schedules 3 and 4, it is not perhaps centrally as important as it is in the Bill.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para36"></a>Under Section 24, however,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A worker may present a complaint to an employment tribunal that he has been subjected to a detriment in contravention of Section 23".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para37"></a>
Section 23 deals with a case where an employer has acted, or deliberately failed to act, on the ground that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any action . . . taken, or . . . proposed to be taken, by or on behalf of the worker with a view to enforcing"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para38"></a>
his right to the minimum wage; or where
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the employer was prosecuted for an offence"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para39"></a>
under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, led to the worker being victimised in the ways that happen sometimes&#151;not that often, but bad employers do such things. I cannot see what the logic is in subjecting the new penalties and the new prohibitions not just to the right to claim the national minimum wage but to the right to complain about the detriment caused by victimisation. The way the Government have constructed this list is quite extraordinary. Schedules <P>


<a name="column_CWH305"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH305</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>are not debated much in Parliament. More is the pity because one can understand Clauses 31 and 33 only in the light of Schedules 3 and 4.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para40"></a>We then come to the Tax Credits Act 1999. I was astonished to see that mentioned because I must admit that either I did not know or I had forgotten that a worker who is victimised on the ground that he has tried to enforce his benefit or right under the Tax Credits Act also has a right to complain to the employment tribunal. I do not know why that poor worker&#151;literally, in this sense&#151;is subjected to these new rules.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para41"></a>The next entry, and the equivalent in Scotland, is the Employment Tribunal Extension of Jurisdiction Order 1994. This raises an important point because, of course, the special penalties and the special prohibitions of Clauses 31 and 33 can apply to cases in the employment tribunals. Only fairly recently the employment tribunals had a concurrent jurisdiction with the county courts and the High Court in breach of contract cases.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para42"></a>Therefore, the special prohibitions and the special penalties will apply here to employment tribunal cases, but they will not apply to precisely the same cause of action in the county court or the High Court. I mean precisely the same facts and precisely the same complaint: one in the employment tribunal, to which this will apply, and one in the ordinary courts, to which it will not apply. Quite why the Government want to increase the number of cases in the county courts and allow full recompense and compensation there but not allow it in the employment tribunals baffles me.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para43"></a>Finally, I turn to Regulation 30 of the Working Time Regulations 1998. It states.
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A worker may present a complaint to an employment tribunal that his employer&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para44"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) has refused to permit him to exercise any right he has under&#151;",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para45"></a>
and then it sets out a list. There appears a whole series of basic regulations to the working time provisions, and, secondly, where the employer&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"has failed to pay him the whole or any part of any amount due to him under [the working time] regulations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-39_para46"></a><P>

<a name="20321-39_para47"></a>This is a straight breach of regulations. It is not a detriment case. It is a straightforward right to go to the tribunal and claim that the working time regulations have been broken. Of course, the point also arises here&#151;and I should have mentioned it before&#151;that in so far as this is based upon a directive of which we have managed to contract ourselves out of a great deal&#151;a situation which I hope will rapidly come to an end&#151;it is more than questionable whether it is possible, under the provisions of what the Luxembourg Court will enforce as European law, that these limitations on the rights under Section 30 to enforce the working time regulations will be acceptable.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para48"></a>No doubt the Government will have prepared a case and I expect they will say that it is only objectionable when one destroys the right and not when one limits it. In reality, when one limits the right to the extent that Clause 33 can limit it and prohibits any access to the <P>


<a name="column_CWH306"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH306</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>tribunal, one is coming very close to destroying the right altogether. Also, the imposition of penalties on what one can recover obviously has a deterrent effect and is arguably not an effective and appropriate remedy for the enforcement of these European provisions.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para49"></a>I apologise for going through each and every provision in these schedules, but when one goes through them, one sees what Clause 31 and, more particularly, Clause 33 really amount to. They are an onslaught not merely upon basic employment protection rights, and a question not merely against European standards, which we are obliged to impose and to have effectively remedied, but also in several cases they are penalties and prohibitions against the enforcement by a worker who suffered victimisation for trying to enforce his rights. What is the sense of that? "Oh", the Government may say, "because he must send a letter to the employer". Who is this employer by hypothesis in every case in which the word "detriment" appears? He is by hypothesis an employer who has&#151;in the allegation of the employee&#151;imposed victimisation on the employee that that employee wishes to have remedied and compensated. What on earth are the Government doing giving special barriers to the enforcement of remedies against detriment and victimisation? What justification is there in Clause 31 for saying that a worker who has been victimised must go through all the levels of appeal before he can get full compensation? The more one looks at Schedules 3 and 4, the more doubtful one becomes about aspects of all the items that are inserted within them.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para50"></a>It would not be much of a Bill if we just abolished Schedules 3 and 4 because Clauses 31 and 33 would become otiose. As a matter of fact, it is one reason why we left in betting workers and Sunday shop workers, because we are not destroying the whole of Schedules 3 and 4. It is a little unfair on betting workers and Sunday shop workers but, nevertheless, we have not moved their exclusion.
<P>

<a name="20321-39_para51"></a>I look forward to hearing what my noble and learned friend can say against each and every one of those items. I beg to move.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-40_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   That was a very helpful and comprehensive moving of the amendment because a number of clear strands and principles emerged. I hope that I can help the Committee with them. Before I do so, I shall put in context what the Bill does.
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para0"></a>Clause 31, as it currently is, states that if you have not gone through the procedures, the tribunal must, subject to subsection (4), reduce any award which it makes to the employee by 10 per cent and may, if it considers it just and equitable in all the circumstances to do so, reduce it by a further amount. So, with regard to Clause 31, the consequence of being one of the jurisdictions in which the whole procedure has not been completed is that the award must be reduced by 10 per cent and may be reduced, if it is just and equitable, by a further amount. As my noble friend Lord Wedderburn says, even that 10 per cent is subject <P>


<a name="column_CWH307"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH307</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to another exception in subsection (4). The duty under subsection (2) or (3) to make a reduction or increase of 10 per cent does not apply if there are exceptional circumstances which would make a reduction or increase of that percentage unjust or inequitable, in which case the tribunal may make no reduction or increase, or a reduction or increase of such lesser percentage as it considers just and equitable. So there are those provisions in Clause 31.
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para1"></a>Clause 33, as my noble friend Lord Wedderburn has very fairly said, requires the employee, before he can make a complaint, to go through step 1 of the grievance procedure, which is to send a letter raising the grievance. In certain circumstances, the writing of a letter itself would be quite unreasonable to ask the employee to do.
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para2"></a>An example where that can be suggested, as has been raised before, is someone who has been bullied because of their gender, their race, because they have raised a national minimum wage claim, or because they have raised a health and safety at work claim. If they are people who would be reluctant to raise the grievance because the offender, the bully, is the person to whom they would have to raise the complaint, then, of course, it would be wrong in those circumstances to bar them from the tribunal. That is understandable and we intend that regulations be made under Clause 31 to provide for exemptions from the need to complete procedures in these and other special circumstances. There may, for example, be some difficulties for people with particular disabilities. We shall have to consider that when we make the regulations. However, in the vast majority of cases I see no reason why Clause 31 should not apply to grievances taken up under these jurisdictions. There will be many cases where, for example, one is alleging discrimination on grounds of race and gender, of trade union membership, of raising health and safety at work complaints or the minimum wage, where the person to whom one raises the complaint is not the person against whom the complaint is being made. There will be cases of detriment because of, for example, raising a national minimum wage issue, where the grievance procedure does not require the complaint to be made to the person who is alleged in the examples given by my noble friend to be the person who is bullying the victim. Is there any reason in those circumstances why a letter should not be written before the complaint is made under these jurisdictions? It is difficult to see why not. The purpose of these particular clauses is to encourage employees and employers to seek to resolve disputes without resort to tribunals or courts. We believe that this provision promotes that.
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para3"></a>Of course, we must take care to ensure that people who legitimately would not want to write a letter because of fear, bullying, harassment or other misconduct by an employer should not have to do so. We will seek to do all we can to ensure that. We will be happy to discuss it with my noble friends to ensure that it can be done. Remember that in relation to Clause 33 writing a letter to raise a grievance is not a bad thing to do, particularly when that procedure can, for <P>


<a name="column_CWH308"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH308</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>example, get the issue pushed up to another level of management. That was referred to by my noble friend Lord Gladwin of Clee in relation to an earlier amendment.
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para4"></a>It is not a bad proposition and it does not have the consequences that my noble friend, in his submission, suggested. The only case that my noble friend really posited was the bully and in those circumstances we will make provision. The fact that an assertion of detriment is made does not mean that such an issue cannot be resolved in certain circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para5"></a>Another issue to which my noble friend referred was redundancy payments. As far as this is concerned, he was absolutely right to say that they often give rise to complicated disputes, issues or misunderstandings between parties. The employee has a legal right to his redundancy payment, as specified by law or by a collective agreement. That does not mean that it is not sensible to write and raise the issue about redundancy to see if it can be resolved. Our intention in these particular jurisdictions is not to allow bullying and harassment to prevent claims being made. It is to seek to encourage resolution of disputes by internal procedures. Our regulations will seek to ensure that the proper distinction is made: not to punish somebody who reasonably did not raise the matter through the grievance procedure&#151;which we think will be the exception, not the normal case; on the other hand, we should make sure that where it can be raised it should be.
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para6"></a>All the points made by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn of Charlton fall into the category of "You shouldn't have to and it's not fair to do so". I have dealt with all of them. There is no point in going through each of the individual jurisdictions and I am not going to do so. Every one of them fell within one of the points that I have just made.
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para7"></a>We have listened very carefully and will discuss very fully with my noble friend and anyone else the details that he would like to see in the regulations to ensure&#151;he rightly referred to this&#151;justice in relation to those who should not be required to write a letter before they have the right to go to a tribunal. However, I do not think that if one sat down and went through it, we would disagree very much.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-40_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am sorry about that. I think I disagree very profoundly with my noble and learned Friend Lord Falconer of Thoroton about much of this. I am not sure whether he referred to cases of detriment or victimisation. He referred to cases of bullying.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-40_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Could I help? I was meaning to refer to the health and safety and minimum wage cases where there is provision for one not to be victimised. My noble friend called it "detriment"&#151;that is what it is called in the statute&#151;and I meant to refer to those detriment cases.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-40_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I appreciate what my noble and learned friend says. I can only say that the <P>


<a name="column_CWH309"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH309</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>matter is here in the schedules. Cases of victimisation and detriment are put squarely within the new rules on penalties and prohibitions, and I do not see how regulations will take them out. Perhaps if someone is very badly victimised, the regulation will let them go in some special cases. Frankly, I do not agree that normal rights should be given only in very bad, bullying victimisation.
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para8"></a>I believe that, in any case, one should have normal rights if one is victimised for trying to enforce one's basic employment protection rights. If a person tries to do that, he may be deprived of overtime, he may not be promoted or he may be victimised in some other way at his place of work. Why on earth should special rules apply to a person's ability to go to a tribunal and say, "That's not fair"? Some workers will say, "I'm not going near that employer again. Look what he did to me last week. Why shouldn't I go to the tribunal and say, 'That's not right'?" By hypothesis, let us assume that the worker is correct in his allegation. What is wrong with enforcing the right not to be victimised, but without special penalties and without special prohibitions?
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para9"></a>With the greatest respect, I shall read very carefully what my noble and learned friend said. I do not believe that the defence of Schedules 3 and 4 is particularly effective. He said not one word about the European situation. I do not know whether the Government are remaining silent on that because, once again, they are confident that they will not be judged badly in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, but I wonder whether that is so. My noble and learned Lord said nothing whatever about the European dimension. Perhaps we are trying to take that issue off the agenda these days.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-40_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   It was entirely my fault for not referring to the European dimension. We shall of course consider the issue of compliance with European law, but we are perfectly confident that we are complying with it.
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para10"></a>However, I believe that this matter goes back to the essential point that I made at the beginning&#151;that is, whether the obligation comes from European law or domestic law, the principle should be the same. If there is a good reason why one should not write a letter&#151;for example, if one is being harassed or bullied&#151;that would be dealt with in regulations. If not, then we do not see the justification. We are also saying that in every one of those detriment cases it would not be the case that there was a good reason for writing a letter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-40_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I see. Therefore, if someone were badly bullied, it would be unsatisfactory for a penalty to be placed on him by the employer if he tried to enforce his European rights, implemented into our law, but not if he were bullied just a little. People will read this and will ask what it means. They will go to an adviser and ask what this is about. The adviser will say, "I cannot tell you that until we have the regulations". He would be able to say, "I might be able to obtain a draft 30 days before the regulations come in". But he will then read Hansard and will charge an <P>


<a name="column_CWH310"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH310</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extra fee for that. He will say, "The noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, says that if you are bullied a little bit, then you are subject to all these penalties and prohibitions. If you are very badly bullied, then you may not be. But I cannot be sure until I see the regulations".
<P>

<a name="20321-40_para11"></a>That is not at all satisfactory. These are shoddy legislative proposals. It is not good enough for citizens of the country to be subject to schedules of this kind concerning important limitations on their access to justice. There is nothing that we can do about it this evening. I am not sure what we can do this evening, but at present the best that I can do is beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-41_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden </B>   moved Amendment No. 142:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 37, line 17, after "State" insert ", after consultation with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service,".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-41_para0"></a><P>

<a name="20321-41_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving Amendment No. 142, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 143 to 145. We now reach Clause 32, which makes provision for the Secretary of State, in relation to jurisdiction listed in Schedules 3 and 4, which we have just been discussing, by regulations to make provision about the time limit for beginning proceedings in respect of a claim concerning a matter to which a statutory procedure applies. Our amendment stipulates that the Secretary of State should exercise this power after consultation with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. This is important because ACAS is the body which has the expertise and experience in this matter. We are dealing with the imposition of time limits and the imposition of time limits within which a claimant may make a claim is a matter of some concern to that individual.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para2"></a>We are suggesting that it would be right to say that the time limit should not be less than three months. The employee concerned may be distraught by what has happened. He or she may need assistance and advice. For a member of a union, that would present no difficulty but many employees covered by this legislation will, as we know, be working in firms where there is no union and they may not at first know where to go for advice.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para3"></a>We have a workforce that is increasingly multi-ethnic. There may be language difficulties and such people tend to be very vulnerable. Although one can say, as a former union official, that everyone ought to belong to a union, nevertheless that is not always realistic. There is a duty upon politicians, in my view, to do what they can to protect vulnerable people. Our amendment provides that as regards the time limit, that should not be less than three months. That is referred to in paragraph 2 of Clause 32. We want "not less than three months" inserted there.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para4"></a>In tabling Amendment No. 145, we believe that there should be provision for the exercise of a discretion by the tribunal to extend the time for <P>


<a name="column_CWH311"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH311</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>beginning proceedings. That is sensible because, again, the tribunal will have the experience of dealing with such cases and such people. I believe that it can be trusted to exercise discretion in a reasonable way.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para5"></a>We believe that these suggestions are sensible. We hope that they are regarded as constructive by the Government. We are intending, as I and my noble friends have stressed throughout our discussion of the Bill, to be as constructive as possible and I hope that the Minister will agree that this is such an amendment. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-41_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   To the extent that these two amendments seek to prescribe in the Act itself the time limit for the commencement of proceedings, we certainly sympathise with that idea. However, what we find unacceptable is that the limit should be not less than three months, only because this would entitle the Secretary of State to prescribe any limit of any length&#151;even years and even something outside the normal period prescribed by the statute of limitations for ordinary civil claims. We believe that the limit should be relatively short because of the difficulty of remembering the sequence of events in what would be an intensely personal dispute. I regret, therefore, that we would not support the amendment as it stands. However, if it were to come back in a different form at a later stage, with an upper limit of a reasonably short length, we would certainly be willing to reconsider the matter.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para6"></a>In the last group of amendments, the Minister mentioned that he would listen to his noble friends. Then he said, "or other friends". He did not say he would listen to Members of the Committee. I say that only because, as I said before, I have some diffidence in supporting in case it does some harm to what are clearly very good amendments, or could be very good amendments.

<A NAME="20321-41_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Indeed, I was so carried away with the warm and comradely spirits of the Committee that I regarded everybody in the room as friends. I should have said "Members of the Committee". I specifically referred to my real friends over here, in parliamentary terms, but I meant all Members of the Committee.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para7"></a>Perhaps I may deal with the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, and make absolutely clear from the outset that we regard these as constructive suggestions. If and in so far as there is a disagreement, it is not about the principle; it is simply about the drafting issues.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para8"></a>First, there will be a thorough consultation exercise before any regulations are made. Those people who will be consulted will, of course, include ACAS but I do not see any need for consultation with ACAS to be spelt out on the face of the Bill. The regulations will be concerned with the adjustment of time limits in relation to those jurisdictions listed in the Schedules 3 and 4. The aim is to ensure that the parties have a <P>


<a name="column_CWH312"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH312</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reasonable time to complete the statutory procedures before a complaint has to be made to an employment tribunal.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para9"></a>I can assure the noble Baroness and all Members of the Committee that the time limit for beginning proceedings in respect of a claim to which a statutory procedure applies will not be less than three months.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para10"></a>I would also draw the attention of Members of the Committee to a statement made in the Government's response to the consultation. It said that it is intended to extend the time limits for applying to a tribunal by three months where a claim has been submitted, or where procedures have been started but not completed, within the existing time limits for presenting claims. There will be further extensions of up to two months if both parties want this. All this was reiterated in committee in the other place.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para11"></a>The regulations will also make it clear, picking up the third point made by the noble Baroness, that it will be the tribunals which will exercise the discretion for extending time limits mentioned in subsection (2)(b) of this clause. I thoroughly endorse the point made by the noble Baroness that, of course, the tribunals are particularly well placed to exercise that discretion.
<P>

<a name="20321-41_para12"></a>The precise details of the regulations have yet to be worked out but I hope I have said enough to allay concerns of the noble Baroness and other Members of the Committee and that she will feel able to withdraw her amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-41_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   Before my noble and learned friend sits down, did I hear him to say that extensions beyond three months will only be allowed up to two months more?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-41_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I said that the time limit for beginning proceedings will be not less than three months. It is intended to extend the time limits for applying to a tribunal by three months. Where a claim has been submitted or where proceedings have started but have not been completed within the existing time limits, there will be further extensions of up to two months if both parties want this.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-41_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response. I am glad to learn that the principles in the amendment are accepted and that the intention is that this will all appear in regulation. I still believe that it will be very much better if we had something on the face of the Bill, because this has been the standpoint of myself and my noble friends throughout our discussions. However, I am grateful for what has been said. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-41_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   Before the noble Baroness sits down, what I am being told from behind me is that there can be a series of two months' extensions. So you can come back to the tribunal and in the tribunal's discretion it can extend further. That would be in its discretion even when one party is opposed&#151;but only by agreement.

<a name="20321-41_para17"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: This is a technical amendment to swap the order of Clauses 32 and 33. Following our amendments to Clause 33 in the other place, it is clear that the clause should now come before Clause 32. Clause 33 deals with presentation of complaints to tribunals and it makes sense for this to come before Clause 32, which is about consequential changes to time limits for making complaints to tribunals. Further, Clause 32 refers in a consequential way to Schedule 4 but it is Clause 33 that introduces that schedule. I hope that Members of the Committee will feel able to agree to the amendment. I beg to move.

I quite see the logic of it, but Clause 33 is Clause 33. It has a bad reputation that will stick with it no matter what number it is given. However, I understand him.

<a name="20321-42_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving this amendment, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 147A. Amendment No. 149ZA has been grouped with these two amendments.

<P>

<a name="20321-42_para2"></a>Amendment No. 146A is concerned with Clause 33&#151;I almost said, "The notorious Clause 33". Clause 33 applies to all those jurisdictions in Schedule 4 that we looked at and which caused a certain amount of <P>


<a name="column_CWH314"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH314</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>doubt in the minds of some Members of the Committee. In all those jurisdictions and all the cases of victimisation and the rest of it, Clause 33 says:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An employee shall not present a complaint to an employment tribunal under a jurisdiction if"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-42_para3"></a>
two conditions are satisfied. The first is that the matter concerns paragraphs (6) or (9) in Schedule 2; that is, setting out a grievance and sending a copy to the employer in writing or&#151;I apprehend when we come to look at the Bill again&#151;sending it or a copy, I hope, to the employer in writing.
<P>

<a name="20321-42_para4"></a>Amendment No. 146A would add a third condition. I will not rehearse again the many cases in which we think it quite unreasonable that even that step should be required of many workers&#151;it may be reasonable in some cases&#151;but to present it as an absolute rule and then say one will allow a few workers not to be caught by it in regulations, seems to us quite wrong.
<P>

<a name="20321-42_para5"></a>The general rule should be the addition of our third condition. We have said that the third condition&#151;and I quote from Amendment No. 147A&#151;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-42_para9"></a>
I interpose that that is a case of dismissal or threatened dismissal in connection with which the grievance has arisen&#151;
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"of the reasons why the lesser step of a warning or a suspension is not appropriate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-42_para10"></a><P>

<a name="20321-42_para11"></a>Everything that has been said by the Government in response to our request that the concept of investigation be built into Schedule 2&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Sharman, also moved amendments in the same respect&#151;is irrelevant to this amendment. The Government case previously was that the present law concerning the decision of cases in a tribunal still includes the requirement of an investigation by the employer, certainly where there has been a dismissal and in other cases of detriment as well. It might well be unreasonable of an employer to take disciplinary steps against an employee without proper investigation. It will go to reasonableness.
<P>

<a name="20321-42_para12"></a>Neither we nor the Law Society like the idea of prohibiting access to justice. The Law Society gave us a brief in which it said that Clause 33 really should be struck out of the Bill. It is of the opinion that, given the Government's premises, Clause 31 would suit it very well and would be enough and that Clause 33 is unnecessary. But given that the Government wish to introduce some prohibition on access to justice, at this stage&#151;I underline that&#151;of affairs, an employee could only, even on the Government's hypothesis, be reasonably excluded from the doors of the tribunal where, in face of a threatened or actual detriment or dismissal, about which he wishes to raise, or in connection with which he wishes to raise, his <P>


<a name="column_CWH315"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH315</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>grievance, where the employer has assured him that what has been done, or what is about to be done, has been done on the basis of proper investigation.
<P>

<a name="20321-42_para13"></a>I see the case, although I would want to look at it very carefully, but, where an employee has been given an assurance of that kind, I can understand that it is arguable to say, "This has all been looked at with great care, and the following are the things you have done that I do not like and that I am going to impose a detriment for". If they receive such an assurance, it is arguable that he should take a step in a statutory grievance procedure, perhaps, and the tribunal should say, "No, unless you do that, we will not hear you, because we have seen the assurance of the employer".
<P>

<a name="20321-42_para14"></a>Someone will raise a problem with that. It will be said, "Will they see the assurance from the employer?". First, they can see it if they put a little box on their new prescribed form under Clause 25. "Have you been assured by your employer that he has investigated the case&#151;yes or no?"
<P>

<a name="20321-42_para15"></a>Secondly, in another place, the Minister, my honourable friend Mr Johnson, said that the tribunal would know whether the employee was prohibited from presenting a case either from the ET1 form for the presentation or the communication of a complaint, or from the employer's response on ET3. In other words, the Minister in another place accepted that the tribunal would need to see some of the circumstances before it knew whether or not the employee was allowed to present a complaint, in the words of Clause 33. If the Minister tells me that that is not so, I can only ask him how on earth the employment tribunal is to know whether it is receiving a complaint which is prohibited from being presented.
<P>

<a name="20321-42_para16"></a>Of course my noble friend Lord McCarthy will want to ask many more questions about the form, because it is via the form that we suspect the Government will allow the tribunal to find out, by new questions on the form about whether he has taken certain steps or not. If it is going to do that, then it can add another question although, as the president of the Employment Tribunals Service has said, these forms are likely to get pretty complicated and become something of a nightmare if a bureaucratic hand adds questions to them.
<P>

<a name="20321-42_para17"></a>But this is an assurance that a worker who is to be prevented from having a day in the tribunal to enforce his rights is entitled to have. He is entitled to have at least the assurance that the case has been properly investigated. He is entitled to an assurance that he will not be given a small warning or a small suspension because the facts of the offence which he is alleged to have committed are those in the document or the communication which the employer has made available to him. Where reasonably practicable&#151;we have attempted to be more than reasonable in the words of the amendment&#151;he is entitled to be told the reasons why those lesser steps are not to be taken against him.
<P>

<a name="20321-42_para18"></a>The amendment is moved on the basis that the Government's hypothesis is right: that the Government need Clause 33&#151;which we dispute&#151;and <P>


<a name="column_CWH316"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH316</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that it is right to enforce against workers' generally, whatever the small number of exceptions. We have been told that the exceptions will be limited to a small number of cases. We object to the prohibition of access to tribunals. However, if those objections are to be overridden, workers must at least be confident that the Government do not intend to cut applications to tribunals by 40,000 cases by the imposition of unfair rules.
<P>

<a name="20321-42_para19"></a>The distrust, which is widespread, could be somewhat assuaged by the inclusion of a rule of this kind&#151;these are words which my noble and learned friend may wish to criticise&#151;setting out that a worker should be assured that a great deal has been done to ensure that he has a case to answer and should therefore go into procedure. It is a good trade union principle that, if there is a case to answer, one goes into procedure, but if a person does not have the assurance to know that there is a case to answer, he will feel hard done by and he will be right. I beg to move.

<A NAME="20321-42_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   This matter involves a degree of complication that is very difficult to follow. My noble friend is saying that we should accept the hypothesis&#151;which I do not&#151;that, if one is an employee, one must first write a letter before going to the tribunal. Let us add another condition that, before the employee can go to the tribunal, not only does he have to write a letter to his employer but his employer must, by one means or another, assure the employee that the grievance raised has been properly investigated. That is what the amendment states; that is how it was introduced. It concerns a level of obstruction which is hardly worth addressing. One ends up with the situation in which the employer, simply by saying that he has not investigated and by not giving the assurance sought by my noble friend, can prevent the employee ever going to the tribunal. That is plainly not what my noble friend intends. Therefore, perhaps he would explain how it works.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-42_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I am grateful to my noble and learned friend. I thought that I had explained, but my explanation was plainly inadequate. I shall read it. This is not about the assurance of the employer operating in the way he described; it operates in the following way. At present the clause states that the employee is prohibited from presenting a complaint to the tribunal unless the two conditions are satisfied. The first step relates to the grievance procedure, and he has not completed that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-43_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   He must send the letter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-43_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   He must complete&#151;I quote the clause,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the requirement in paragraph 6 or 9 of Schedule 2 has not been complied with".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-43_para0"></a>
Therefore, he should send a letter. He has not done that. We say that if he has not sent the letter, he is still allowed to go to the tribunal. That is what the amendment states. It is not quite what my noble and learned friend understood it to mean. He was quoting <P>


<a name="column_CWH317"></a>

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column CWH317</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the mis-type where I inserted the word "not" in the wrong place in my first draft, which he seems to have obtained. But it is not what is printed. He is not allowed to go to the tribunal where the necessary condition is satisfied. The necessary condition is satisfied if the employer has given him this most important assurance. He is entitled to know when he is stopped from going to the tribunal that the matter has been properly investigated. There is nothing complicated about that. It is very simple. I am baffled that someone with the experience and learning of my noble and learned friend should find this simple amendment complicated or difficult in any way. I shall read it again. It states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The necessary condition is satisfied"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-43_para1"></a>
that is to say, when he is prevented from going to the tribunal in these cases of dismissal, detriment and grievance&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"where ... the employer has given to the employee an assurance that he has conducted an appropriate investigation",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="20321-43_para2"></a>
and so on. That is not at all what my noble and learned friend said. I shall read Hansard with interest as I may have misheard him but it is not at all what I thought he said. This is not fiendishly complicated. It says to the employer, "If you want to join in the abolition of the 40,000 cases and you want to stop the employee going to a tribunal, then you assure your workers that you conduct proper investigations into your cases of detriment and dismissal". What is wrong with that?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-43_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   That is fine and very clearly put. The amendment says that you must give that assurance in relation to the letter that has been sent. But I accept what my noble friend says. All that we are saying in our procedure is that one has to write a letter raising the matter before. Presumably, it is not a grievance that has to be raised in writing. I am not quite sure how one identifies the grievance. In his amendment my noble friend has done it by reference to the letter at the first stage in the procedure. However, apparently we can ignore that now. It is just some unidentified grievance, saying that an assurance has to be given in relation to the case that a proper investigation has taken place. If, again, that is the proposal that he makes, again, it would appear that the employer can prevent the employee going to the tribunal, because what the employee wants is the ability to go to the tribunal. What the procedure involves is simply saying, before you do that, subject to the exceptions, you should write a letter.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-43_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   No. The amendment provides that you can go to the tribunal without the letter in the good old-fashioned way, unless the employer does something as well as you. What you have to do is write a letter; and what the employer has to do is to do what we are saying in Amendment No. 147A. It becomes, in a sense, a kind of parity. If the employer will not do it, he cannot stop you going; you go.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=3><P>
<A NAME="20321-43_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I see. The amendment therefore provides that, if the letter has not been sent, the employee can say, "I don't need to send the letter unless the employer gives the assurance that he has properly investigated the matter".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-43_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton:  </B>  Yes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-43_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Falconer of Thoroton: </B>   I understand now and I apologise. It was entirely my fault for not understanding until it was explained so clearly by my noble friend. With respect, that is an unnecessary degree of complication. I do not really think that my noble friends Lord McCarthy and Lord Wedderburn believe that it is an appropriate degree; and they are saying sotto voce that they do not believe it is an appropriate degree of complication. It is a sort of&#151; I am not quite sure what it is. We just have to address the question: are we right or are we wrong in requiring this letter in the first place? We think that we are, subject to those exceptions. I do not believe it really throws much light on the issue by this if, which we deny, you require this letter, there should be this procedure as well. It does not really advance the debate one jot.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-43_spnew7"></A><B> Lord McCarthy: </B>   At least it completes the debate properly at half-past seven. The noble and learned Lord has used every reason to reject our amendments except that we do not believe what we say. So now he has completed it, there is nothing left.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321-43_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Wedderburn of Charlton: </B>   I can assure my noble and learned friend that we believe every word that we say. I made it quite clear. I moved the amendment on the basis of the Government's own hypotheses. They want a letter to be sent. I want this to be even-handed. This amendment introduces an even-handedness. I feel as though I am in "My Fair Lady" and want to say, "By Jove, he's got it!". He has suddenly understood the effects of the amendment.
<P>

<a name="20321-43_para3"></a>My noble and learned friend now understands that an employer cannot stop an employee going to a tribunal. However, he can stop the employee going to a tribunal if he does not give the assurance, and so it is even-handed. It is not very complicated. He thinks if he introduces a degree of complication which is in the Bill, it baffles the lay mind. This would not. If the only objection to the proposal is that it is not to be an assurance in writing, I will happily by manuscript amend the amendment to include a written assurance rather than one that is not written. That puts an extra burden on the employer.
<P>

<a name="20321-43_para4"></a>I was very gentle in my burdens on the employer. It is just an assurance, and if that is what the noble and learned Lord objects to, I hope he will understand that we can bring it back on Report and move it as a written assurance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w01_wqn1"></A><B> Viscount Simon </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>If there is to be an announcement about the appointment and re-appointment of Surveillance Commissioners under Part III of the Police Act 1997.[HL3467]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   In accordance with Section 91 of the Police Act 1997, after consultation with the Scottish Ministers, the Prime Minister has agreed to appoint and re-appoint the following Surveillance Commissioners to assist Sir Andrew Leggatt, the Chief Surveillance Commissioner. There are three commissioners for England and Wales, two for Scotland and one for Northern Ireland. However, the remit of each commissioner covers the whole of the United Kingdom so that any commissioner can act in jurisdictions other than his own.
<P>

<a name="20321w01_para0"></a>The Prime Minister has appointed, from 1 November 2001, as a Commissioner the right honourable Lord Sutherland, who served as a judge of the Court of Session from 1985 to 2001, for a period of three years.
<P>

<a name="20321w01_para1"></a>He has also reappointed as commissioners:
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w01_spnew1"></A><B> Sir Charles McCullough </B>   who was appointed as Surveillance Commissioner in 1998 and is reappointed for a further three years from 1 November 2001. He served as a High Court judge of the Queen's Bench Division from 1981 to 1998.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w01_spnew2"></A><B> The right honourable Sir Michael Hutchison </B>   who was appointed as Surveillance Commissioner in 1998 and is reappointed for a further three years from 1 November 2001. He served as a Lord Justice of Appeal from 1995 to 1999.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>three years from 1 November 2001. He has been a judge of the Court of Session since 1997.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w01_spnew4"></A><B> The right honourable Sir John MacDermott </B>   who was appointed as Surveillance Commissioner in 1998 and is reappointed, 1 November 2001, until 1 October 2003.
<P>

<a name="20321w01_para2"></a>The commissioners are appointed under the provisions of Part III of the Police Act 1997. The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 extended the commissioners' remit. Since the authorisation of intrusive surveillance operations forms a key component of the Government's response to serious and organised crime, I attach considerable importance to these appointments and I am delighted that the commissioners have accepted their appointments. In conjunction with Sir Andrew Leggatt, their substantial judicial experience, particularly of the criminal justice system, will provide independent oversight of surveillance operations, which, although operationally important, must also be subject to stringent safeguards.

<P>
<UL>What advice has been given to civil servants on the conduct of government business during the forthcoming elections to local councils on 2 May.[HL3468]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   The Government have issued guidance to civil servants on the principles which they should observe in relation to the conduct of government business in the period before the forthcoming elections.
<P>

<a name="20321w01_para3"></a>The guidance stresses that civil servants should conduct themselves in accordance with the Civil Service Code and is based on the need to maintain the political impartiality of the Civil Service and the need to ensure that public resources are not used for party political purposes. The guidance will come into force on 11 April. Copies of the guidance have been placed in the Library of the House, and are also available from the Vote Office.

<P>
<UL>What assistance and financial funding they are currently providing, or intend to provide, to the appropriate authorities in Yugoslavia for the resettlement and assimilation of 450,000 refugees from Croatia and Bosnia, and 190,000 Serbs from Kosovo, who have fled from their original homes and wish to stay in their new locations in Yugoslavia.[HL3309]
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="20321w01_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Amos): </B>  The UK assists through its 19.6 per cent share of EC programmes.

<P>

David de Vinatea has been commuted and he is currently awaiting release. Our embassy in Lima is closely monitoring his case and we hope that release will be soon. The Foreign Office has consistently lobbied the Peruvian authorities concerning the issue of unlawful imprisonment. Since March 1998, we have contributed over &#163;140,000 to assist the work of the Peruvian Ad-Hoc Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Ombudsman in investigating the cases of those unjustly accused. On their recommendations, over 400 prisoners have been released to date.

But grant-in-aid is awarded to other non-public bodies involved in foreign policy work, including the British-Russia Centre, the British East-West Centre, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the British Association for Central and Eastern Europe and the Great Britain-China Centre. The FCO also pays for corporate membership of some foreign policy institutions (including "think tanks") and sponsors individual conferences and events in support of FCO objectives. As to the Royal Institute of International Affairs and the Foreign Policy Centre, I refer the noble Lord to Answers which my noble friend Lady Amos gave him on 18 March, Official Report, WA 117-18.

<A NAME="20321w02_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Greaves  </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether Postcomm's recent proposals for postal competition will threaten the provision of a universal postal service based on a standard United Kingdom-wide tariff; and, in the event that they affect the ability of Consignia to provide such a service while maintaining commercial viability, whether the shortfall will be met by government subsidy or an increase in postage rates.[HL3221]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  It is Postcomm's primary statutory duty to ensure the provision of a universal postal service at a tariff uniform throughout the UK.
<P>

<a name="20321w02_para0"></a>Postcomm currently requires Consignia plc, in the licence, to provide a universal postal service. The licence provides that any proposals by Consignia for an increase in the price of first and second-class mail needs approval by Postcomm.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w02_wqn2"></A><B> Lord Greaves </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w02_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Bach): </B>  The Government's initial assessment of the implications for UK personnel of the Khamisiyah demolitions was published in December 1999 in a Ministry of Defence paper entitled Review of Events concerning 32 Field Hospital and the Release of Nerve Agent Arising From US Demolition of Iraqi Munitions at the Khamisiyah Depot In March 1991. The paper is available in the Library of the House and on the Internet at http://www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/info/khamisiyah.htm.  The paper's main conclusion was that the possible level of nerve agent exposure would have no detectable effect on human health, either in the short or long term.
<P>

<a name="20321w02_para2"></a>The statistics recently released by the US Veterans Benefits Administration are believed to be based on remodelling of the theoretical plume of nerve agent which may have been released by the demolitions carried out subsequently. The MoD is seeking to establish from the US authorities the full scientific basis for the remodelling. Once this has been obtained and analysed, I will write to the noble Lord and place a copy of my letter in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w02_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bach:  </B>  Funds to meet the additional cost of overseas commitments are sought at Main Estimates, once a taut and realistic estimate has been calculated. In 2001&#150;02 they were shown under Request for Resources 2, Conflict Prevention. Additional funds were provided at Spring Supplementary Estimates 2001&#150;02 to meet in full the additional costs which the Ministry of Defence had incurred on operations overseas. A similar process will be followed for 2002&#150;03. Separate work is in progress on counter terrorism. Once realistic Estimates for this requirement have been determined, additional funding, where necessary, will be sought.

<A NAME="20321w03_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone:  </B>  The Heritage Lottery Fund supports applications for the refurbishment and restoration of historic urban parks. The number of parks that received funding in the past three years were: 1999&#151;37; 2000&#151;31; 2001&#151;34. While all were of heritage importance, the information available does not allow their exact designation as Victorian parks.
A complete list follows, broken down by year, which shows their location.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w04_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath): </B>  It is generally accepted by United Kingdom clinicians that recombinant and plasma derived clotting factors are equally effective in treating clotting disorders. In guidelines produced by the United Kingdom Haemophilia Doctors Organisations, comparisons between the two types of product revolve around their relative safety, bearing in mind that no medicinal product can ever be completely free from risk. An advantage of recombinant products, where they are entirely free of human albumin, is that they eliminate the risk from blood borne viruses and the theoretical risk from vCJD. However, plasma derived clotting factors are tightly regulated by European and United States authorities to minimise the risk of viral transmission. This is achieved by the screening of donor blood and the anti-viral measures taken during manufacture. By ceasing to use UK plasma in the manufacture of blood products, the Government have already taken steps to reduce the unknown risks from vCJD.
<P>

<a name="20321w04_para8"></a>The Government will make a full statement once we have completed our consideration of the Haemophilia Society's call to extend the provision of recombinant clotting factors to all haemophilia patients in England.

<B>21 Mar 2002 : Column WA176</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<UL>How many children in the care of West Sussex Social Services have gone missing since 1965;
whether any have been traced; whether other social service departments have lost children in recent years; and whether they will ask the Social Services Inspectorate to report, with a view to publishing their findings.[HL3233]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="20321w04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:  </B>  From April 2001 all local authorities in England have been required to include data about the numbers of children in their care who go missing for 24 hours or more in their annual statistical return to the Department of Health. Prior to 2001, councils had to return data on numbers of children who were missing for more than seven days. Data concerning this issue were not available in 1965.
<P>

<a name="20321w04_para9"></a>West Sussex Council has provided the following information to the department about young people in its care who have gone missing without trace since 1995. These were predominantly asylum-seeking young women from West Africa. In 1995 one person went missing; this figure was two in 1996; seven in 1997; 11 in 1998; 23 in 1999 and 21 in 2000. By 2001, the council had developed procedures to identify and support young people from abroad who were particularly vulnerable; by January 2002 six had gone missing. While other young people in the council's care do go missing temporarily from their placements, it would be extremely rare for a young person to go missing without trace.
<P>

<a name="20321w04_para10"></a>Research about young runaways sponsored by the department and by voluntary organisations, suggests that looked after children missing from residential or foster care are more likely to run away than those living at home. The majority of these young people are found within 48 hours. According to the Department of Health's statistical return of the young people missing from their care placements during the course of 1999&#150;2000 approximately 140 were absent for over six months.
<P>

<a name="20321w04_para11"></a>The Department of Health is working closely with the Social Exclusion Unit and is preparing guidance for local authorities, the police, health agencies and the voluntary sector concerning good practice and procedures on children missing from care.
