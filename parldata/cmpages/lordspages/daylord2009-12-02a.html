I am pleased to tell the noble and right reverend Lord that the national dementia strategy makes it clear that information should be available on what options exist for planning ahead for those with dementia to ensure that their wishes are considered. In implementing the strategy, the Government will continue to work with stakeholders to ensure that everyone working with people with dementia is supported in making ethical decisions.</p>

Would she accept that the vast majority of the 700,000 people suffering from dementia are cared for at home and that therefore carers at home should be treated as genuine care partners, together with the professional team? They should be trusted and given access to information. What would her Government do to promote that?</p>

In the consultation that Nuffield carried out, many carers expressed concern that they were treated with suspicion by professionals and felt that they needed to earn trust, despite the fact that they were providing most of the daily care. We totally agree that carers should be treated as care partners by professionals. The national dementia strategy makes it clear that family carers are

Those decisions may go from asking themselves, "Can I lock him in while I go to do the shopping?" to deciding whose needs are paramount when residential care is being considered. Will the Government help carers with those kinds of ethical decisions?</p>

The person who is caring for the person with dementia is best placed to take those decisions, but they need support in that. Proper education and training for professionals and carers have been identified as something that we need to address; we need to look at where there are gaps, which indeed there are, and we need to make sure that this is one of our priorities.</p>

None of us knows who is going to develop dementia; it can occur in anyone. In particular, people should be able to make decisions about their own future while they are still able to do so, or even decisions as to whether they would want to take part in a research project if they develop dementia.</p>

The first is the need to think ahead and to encourage people to appoint a welfare attorney, if they can, who will support them when the time comes that they no longer have the capacity to do so themselves. Secondly, the ethical issue that the report points to about research is how someone who lacks capacity can take a decision to participate in the dementia research that you might wish to undertake. It is important that those issues are discussed while the person still has capacity and that the decisions are recorded, so that the people who have the care of that person know what their wishes would have been.</p>

Following the Minister's response to the last question, does she agree that the real issue is to devote more resources to research into dementia as a whole and particularly, as the Nuffield report suggests, into the social research, which covers all the aspects of care and people's experience when they suffer with this disease? In a sense, that is one thing that is sadly lacking in present research resources.</p>

We are currently commissioning research into best-interest decisions taken under the Mental Capacity Act. As part of the strategy, my honourable friend the Minister has, as my noble friend will know, established a ministerial group of which the Alzheimer's Society is part, following on from the dementia research summit which pointed to many of those priorities.</p>

In Holland, for example, they do things such as making their own beds, instead of being told that it is unsafe, which is the British practice.</p>

The report points to, for example, filling in a pond in a care home, which had given enormous pleasure to people, because of the risk. The noble Baroness is absolutely right. Overall, the Government are taking this report very seriously indeed. It has messages not just for us and how we deal with the dementia strategy but for all professionals and people who are dealing with people with dementia.</p>

It is a very important way in which individuals can take control of their energy usage and supply. How will the Government make sure that the cost of these meters, which will now be rolled out across the nation over the next 10 years, is not completely charged over that time to consumers, given the considerable saving that energy companies will make in the absence of reading meters and many other functions?</p>

The cost will fall to the energy companies. We would expect some of that then to follow through in prices to customers. We project that the net gain for customers will be about £28 per household from 2020. We wish to ensure that there is a competitive market with proper regulation so that customers are given a fair deal.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, must be very pleased today that the Government read his Question a week ago and came up with the Answer for him just in time. However, it is disappointing. Again, here we go: hesitation, hesitation and another delay. Does the Minister agree that families sorely need control over their escalating fuel bills and sticking to the same old slow timetable for rollout by 2020 will leave the United Kingdom and consumers lagging behind again?</p>

This is the first country to decide to have smart meters for all domestic households. The timing is entirely consistent with what we discussed when the Energy Act went through last year. The reason for doing it over this period is to do with cost. If we went for a quicker timetable, it would cost much more money, which would have an impact on consumers. It is a reflection that the party opposite just cannot do its economic sums.</p>

I have plans in hand to deal with issues such as trade and industry, the relationship with DfID and, I hope, with the border authority as well, so I am making a serious effort to address some of the concerns that have been raised.</p>

Does she also note that the group in Trinidad decided to invite Rwanda into the Commonwealth? It is probably a good idea-particularly since I gather that they have taken up cricket in Rwanda-but was either House of Parliament consulted before it became the British Government's policy to back that membership?</p>

It appears in the communiqué and there was a very firm belief, as has been in the case in the past-for example, with Mozambique-that it is a way of ensuring that you draw into the Commonwealth those countries that can benefit from the relationship that we have on human rights, democracy and other issues. I sensed a real consensus around the Commonwealth meeting of Ministers on the application and the success of Rwanda in joining.</p>

During my visit, I went on board HMS "Iron Duke", a ship working in the Caribbean mostly on disaster issues, which has developed a very important and significant counternarcotics role in the region. The collaboration and co-operation are good, but we concede that there are huge concerns since we know that 30 per cent of the cocaine found on the streets of the United Kingdom is transhipped through the Caribbean.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_742"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 742</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_1"></a><a name="09120238000064"></a>I share my noble friend's concern that there is precious little evidence that those at the top of our banks appreciate the concern about those extraordinary levels of income. I would estimate that at least 5,000 people working in the banking industry in the UK will, if nothing is done, receive remuneration in excess of £1 million this year. The real responsibility must lie with the shareholders. Accordingly, I have written to the NAPF, the CBI and the TUC, urging them to use their influence to persuade trustees to ask their fund managers: "What are you doing to stop these unreasonable and unjustifiable levels of remuneration?".</p>

Will he refer to his colleagues in the Treasury the fact that there is a widespread view that naming bankers and what they earn is an essential part of bringing transparency to the industry? Would that not play a small part in returning some level of trust to an industry whose name is still in the mud?</p>

It is far more important to understand the architecture of remuneration within banks and how that is linked to performance and risk management. In early August, I suggested that David Walker needed to push the envelope a little further in a number of areas and suggested that he consider the issue of identifying people by name. He considered it, but he did not think it would add a great deal, and I am minded to conclude that he was correct. As I said, it would involve naming more than 5,000 people-all of whom, of course, would qualify for mansion taxes.</p>

Surely one of the problems of relying on shareholders more is that the individual small shareholder-a shareholder who has perhaps 1,000 shares and goes to an AGM-has no chance of making his ideas move forward against the pension funds which own much the largest quantities of shares and which often, frankly, do not wish to rock the boat.</p>

From my own perspective, private shareholders are often the most effective of all shareholders because of their ability to stand up at shareholder meetings and occasionally to prick the pomposity of the directors by asking questions in the open. The institutions often do not do that. However, the power of the vote lies with the institutions and they must take action. They must take action now because although they vote on the remuneration committee report, they do so after the act of payment. The decisions about bonuses will be made over the next six to eight weeks and it is important that our major institutions engage now with the companies and say: "We will not support grotesque payments. If you persist in paying them, we will exercise our votes to remove from the board the people who authorise them".</p>

I find it quite extraordinary that Mr George Osborne, in his speech on 26 October, suggested that the pressure needed to be borne down on retail banks. The vast majority of people working in retail banks-in branches, call centres and service centres-only dream of these rewards. The real problems lie in the investment banks. But perhaps Mr Osborne is again evidencing his commitment to transfer wealth from the poor to the rich.</p>

However, one needs to put David Walker's definition of £1 million a year as the starting point for disclosure in the context of national average earnings being just over £20,000. I think that that shows the extent to which the space that those in banking live in is completely different from the world that the rest of us occupy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_2"></a><a name="09120238000075"></a>The <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper set out our plans to upgrade the UK's legal and physical digital landscape. Digital Britain includes plans, which are already being implemented, to ensure the availability of broadband to practically every home and business in the UK.</p>

<a name="91202-0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_3"></a><a name="09120238000076"></a>The Bill is an important part of the wider Digital Britain agenda. It is a broad legislative agenda that stretches from new rules that for the first time make it an offence to sell 12-rated video games to children under 12, to a strong new commitment to public service news. I do not aim to be comprehensive or to touch on every aspect of the Bill today. I will focus on three key things: where the Bill takes us in modernising our digital infrastructure, in particular charging Ofcom to create new capacity for radio and mobile telephony and internet services; the measures that we propose here to update our copyright regime for a world in which we use digital content in radically new ways; and, finally, how we will protect and strengthen public service content both nationally and locally.</p>

<a name="91202-0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_4"></a><a name="09120238000077"></a>I stress that the Bill and the wider Digital Britain agenda are about adapting our infrastructure, our copyright laws, our support for public service media content and the regulator that oversees all these things to quite revolutionary technological change. At the heart of what we are discussing today are the British creative and communications industries, which produce £125 billion a year and employ just fewer than 2 million people. Vital as they are, the Bill is not just about the communications and the creative industries; it is about the wider legal frameworks and infrastructure of an entire knowledge economy. It is therefore about future readiness in the economy, competitiveness and growth.</p>

<a name="91202-0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_5"></a><a name="09120238000078"></a>A digital economy, just like any other economy, is built on infrastructure. We think of infrastructure as tying two places together across distance, but the digital economy collapses distance into nothing. Its infrastructure is more about spectrum, speed and capacity than geography, but, just like any infrastructure, it has to be in place for innovation and growth to happen. For that reason, the Bill creates a new obligation on Ofcom to report every two years on the state of Britain's communications infrastructure. It also requires that Ofcom adapts its principal focus on promoting competition and the interests of citizens to the need to promote investment in infrastructure in the UK.</p>

The Bill makes changes that will support the recommendations of the independent spectrum broker that we will implement to ensure that we have the mobile network capacity that we need. This will include arrangements for applying new pricing arrangements to already auctioned spectrum to make sure that it is used as efficiently as possible. We have also set out our vision for the future of digital radio, which will see the

<a name="91202-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="09120238000080"></a>The Bill also represents a major evolution in our copyright system in Britain. That shift is a reflection of the unique challenge that digital content poses to industries whose survival depends on protecting content and rewarding creativity. I recognise that this House is probably the one place in Britain where peer-to-peer file-sharing is associated more with passing notes in the Lords' tea room than with piracy, but, joking aside, this is a major problem for Britain's creative industries. Our copyright regime is 300 years old this year, which means that our copyright infringement problem is also 300 years old. But the dimensions of the problem have been exponentially changed by digital technology. The ease with which data can be transferred and shared is the most powerful transformative force in the digital economy. For creative businesses, it is also its Achilles heel.</p>

<a name="91202-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="09120238000081"></a>An effective copyright strategy for the digital economy has to do a number of things. It has to make a compelling case, an educative one, to an internet-literate generation that protecting the creativity it enjoys means rewarding<I></I>creativity, and that means protecting copyright. But it also means recognising that copyright infringement is the market's way of telling us that we need to develop new business models that make digital content legally available at reasonable prices. This is a market challenge for content providers who need to reconnect with their customers.</p>

<a name="91202-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="09120238000082"></a>But this does not replace the need for government and for the law to protect the rights of content holders, so we are creating two new obligations on internet service providers: first, to send letters to their subscribers linked with an alleged online copyright infringement; and secondly, to record the number of these notifications with which each subscriber is associated, and to provide anonymised lists to copyright owners on request. This allows copyright owners to apply for a court order to get access to the names and addresses of serious infringers and target legal action. If, following a period of assessment, such warnings are not deterrent enough, we are also proposing a reserve power for the Secretary of State by secondary legislation to direct ISPs to impose technical measures and for Ofcom to consult on a code to regulate this obligation. The measures could include temporary account suspension and would be targeted only against the most serious infringers. These tougher technical measures will be exceptional and a last resort. Our central goal is for users to reconnect to a legitimate market for this content, not disconnect from it. Infringers would have clear and ample warning of the risks they appear to be taking and will have been advised clearly on how to access material legally. There would be a clear and independent route of appeal, including to a first tier tribunal.</p>

<a name="91202-0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="09120238000083"></a>I realise that people expect these measures to be proportionate-and they are. ISPs already have and use the power to disconnect in appropriate circumstances. Critics have suggested that this policy focuses on coercion, but that is quite wrong. We are clear that there is a primary role for education about the value of copyright, and a very clear obligation on the creative industries to get their act together and build business models that  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_746"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 746</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>provide access to content at a cost that makes the risk of breaking the law an unattractive option. But I do not accept that the difficulty of defending creative content from piracy in a digital economy should become an argument for not even trying. There will be no creative economy if we cannot preserve the value of creativity by protecting what it produces.</p>

<a name="91202-0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="09120238000084"></a>To reflect the ever-changing nature of this market, the Bill includes a power to amend the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 in future, to reflect fast-changing technology. Such a power should not and will not be used lightly. That is why any use of the power would require full public consultation followed by approval of both Houses of Parliament, and it is why we have provided explicitly that the power may not be used to create or modify criminal offences.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="09120238000085"></a>Finally, I want to point to the strong defence in this Bill of the principle and practice of support for public service content in broadcasting, both nationally and locally. The provision of high quality UK content-and news in particular-is the clear preference of the public. It reflects the fact-not universally acknowledged, I grant you-that a purely free market for media simply will not produce or preserve the plurality, diversity and impartiality of local news content that people demand. Keeping this function of our media strong means recognising that market pressures and structural changes are putting pressure on commercially provided news in the nations, regionally and locally. Some element of public support is needed if this provision is to be preserved.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="09120238000086"></a>The Bill sets out a revised remit for Channel 4. This refreshed remit underlines the Government's clear and continuing commitment to Channel 4 and to public service broadcasting more generally. But it also makes clear what the Government expect from public service broadcasters-that they help advance the development of a well informed, well educated and socially cohesive society. As an additional way of doing this, the Bill also creates the power in Ofcom to support independently funded news consortia to provide regional and local news services. The Government have announced their preference to maintain in the next broadcast licence fee settlement the existing top-up element and to use it to fund the new consortia. However, the multi-year funding settlement with the BBC is crucial to the BBC's independence, so we do not intend to make a decision on this until nearer the 2013 rollout date.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="09120238000087"></a>There are serious implications in this work for Ofcom. The Bill creates an adapted remit for Ofcom in three important ways. It requires Ofcom to balance its primary focus on consumers and competition with a new additional focus on ensuring investment in the long-term strength of Britain's communication infrastructure. It also requires Ofcom to take a new forward role in ensuring that the British media market produces the right mix of impartial national and local news. This expanded role is critical and must be well defined and defended. It requires Ofcom to take a new role in shaping our response to online copyright infringement.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="09120238000088"></a>There are some in the commercial sector who believe that the future of British media would be served by cutting back the role of the media regulator. They take  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_747"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 747</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>this view because they want to commandeer more space and income for themselves and because they want to maintain their iron grip on pay-tv-a market in which many viewers feel they are paying more than they should for their movies and their sport. They also want to erode the commitment to impartiality-in other words, to fill British airwaves with more Fox-style news. They believe that profit alone should drive the gathering and circulation of news rather than allowing a role for what they call "state-sponsored journalism". The Government and this Bill reject this world view, and I hope that the whole House, including the Conservatives, will make it clear today that they think likewise, and that notably they will support Ofcom's efforts to ensure that consumers are getting a fair deal in the pay-tv market.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="09120238000089"></a>Ofcom represents an important means of securing media standards, strong public service content and investment in the future infrastructure of the digital economy. In my view, Ofcom should be strengthened, not emasculated as some Conservative spokesmen have suggested.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="09120238000090"></a>Although this Bill is broad in the scope of issues on which it touches, every measure has a simple but powerful objective: to equip this country to get the very best out of the digital economy. I look forward to hearing the views of noble Lords today and to engaging with them in Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"></a><a name="09120238000208"></a>"Ah, there's a face from the past".</p>

<p><a name="09120238000203"></a>So my first complaint about the Bill is that it does nothing to curb the excessive salaries paid to BBC commentators.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="09120238000095"></a>In introducing the Bill, the Secretary of State wisely left to one side some of the rhetoric he uses outside this House, particularly the charge that this party has entered into some kind of pact with Mr Murdoch and News International. Given that his old boss travelled half way round the world to gain Murdoch's support, that seems a rather fanciful criticism. Yet it is useful to recall this because in the Bill there are a number of  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_748"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 748</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>commercial interests at stake. The House will need to be precise in defining what is the public interest. That is the acid test.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="09120238000096"></a>This is a major Bill, dealing with a wide variety of issues from how you strengthen the communications infrastructure, on which the noble Lord dwelt, to digital security and public service broadcasting. In principle, I agree with much of it. However, the Bill is also behind time. In their <I>Creative Britain</I> paper, the Government committed to having legislation in place on illegal file-sharing by April 2009. That was not an aspiration; it was, in their words, a commitment. Self-evidently, the Government have fallen behind on that timetable. An election looms and the position is made no easier by the lack of detail in many of the clauses of the Bill. We should certainly make all speed with it, but not at the price of letting through bad legislation. That would not be carrying out our duty.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="09120238000097"></a>I will deal, briefly, with three aspects of this Bill. First, and most contentious, is illegal file-sharing. The United Kingdom has a real interest in seeing the creative industries develop and prosper. Films, music, broadcasting, publishing and video games already make an enormous contribution to the economy. The exact scale of that contribution depends on definition, but the Government estimate that the sector contributes some £60 billion per year to the British economy and that the creative sector has grown at twice the rate of the economy generally. To put it in more manageable terms, the music industry estimates that they account for more than 100,000 jobs. The film industry employs an estimated 35,000 to 40,000. Broadcasting employs another 50,000. Those jobs are not just actors, writers and directors; they are the scene-makers, the plasterers who work at Pinewood, the skilled animators who have produced everything from <I>Wallace and Gromit</I> to <I>Fantastic Mr Fox</I> and the skilled engineers who work in the post-production studios. It is not just artistic talent that is employed in these industries. There is a wide range of technical skills and skills at the highest level. In other words, these are serious industries making a serious contribution to the United Kingdom economy.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="09120238000098"></a>These industries also depend on innovation, new ideas and the willingness to back those new ideas with investment and with risk capital. Most films that are made never get shown in the cinema. Many films make a loss for the investors who have backed them. But the incentive always is that those who have created and financed the content should have the opportunity of reward for their initiative. They back their judgment. "Slumdog Millionaire" is a prime example of that. That is why illegal file-sharing piracy is such a threat to the creative industries. It means that legitimate business aims are undermined. If you have invested heavily in a film only to find that this is being distributed free on the internet, clearly your whole business plan is put at risk.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="09120238000099"></a>The Select Committee on Communications, which I chair, has been taking evidence from the film industry. One piece of evidence which sticks in my mind was from James Clayton, the chief executive of Ingenious Investments. He said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"></a><a name="09120238000209"></a>"One of the films we co-financed recently was 'Wolverine', a spin-off of the 'X Men' series, released at the start of May. Shortly before release in April, a partially completed version of  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_749"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 749</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the film found its way onto the web. It was downloaded four million times and Fox, who are our partners on the film, estimate that it probably knocked $20 million to $30 million off the box office".</p>

<p><a name="09120238000204"></a>That is the kind of challenge that such producers face.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="09120238000100"></a>The internet has achieved many good things, but it is equally clear that it has made that kind of abuse possible. It is clear that public interest heavily argues for action to be taken to prevent such abuse taking place. I understand that there are other views. We have all been inundated with advice on this matter. If you go to a recent BBC blog, you will see that three pages of what was intended as an objective discussion of the position was followed by 23 pages of comment, mostly from people who were passionately opposed to action being taken. The argument is that the Bill is illiberal, that file-sharers are those who spend most in the legitimate commercial market and that the industries would help themselves by making more material available legally and legitimately, which is an important argument to which I shall come in a moment.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="09120238000101"></a>Against that, as far as the music industry is concerned, the British Recorded Music Industry says,</p>
<ul><a name="09120238000211"></a>"that online copyright infringement seriously threatens the sector ... record companies stand to forgo something like £200m in lost sales due to infringement in 2009".</ul>
<p><a name="09120238000205"></a>Many of the figures who gave evidence to the Select Committee on Communications also warned very much of the dangers. Tim Bevan, the head of Working Title Films and the chairman of the UK Film Council, made very much the same point. David Kosse, the president of Universal Pictures International, said:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4"></a><a name="09120238000210"></a>"We would perceive piracy as the number one threat to the industry for everyone-studios, independents, everyone around the world".</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="09120238000102"></a>It seems to me that that is the case, and that it is not just films. It can be books and video games, and Premier League football, which is free-to-air in China and then transmitted here. Too often, what we are talking about is theft and a kind of theft which can have a devastating effect on industries where Britain is a leader and where the challenge is to develop more. We are also talking about organisations transmitting illegally and getting advertising revenue as their reward. We would be mad not to take some action in this respect.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="09120238000103"></a>Obviously, the crucial question is how we do that. I think that the step-by-step approach set out in the Bill is correct. We will have to examine the implications in Committee and seek to obtain more detail at times, as the British Library has argued. My support is also subject to two qualifications. The industries must take action of their own to make their products accessible, legitimately and legally. What the music industry has now done, perhaps belatedly, is encouraging. Today there are now 35 legal music services available in the UK.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="09120238000104"></a>My other qualification has to do with camcorder crime. Here, there is no sensible argument of justification. It simply means a small team going to one of the first performances of a film, recording it and then putting it on the net. Specific legislation is enacted in a number of other European countries but here the Government's position is that we must wait to see whether the Fraud Act covers it. A test case is imminent, we are told. We  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_750"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 750</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>will have to see the outcome, but if it is not covered then I think that there will be a very strong case for specific legislation.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="09120238000105"></a>The second area, to which I turn briefly, is public service broadcasting. I declare an interest as a lifetime member of the NUJ and a past chairman of two regional newspaper companies. No one should be in any doubt about the crisis we face in regional news. ITV has been quite frank. It cannot afford to produce regional news programmes-in spite of the big audiences it attracts-and it intends to withdraw them. As it stands at the moment, we face the prospect of a return to the 1950s, with the BBC having a monopoly of regional television news. I say return to the 1950s but it is actually worse than that. At that time there was a thriving regional press. There were strong morning regional papers as well as big circulation evening papers. There has been a steady decline since then and the position has markedly worsened. Competition from the internet for advertising, particularly houses and jobs, has hit the regional press, as too has the financial crisis of the past few years. The result is that the whole industry is fighting for its future.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="09120238000106"></a>Faced with that position, the Communications Select Committee proposed a reduction in controls on newspapers taking a stake in regional television and also contestable funding in which a news consortium could bid for public funding. Ofcom shared its view. I would not have financed digital switch-over in the way it has been financed. I would have preferred it to be, and I think it would more properly have been, social security spending, but that advice was ignored. Licence fee money has been used. There is an estimated £130 million a year underspend. That is one option for the public funds that would be required without going back to the taxpayer, but it is not the only one. It would be possible, for example, in the longer term to use the money the Government are going to get from the sale of analogue spectrum-there will be very real value to them in that in spite of switch-over.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="09120238000107"></a>We will have to look very carefully at this in Committee, but on the principle of public support, there is nothing new. Broadcasters such as ITV have received an implied subsidy from the analogue system from which we are moving. Competition was limited; the financial benefit was undoubted. As for the BBC, which opposed the use of licence fee money in this way, in my view the public interest requires a more generous response from it. I do not want to see a BBC regional monopoly.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="09120238000108"></a>My third area is the proposals affecting Channel 4 and ITV. I welcome the abandonment of the Government's plan for putting Channel 4 and BBC Worldwide together in a new company. I never thought that made sense and it was a piece of institutional engineering that was not going to work. I hope that instead there can be a more meaningful partnership between the two companies. I also welcome the fact that Channel 4 has been given an explicit duty concerning film. I welcome the liberalisation of controls on ITV. I make one point about this. The significant feature of the changes proposed for ITV and Channel 4, covering Clauses 21 to 28 of the Bill, is that they have been proposed only a few years after the Communications Act 2003. The Act is being amended to bring it up to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="09120238000109"></a>Changes are much more difficult to make with the BBC. The BBC is controlled by royal charter. It sounds very grand, but actually it means that a deal is done between the Government and the chairman of the BBC. There is no vote in Parliament and the charter, as the Minister said, lasts for 10 years. The implication is basically this. Most people now agree that the corporate governance arrangements for the BBC are a mess. There is no chairman and there is a fatally divided structure between the main organisations in the BBC Trust. It is not only I and my committee who have said that; Mr Bradshaw, the Secretary of State, makes entirely the same point. However, because it has a royal charter, we cannot do what we can do with ITV and Channel 4.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="09120238000110"></a>Technological change is taking place in a time of severe economic turbulence. Broadcasters are having to adapt rapidly and policy makers are having to be flexible. Against that background, an agreement setting down BBC policy 10 years in advance seems to be wildly out of date.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="09120238000111"></a>In general, I welcome the Bill. My criticism is that too much is left to regulation; my concern is that some fundamental issues about the media and communications, especially with regard to the BBC, have not been tackled; and my warning would be that if we want efficient and modern industries in the new digital age, after the election these issues will need to be tackled by the incoming Government with new legislation.</p>

However, this Bill is the exception to those criticisms, as from all sides of the House we welcome it and hope that in its appropriately amended form, after it has been subjected to the scrutiny that your Lordships always give, it will get passed through another place and become law before the election. That is the view of my party and, from listening to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, also of the Conservative Opposition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="09120238000113"></a>The Minister was right in using this opportunity to put on record the importance of the creative industries. Statistics are always difficult in this field but, if we take the film industry, radio and television, the music industry, book publishing, computer software and video games, let alone the explosive growth in the mechanisms to deliver the software to people's homes, the creative industry probably represents not far off 10 per cent of British GDP. So when we debate these issues, we are talking not of minority industries but about industries that already represent a significant part of British industry and are likely to be the fastest growing element of British GDP, as public sector expenditure shrinks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="09120238000114"></a>We on these Benches give a gentle welcome to this Bill, which has had a long gestation period. It is very nice to see the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Barnes, in his place for this debate. During his period as-I shall not use the expression of my noble friend Lord  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_752"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 752</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>McNally-a GOAT, we had several debates in your Lordships' House on the paper that has ultimately resulted in the Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, made a valid point in asking why it has taken so long to get to this position. He had some implicit and explicit criticism of the Government, which I share. We could apply some element of blame to the creative industries themselves. Although they have pressed for a considerable length of time for a lot of these provisions to be enacted, when they could have reached agreement and made it easier for the Government they have taken some time to do so. Even now, we may find it necessary for Ofcom to impose a code on the online infringement of copyright, because the industry will not be able to come up with its own code to be franked by Ofcom as the Bill requires.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="09120238000115"></a>It is particularly unfortunate that the code on the online infringement of copyright to which the Minister referred has not appeared in any form in draft that we could consider when looking at the Bill. I know that colleagues on all sides of the House have significant reservations on the human rights issues in relation to potential infringement. It would be easier for those concerns to be dealt with if we had a draft code to deal with the mechanisms under which penalties would be applied to individuals. We are clearly not going to have that code in draft, so we will have to do the best we can as the Bill proceeds.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="09120238000116"></a>I shall deal primarily with the second part of the Bill on the online infringement of copyright. Other issues will be taken up by my noble friends Lady Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury and Lord Clement-Jones. However, we will support the first part of the Bill, under which obligations are imposed on Ofcom to promote appropriate levels of investment in electronic communication networks and also to promote appropriate levels of investment in public service media content. We believe it is the right thing to do.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="09120238000117"></a>When we get to Committee, however, we would like to revisit the role of the National Audit Office in the scrutiny of public service content providers for the purposes, as the Bill says, of ensuring efficiency. Those of us with long memories will remember that my noble friend Lord Sharman, right at the beginning of the debate on the BBC's corporate governance, raised the involvement of the National Audit Office as an auditor of the BBC. His proposals were resisted. I sometimes wonder whether the resistance in involving the National Audit Office really goes to the desire of the BBC particularly to prevent the public disclosure of the talent salaries, which is a matter of significant public interest, almost on the same level as bankers' salaries, but we shall see. We will return to that when the Bill comes to Committee.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="09120238000118"></a>The major issue, and in our view likely to be one of controversy, is the online infringement of copyright. It is clearly a major problem. Many people suggest that they know the answer to the numbers and it is obviously very difficult to say how much online copyright infringement actually goes on in the UK, but the general suggestion is that about 6.5 million people-if you can have "about" 6.5 million people-in the United Kingdom share copyrighted files regularly. That is about 10 per cent of the UK population. It is generally  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_753"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 753</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>thought that 95 per cent of music downloads in the UK are illegal, and it is suggested that up to 25 per cent of the world's online television piracy takes place in the United Kingdom. In 2007, an estimated 78 million illegal downloads and streams of films took place in the UK. We may dispute the statistics, although I understand that Mr Bradshaw does not, and we may all take them with a pinch of salt. Nevertheless, I think there will be common ground that this is a major issue. In the impact assessment on the Bill, it is suggested that if a reduction of 55 per cent in illegal downloading took place as a result of the measures to be introduced, there would be an annual revenue increase to the creative industries of about £200 million per annum, so this would be a very significant step.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="09120238000119"></a>Which business sectors are affected by these proposals to ban or restrict illegal file-sharing? First, there are obviously the internet service providers and the mobile network operators. Six of the internet service providers represent over 90 per cent of the market, but the mobile network operators are beginning to become more significant. Secondly, we have the creative content industries where there are rights holders-primarily in films, TV, music, video games and software. Then we have some element of the book publishing industry; the introduction of structures such as Kindle obviously gives the opportunity for more significant illegal downloading.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="09120238000120"></a>In broad terms, I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, in that we support the provisions of this Bill. As always, however, the devil will lie in the detail and from these Benches we shall be applying three principles in looking at these provisions. First, we accept the point that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, made; to use copyrighted material without the appropriate payment is actually theft, and we have no sympathy for the suggestion coming from certain quarters that all information on the internet should be free, irrespective of the copyright position. Although many 18 year-olds-or even 17 year-olds-would take that position, we do not think that that is the correct position to take.</p>

<a name="91202-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="09120238000121"></a>That leads me onto the next test. Again, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, mentioned this-it might have been the Minister-but we think that education in this area is very important. There is a whole universe of people out there who genuinely believe that everything on the internet is free. They do not realise that they are in breach of copyright when they download music or a film, so the industry and the Government need to work together to ensure that there is proper education on that. The third and most fundamental point is that penalties must be subject to the principles of natural justice, so that no unfair measures can be taken against an individual and, more particularly, that each individual must, under the process, be seen to be innocent until proved guilty.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="09120238000122"></a>Several major points come out of this section of the Bill where I can say, straightaway, that we are unhappy. First, there is Clause 6, which would amend the Communications Act 2003 and would put in a new subsection (5)(b) of its proposed new clause which provides for retrospective penalties to be applied to people or organisations who have been seen to have  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_754"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 754</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>infringed. We think that that retrospective element is inappropriate for this Bill and it ought to be deleted.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="09120238000123"></a>The second issue is that of costs; who is going to pay for these exceptionally expensive measures? The rights holders say that it ought to be the ISPs, and the ISPs say that it ought to be the rights holders. It is not surprising that there is a significant argument about this, because the costs of enforcing and putting into place the measures that this Bill contemplates probably run to somewhere between £50 million and £100 million. We are talking about significant sums of money to implement this.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="09120238000124"></a>I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Barnes, is in his place, because in his last report he said that the issue of costs would be dealt with in the Bill. Now, I know that he has left Government since he made that statement, but somebody ought to indicate in responding why that is not the case, because how those costs are to be apportioned is clearly a major issue between the ISPs and the rights holders. Unless the Government give some indication of what they think that position should be, my guess is that Ofcom will always have to come up with a solution, rather than a negotiated agreement between the ISPs and the rights holders, which would clearly be preferable.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="09120238000125"></a>Thirdly, we welcome the development of the argument that has resulted in the creation of the First-tier Tribunal, but we still see serious issues, both of proof and of costs to the ISPs. We are rather attracted to the proposal for an entity in the middle, which has been suggested by both FACT and the Motion Picture Association. I will not bore your Lordships with how that would work, but I think it is something that we would wish to see seriously considered.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="09120238000126"></a>I recognise the general principle that we have to find a mechanism to stamp out this practice. However, it is clear from my remarks and those of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, that this section of the Bill will need major scrutiny. I will add to his point that we feel that Clause 17, which effectively gives the Government power to alter copyright law by statutory instrument, should be rejected. We will not support that. I do not go as far as the <I>Guardian</I> in suggesting that this would be used, if there were a Tory Government, by their new friend Rupert Murdoch in some way to continue his fight against Google. I do not reject it for that reason; I just think that if we are going to alter copyright law it has to be done by primary legislation, rather than by statutory instrument.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="09120238000127"></a>Another glaring omission from the Bill is how to deal with format shifting, rather than file-sharing. Format shifting is the process by which, when you have downloaded music or a film to whatever instrument you downloaded it to, you then move it across to another instrument in your control for your private use. Although today that is technically a breach of copyright, nobody ever attempts to enforce it. We take the view that this is an opportunity to put in the Bill that format shifting does not constitute a breach of copyright if done for personal use.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="09120238000128"></a>As I indicated earlier, my noble friends Lord Clement-Jones and Lady Bonham-Carter of Yarnbury will deal with other matters in the Bill in this Second Reading

Following the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, I regret that the opportunity to deal with the corporate governance and management of the BBC has been lost. It is running out there as a serious issue. The Minister is disagreeing with the structure that his Government put in place originally. We have a number of suggestions as to how the governance of the BBC ought to be improved, and the Bill seems to have been the opportunity to deal with that. Having said that, I look forward to the Committee with eager anticipation.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, proudly proclaims his former membership, or perhaps current membership, of a trade union, the NUJ. He inspires me to proclaim my former membership of the long-forgotten ACTT, the Association of Cinema and Television Technicians.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="09120238000130"></a>I greatly welcome some of the key measures in the Bill-for example, the proposals to improve our digital communications infrastructure. Britain, let us not forget, lagged seriously behind other leading countries in the first phase of developing broadband services. The primary cause of that was, of course, the failure of the regulator to grip BT. This Bill now offers the prospect of a catch-up-the strategic roll-out of high-speed broadband to an estimated 80 per cent of the population. Reaching the last 20 per cent will, no doubt, become our next preoccupation.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="09120238000131"></a>Secondly, the measures in the Bill for countering copyright theft are well considered and proportionate. Let us be clear-as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, emphasised with considerable force and eloquence-that the arts, music and entertainment sector is a very large part of the British economy, fostering creative expression, wealth creation and employment; that copyright theft has increasingly undermined the sector's conspicuous creative and business success; and that unless that threat is countered effectively, the industry's prospects will diminish.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="09120238000132"></a>Let us also be clear that this is not a small problem: a huge proportion of internet traffic-probably around a half-is taken up with the pursuit of copyright theft of various kinds. For instance, on the day that new countermeasures were introduced in Sweden, internet usage simply fell off a cliff. For the avoidance of doubt, let us finally be clear that the Bill does not inaugurate-as some have suggested-a snooper's charter. The ISPs will not be required to spy on their customers. Rather, the carefully graded response set out in the Bill will apply only to an absolutely identifiable account which is used at a precise moment in time, measured to the second, by someone who admits to possessing specific named content and then transmits that content online to a third party in breach of copyright. In respect of music, that content will overwhelmingly be available easily, speedily and for payment from online sources. I accept the view already expressed that the music industry certainly could have done a lot more to facilitate online payment in the past. But it does now.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="09120238000133"></a>My only concern about the process outlined in the Bill is that it may discourage criminal prosecution for persistent, flagrant theft. It is theft-as the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, asserted-the moral equivalent of persistent shoplifting of CDs or DVDs at an HMV store. The internet service providers should neither ignore it, nor abet it, nor appear to condone it, which some come dangerously close to seeming to do.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="09120238000134"></a>The noble Lord-the Secretary of State of almost all he surveys-has been typically unequivocal and bold in adopting these measures, and he deserves praise for that. So does the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Barnes, for tackling, against the clock and in quick time, under the Digital Britain umbrella, a formidable list of issues, and for resolving some of the most stubborn. He appears to be sporting a tan. I hope that he has enjoyed his well earned rest after the trials of No. 10 and project leadership. However, as we step back at the end of the Digital Britain process, perhaps I may make some broad observations about where we now find ourselves.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="09120238000135"></a>The first issue is how we as a nation are to maintain our glorious tradition of public service broadcasting as the digital age brings enormous structural change to the industry, as competition in the provision of public service programming erodes, and as our national investment in high-quality British production declines. That is the way to frame the issue, not just to ask questions about the BBC.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="09120238000136"></a>It was right to recognise in the Digital Britain process that the traditional providers of regional and local journalism and information, in print and over the air, are highly challenged. That really should worry us. But many other genres of public service content are also threatened, or soon will be. It was well intentioned, but I think too limiting, to focus primarily only on one genre and to look for a short-term fix, shifting funds from one convenient bucket to another. It was wrong in principle, I think, for the Government to consider intervening in such granular fashion in the provision of journalism. Our genius as a country since the 1920s, almost alone among developed nations, has been to keep government at arm's length from such matters and to address them through enlightened regulation. A job for the next Government will be, I hope, to step back-we heard echoes of this at the beginning of the debate-and to address comprehensively the future of public service broadcasting and the role of the BBC within it. Like the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, I hope that that will not be a monopoly role.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="09120238000137"></a>The Bill is not entitled a digital communication Bill, but rather a Digital Economy Bill. So my second observation is that we do not yet have the appropriate machinery of government to deal with the vast and growing challenges of the digital economy. The Bill barely scratches the surface of that. It is as if, 30 years after the invention of the motor car, there were no Ministry of Transport.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="09120238000138"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, with his usual precision, clarity and verve, ran what was, in effect, a short-term project. He was not in a position to encompass the whole diverse catalogue of issues that the digital age is throwing up. I give just a few examples. First, online fraud is sophisticated and organised; it is both national  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_757"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 757</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and global; it is enormous and it is mushrooming; yet the law enforcement agencies here and in other countries are still not past first base in countering it. Secondly, wicked men and women can entice strangers online to commit dreadful acts of evil on children and others, yet there are still too few virtual bobbies on the digital beat to deny them. Thirdly, malware introduced surreptitiously to your personal computer, like the creature in "Alien", helps create powerful, malign and parasitical networks, yet the many loose networks of criminals operating in this space act with impunity. Fourthly, without a framework of standards, the emergence of cloud computing-vast storage and functionality sited away from the desktop-may place businesses, citizens and consumers at risk. Fifthly, the ability of search engines to monitor your personal online activity and to exploit it commercially will raise increasing privacy concerns. Sixthly and finally, online content may be woefully inaccurate or even defamatory, but it is a world where remedies are hard to find.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="09120238000139"></a>There are many other examples, but in sum, the digital economy is, in many respects, a lawless, unpoliced and unregulated place and I do not believe it can remain that way for much longer. This Bill is more than a step in the right direction, but we will sooner rather than later need to make a far bigger leap and to review, in the most fundamental ways, how we are not only to harness digital technology for the common good, but also how we are to deal with the enormous problems that it brings too. That review will require a substantial rethink of how Whitehall can be organised to bring a real and continuing focus on every aspect of the digital economy and what institutional framework will be needed in support.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="09120238000141"></a>That is embodied in the welcome proposals, such as requiring Ofcom at all times to consider the impact of investment levels in public service content, the updating of Channel 4's remit and supporting its ambitions to continue backing and challenging the BBC in delivering innovative public service programming for a full range of platforms. However, in addition to securing a bright future for strong public service content in a non-linear world through legislation, the Government must also secure the ways and means to get that content to the people and for people to interact with it. Regional and local news coverage, for example, is key-as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, under whose chairmanship of the Communications Committee I am privileged to sit, has said. That means not being content with a postcode lottery approach for access to high-quality, high-speed broadband, but aiming for and achieving genuinely universal inclusion across the country.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="09120238000142"></a>I have some areas of concern about that. First, although the universal service commitment is an honourable ambition and is being helpfully supplemented by the Government's commitment to a home access scheme for low-income families and ongoing investment in the digital inclusion programme, groups are now suggesting that the bar has been set too low in terms of universal connection speed. It would be a shame if the considerable amount of money being diverted from digital switchover surplus towards funding that commitment were to become a futile catch-up game.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="09120238000143"></a>Secondly, significant state subsidy for the next generation access project through direct taxation of fixed phone lines needs to strike a fine balance between giving a shot in the arm to ensure that the most remote areas get superfast broadband, while not using public money to subsidise activities that will then distort competition. That said, the target of getting superfast broadband to only 90 per cent of homes in the next eight years seems rather too modest. By that time, if the pace of digital evolution continues, superfast broadband as it is today will certainly not be considered a luxury. It will be almost as basic as a telephone line is now-vital for small businesses, for individuals seeking to engage in the public sphere, or even for getting full use of government services. The Government must make it absolutely clear to the public why society should now collectively fill the digital vacuum from which those living in our remotest areas will undoubtedly suffer if public investment in the cutting-edge of internet access is not forthcoming sooner rather than later. There is a real issue of likely social exclusion here. I hope that the Minister can reassure us about the Government's determination to address that completely.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="09120238000144"></a>Turning to the introduction of a statutory age certification for boxed video games, it is a good move to give the Video Standards Council tough powers to police the Pan-European Game Information age rating system. Awareness of how children and other vulnerable groups might be affected by the unregulated excesses of the market must temper our desire to embrace new and creative technologies. With 10 per cent of 11 to 16 year-olds spending more than 10 hours a week playing computer games, according to the Childwise survey this year, and with inconsistency between the classification of such video games and the approach taken to films, tighter controls in this area would be more than welcome. Only credible regulation can begin to give parents and others responsible for bringing up children the confidence to enforce certification and not to succumb to pester pressure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="09120238000145"></a>The switchover to digital radio may produce more problems than expected. Of course there is much to welcome in the creation of platforms for new content to meet the needs of specialist audiences. I think, for example, of Premier Christian Radio's recent acquisition of a national DAB licence. However, there may be much to be concerned about over the plan to cut off national stations and many local services as early as 2015. While the Government have indicated that that will not be finalised until digital services account for 50 per cent of all radio listening and can reach 90 per cent of the population, it is also clear that without an early deadline, sufficient pressure may not build on

The radio switchover again underlines the risk of creating another two-tier system where significant swathes of the country could lose their favourite national stations from the FM dial, including the BBC stations they pay for through the licence fee. Surely that cannot be right.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="09120238000146"></a>What government support will there be for the switchover to digital radio, which is likely to be not only more problematic but, generally, more expensive across the population than the TV switchover has been? Will the Minister accept that overrushing towards analogue switch-off will not allow proper time for the Government, this House and the other place to think through the unintended consequences? Is there anything that the Government can learn from the German Government's experience and their postponements of switchover plans?</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="09120238000147"></a>An example of unintended consequences comes from community groups and churches that use radio microphones in various ways to enable people to hear and to use space creatively. As part of the overall policy on the digital economy and the sale of the audio spectrum, Ofcom is going to move the channels on which community groups and churches operate their radio mics, rendering the old equipment useless. I am aware that Ofcom is now looking at compensation for that, but are the Government aware that from the point of view of many charities, not just churches, there is a potential problem and a possible case for compensation for equipment that is still serviceable but is no longer useable? I am concerned about unreasonable costs being faced by some voluntary organisations. On voluntary supported broadcasting, do the Government intend to keep some of the analogue spectrum going, for example, for hospital radio?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="09120238000148"></a>This country must, of course, embrace the opportunities offered by a digital economy, but the advantages must be shared by the widest possible number of citizens. Some, if not all, of the unintended consequences that could unfairly disadvantage people might be avoided by not being trapped in too rigid a timetable. If that happens, I fear that this country will not benefit from the best rewards that a digital economy offers.</p>

I acknowledge that well known commandment, "Thou mayest not speak if thou art unable to remain for the wind-ups", and merely give notice that my noble friend Lord Bragg and I intend to play as vigorous a role as possible in Committee and at later stages of the Bill. I entirely support the Bill. I was hugely encouraged by my noble friend the Secretary of State's opening speech, which for me hit every button, and by the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, which was really excellent. I apologise that I cannot stay for the rest of the debate, but, as I said, I look forward to playing a very full part in the remaining stages of the Bill.</p>

If he has written it out, perhaps he will e-mail it to us so that we catch it anyway.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="09120238000151"></a>I, too, support if not the whole speech of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, then certainly the end of it, when he talked about the policing of the net. It is the wild west out there. It can be a very uncomfortable place in which to be an ordinary citizen, and if the streets were like the internet we would want to know what was being done about it. It is high time that the Government caught up with the needs of their citizens and started to do something about this. Relying on poor, under-resourced police officers-in individual forces, for goodness' sake-to deal with something that is a global phenomenon is, frankly, ridiculous, and it is time that the Government gave us some help with this.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="09120238000152"></a>I will speak on three subjects: domain name registrars, the spectrum and copyright. I am not entirely convinced by what the Government are setting out to do with domain name registrars, and I want to understand their reasoning better. I understand the problems that are described in the impact statement in particular, but do they really have plans for dealing with these things if they actually own the domain name registrars? Have they really thought through what powers would be necessary to enable them to tackle these things fairly and effectively? If they have, why do they not try giving those powers to the domain name registrars before they get around to thinking that those registrars should be nationalised? I will explore that in some detail.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="09120238000153"></a>Secondly, there is a well established need for additional spectrum for the emergency services. The current systems have, on several occasions in the past year or two, been overloaded to the point of breakdown. They are running on old technology that is way behind anything used by noble Lords, let alone by their children, and we are coming up to 2012, when we will need to have a very effective and highly capable system to deal with security at that event. Surely at some time in the future we will want our emergency services to have a really modern and effective system that is equivalent to the iPhone in noble Lords' pockets or even, perhaps in five years' time, to something that is much better than that. That will require spectrum, and I will table an amendment to require Ofcom not to allocate but to set aside spectrum for the emergency services.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="09120238000154"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Carter, will doubtless remind me that the system is currently in place for more spectrum; the emergency services have to put forward a business case and can be allocated spectrum. However, the emergency services have just heard today that they are to reduce their budgets by 5 per cent a year for the next five years. In any case, it will take a lot of time to put together some of the things that they are required to think about and to sort out exactly what equipment will be required.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="09120238000155"></a>In Council recommendation 10141/09, which I think was signed by the noble Lord, Lord West, the European Union has agreed to a chunk of the spectrum being allocated for the future expansion of the emergency  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_761"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 761</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>services so that they can be co-ordinated across Europe. The last time we produced a system for the emergency services, which was Tetra, we managed to create the international standard by doing so and we have benefited enormously from it. A large proportion of the industry which provides the equipment for that service is located in the UK and has been extremely successful in exporting it worldwide. If we find ourselves without the spectrum available within the band which has been allocated by the EU, when the demand really starts to build for the new generation of emergency services kit, we will find ourselves not only locked out of the market and all the benefits that would come with it, but also having to design for ourselves unique and expensive kit to cater for the fact that the bit of spectrum left over for the emergency services is somewhere off in another part of the spectrum and does not accord with EU and probable international standards.</p>

<a name="91202-0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="09120238000156"></a>This is a substantial decision because we are probably looking at 15 megahertz of spectrum, which is quite a chunk. None the less, I hope very much that I can persuade my Front Bench colleagues that they should support me in my amendment when it comes forward. I would also be delighted if we managed to persuade the Government that they should take an interest in this because it is pretty vital for national security reasons that we have a good allocation of spectrum for the emergency services.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="09120238000157"></a>Lastly, I want to speak about copyright. I should declare my interest as my main activity outside this House is in producing copyrighted material and selling it in book form and very substantially on the internet, so the basic protections that copyright law offers are extremely important to me. However, I think that the Bill has to be careful to ensure that it looks after the proper interests of citizens. We have always allowed citizens leeway under copyright law. You can lend books to friends and, as has been said, you can even copy your music and put it on to different kit. It is well known that newspapers are read by many more people than buy them, and certainly I am happy to borrow them when they are left behind on buses. I think it is entirely reasonable that people have got used to a reasonable level of sharing of copyrighted material between friends and within small communities, so that it does not have to be purchased again for every instance that it is used. The figures produced to show the losses incurred by the creative industries through illegal downloads do not represent those losses, but reflect infringement of copyright. It is not at all certain how many songs or films would actually have been purchased if people had had to pay for them. Many of the people who are downloading in this way are not in a position to pay for more than they do already, so one must be careful about the terminology one uses.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="09120238000158"></a>We have to be careful too about the industry cloaking itself in the finery of the small, creative individual. We are not talking about the small, creative individual here, but about powerful, monopolistic industries and giving them power over citizens. We must be careful of that. A principal example is that of the pornography industry, which I have seen mentioned in one briefing but has not been spoken of in any of the speeches today. Pornography is widely used on the internet and is one of the most assiduous industries when it comes  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_762"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 762</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to pursuing people for supposed non-payment for illegal downloads et cetera. We have to face it that we will be putting a lot of people into the hands of pornographers and their lawyers if we are not careful about the way we draft the Bill.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="09120238000159"></a>The recording industry is another major beneficiary of what is being done here. That industry is not exactly known for its kindness to creative people. Many people have created pieces of music and sold them to rapacious recording companies for a couple of hundred quid, only to see those companies go on to make vast sums out of them. The relationship is not equal and, as I have said, we are not dealing here with the benefit to the creative individual, but with the benefit to a powerful and monopolistic industry. We are also being asked to protect football, and presumably the interests of Mr Murdoch when it comes to putting the <I>Times</I> behind a "pay for" wall on the internet. In that context I am delighted to support what the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, said about the BBC. I am 100 per cent behind his resistance to Mr Murdoch's demands in that regard.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="09120238000160"></a>We also need to bear in mind that the problems now facing the industry are, to quite a large extent, of their own creation. The industry has been extremely slow to listen to the demands of its customers, and has had something of an abusive relationship with them, seeking to punish them before thinking of how to serve them better. It has taken a decade for the industry to produce sensible alternatives to illegal file-sharing, and the fact that a generation of people have become used to an illegality comes down to the industry's sluggishness. It is still slow. The football people have complained that there are sites where people can download streaming video of premier division matches. All that the companies offer is an annual contract for several hundred pounds. They do not offer per match deals at a reasonable price. If companies treat their customers in that way, they really should not be surprised that their customers try to get round the system.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="09120238000161"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, put it quite well when he talked about moving the industry forward and producing better business models. We ought not to be producing legislation that fossilises the creative industry in this unsatisfactory relationship with its customers. We ought to be ensuring that we are producing something that creates a real incentive to move it forward. Little things get complained of, such as the immense sluggishness in rights clearances. I have come across that to some extent. These things have to be dealt with by the industry. Underlying the Bill there should be a real quid pro quo.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="09120238000162"></a>I want to see an ISP/customer-friendly system to back us out of our addiction to illegal downloads. The first letter that comes from an ISP to the customers ought to be helpful, friendly and explanatory. It ought to give people the information that they need without making them feel like criminals in the way that the BBC does when it sends out a letter to someone it thinks has not paid the licence fee. It is very important to get the text of that letter right and I hope that we will set in place a system in which the text of the letter is under the control of Ofcom or the Government, and not individual copyright holders or ISPs.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="09120238000163"></a>Secondly, it should be compulsory for copyright holders to go through the mechanism we are putting in place. It is not acceptable that we are putting in place a mechanism for them to deal with per-to-peer file-sharing and for them still to go immediately to lawyers and harass people as the pornography industry does already. The briefing that noble Lords will have seen from <I>Which?</I> describes the consequences well. We should take the opportunity of this Bill to stamp that out.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="09120238000164"></a>Thirdly, the appeals system must be good and clearly set out. We should be offering our citizens due process, not something that is summary. Losing one's internet connection in the digital age is a severe disadvantage. Losing it because you happen to be sharing it with other members of your family or, under current British Telecom arrangements, you are letting your neighbours use it, is something that we have to be careful of. I am not at all clear that we have the technology to go beyond the IP address, which comes into my router, to identify which user of perhaps one or two dozen who have access, has done the illegal downloading. We need to be very clear that we do not tip people into losing their internet connection or worse on a technically fallible basis. If I have one last request for my Front Bench, it is please can we vote against Clause 17?</p>

Not long ago, I welcomed him to the government Front Bench as a distant cousin as well as a colleague. He will be missed.

<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="09120238000166"></a>I will briefly concentrate on those areas pertaining to public service content in <I>D</I><I>igital Britain</I>.

<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="09120238000167"></a>We on these Benches welcome the Government's commitment to Channel 4. Their recognition of the need to update Channel 4's remit will help to secure its role as the main public service competitor to the BBC. Here I echo the Minister. Competition is an essential element to ensuring a healthy future for the BBC and public service broadcasting.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="09120238000168"></a>Currently, Channel 4's remit relates only to linear TV and ignores the growth of digital media. We welcome the Bill extending this remit to new formats and platforms, where the channel is already pioneering public service broadcasting. I recommend its "1066" online game, designed to accompany a history programme of the same name broadcast on its terrestrial channel. This was targeted at 10 to 15 year-olds. We also welcome the new specific obligation placed on Channel 4 to produce content for older children and young adults. The channel already has a strong connection with younger audiences, so this is a sensible fit. I join the  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_764"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 764</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>noble Lord, Lord Fowler, in welcoming a commitment to the making and showing of British films being enshrined in the Bill as part of the channel's role.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="09120238000169"></a>I have two caveats about the Channel 4 elements. It is important that these new arrangements do not lead to any diminution of PSB on Channel 4's main, terrestrial channel. An essential component of public service broadcasting is that it engages as wide a spectrum of the population as possible so that different kinds of people with different interests and insights can share with society as a whole. Public service content must not be relegated to digital channels with small, niche audiences. This must not be used as an excuse to not commission public service broadcast programmes for the main channel. In the light of this, should Ofcom not be given new powers to ensure that Channel 4 adheres to its existing PSB obligations on its main, linear channel? While we wholeheartedly welcome what is in the Bill, we worry about what is not. It fails to address the longer term problems of plurality in public service broadcasting.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="09120238000170"></a>As many noble Lords have said, the multi-channel landscape of the digital future poses particular challenges to the purely commercial public service broadcasters. We accept the need addressed by the Bill to reduce the regulatory burden on ITV. This new landscape has transformed the economics of commercial PSB and put the provision of regional and local news under particular threat. We agree with the noble Lords, Lord Birt and Lord Fowler, and with the Minister that the BBC must not become a monopoly supplier.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="09120238000171"></a>The Bill proposes that the underspend from the licence fee money ring-fenced to help pay for digital switchover's targeted assistance programme will be used to pay for the independently financed news consortia pilots that start next April. How do the Government know how much that underspend is when digital switchover is not completed until 2012? We still have London to go.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="09120238000172"></a>Although we were against the BBC money being used to fund a social cost, we support the surplus being used to help to fund commercial public service broadcasting, but there it ends. We are absolutely against top-slicing. Once this money is used, that is it. We believe that top-slicing threatens the independence of the BBC and that condoning raids on the licence fee sets a dangerous precedent, leaving the BBC vulnerable to further funding cuts at the whim of the Government of the day.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="09120238000173"></a>For the pilots to work, there must be variety and innovation and they must concentrate on the local as well as the regional. As I understand it, the DCMS-not Ofcom-is running the pilots, so will the functions set out in Clause 28, allowing Ofcom to set criteria and conditions for the provision of this type of new service, apply to the pilots? Surely, for the pilots to be of any benefit, that must be the case. I am pleased to see in the Explanatory Notes that Ofcom may set conditions which encourage the provider to support or promote wider benefits to society in connection with the provision of news. That might include commitments to media skills and training. Is that something which the DCMS intends to encourage? Like the proposals for Channel 4, the Bill is silent about what comes next. How will the

As it stands, it seems that the pilots exist in a strange limbo not unlike contestants on a TV reality show.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="09120238000174"></a>I have a couple of questions about the interface with ITV. What quality control will ITV have over the programmes which emerge from the news consortia? After all, they will appear as part of the ITV schedule, and their success or failure will impact on the channel. Given that work previously undertaken by ITV's regional production teams will be taken over by the news consortia, will-I have to use a terrible acronym-TUPE, the transfer of undertakings protection of employment regulations, apply to the affected staff?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="09120238000175"></a>I end by picking up on what my noble friend Lord Razzall said about the fact that there is no mention of the BBC in the Bill. Long ago, we on these Benches called for a truly independent regulator of the BBC and argued, at the time that the BBC Trust was established, that that arrangement would only perpetuate the muddle between regulation and governance. Considering that those are the very sentiments expressed very publicly, as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and my noble friend Lord Razzall have pointed out, by the most recent Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, does the Minister agree that not addressing the matter of BBC governance in the Bill is a lost opportunity?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="09120238000177"></a>Earlier, in opening the debate, my noble friend the Secretary of State rightly highlighted the importance of the digital economy, the need for adaptation due to changes in technologies, and the increasing industrial importance of being future-ready as a knowledge and service economy. The triple effects of the death of distance, the crescendo of new creativity and the insurgence of the internet have created a new world and there is a clear need for legislative adaptation so that we may adjust to those changes.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="09120238000178"></a>For my part, one of the unexpected and possibly unintended consequences of my post-ministerial cooling-off period has been to spend time working abroad and observing in some detail other countries' developments and approach in this area. Whether it is the emerging markets, the ever-more powerful Chinese economy, the vision of the smaller Scandinavian countries, the aggression of the newer European countries or the clear approach of our more significant European partners, all of them have plans for and investments in their digital economies. It is increasingly clear that a digital future is central to industrial and governmental strategies around the world. The explosion of distribution systems, applications and the increasingly borderless nature of the content markets highlights those countries which are either ahead or behind in the digital future.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="09120238000179"></a>The debate within our Government was whether, at this stage in the political cycle, a small but perfectly formed Digital Economy Bill could do enough of the heavy lifting to merit inclusion in a final Queen's  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_766"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 766</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Speech, or whether it would be more coherent to wait until we were at a different point in that cycle and more fulsome legislation could be considered in the round. As the noble Lord, Lord Birt, rightly highlighted, could we go in a year from a consultation document, through a White Paper and a Green Paper, to a Bill, and avoid major mistake, major omission or a significant diminution of quality?</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="09120238000180"></a>In politics, as in life and business, waiting for the perfect moment is rarely advisable. In my experience, a good decision on Monday is often preferable to a perfect one on Friday. This Bill therefore has a number of merits which I believe will bear the scrutiny of this House. First, it lays down a marker by its very existence, by not being solely a piece of broadcasting legislation, while at the same time seeking to address some if not all of the issues facing our public service broadcasters, but in the context of the modern digital economy.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="09120238000181"></a>Secondly, in the critical areas of investment, infrastructure, spectrum liberalisation and the digitalisation and deregulation of sound radio, it provides a framework for innovation, development and investment. Thirdly, in a whole range of detailed areas-from content protection and the value of rights, to video games classification, domain name registration and protection, the future remit of Channel 4, the broader issues of public service content, and the provision of funding, albeit short-term funding, for independent impartial news-it seeks to play catch-up with some of the capabilities of the technologies and the changing nature of consumer preferences.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="09120238000182"></a>As to its very existence, I do not think that it is merely a matter of nomenclature that this is a Digital Economy Bill rather than simply a piece of communications or broadcasting legislation. As I have commented before in this place and in others, one of the remarkable features of the 550 pages of the Communications Act 2003 was that the internet was not mentioned at all by name and only once by an oblique reference to an obligation on the regulator to consider the importance of high-speed data services in remote locations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="09120238000183"></a>On the strategic elements of the Bill, and in particular the proposed updating and amending of the regulator's primary duties, I would urge noble Lords not to underestimate the importance of the proposed changes. Regulators are creatures of statute, of their leadership, of their governance structures and of the environment and the context of the times in which they operate. Their independence, their objectivity and their quality is often valued only when it is absent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="09120238000184"></a>Many of us have lived through-some of us in rather too close proximity-the seismic events in the financial services sector, and an interesting question to pose is whether a gentle but firm amendment, ahead of time, to the primary duties of the Financial Services Authority might have produced a different response and emphasis in its approach to its regulatory duties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="09120238000185"></a>In this country we do not have a crisis in the communications sector. In many ways we have enormous strength, significant competition, highly competitive retail pricing and, in the content and applications market, world-class levels of innovation and entrepreneurialism, and a number of globally admired companies. However,  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_767"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 767</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>as I said in my opening comments, the rest of the world is not only catching us up but, in many instances, overtaking us. Two much-discussed elements of the <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper are not in the Bill, either because legislation is not required, as is the case for the delivery of the universal service commitment, or because it was a tax measure, albeit a hypothecated one, and will therefore be dealt with in a Finance Bill. But perhaps I may make two related comments on these two issues, not least because they are often elided together as the same thing, and sometimes wilfully misunderstood and misreported.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="09120238000186"></a>The first proposal in relation to the universal service commitment allows this country to fund, from the underspend in the digital switchover, some hundreds of millions of pounds of public funds to ensure that every community, and possibly even those residents in Hambledon who are not BT employees, has access to a basic level of connectivity and a minimum level of broadband connectivity. The separate but related proposal for a hypothecated levy intended to generate seed-corn public funding that could be made available at an appropriate coupon rate for commercial players is a modest attempt, I would be the first to acknowledge, to bridge the gap that exists in this country today for the need for capital investment in our infrastructure set against the market's ability to fund it. It may help produce a fixed fibre infrastructure that extends further. It may combine in part with some of the liberalisation measures in this Bill relating to the electromagnetic spectrum to allow for the creation of fixed and wireless combined capabilities.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="09120238000187"></a>In truth, the technology solution should not concern this House; what matters is our willingness to recognise the importance of the communications sector and the need for investment upgrade in infrastructure. At the same time we need to see that the real future value is in the applications and services that will and can be delivered on such an infrastructure capability. That is the digital economy. As a country we are still broadly willing, with some notable objectors, to spend £142.50 per household per annum, with appropriate exemptions for certain households, in a hypothecated tax called the licence fee to provide us with high quality public service British content and the broadly beneficial multiplier effect that the money has on creating commercial businesses in the content markets.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="09120238000188"></a>It seems a credible proposition that we should be more than willing to invest £6 per household per annum, with appropriate exemptions for certain households, to facilitate and accelerate our infrastructure upgrade. For our digital economy it is far from the final answer. It is in truth only the beginning and that is probably a useful summary of this Bill-it is only the beginning, as the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, rightly pointed out. It is the first digital economy Bill. It contains a series of measures and proposals that are tightly drafted, broadly necessary and, in some areas, will have a much greater and profound difference than some have anticipated.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="09120238000189"></a>It does unashamedly seek to lay the groundwork for the next Government to return to this sector and look at it more broadly than Parliament has traditionally done through what has often been a broadcasting-only

I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, that there is a machinery of government change that merits further thought and far-reaching work. I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, that there is a need for a proper and measured parliamentary debate on the BBC, and that needs to be done in an environment where discussions can be had around structure, reach and governance without the hysteria of attack and defence polluting the debate.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="09120238000190"></a>Overall, this is a Bill that I am sure will be improved through discussion and debate in this House, but I would hope that, when that debate is finished, there would be cross-party and cross-Benches support, as it is a Bill that it will be more than helpful for the British economy to have on the statute book.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="09120238000191"></a>If I may, and I hope I am not breaking convention, I would like to close by recording my admiration for the Bill team which, despite rather irritating ministerial changes, has produced a focused and well drafted Bill that makes up for its limited clauses in the ground it manages to cover in 49 of them. I look forward to the Committee debate.</p>

Even if it is only a beginning, clearly this Bill is an important one, which will do much to update British communications structure and regulation content. Judging by the speed of change in the industry since the Communications Act 2003 was passed, I believe that it makes sense for the Bill to include powers for the Secretary of State to make regulatory changes through secondary legislation to deal with any potentially challenging new developments that still lie just over the horizon. Similarly sensible is the proposed duty on Ofcom to report to the Government every two years on any developments significantly affecting the UK's communications infrastructure and Ofcom's specific new duty to promote investment in public service media content.</p>

<a name="91202-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="09120238000193"></a>I shall concentrate most of my remarks on the protective measures proposed for creative industries-alas, like many other noble Lords-and on the amendments to the Video Recordings Act. I also want to welcome those parts of the Bill that will help to facilitate opportunities for a wider range of quality PSB content, enabling UK citizens access to these across the increasingly multiple platform that we have now within the communications market.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="09120238000194"></a>It is realistic, too, that the Bill includes plans for ITV, which over recent months made its position very clear. The plans will enable ITV to relinquish its public service responsibilities unless they are funded from elsewhere. Equally, on the other side, it is certainly good news-interestingly, warmly welcomed by Channel 4 itself-that the Bill, as a result of the growth of digital media, proposes to update its activities, requiring Channel 4 to be involved with a wide range of quality programmes, including news and current affairs, for different delivery platforms and multiplexes. Channel 4  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_769"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 769</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has made a considerable success of its public service channels, with news and older children's programmes and, especially, its huge contribution to British film. We shall all look forward to it playing an even more important role in public service broadcasting competition to the BBC and other commercial stations that want to go down that route. However, it remains unclear where the finance for this enhanced role is to come from, although the Minister, in replying, may put us fully in the picture.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="09120238000195"></a>I welcome those parts of the Bill which incorporate the <I>Digital Britain</I> promise to speed up delivery of a fully operational DAB digital radio platform. I spend a lot of time in cars and have had hearing difficulties since the arrival of my first child, so it is a real pleasure to enjoy the quality and clarity of digital sound, especially when listening to music-whether it is Radio 3 or Classic FM, both of which are excellent stations. The plank for Ofcom to be able either to terminate analogue licences without consent, subject to a minimum two years' notice, or where appropriate to extend analogue licences up to and beyond switchover, on condition that digital services are also provided, will no doubt help to build in the much-needed flexibility to enable radio switchover. I very much hope and have confidence in the plans that have been outlined that it will happen by 2015. It is important that it does.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="09120238000196"></a>I turn to Part 3, which deals with creative industries-a key part, with exports worth £16 billion or 8 per cent of GDP, as the Creative Coalition Campaign tells us. Sadly, the industry is increasingly undermined by illegal file-sharing, or theft, to put it bluntly.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="09120238000197"></a>There are also some 1.8 million UK jobs involving a wide range of skills which are endangered while this illegal trade, which is far more dangerous now it is digitally enabled, continues. While most people would be reluctant to limit anyone's access to the internet-my imagination somewhat boggles at how this is to be achieved-and despite the briefings by <I>Which</I><I>?</I> and other organisations, which I have certainly read and I think are concerning, my initial reaction is that the Bill's clauses are both moderate and proportionate. It is good that the Bill will require ISPs and rights holders to work together on how the process to be followed is carried out. Obviously there will be a need for a closer look at the clauses in Committee, but on balance, this seems an acceptable, step-by-step approach to a difficult and-I hope, as we are told-relatively temporary problem, as the market produces a better business model that will make this form of activity less desirable.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="09120238000198"></a>Finally, noble Lords will understand that with my background at the Broadcasting Standards Commission, my main concern with amendments to the Video Recordings Act 1984 is child protection. I of course welcome those parts of the Bill implementing Dr Tanya Byron's recommendations in <I>Safer Children in a Digital World</I>, but I am concerned that this Bill represents a missed opportunity to update all the exemptions in Section 2 of the current Act. These exemptions relate not only to video games which the Bill does amend, but also to other video work such as music and sports videos. Such works can claim exemption from the VRA and be sold perfectly legally to children, even if  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_770"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 770</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>they contain material which is clearly potentially harmful. I am not suggesting extending the VRA to all such exempted works, merely to those that contain content which is potentially harmful, such as graphic violence, sexual content falling short of actual sexual activity, and inimitable, dangerous behaviour and drug use.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="09120238000199"></a>I have seen some of these works myself. Their content is by any standards, inappropriate for children. For example: "Motley Crue - Greatest Video Hits"-and these, I may say, are not on my usual viewing list-features topless lap-dancing. "Slipknot (10th Anniversary DVD)", features the sight of the band's name carved into girls' arms and torsos. These are works which parents could legitimately expect to be regulated. Yet under the current legislation they can be sold legally without any age restriction. The enforcement agencies have no ability to prosecute distributors for supplying such works unclassified.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="09120238000200"></a>Will the Minister confirm that it is not the Government's intention to allow the new video games authority to classify film-type content, including full length feature films, in video games? This is important not to undermine a regulatory system for films and other non-game content that is tried and tested and has public support.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="09120238000201"></a>I note that the Bill anticipates that certain classes of video games may be transferred to the BBFC from the video games authority, and I understand both from it and the Explanatory Notes, that this could include games which are supplied on the same disc as a film, where the film is the primary content, and hard-core sex games, which require specific expertise because of the extreme pornographic content.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="09120238000202"></a>I would suggest-and perhaps we can look at this in Committee-that it might better reflect the Government's intent if they were to state in the Bill that these allocations shall take place where the primary content on a disc is film-type material rather than a video game, or where the video game would require an R18 certificate for supply to a licensed sex shop. I hope that the Government are able to address these concerns and, indeed, the others that will clearly be arising in Committee and on Report, but I thoroughly support the main purpose of the Bill. I hope that it is going to be improved-I am sure that it will-by the debates that go on in your Lordships' House, and that the result will be to more effectively future-proof the whole legislation, and to better achieve support for the creative industries and, above all, for public service broadcasting.</p>

I very much welcome the Bill, and it has been heartening to hear some really powerful speeches in favour both of its thrust and of some of the details in it. In particular, I am struck by the idea that in this digital age, this is the first time that we are looking at communication other than just as the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. Yet really, Parliament and the legislators are seeing it as the public have experienced it for a long time now.  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_771"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 771</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Very often, we are catching up with the public and in a lot of the details of this Bill we are, indeed, doing just that.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="09120243000002"></a>I shall restrict my remarks to Clauses 4 to 17 on "Online infringement of copyright", and at this stage I will not really go beyond that. I very much welcome them; the principle is right, and from what I have read so far I think that the detail is right as well. If there is to be an argument against it, I suppose that it will be that this is legislation which should have happened some time ago, but if that accusation is going to be bandied around the Government will certainly not be the only guilty party. Indeed, everybody seems to have been slow to react to changes in this field. That is why, so many years into the digital economy, we are now faced with a really quite serious problem of online piracy.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="09120243000003"></a>I suspect that as we go through this Bill we shall be talking a lot about some of the difficulties that the digital economy has thrown up. I suppose that is why we are legislating, and I therefore wanted to take the opportunity to say at Second Reading that those things are the small downside of two incredible success stories. First, there is the success story of the digital economy itself, which has quite simply transformed access to information, to creative content and to social networking in a way that we could not have imagined 10 or 15 years ago. Secondly, we are discussing these issues because of the quality of the creative content. Quite simply, no one would bother to download for free lousy content in an infrastructure that was difficult to use. It is because we have a strong digital economy and high-quality creative content that we have the problem.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="09120243000004"></a>The digital economy is a success story, when you look at it, because of its pace of innovation and its speed in adapting to the wishes of its users, which have made it one of the fastest-growing industries, perhaps, of all time. In 2006, the Performing Right Society licensed 400 providers of online music; in 2009, it is licensing 1,200-an increase of 200 per cent in about four years. I cannot think of another industry so important which has managed to grow at that speed. There is no doubt that, in terms of education and opportunity, the world is far stronger because of it.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="09120243000005"></a>Often, in these debates, we have spoken as if the digital world sweeps away everything else. We talk about a revolution and, indeed, in many ways it has been one. Yet we constantly make this mistake, when talking of the need for a revolution and welcoming rapid change when it has happened, of forgetting to say what does not change. We forget to say what must remain in place. The principle that a creator should be able to choose whether they get paid for their work or give it away free should be a cornerstone of the digital economy, in the same way that it has been a cornerstone of the creative economy. We have all failed to remind everybody, particularly the youngsters who have grown up in a digital age, that that does not change. It is not part of the revolution that we otherwise welcome.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="09120243000006"></a>It has indeed been a long-standing practice of musicians to give away their work for free. No one is opposed to that. The important principle is that it is their choice. If not, it is not only theft from the individual, as a number of noble Lords have already said, but foolishly  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_772"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 772</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>short-sighted. It risks undermining the very talent that will take both the creative and digital economies to the next stage of their development. Of course, as a number of noble Lords have said, copyright in a digital age should have been addressed years ago. When you look at the history, you see that anyone who could have acted or had a vested interest in acting failed to do so. It was almost like the rabbit in the headlights. The big companies-so successful for so many decades-were so slow to adapt to a digital world from an analogue world.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="09120243000007"></a>There were two things that we failed to do. One was to argue the need for copyright. We sometimes talk as though it is only this generation that does not understand copyright and treats it with such disregard. To tell you the truth, when I was 17 or 18, I am not sure that I thought much about copyright when, in those days, I taped something from a record that was playing. It is not that this is the first generation not to value copyright; it is the first generation that can do it at such high quality. Therefore, it has such an impact on the rest of the economy. Our generation probably did it; we got away with it and the economy got away with it, but it is a different ball game now.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="09120243000008"></a>Clearly, as a number of noble Lords have already said, there should have been models that safeguarded copyright far earlier than there have been. If we are going to move forward on this, and get the best of the revolution but at the same time preserve the best of what needs to be preserved, four things need to be in place. First, consumers need easy ways to pay for download content. Secondly, new business models need to make sure that rights holders are paid for the work that they create. Thirdly, a legal framework needs to protect consumers and creators, but also provide an environment in which the digital economy can flourish. Fourthly, something that has not been mentioned as much so far this afternoon is the need for an education programme about the value of copyright. None of those things would restrict the creativity or innovation that is important to make sure that the digital economy continues to flourish.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="09120243000009"></a>I would argue that in three of those four areas, prior to the Bill, progress-although late-has been made. It is now easy to download music legally and pay for it. There is no excuse now for not doing so. iTunes, probably the first online provider of music to be licensed, in 2004, now has 8 million people who download music and pay for it. Perhaps an even greater success story is that of Spotify, which went from a zero start to having 2.7 million users in the six months up to July of this year. Most of them are over 35 years of age and are downloading music for the very first time. People are beginning to use the facility that is there.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="09120243000010"></a>There is also a business model. In 2002 the Performing Right Society collected £1 million to pay its members for online music services. By 2008 it was collecting £23 million just through online music, and distributing £20 million to its members. There is also an education programme. The Federation Against Copyright Theft has worked long and hard to get a programme, but I know from experience that having a programme does not mean that people learn. It certainly does not mean that people act on it.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="09120243000011"></a>The problem we have is that the idea that creative content should be freely available is received wisdom for such a large proportion of our population. A whole generation has grown up believing that it is all right to download someone else's creative work at no cost. Progress is being made but there are challenges. Trying to persuade people to pay for something that was once free is far more difficult than doing it the other way round. Moreover, it is an incredibly complex market to license. It is not the easiest thing to negotiate, monitor and manage the 1,200 online providers that the Performing Right Society licenses. You often hear it said outside-it has not been repeated much here today-that the sector can afford it and that the people who are losing the income can afford to get it elsewhere. Last year, 82 per cent of Performing Right Society members earned less than £1,000 from the music they created. Some 1.5 per cent of them earn above £50,000 a year while fewer than 500 members earn more than £100,000 a year. Those 500 members who can afford to give their work away free online can turn to other income sources such as gigs to earn their income. That is why the Bill-it is, if you like, the digital economy's fourth plinth-is so important. We have had nothing like this so far, and it is therefore very welcome in adding to the infrastructure. Indeed, it goes some way to completing that infrastructure.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="09120243000012"></a>We have the strong statement that file-sharing is not acceptable and that we do not live in a society where that is the done thing. The Bill will ensure that legal, online services have time to develop, unhampered by having to compete with illegal free music. It is very difficult to get legal services going when you are competing with people who give them away for free. The Bill is directed at the most serious serial file-sharing offenders, and, according to the legislation, is a last resort. It incorporates in the system education about the process. I believe that it will begin to move us towards a fully functioning online market for the creative industries. We should not ignore people's complaints about the Bill but no one wants to go beyond the remit or make problems worse rather than better. In Committee and on Report we will have the opportunity to consider that. I very much welcome the principles and detail of the Bill.</p>

<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_774"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 774</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>digital age in only one area, and that was as a result of an amendment in your Lordships' House to support the expedition of universal provision of broadband services. In addition, one of the key shortcomings of that Act was that it focused very much on the plurality of choice of media, including the provision of choice of public service broadcasting, without proposing any solutions regarding how creative works would be properly rewarded, particularly in light of convergence-a development that was already becoming a reality at that time.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="09120243000015"></a>My contribution today reflects my enduring interest in the UK's vibrant creative economy. The creative sector is set to be an engine of growth out of the recession, especially as other sectors of the economy continue to struggle. It is important that the Government reaffirm and recognise the value of creative works, both to individuals and to the UK economy. I also have concerns regarding freedom of speech and possible regulatory creep beyond public service broadcasting into other editorial content, a concern that could directly impact the future of self-regulation for the press and online news. I will come to that a little later.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="09120243000016"></a>When the <I>Digital Britain</I> report was published, there was much talk about the focus being too much upon the pipes and not enough upon the poetry, that the Government had addressed the relatively easy bits, the hardware, but what about the valuable software, the creative content, both in terms of its future viability and protection from piracy? Digital copyright theft, including illegal peer-to-peer file-sharing, is, as we have heard this afternoon, severely damaging the UK's creative industries, such as music, audio-visual, publishing, retail and sports broadcasting.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="09120243000017"></a>Clearly, online copyright infringement seriously threatens the sector and it should be for an artist, singer, composer, author, photographer, filmmaker or publisher to decide whether they should give their work away for free. Measures are needed to tackle both illegal peer-to-peer file-sharing and non-peer-to-peer forms of infringement. The Bill has to be proportionate, effective and fair to media owners, ISPs, rights holders and consumers-a tough challenge. I hope the Bill will not only reduce the levels of online copyright infringement, but also ensure the development and growth of legal online services. Quality of content and high professional standards are vital across the media and to all the creative industries.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="09120243000018"></a>The Bill focuses on a number of important areas which I hope will be carefully scrutinised through its passage. For example, this may sound like one small area and it is one that is often overlooked, but I focused on it back in 2005. It concerns the issue of orphan works. I said then:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="09120243000034"></a>"Without adequate protection the photographic image-tomorrow's cultural heritage-and those who create it will cease to have true value, and without adequate protection a profession dies".-[<I>Official Report</I>, 22/6/05; col. 1690.]</p>

<p><a name="09120243000019"></a>Take photographers who are concerned that, in a digital age, information about copyright and the creator supplied with the digital image is stripped away, often automatically, so that in a matter of moments the world is awash with so-called orphan images. Almost five years on, in a world where digital is now the

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="09120243000020"></a>I hope that this will be an enabling Bill rather than a restrictive one. New laws should seek to encourage consumers into legal services and deter them from using illegal sites. In this regard, I have been struck by the degree of concern across the creative sector regarding the proposal in the Bill to allow for, in the words of Liberty,</p>
<ul><a name="09120243000035"></a>"future Governments to sidestep traditional criminal and civil law standards and procedures in favour of administrative systems controlled by the Executive".</ul>
<p><a name="09120243000021"></a>As other noble Lords have said, future Governments will have the power to change even the fundamentals of copyright without parliamentary debate through the use of statutory instruments. Of course we must also accept that with the speed of change in the creative environment, both in terms of technology and the marketplace, there must be flexibility, and the process of primary legislation is slow and often inflexible. There is a difficult balance to strike here, and I believe that it is important that we wrestle further with this issue in Committee.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="09120243000022"></a>As chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the body responsible for independent regulation of the press, I must express some concern at the extension of the scope of Ofcom's reviewing and reporting obligations beyond television. Considering public service media content on other platforms and applying stringent statutory impartiality rules has worrying implications for freedom of speech and expression. The exact shape, scope and range of the new regional news providers-the Minister referred to the new news consortia-the IFNCs, has yet to be finally determined by the Government and clarification is required.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="09120243000023"></a>Otherwise, the risk is that impartiality rules will be expanded into areas of the media for which they were not intended and in which they will constrict freedom of expression. It is right that the Government acknowledge that we need funding and investment for a vibrant digital economy, and that they recognise the huge new opportunities for the creative industries that digital technology provides. New ideas, content and products must be fairly rewarded and protected, so it is also vital that the Government find a way to achieve a difficult balance between the rights of the individual and copyright protection.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="09120243000024"></a>In terms of investment, however, are the Government satisfied that Ofcom will be able with confidence to promote the right and sufficiently flexible infrastructure, given the speed with which technology is changing? The need to create new business models fairly to reward creative works is crucial, and I am concerned that the Bill still has not addressed that and seeks to rely on old economy solutions to new economy problems. My worry is that the Bill is in danger of missing the opportunity seriously to consider funding for creative content. After all, its proper focus on illegal file-sharing masks the underlying problem of how content providers can survive when the public now expect free content online.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="09120243000025"></a>In essence, perhaps the Bill has the wrong title. It should surely be called the creative economy Bill, to keep reminding us all that, no matter how much law is

What does digital mean? Of course it means television and radio, but it also means broadband. I am sure that we will discuss this when the Finance Bill comes to us in March, but unfortunately we are now looking at a Bill based largely on the interim report of the noble Lord, Lord Carter, <I>Digital Britain</I>, which pledges to give us universal broadband access at 2 megabytes per second by 2012. However, the report did not outline how that is to be achieved. I read that Tim Johnson, the chief analyst at the broadband think tank Point Topic, warned that the commitment presents a massive challenge.</p>

<a name="91202-0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="09120243000027"></a>The promise of universal access to broadband is vital, but the scale of the task of making that a reality should not be underestimated. Figures show that Wales is still lagging behind much of the country when it comes to broadband access and speeds. We need to look at how to prioritise areas that cannot currently access broadband. I appreciate that it is important that broadband expansion is carried out in a manner that is commercially viable, but we must not lose sight of the fact that accountants must not have the last word. Some areas cannot receive broadband at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="09120243000028"></a>Many individuals and businesses, especially in rural Wales, still do not have access. That is damaging both to individuals who are missing out on the benefits that broadband provides and to rural businesses, not just the agricultural sector, but people who need high-speed internet to remain competitive. This morning, I spoke to the National Farmers Union secretary for Montgomeryshire, Mr Aled Griffiths. He emphasised the needs not only of agriculture but of businesses in rural areas, which are increasingly trading internationally, and the needs of rural tourism.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="09120243000029"></a>In Wales, tourism is now our main industry, and 10 per cent of our workforce are employed in tourism. Welsh tourist organisations-I spoke to them this morning-are unanimous that broadband access is vital. We remember that in attracting tourists we compete not only with the rest of UK but with the rest of the world.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="09120243000030"></a>The problem of providing broadband in our rural areas causes real concern. We are glad that the Houses of Parliament and the National Assembly in Cardiff are looking seriously in this direction. It is not only a problem in rural areas but in the valleys of Wales, which have long been known to have special problems and much deprivation. If we look at the tables, we see that Merthyr Tydfil, the Rhondda valley and other places have problems of high unemployment, difficult health situations and low incomes. They are vulnerable places that feel increasingly helpless. Will they have the opportunity to engage in the high-tech developments offered to us?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="09120243000031"></a>Today, I looked at the figures for radio listeners in Wales who have ever listened to digital audio broadcasting. I shall not go through the whole list, but in Cardiff, it was 27 per cent, while in the valleys, it was only 4 per cent. That is the difference. The most needy areas will not have the opportunity to benefit from these new high-tech developments. There is a pressing need for an extension of broadband, not least because of the commitment already made by the Government that fibre optic broadband should be prioritised in "notspots", where other technologies have also failed.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="09120243000032"></a>In London, 93 per cent of the population is in reach of 8 or more megabytes per second; in Wales, it is 38.4 per cent. In Wales, 26.9 per cent of the population is out of reach of 2 megabytes per second; in the London area, it is 1.2 per cent. We have problems. Last year, the European Union Telecommunications Commissioner said that many people in our rural areas still find that they can not get broadband under the current arrangements. In rural areas, not just in Wales, but in Scotland and parts of England, people find that they cannot get broadband under the current arrangements. The promise to have broadband available to every home is a massive challenge, but it is a target for us to aim at. It is important that areas with historically poor broadband access are targeted.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="09120243000033"></a>Once the UK Government have decided a way forward, the Welsh Assembly Government should seek assurances that Wales will be given the tools that it needs to deliver that pledge. Since 2003, the Welsh Government have operated their Regional Innovative Broadband Support project. It has largely been successful, but there are still many people who are not able to access the service. The geographical conditions create that difficulty. In this modern day, broadband is essential to reach the whole of the world, not only the whole of the UK; but it is not an end in itself, but a means to an end that can improve the lives of so many people in so many different ways.</p>

I wish to concentrate on the fact that the Government are committed to giving every household broadband by 2012. Yes, it will be 2 megabytes in some cases; but for the vast majority of people, it will be considerably higher than that. For instance, Virgin Media is offering me, in an urban situation in Scotland, 50-megabyte access to the internet, which allows me to watch television-or it would if I were prepared to pay the extra £10-and it is experimenting with 100-megabyte service in some parts of the country. BT will be rolling out the same sort of speeds when it puts in its fibre optic cabling. We have to concentrate on that. I was rather surprised by what the noble Lord said about parts of rural Wales not being able to get at least 2 megabytes. I have a house on the Isle of Arran and can get 2 megabytes. You really cannot get much more remote than the Isle of Arran in some ways, but it has created exchanges to ensure that we get it.</p>

Some of our older people find the internet more difficult. I have an 85 year-old father-in-law who has access to the internet and uses it, but he is relatively rare among those of his generation. We must have this commitment, because if we do not have it we will have this divide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="09120254000003"></a>I doubt whether I will do any of my Christmas shopping this year in a shop; I will do almost all of it online. I will buy books and records from Amazon and other things from other people. I even buy theatre tickets to give to people if that is the appropriate present. I am an early adopter of modern technologies-I bought my first mobile phone for £2,500 and my first computer for the same sort of money; it was a BBC computer and it had 400 kilobytes, not megabytes-and I have been slightly surprised throughout this debate by the almost negative approach to the internet. If you were a parent, or any other normal person, listening to the end of the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Birt, you would never take up the internet. You will lose a fortune to swindlers, your children will be at great risk from paedophiles, and you will wonder why on earth you would take it up.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="09120254000004"></a>The internet needs to taken up because even now we have this divide. Moreover, what will be the next development? Noble Lords have already mentioned 50 megabytes and high-speed cabling for broadband, which will allow us to use all sorts of video services. I have been saying for a long time that we should stop talking about broadcasting because the future is narrowcasting: watching what you want to watch on the internet where you want to watch it. The benefits will be enormous. Someone mentioned football matches. Ultimately, that is exactly how you will watch football matches. Manchester United will not continue to have 10 matches a season on Sky when it can have every one of its matches live on the internet throughout the world and collect a fee for it. The fee might be quite small-it might be only £1 a time-but if millions of people are watching it, that is an awful lot of money every week. That will happen, and that will be the way in which the internet develops. There will be an enormous increase in the number of services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="09120254000005"></a>Unlike many people, I will not be worried if the BBC becomes the sole provider of news in a particular area, because there will be access through the internet to a whole range of other news. If I want to find out how the local football team is getting on-or the local rugby team, in my case-I do not wait until the local paper comes out on the Thursday or the Friday; I look at the internet 10 or 15 minutes after the game has finished and then read the report on the local rugby team's website. If I want to know about a local planning decision, I do not wait until the local paper comes out; I go on to the local authority website and find out almost immediately after the committee has met-if I cannot actually watch the committee discussing it on the internet, which is possible in some cases.</p>

The problem is that in this country, among our young people in particular and to some extent all of us, we are very used to not having to pay directly-across the counter, if you like-for what we watch. I pay for a television licence for the house, and therefore my wife and my children who live with me watch television for nothing. They do not pay to watch ITV, and now they do not pay for a lot of material on the internet either. I can watch BBC iPlayer on the internet and I do not pay anything extra for doing so. Our youngsters are accustomed to this, so we have to educate them on how they have to pay for people's performing rights so that we continue to support the creative economy, but it is going to be a difficult task.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="09120254000007"></a>There are dangers in what the Government are proposing. Most of the Bill is very good and takes the digital economy forward, but I have concerns about the idea of cutting off broadband access. If I am right, broadband will become as important to our households as our gas, electricity and water supplies. We have come a long way in trying to stop the utility companies from actually cutting people off if they do not pay, and we have to adopt the same attitude towards broadband access. We will have to look at other ways of dealing with the problem, and it is something that we will look at in Committee. As I say, a lot in this Bill is excellent, but in some areas, while it deals with today's problems, I am not sure that it deals with those of tomorrow. That is something we will also have to look at in Committee. I am sure that we will give the whole Bill very careful scrutiny, but on the whole I give it a warm welcome.</p>

The company is a photographic archive and a member of the British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies. In turn, the association is a member of the Creators' Rights Alliance, which represents a wide spectrum of organisations in the music and photographic fields. There are certain aspects of the Bill which are of concern to that organisation and others, and I will attempt briefly to address them.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="09120254000009"></a>The first is the subject of the use of works whose creators cannot be identified-orphan works. It is a logical and legal absurdity to make such provision while there are significant groups of authors who do not have the right to be identified as authors of their work under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The right is given by Section 77 but, for many, is taken away by Section 79. The groups include news reporters and photographers, and all authors and performers who produce work under contracts of employment. Authors and performers should have an unequivocal and universal right to be associated with their work and to defend its integrity.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="09120254000010"></a>I suggest that there are two key moral rights which need to be considered. The first of these is that society and democracy have a profound interest in clear attribution, especially for news reporting, with the corollary that identified authors should take responsibility  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_780"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 780</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>for their work. Secondly, authors and performers should be able to enforce their moral right to object to uses of their work that, in the words of the governing international law of the Berne convention, are,</p>
<ul><a name="09120254000094"></a>"prejudicial to [their] honour and reputation".</ul>
<p><a name="09120254000089"></a>For example, authors and performers should be able to prevent works being distorted by manipulation or being used in misleading or offensive contexts.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="09120254000011"></a>I shall say something about extended collective licensing, if I may. Clause 42 would allow the Minister to make regulations by statutory instrument to permit extended collective licensing-the extension of licensing agreements to all authors, not only those who are members of the collecting societies that negotiate them. I shall come back to that later. Such a provision exists in UK law to facilitate cable redistribution of TV programmes, but making the works of authors and performers available on the internet from where they may so easily be copied for gain, whether by individuals or corporate pirates, has a much wider impact and requires much stricter safeguards. I note that a famous web search engine is already distributing creators' works without permission and, on the face of it, is in breach of national and international law, in the hope of changing the law to exploit forms of extended licensing. That is a quite different matter from licensing to genuinely public institutions, such as the British Library.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="09120254000012"></a>We believe that legislation should enshrine the principle that all uses of a work permitted under extended collective licensing must be accompanied by full credits for the author and other metadata which not only detail the source of the work but also give information such as agency contact details, thus ensuring that the work is traceable and attributed. There is a particularly relevant point here. As is well known, litigation on infringement of copyright is cumbersome and expensive in relation to likely returns and is rarely used. I pay tribute to the Minister for the way in which he set out the intended policing of copyright infringements. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, will pass that on to him.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="09120254000013"></a>The massive fall in licensing fees following the advent of online publishing has meant that the paternity right is ever more essential to photographers and other creators being able to trace and gain recompense for uses of their works. The right to a credit must be safeguarded, together with a suitably high level of compensation by transgressors. It is a further reason why metadata-the textual accompaniment to an image or other work-must remain linked by law. It will simply be a matter of survival for many photographers.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="09120254000014"></a>There is a theoretical prohibition under the Copyright and Related Rights Regulations 2003 on removing such information that attempts to implement the relevant provisions of the EU directive on copyright in the information society. The Consumer Rights Alliance believes that it is defective; it provides that a creator or other rights holder has the same rights as he has in respect of an infringement of copyright, which is to sue for the value of the infringement. What is that worth?</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="09120254000015"></a>We believe further that the Bill should make it clear what kinds of organisation should be authorised to implement either licensing of orphan works or extended

I am concerned that under Clause 42, proposed new Section 116B, there is scope for an institution to become self-licensing, and I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that the possibility of closing this anomaly, or at least clarifying the position, will be addressed. To revert to that point, Clause 45 enables decisions on collective licensing by the Secretary of State by way of statutory instrument. As a member of the Opposition, I have a natural suspicion of this form of legislation, and in this context I consider it to be particularly serious. We must have regard to the attitude of future Governments and also bear in mind that there are in this environment some very big beasts with massive resources for lobbying.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="09120254000016"></a>The Bill rightly seeks to strike an equitable balance between creators, stakeholders and users. If this clause is not modified the balance could well be upset. The collecting societies are, in effect, the monitors of this balance. A great responsibility lies with them, and it is for this if for no other reason that I urge the Government to consider regulating them in the body of the Bill rather than by way of secondary legislation, with all the power that that would give to one individual-the Minister.</p>

I come from a family of newspaper owners. My early career, before politics took over, was in publishing and bookselling. I should declare an interest in that I am now related by marriage to a successful, Pulitzer prize-winning playwright and screenplay writer. I absolutely share the Government's ambition to make the UK one of the world's creative capitals.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="09120254000018"></a>Do the provisions of Clauses 4 to 17 actually make the UK a better place in which to innovate? When he opened the debate this afternoon, the Minister spoke of the unique challenge to the creative industries that the digital age has created. Many today have spoken of the particular opportunities that have also been offered. I join the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, who spoke so eloquently of the new business models that need to be made the most of. There are great opportunities out there and they need to be encouraged.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="09120254000019"></a>The Government could have chosen to go down one of two paths with this Bill. One is to encourage those models. The other is to take a fairly heavy hand to protect the old model. The Government in this Bill have emphasised that protection model. This is not the best method of encouraging new innovation, and it threatens to make the UK a rather unwelcoming place in the digital age.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="09120254000020"></a>My noble friend Lord Razzall said at the beginning of the debate that education is the most important issue in discouraging illegal file-sharing. He is absolutely right and other noble Lords have made that point. For most 18 year-olds it is the norm to share. I am sorry for the lack of emphasis on education here-it is not even mentioned in these clauses.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="09120254000021"></a>This debate takes me back to my own dissertation, at the end of my college course some 35 years ago, on the problem for the book industry posed by copyright piracy in the developing world. The invention of the  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_782"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 782</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>photocopier and the lack of copyright law enforcement in the developing world would, it was said, lead to the worldwide collapse of the publishing industry. Centuries earlier, the scribes who transcribed books in longhand had similar feelings about Caxton when he invented the printing press. They worried that it would put them out of business. In fact, a whole renaissance of art and learning blossomed with the wider spread of the book. Throughout the ages, the old style of creativity has fought tooth and nail against change.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="09120254000022"></a>That is why the Government are making a mistake in this Bill. While understanding the wish of industry for protection from the tides of change, the Government have, in Clauses 4 to 17, laid the emphasis too much on stemming that tide and not enough in channelling it into the new business models. Can the Minister elucidate the most successful, established and emerging business models for monetising online content? Noble Lords have mentioned Spotify, micro-payments and other forms of payment for content. How will they be made easier and more convenient? What vision do the Government have for this? What studies have they done to see how free, ad-funded models might also succeed? These are some of the questions that need to be answered as we move into Committee.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="09120254000023"></a>The other thing I find difficult to understand is that this Bill seeks to make one industry that has seen phenomenal growth, investment and innovation-the internet service providers-pay for the protection of another sector. That does not seem a reasonable principle to pursue. The Minister will say that Clause 15 talks of sharing costs, but we do not know on what basis those costs are to be shared. That is to be in secondary legislation. I am glad to hear my noble friend on the Front Bench say that he will try to amend this and make it clearer in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="09120254000024"></a>I fully accept that those who create a product should end up with some recompense for their labour if the market wants the product. At the moment, I doubt we have the balance right in the Bill. I share the sentiment expressed so well by the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, that we need to look more closely at the effect on the individual citizen. He said that the Government should have in mind the proper interest of the citizen. The Bill has been brought forward by DCMS and DBIS, so it has laid the emphasis on the creative industries. What representations has the Minister received from the Home Office or the security services?</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="09120254000025"></a>My other problem with these clauses is the effect that their provisions could have on security and law enforcement. These provisions could drive the more persistent file sharers to use encryption and then there would be an enormous difficulty as regards the crime fighting use of interception. Using encryption is not something that needs would-be file sharers to be highly technically sophisticated. They can buy encryption software which they can download, so the problem for the copyright holders would not be solved. However, the problem for the police, SOCPA, CEOP and so on would be immense. The sheer volume of encrypted material could mean that the ease with which terrorists or child porn criminals will be able to smuggle their material around will be massively enhanced. I am deeply concern by what the Home Office has said about these propositions.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="09120254000026"></a>We need to think about what sort of country we want the UK to be in the future. Will it be one where the digital world enhances community life and education and increases access for all both within the community and in the wider world? I believe that is the model we want. Earlier, the right reverend Prelate spoke about inclusion but this Bill will make life very difficult for the future of internet cafes and other shared networks because it will place obligations on the owner of the account for the behaviour of users. That is fine for those who can afford broadband and have absolute knowledge of those who use it. However, just at a time when Swindon is planning to become the first wi-fi town in Britain and offer free internet use for its 186,000-strong population, the Government are liable fatally to undermine that community provision. I understand that Ohio in the States has used a similar model to become a wi-fi town but that it has been put under threat because the Motion Picture Association of America managed to shut down its municipal wi-fi network after a single download. Perhaps the Minister can confirm whether that has been looked into.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="09120254000027"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maxton, was particularly farsighted when he spoke of the right to utility connection being something that we should think about as regards the internet. I think it should become a right and that Finland is moving to make broadband access such a legal right.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="09120254000028"></a>Against that background, the provisions in the Bill either to cut people off from broadband or to throttle it-a particularly difficult term which I believe means to reduce the band width-are ones that we need to explore as regards the code. It is particularly sad that we have the Bill before us but not the code, which is such a critical part of the provisions. We need to know that the code is appropriate, fair and proportionate. At the moment, we do not know what will be regarded as serious enough to warrant a disconnection as we do not know how the threshold will be defined. There is no doubt that disconnection would affect families, businesses and, potentially, whole communities.</p>

<a name="91202-0007.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="09120254000029"></a>I am also concerned that under this Bill the accused will have to prove their innocence and probably will have to pay if they want representation. As soon as suspicion falls on them, they will automatically be put on a list from which they will have to appeal to be removed. There are a lot of worries that we will need to scrutinise in Committee. I very much look forward then to exploring the detail.</p>

Until that point, I thought that this was becoming a dangerously unbalanced debate, with the notable exception of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and, to some extent, my noble friend Lord Maxton. There was acceptance of the approach of going down the line of sanctions to transform the position on illegal file-sharing and downloading.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="09120254000031"></a>In the interests of balance and, possibly, of time, I have scrapped the part of my speech which was supportive of many of my noble friend the Secretary of State's  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_784"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 784</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>proposals. However, I assure him that there are large parts of this Bill and the objectives of the digital Britain programme that I strongly support. There are also significant parts which I find very difficult to support and I will raise these issues as we go through the stages of the Bill. I do so in part-I declare this interest-as the chair of Consumer Focus and thereby speak on behalf of millions of consumers, who do not really understand copyright law, who do not know whether what they are doing is legal or illegal and who, to some extent, as my noble friend Lord Maxton, has said, now expect a free service and will be resentful of and resistant to attempts to curb that. That is not to excuse it, but to face up to the reality of the modern age.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="09120254000032"></a>I do so in part in relation to my role with Consumer Focus. But I do also-this is why I am slightly surprised at the balance of the debate-simply as a Member of the House of Lords. Normally, your Lordships' House is deeply diligent about issues of human rights, privacy, due process, the rule of law and the need to provide proof in cases of criminality and the equivalent. It is also very insistent on the principles of better regulation, which this Government and many opposition parties have embraced, relating to proportionality, transparency and enforceability of the regulations that we have passed.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="09120254000033"></a>This law is ultimately not enforceable in the sense that it will get rid of illegal downloading. The background to this Bill refers to 6.5 million illegal downloaders. My rather limited understanding of the teenage world suggests larger numbers than that and that the number of transactions which each of them could be accused of engaging in illegally will amount to hundreds of millions of individual transactions. You will only ever scrape the surface of that. As the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, has just said, those who are making serious money out of it will be able to engage in encryption and other ways to avoid detection and enforcement. I agree again with the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, that the Government should have chosen a different road.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="09120254000034"></a>There have been many references, including that of the right reverend Prelate, to this being the equivalent of theft. It certainly falls under the context of the commandment, "Thou shalt not steal". I am told by the noble Lord's officials, and I made the analogy myself, that technically it is not theft because, at present, it is enforceable through the civil courts and not the criminal courts. But even if we accept that it is theft, the shoplifters who steal the actual DVD, which is worth a lot more than the rights of an individual download to the rights holders, have a fair trial and are subject to due process. They do not receive a letter, but, at the first attempt of enforcement, they are subject to due process. However, in this system, due process enters the equation only at appeal stage and then as a result of strong counterlobbying by among others my own organisation. There is a real problem about the impact assessment and about how much you could actually recover for rights holders. The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, made the point that the £200 million -or the £400 million which is allegedly the figure the rights holders are missing out on-is a purely notional amount. If you actually enforce this and the downloading  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_785"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 785</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>finishes, not a penny automatically goes back to the rights holders. It is not a figure equivalent to any other area where we use sanctions in order to recover money on behalf of those to whom it is due.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="09120254000035"></a>I recognise there ought to be some return to rights holders. I am not denying that. But I am saying that the way forward must be to develop education and alternative business models and technical models on the lines of iTunes and Spotify and the very many other-I think one noble Lord referred to 35 now-different providers in this field of legal downloading. They have higher quality, are easier to use, easier to do and are relatively cheap compared with illegal downloading.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="09120254000036"></a>Surely the main way forward should be to develop legal ways in which the interests of rights holders can be met and to which consumers can relate, not engaging in sanctions that raise serious issues of consumer rights and human rights. That is happening but it is happening slowly and, as other noble Lords have said, it is happening far too late. The main focus of this debate and the main focus of this Bill should be to develop those alternative measures. Instead, the headline of this part of the Bill regrettably is on sanctions. It is on criminalising people who are unwittingly engaged in downloading and it is setting in statute and through the regulations that Ofcom will be required to produce sanctions that are not proportionate to the loss to the original rights holders. They are not necessarily the original rights holders because, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said, most of the rights are actually owned by monopolistic companies, not individual creative persons. The sanctions are disproportionate in the sense that not only is the individual who actually committed the breach of copyright likely to be affected but also his or her whole family and in some cases businesses. It is also not clear whether there are exemptions to this in relation in libraries and schools and institutions which provide multiple access on the same e-mail address.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="09120254000037"></a>You are not simply penalising the individual who breaches the copyright but a whole range of other people whose livelihoods may well depend on access and unthrottled access to the internet. I am profoundly concerned about provisions in Clauses 4 to 17. I accept very much that the Government have moved from the position which was originally being urged on them, principally by the industry. I am prepared to accept that the first stage of the process that they outlined, which places the duty on Ofcom to look at how we can develop more legal ways of provision, is sensible but that is the provision that ought to be the main part of resolving this problem, not the sanctions. I still have profound objections to the sanctions as they stand in stage two of the process.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="09120254000038"></a>I hope that we can look at some of these issues in Committee. We may be able to move the Government further towards emphasis on developing alternative business models and the introduction of a fair use provision in copyright law that would enable most users to escape from being criminalised and ensure that where sanctions still apply they are in line with the principles of law and of protection of the citizen which are normally central to the concerns of this House and rightly so.</p>

He always made the distinction between the plumbing and poetry involved in moving to digital Britain. I am afraid that my speech will be mainly plumbing, but some of the speeches today have demonstrated real vision and excitement about the prospects. I have certainly enjoyed enormously hearing today's debate.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="09120254000040"></a>We on these Benches broadly support the Bill and the four key objectives put forward by the Government-the creation of a competitive infrastructure, the protection and development of our creative industries ensuring the continuing health of public service broadcasting, and the essential need for digital security and safety. This is a very skeletal Bill, however, which depends hugely on regulations and codes to deliver its intentions. There is not even a pig in the poke; the pig has not even arrived, in some cases. Our attitude to the Bill will be whether critical amendments are made, whether some of the crucial questions are answered and whether vital assurances are given by Ministers during its passage through this House.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="09120254000041"></a>I shall not go over all the ground trodden so ably by my noble friends Lord Razzall and Lady Bonham-Carter, but I want to highlight some of their points. First, we support the extension of the duties of Ofcom. However, we believe that the National Audit Office should have an extension of its powers to ensure efficiency among public service broadcasters. We also, like the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, believe that the BBC Trust has had its day and that the governance system for the BBC needs replacing. We need a proper public service broadcast regulator-an overarching regulator for all public service broadcasting.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="09120254000042"></a>My noble friend Lord Razzall set out very clearly the principles on which we support the Government's proposals on online infringement of copyright. Our position is that it is vital that creators have protection from those who infringe their copyright and deny them financial payment for their work. However, in the words of the chairman of UK Music, Feargal Sharkey:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6"></a><a name="09120254000093"></a>"Our focus is not to disconnect, but to reconnect. To reaffirm and recognise the value of creative works, both to individuals and to the UK economy".</p>

<p><a name="09120254000090"></a>That is not a negative. Much was made today by my noble friend Lady Miller and the noble Lords, Lord Lucas and Lord Maxton, of the need for new models. Of course, there is a need for new models for creative exploitation, such as Spotify; we agree. But there needs to be a backdrop of protection for the creative industries to enable innovation to take place. That is the basic point. It is clear that if no action is taken the UK creative content industries will suffer massive losses in displaced content sales. Give or take the impact assessment that sets it all out, some of that might be overegging it slightly-but it is there or thereabouts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="09120254000043"></a>We broadly share much of the Government's intention in offering protection to creators while ensuring digital access for the public. However, we are very clear about the conditional basis of our support for the provisions in this Bill. First, the terms of the all-important initial obligations code must make it clear what those thresholds are. The thresholds must be proportionate and must not be set too low. We should know what they are before the Bill goes through the House. There are also potential problems, as my noble friend Lady Miller pointed out, for an internet access service that has to take responsibility for people using its system, such as an internet café, wi-fi router connections and so on. Who will be liable in those circumstances? Who bears responsibility? Will this kill off community wi-fi services and internet cafés? We must be very clear about the impact of this.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="09120254000044"></a>My noble friend Lord Razzall made the point about the concerns of mobile broadband providers. Particularly dangerous are the retrospective provisions set out in the Bill, whereby they may be obliged to build massive, expensive databases just against the possibility that they go over the thresholds and have to start notifying customers-in which case, they would need to retrieve all the past information. It is crucial that those retrospective provisions are taken out. It is also crucial under the initial obligations code that there are provisions that relate to the assessment of the quality of the data provided by rights holders. Many noble Lords have raised this issue in terms of the attribution of IP addresses to individuals. Who will ensure that this is of sufficient standard? Ofcom? An independent body? This is a crucial aspect.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="09120254000045"></a>Of late, we have seen a proliferation of lawyers' letters, acting for the pornography industry, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, pointed out, often against innocent people asserting copyright claims and threatening court action. <I>Which</I><I>?</I> and others are right to raise these cases, but I hope that the provisions of the new code will obviate the need for this heavy-handed type of action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="09120254000046"></a>Clause 10 gives the Secretary of State power to direct Ofcom to assess whether technical measures should be imposed, take steps to prepare for them and report to the Secretary of State. On these Benches we are deeply concerned that it does not explicitly say that the Secretary of State must wait for a year before beginning this assessment and preparation for technical measures to give adequate time to assess their effect. This should be only after a compulsory report from Ofcom.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="09120254000047"></a>As regards Clauses 12 and 13, and the contents of the technical measures code, there needs to be clarity on limits to the period of any account suspension or limiting, and we need clarity on the administrative body and the tribunal and appeal process and where the onus of proof lies. My noble friend Lord Razzall has raised the issue of sharing of costs. There needs to be much more about the equitable sharing of costs between the ISPs and the rights holders in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="09120254000048"></a>Clause 17 is the most controversial clause in the whole of the Bill. There are many Henry VIII clauses in the Bill, but this is the most sweeping, and I see that Google, eBay, Facebook and Yahoo are also concerned  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_788"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 788</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>about it. The amendments to the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 give the Secretary of State power to amend Parts 1 and 7,</p>
<ul><a name="09120254000095"></a>"for the purposes of preventing or reducing the infringement of copyright by means of the internet".</ul>
<p><a name="09120254000091"></a>The argument is that the Secretary of State needs to respond to new technological developments. But the Secretary of State could completely rewrite the law of copyright relating to the internet without any primary legislation. There has been no urgency displayed by Ministers in implementing many of the Gowers committee recommendations even in this Bill, despite the opportunity to do so. It would be quite wrong for copyright law in the digital era to be exclusively dealt with by secondary legislation in such a sweeping way.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="09120254000049"></a>I understand that the reason for this provision is so that the Government can deal with the enforcement of copyright against so-called cyberlockers which do not involve P2P file-sharing as such. But if this is the intention, why not put it in the Bill? Why is it not an amendment to the Communications Act rather than the Copyright Act 1988?</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="09120254000050"></a>In other parts of the Bill, powers in relation to internet domain names on the face of it look like a perfectly reasonable provision. But I was very interested to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, had to say. Can the Minister clarify whether the provision has been notified to ICANN and what its response has been? After all, that is the global independent body responsible for the security and stability of the internet. What advantage does it see in having these provisions in UK domestic law?</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="09120254000051"></a>My noble friend Lady Bonham-Carter has made our views positively clear on the extended remit for Channel 4. But as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said, where is the finance going to come from for this extended remit? We heard about a £100 million deficit for Channel 4 coming down the track-where is the additional subvention going to come from? We all need to know whether there are answers to that, and I know that the noble Lord, Lord Carter, laboured long in the vineyard trying to put together various solutions.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="09120254000052"></a>I come to ITV. As my noble friend Lady Bonham-Carter also said, we are very much in favour of these provisions, which reduce the regulatory burden on Channel 3, or ITV. We are also in favour of the new pilot projects for IFNCs starting in Scotland, Wales and the Tyne Tees and Borders ITV regions next April. It seems peculiar, however, that there have been no decisions on continued funding. Surely, to start those trials without a clear idea of where the future funding will come from, once the full rollout takes place, is going to be a big mistake. It is building up false expectations if that funding cannot be provided in future.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="09120254000053"></a>I put another marker down, as my noble friend did, that we would not support top-slicing to support that particular aspect of additional independent news provision on ITV. My honourable friends in Scotland are extremely concerned, as we are, about the Gaelic television provisions, which are potentially no longer going to be with STV. I know that there is optimism about them being provided by Alba, but that is not a done deal and it may deprive those who depend on Gaelic television in Scotland.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="09120254000054"></a>I move on again, to independent radio services. We broadly welcome the provisions for digital switchover. Of course, full switchover will only happen on a specified date if certain criteria for uptake are met, and the only way that one will get further adoption is by setting a firm date. I hope that the Minister will confirm that we are currently working off a 2015 date, but there are concerns among smaller radio stations that the digital multiplex regions that have been defined are too large. Small, local stations will be broadcast across the whole of a large region covered by a multiplex, and may be expected to pay a rental reflecting that. That would be unfair on some of those small stations. Many of them are arguing for DAB plus, a technology which would be, I believe, much more in tune with their requirements. I would be grateful to hear what the Minister says in that respect.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="09120254000055"></a>Coming to access to the electromagnetic spectrum, on these Benches we have not yet decided whether to support the Government's proposals on that. The impact assessment claims that this will have,</p>
<ul><a name="09120254000096"></a>"the maximum possible effect in terms of promoting and sustaining competition in the mobile sector".</ul>
<p><a name="09120254000092"></a>If the changes in the Bill cannot be implemented by Ofcom, it is said that some mobile network operators may have to delay the rollout of 4G. Yet are we selling a valuable resource, one which is worth billions more than will actually be derived under the Government's proposals, too cheaply? Selling the spectrum piece by piece, rather than in the package proposed by the Government, could perhaps get us a much better return. Government plans are not in line with how other countries in Europe are dividing up their spectrum.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="09120254000056"></a>Those who have talked to us on these Benches have also argued that there should be some provision for a new entrant to the market in the auction of new spectrum in the 2.6 gigahertz and 800 gigahertz spectrum-a section of spectrum that no existing holders can bid for. That was the case with the original auctions; why is it not being proposed in these circumstances? Are we simply ensuring that existing mobile operators are deriving an unfair advantage over the fixed-line ISPs or are the Government putting forward some real advantage, such as a public service obligation for the mobile operators? That does not exist at the moment, but is there some proper quid pro quo taking place?</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="09120254000057"></a>We have a diminishing number of mobile operators, and it looks as if they are going down from five to four. At present, the current arrangements look like a carve-up between those mobile operators. If we could find further funds from that mobile spectrum auction, surely those could go toward some of the new, superfast broadband delivery or some of the future ITV news requirements. Would that not be beneficial? The Government set great store by the Independent Spectrum Broker's report, but no one seems to have seen the remit given by the DCMS to the Independent Spectrum Broker's report, so it is very difficult to judge whether the spectrum proposals are proper and the right way forward. We strongly support the adoption of the enhanced PEGI standards for video recordings. We believe that it will be a tougher regulator and it is, of course, the only pan-European regulator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="09120254000058"></a>There are a number of matters missing from the Bill. We very much look forward to the super-fast broadband levy in due course. It would be useful if the Minister, in winding up, could address the press reports that have been made about exactly what that levy will consist of. We generally support the principle of a levy to support the rollout of super-fast broadband. I have to finish now. We have not seen any statement in the Bill about the new digital delivery agency. There is nothing in there on media ownership rules and there are any number of copyright provisions that have not been included, as mentioned by my noble friend Lord Razzall in terms of format switching. That, of course, should be included but is not. I very much hope that in Committee we can make a number of amendments to improve the Bill.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="09120254000060"></a>Welcome though it is overall, the Bill has its disappointments. As my noble friend Lord Fowler pointed out, a number of matters remain to be addressed. There was an opportunity for Her Majesty's Government to make Britain, in digital terms, one of the most advanced countries in the world. In the case of broadband-conspicuous because of how little there is in the Bill about this crucial matter-the very low target for 2012 will merely confirm that Britain is in the digital dark ages. How regrettable that there is no chance to debate the Government's plan, or rather lack of one. So far all that has been suggested is a new tax, but there is little information on how the money raised will be spent. Spending money without proper examination creates the danger of leaving the UK with an expensive infrastructure that is already out of date and not responsive to consumer or industry needs.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="09120254000061"></a>The Government should be looking at the regulatory regime in this area and reviewing how outdated and burdensome piles of red tape could be got rid of to assist and encourage private sector investment. This is urgent. Already the internet system is creaking, with mobile networks crashing, and we are still in the early stages of the revolution in communication that is taking place. It is shaming to read Cisco's report Britain is only 31st out of 66 countries in broadband speed.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_202"></a><a name="09120254000062"></a>Broadly speaking, as the Secretary of State has explained, the general duties of Ofcom are amended to extend investment in infrastructure and promote investment in public service media. This is done by amendment to the Communications Act 2003. However, the 2003 Act already seems to cover everything included in the Bill. Could the Secretary of State let the House know what in particular will be achieved by the proposed amendments to the Act, that could not have been achieved without the Bill that we are discussing today? For example, under chapter 3 of the framework directive, "Tasks of National Regulatory Authorities", Ofcom already has a duty to promote efficient investment in infrastructure.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_203"></a><a name="09120254000063"></a>In addition, the explanatory document repeats the obligation under the 2003 Act to further the interests of citizens in relation to communication matters. Does

How can the interests of citizens not allow, or, indeed, encourage, a sensible view to be taken of long-term considerations?</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_204"></a><a name="09120254000064"></a>Another concern is the promotion of appropriate levels of investment in public service media content. What is "appropriate", and to what does it apply? Does it, for instance, apply just to the public service broadcasters' online activities, or to all online content which could conceivably count as public service? Is it the amount of money invested, or is it where it is invested? Is it a requirement for the BBC, the largest public service provider, to invest in making programmes specifically for the internet, rather than using the internet to reproduce and promote its television and radio content? We think that the BBC news website, for instance, is a good thing, but would not want it to use this clause as an excuse to expand its online activities beyond their core purpose. These are matters for Committee, but it would be helpful if the noble Lord could tell the House a little more precisely what this clause is trying to achieve. It is broadly drafted and raises many questions.</p>

<a name="91202-0008.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="09120254000065"></a>No one could argue with the aim of Her Majesty's Government to tackle the massively important area of illegal file-sharing, but the lack of detail in the provisions is disappointing. The lack of certainty is a particular concern for internet service providers, especially mobile broadband providers, who are unsure about the cost of compliance. It is possible that these clauses will set up a proportionate, fair and effective regime, but, bearing in mind the dissatisfaction so many stakeholders have expressed, there must be doubts about how well the provisions will work. These provisions will need to be scrutinised very closely in Committee, especially Clauses 11 and 17. I listened closely to what my noble friend Lord Lucas said. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, also made some most pertinent comments on Clause 17.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="09120254000066"></a>Clause 11 appears to imply that the Secretary of State does not need to consult Ofcom before introducing technical measures. We would be reluctant to see the Secretary of State given such comprehensive and unchallengeable powers. As he himself has pointed out, the latter clause on copyright needs to be updated to take account of new media forms, but this clause does not do that; it just allows the Government to do whatever they want at any point in the future. Although some future-proofing may be necessary, it is regrettable that such a large and important part of a modern digital economy should be left to secondary legislation, with the corresponding lack of scrutiny and certainty. Will the Secretary of State confirm that, as my noble friend Lady Buscombe pointed out, Clause 17 would in effect enable him to rewrite the entire basis of British copyright law by statutory instrument?</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="09120254000067"></a>It is hoped that the current system of domain name registration can continue to operate in the interests of consumers and businesses without the need for government intervention. There is a case for government obtaining reserve powers to take action where serious failures may be identified, but greater detail is required on how these powers will be used, and what will trigger their use. Could the Secretary of State tell

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="09120254000068"></a>The Bill has provision for public subsidy to prop up regional news. Despite the well argued plea from the noble Lord, Lord Mandelson, I believe this would be quite wrong. The situation would arise of news providers pursuing subsidy rather than their rather more important task of pursuing news. Worse still, in today's world of spin, one body funding all news carries the hideous potential danger of that body seeking to influence the news. If outdated and restrictive regulations on commercial service providers were removed promptly, the necessity for subsidy could be avoided.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="09120254000069"></a>While we on these Benches support the switch from analogue to digital radio, it is a sensitive area. It would be good if the Government could give some assurances of what criteria will be used to decide when will be the appropriate time for the changeover. Will the Government be guided by the criteria set out in the <I>Digital Britain</I> White Paper, referred to by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester? If so, we remain unconvinced that the 2015 target date is realistic and worry that millions of listeners and hundreds of local stations will be disadvantaged.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="09120254000070"></a>There are many for whom the digital switchover will cause problems: the elderly or the lonely, who may have had a wireless for many years which has become almost a companion; the blind person who will not be able to work the digital radio because the instructions are on a screen that they will not be able to see. I hope that the Secretary of State can reassure the House that proper care and attention will be paid to the needs of those who will encounter difficulties with the transition.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="09120254000071"></a>On these Benches, we welcome the moves to a single classification for video games. We are concerned, however, that the Government have not taken this opportunity to address the loophole in video classification laws that allow violent, sexual and other harmful content to escape age verification if they are part of music or sports videos and films.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="09120254000072"></a>Among other comments, my noble friend Lord Bridgeman made some pertinent remarks on Clause 45 about collective licensing. What is the Minister's view on this potentially tricky subject? In the Bill, much of the devil will be in the detail and we on these Benches look forward to the Committee stage where the detail and the Government's future intentions can be examined thoroughly.</p>

The only thing I would say in reply to his comment that the Bill team has done a good job is that they are only in the foothills-we are nowhere near the Himalayas yet. I assure him that the Bill team has to earn its medals through a great deal of work as we go through Committee, Report and Third Reading on the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="09120254000074"></a>I am of course grateful that the opposition parties have indicated their broad support for the Bill. The opening speeches therefore filled me with some joy. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, for his constructive approach to the issue, not only because he was the first opposition speaker but also because he chairs the important Communications Committee. We therefore always take his views on these matters with the greatest interest and seriousness. I was pleased that he emphasised one dimension which did not get much coverage in the debate-the difficulties, perhaps reaching crisis proportions, surrounding local and regional news. The noble Lord, Lord Birt, reinforced the point that the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, made, so I make no apologies for the fact that the Bill addresses this issue-it is important. There is no doubt that the wider public take a very great interest in local news, and as the opportunities and the provision contract, it is a very real loss to them. I am grateful to both the noble Lords, Lord Fowler and Lord Birt, who emphasised that dimension and said that it is an important issue that the Bill addresses.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="09120254000075"></a>I also want to address the issues about Ofcom. I emphasise that this Bill is not about expanding Ofcom's remit, it is about ensuring that we can take account of future investment in infrastructure and public service media content when considering Ofcom's duties to promote competition and protecting consumers. That is a proper obligation to put on Ofcom in this rapidly changing world, where it is obvious that it needs to take account of such opportunities. We are strengthening the Ofcom remit; we are not seeking to grow or extend it.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="09120254000076"></a>I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, who emphasised this point, that we are expecting more from Ofcom under the Bill, but, after all, she chairs a self-regulating committee, the Press Complaints Commission, so she will recognise that as a regulator, Ofcom has much to be proud of. Ofcom is an organisation that is certainly fit to take on the new and revised responsibilities that the Bill introduces. I bring to the House's attention the fact that Ofcom has been voted the best telecoms regulator in Europe by the European Competitive Telecoms Association every year since the ECTA scorecard was introduced in 2005, so it has good credentials.</p>

I was concerned about the possibility of the unintended consequences of ensuring impartiality in the provision of online news in the new consortia, when part of the consortium may involve news provision by newspapers-newspaper websites online-which, of course, are not impartial in their provision of news. We need certainty and clarity. We need to think about that at further stages of the Bill.</p>

However, we are on Second Reading and therefore discussing general principles. I sought to establish the general principles of the Bill as it concerns Ofcom.

To answer every point would keep me here until close to midnight and would scarcely win favour. In any case, I would not be doing what a wind-up speech on Second Reading should do, which is to meet the central points and give some reassurance that the Government have thought seriously about the Bill, so that we can go to Committee and refine our arguments there. However, I am not for one moment discounting the obvious fact that there are some substantial points that have created a degree of a controversy.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="09120254000079"></a>I thought earlier that the Government were being reassured about the Bill because of the extent to which those on the Front Benches were-although indicating their reservations about crucial parts of the Bill in the sanctions to be applied in defence of the copyright position-expressing broad support for the Bill. My noble friend Lord Whitty made sure that I was brought up short because he said that there would be formidable challenges on those terms. He was preceded by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller of Chilthorne Domer, who also expressed worries about that.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="09120254000080"></a>I emphasise that the sanctions are meant to be applied sensitively. I was asked whether the initial letter will be expressed in sympathetic terms. Of course we would expect that. I accept entirely what my noble friend Lord Whitty said, and the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, expressed similar sentiments. People may innocently transgress; not everybody is as knowledgeable as they should be about these matters. These companies have to write to their customers on other matters in any case. For example, if people do not pay their bill in time, the companies will write to them. We expect that the approach will be one of concern for the individual who has carried out an infringement. That does not alter the fact that the Government are convinced of the necessity for effective sanctions when the transgression is obvious, repeated and serious.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="09120254000081"></a>I am grateful to noble Lords who indicated the problem with a copyright law that goes back over 300 years, and has had limited updating since in a modern age when the capacity to infringe copyright is so readily available through technology. That is the nature of the problem we face. I recognise that in Committee we will have substantial debates about these issues. The Government's drafting of the Bill reflects the fact that in this crucial area we must safeguard the rights of the industry. We do that because of the point made my noble friend Lady Morris, the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, in his opening speech, the noble Lord, Lord Birt, and nearly all noble Lords who contributed to this debate about the significance of our creative industries. They paid due respect to their significant and rapidly growing role in the economy and to the fact that in certain areas they are among the fastest growing parts of the economy. Those rights must be safeguarded because, as my noble friend Lady Morris so graphically identified, the industry is fast-growing, but it is vulnerable to downloading without cost. That creates circumstances where a substantial part of the British economy-its intellectual and creative industries-is vulnerable. We went to the industry and looked for proposals on the way in which this issue could be resolved without the sanctions that we are

However, we could not get agreement on that position, which is why we are obliged to legislate.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="09120254000082"></a>One feature that has come out from all sides of the House in this debate is the extent to which the development of the digital economy is crucial in terms of the number of people it employs. It is important in its contribution to the economy, and is also, as my noble friend Lord Maxton and other noble Lords indicated, an enhancing facility of great moment for our people. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, for identifying the problems when the services are not available. People can engage in learning and information and have access news and educational opportunities and development at their command, provided we meet the points that the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, indicated. Resources are not part of the Bill. He will know that, separate from the Bill, we are determined to ensure that rural areas have access. Not only rural areas of Wales have limited access but other areas of Wales have it too. That is also true of England and Scotland; there can also be blind spots in urban areas. We intend to address the broad structure through this measure, but the noble Lord will know that we have already addressed the question of resources. I assure noble Lords that we will use these opportunities for expansion with great care.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="09120254000083"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester indicated the issues that arise with the digital switchover. I emphasise that we will not make the switchover for radio until there is already 90 per cent coverage in the United Kingdom and until 50 per cent of hours of radio are listened to via digital stations. We have criteria before we actually make the move. This follows on from points about the switch from analogue to digital television. I take on board his point that it is important that any changes that are made benefit people and do not shock them with a possible loss of services and extra cost. That point has to be addressed.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="09120254000084"></a>I reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, about the important dimension which she brought to the debate-I think probably uniquely-from her background and the work that she has done in the past. Of course we are concerned about harmful content slipping under the video classification radar. Music, sports and religious videos lose their exemption from classification if they depict certain content: including sexual activity, mutilation, gross violence or a number of other practices that are likely to cause offence. If unclassified videos are on sale when they should not be, it is for the appropriate enforcement authorities to take action. Those providers must also abide by other laws, the Obscene Publications Act being one of them. However, I take on board her point that the new technology gives rise to fresh issues in this area. I know that she will pursue them in Committee, but I assure her that the Government have been concerned to address these matters. That is why the Bill is framed as it is.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="09120254000085"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lucas, indicated that he hoped that those on his Front Bench would vote  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_796"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column 796</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>against Clause 17 in its entirety. I do not know whether he has persuaded them yet, but he may feel that he has some support there. The noble Lord, Lord Howard, may also have detected that there are rather varied opinions about enforcement, so I hope that these matters will be addressed with care in Committee. We on the government side will emphasise that Clause 17 is a very important part of the Bill. In fact, it is absolutely crucial to that issue.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="09120254000086"></a>I emphasise that I have very much appreciated the demonstration of commitment to and expertise on this issue, which is probably the most important of the constructive economic issues that we will address over the next few months. That is because of the potential of this industry. The Bill encompasses very big and real issues and has to address them. I do not have the slightest doubt that the digital economy is an absolutely crucial growth sector and will be in the future, and that we have to act as speedily as we can. As the noble Lord, Lord Howard, said, we are not at the forefront of provision among advanced countries. We have ground to make up, but on the basis of this Bill, we can do more than that. We can make provision which is as good as anywhere in the world, and it is crucial that we should do so. The sector is now considered to account for almost £1 for every £10 produced in the economy each year. That is how important it is, and that is why the Bill is concerned not only with enhancing the capacity for development, but also with the crucial issue of protecting certain aspects of intellectual and property rights.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="09120254000087"></a>I am mindful that I have not been able to address all the points that have been raised in the debate. The noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, raised some detailed and very important issues and I am well aware of them. They will have to be addressed in detail in Committee, and I hope that we will be able to give him the reassurances he seeks. At this stage, I do not have much proof to offer him, but we have considered these matters and I think that I have satisfactory answers to his specific points. However, this is not quite the opportunity for me to go into such detail.</p>

<a name="91202-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="09120254000088"></a>The noble Viscount and other noble Lords have indicated that we will have a most interesting and challenging Committee stage. It would not be the first time that we have conducted considerations in Committee of some intensity and at some length even when on all sides of the House the Second Reading of a Bill has been greeted with acclaim. I cannot quite suggest that this Bill has been welcomed with acclaim, but I am encouraged that all noble Lords who have spoken referred to the significance of the subject and the importance of the advance of the digital economy. It is against that background that we will go into the important details and, in one or two instances, the important principles that underlie several clauses. I look forward, along with other noble Lords, to the Committee stage.</p>

This treaty has not yet entered into force but will do so once all 27 countries have ratified it. This order is a necessary step towards the UK's ratification.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000005"></a>The principal effect of the draft order is to ensure that the powers under Section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 would be available to give effect to any provisions of the agreement and permit any expenditure arising from the SAA to be from the consolidated fund. Montenegro secured its independence in May 2006. It is the fifth country in the western Balkans to apply to join the EU and, as with all other countries in the region, Montenegro shares a troubled past. However, our task today is not to look to Montenegro's past but to debate its future and the reform process by which Montenegro can move towards the EU.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000006"></a>The UK is a strong supporter of EU enlargement, including for the countries of the western Balkans. Enlargement has been one of the European Union's biggest success stories, creating stability, security and prosperity across our continent. A larger EU gives a  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC2"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC2</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>stronger influence in shaping global action to meet today's challenges and helps business and our economy by providing access to a bigger market. We recognise, too, that it is important that enlargement is based upon conditionality; that a country may only join the EU once it has met all the criteria for membership and has undertaken the necessary reforms to do so. The implementation of the stabilisation and association agreement begins the process to a time when Montenegro might be able to start moving toward full accession to the EU; it is an important step in the fulfilment of that conditionality.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000007"></a>Montenegro has come a long way since independence and should be commended for the efforts it has made to put in place a thorough reform process. The stabilisation and association agreement recognises Montenegro as a "potential candidate" for the EU. It sets out clear stages for Montenegro's progress towards eventual EU membership via a closer partnership with the EU under the EU's stabilisation and association process. I emphasise that it is a rigorous, condition-based process.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000008"></a>The efforts Montenegro has made in implementing its interim agreement demonstrate that the prospect of EU membership accession continues to encourage reform. The most recent European Commission progress report in October 2009 shows that Montenegro has made progress on political and judicial reform, but highlights the need for further progress in specific areas such as strengthening administrative capacity and fighting corruption. It also gave a positive assessment of Montenegro's performance on regional co-operation.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000009"></a>Montenegro's SAA has now been ratified by 23 of the EU member states, as well as by the Montenegran and European Parliaments<I>.</I> A track record of SAA implementation is required before Montenegro can achieve candidate status. The avis questionnaire, which Montenegro is currently completing, will also play a key role in identifying future reforms for the country before Montenegro begins the process of opening accession chapters.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000010"></a>I am satisfied that the order is compatible with the rights contained in the European Convention on Human Rights. I commend this draft order to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09120236000011"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09120236000112"></a>Baroness Rawlings:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the order, whose purpose, as we have heard, is formally to give parliamentary approval to an EU stabilisation and association agreement with Montenegro. It is a beautiful country, proud of its long history. We never forget what the famous Montenegran writer, Milovan Djilas, wrote in <I>Land Without Justice</I>:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09120236000097"></a>"For centuries this country's social and political life was organised on a patriarchal, tribal basis in which the <I>brats</I><I>t</I><I>vo</I> (family ties) was vital".</p>

<p><a name="09120236000096"></a>Despite much modernisation, it is still a tough and brutal country that has not forgotten its old feuds, described by the Minister as a "troubled past". This only goes to endorse the importance of association with the EU.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000012"></a>The SAA provides for enhanced co-operation between Montenegro and the European Union. The agreement was signed in October 2007, following Montenegro's  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC3"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC3</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>gaining of independence from Serbia and, effectively, the former Yugoslavia. It covers a wide range of subjects, including Montenegran accession to the WTO, and promotes further regional co-operation between Montenegro and its neighbours.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000013"></a>Montenegro will be helped to conform to EU standards and to foster freer trade with the European Union and its neighbours, some of which are also undertaking similar processes. There are additional measures on co-operation to combat terrorism, border and visa controls, money laundering and people trafficking. Montenegro has declared its interest in joining the Union. The country is now recognised by the EU as a potential candidate for membership.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000014"></a>As the shadow Minister for Europe noted in another place, the SAA may not be the most controversial of treaties on European matters-I doubt that this order will face much, if any, strong opposition. However, should the order be passed, it will represent an agreement with the UK.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000015"></a>With this in mind, I have a few probing questions which I am looking forward to the Minister answering. The European Commission's Montenegro progress report for 2009 concludes that Montenegro has made progress in the political sphere, judicial field and border disputes, to name a few. The European Scrutiny Committee's report of 11<sup></sup>November stated that the Commission is preparing an opinion on the application for membership from Montenegro.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000016"></a>I have three questions. Is the Minister aware of any further developments in this regard and does she believe that Montenegro is likely to become officially a candidate of the EU in the near future? Secondly, what is her assessment of relations with Russia regarding future development in Montenegro? Thirdly, does the order act as a fast track to EU membership or does it mean that Montenegro becomes a potential candidate?</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000017"></a>I hope that we can learn from previous experience and insist on institutional reform prior to EU accession, in contrast to the accessions to the EU of Austria, Sweden and Finland in 1994, and later of Bulgaria and Romania, which led to so many complex problems and difficult decisions.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000018"></a>The EU interior Ministers have recently announced their intention to relax visa restrictions for those travelling from Montenegro to the EU. Will the Minister confirm if that applies specifically to the UK? The progress report also stated that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has deemed Montenegran compliance as generally satisfactory. Does the EU share that view? How did it reach its estimation? Does the EU have cause to believe that wanted war criminals from the Balkans, particularly from the former Yugoslavia, may be in the country?</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000019"></a>In conclusion, we on these Benches support the progression of this order, and agree that Montenegro's development in recent years has been encouraging. We acknowledge that agreement of the order could foster much more political and economic progress. I look forward to the Minister's response, especially to our questions.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC4"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC4</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09120236000020"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09120236000113"></a>Lord Dykes:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for coming to the Grand Committee to propose that the order be approved. I also thank the principal opposition spokesman for her comments, which we support, and for her questions, which should be answered today as far as is possible if that is convenient for the Government at this stage.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000021"></a>There is some feeling now, although progress has been made, that if this is going to take some time then some in Montenegro will be disappointed about the progress. However, if we look back at how long it took for a large number of member countries from different parts of the European Union territories that were previously candidates for entry, the current rate of progress does not necessarily reflect badly on anyone.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000022"></a>As we know, all the western Balkan countries now wish to join the EU as soon as possible and that is widely considered objectively to be a good thing, not just because there is something automatic about it but because of the turbulent history of that area. My noble friend Lord Ashdown, who is here and who may contribute briefly to this discussion today, is a great expert on more than just one part of the former Yugoslavia. The encouraging feature in Serbia itself, for example, appears to be that the previously atavistic and strident nationalism of the transitional period has now been replaced by a much more positive pro-European and pro-EU feeling there among the population in general and among the leading politicians. That, too, bodes well for the stability of the region.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000023"></a>Montenegro itself broke away from Serbia in 2006, as the Minister said. That was originally resisted by Serbia but was then accepted, which is also progress. It is a very small territory in terms of population, a complicated territory and a beautiful country, as the opposition spokesman said, with well under 1 million people, including the minorities from Serbia and Albania. Some anxieties have been expressed by those who know more about the country-I have never been there myself; I hope to go in due course-that there is an element of unruly freewheeling bandit capitalism there that is manifesting itself in various ways. That may need observation to see how it develops but it is often a feature of countries in transition, something that has been seen in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. I do not wish that to sound condescending; it is just one of those things that happen in those parts of the world where a history of such activity has been manifest in the past.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000024"></a>Montenegro is potentially a good candidate to be a member of the European Union, and many British people and other tourists and visitors from other member states have proclaimed with some enthusiasm the merits of a tourist industry in what is an extraordinary country, particularly with the Adriatic Sea border areas that many foreigners now visit.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000025"></a>The situation bodes well in due course but more work needs to be done. There seems to be a willingness among leading Montenegran politicians and parties to engage with this process in an energetic way. That looks good for the future, provided that there is constant reassurance from the Commission, the other institutions and the European Parliament itself that their monitoring processes are effective, realistic and comprehensive,

Time will tell, and time is needed before that happens.</p>
<h5><a name="09120236000099"></a>4 pm</h5>

<p><a name="09120236000026"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09120236000114"></a>Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon:</b> I rise not in any sense to oppose the order but to support it. It gives me great pleasure to see Montenegro reach this point. I have known the country since 1995 and its extremely wily, intelligent, clever and effective leader, Milo Djukanovic, for at least that long. As the noble Baroness said a few moments ago, it is an unbelievably beautiful country with a remarkable people. The ties with Britain go well back to Tennyson's great eagle of liberty. Indeed, if you to Cetinje, the old capital of Montenegro, you will find that the old British legation is still there. It is still right in the centre of what was at the heart of one of the real issues of freedom of the 19th century.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000027"></a>I have four points to which I hope that the Government and the European Union will pay particular attention. Some have been covered already and I apologise if I cover them again. The first is the rule of law. It is the great gift of Europe to install the rule of law in countries such as these. I remember an old Bosnian coming to me and saying, "Is it true that when we join Europe it'll be like when the Austrians were here? We pay too much tax and the Government will pay it back". I said, "Yes, it will", to which he said, "That's fantastic. If that happens, it will be unbelievable". That was his reason for wanting to join.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000028"></a>There is what my noble friend described as "bandit capitalism". Perhaps not everyone would use that phrase but there is a certain tradition that goes back deep into Montenegro's past known as the Hajduk. The Hajduk is a sort of Robin Hood character-a rather romantic figure who lives in the mountains and robs but gives to the poor. I think it would be fair to say that this is a key issue for us to keep a close eye on. I recall going to see a very senior figure in the Montenegran Government in about 1997 or 1998 when we were trying to persuade Montenegro not to part company with Milosevic. I said to him, "You're going to need more money". He replied, "Yes, but it's not like your Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Brown, who has to raise taxes if he needs more money. All we have to do is smuggle more cigarettes to Italy". That was a long time ago and I feel certain that things will have changed, but it will require a strenuous application of the conditionality of the European Union if we are to achieve the necessary moves forward on the rule of law.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000029"></a>The second issue-here I echo the words of the noble Baroness who spoke for Her Majesty's Opposition-concerns war criminals. For six years I was next door on the other side of the river Drina, and for four years I was next door on the other side of the river Drina in Bosnia, when catching Radovan Karadzic was our first priority. I have absolutely no doubt that he was hidden by the Serbian Orthodox Church in the monasteries of Montenegro. To say that they did not co-operate would be an understatement. In fact, the Serbian Orthodox Church did all that it could-at least, with the knowledge if not the connivance of the Montenegran Government-to make sure that Karadzic  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC6"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC6</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was never brought to justice. My view is that the outstanding fugitive, Ratko Mladic, is not in Montenegro. I think that he is probably being protected either in Moscow or unofficially by certain renegade elements of the Serb security services. However, I would want to be assured that Montenegro fulfilled its full conditions under the ICTY legislation for the capture of war criminals.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000030"></a>The third issue is the Moscow element, referred to by my noble friend. This is a small country-the population is about 600,000-and it is not difficult for it to be bought pretty well lock, stock and barrel by the Moscow mafia. Today, almost all the coast from the very beautiful coastal town of Budva past Sveti Stefan and east and south is owned by Moscow mafiosi, one of whom-I hope that I shall not be too insulting-is undoubtedly the very powerful figure of the mayor of Moscow, who owns some of the most prime areas there. I hope that we make it explicit to the Government of Podgorica that they must adhere to the rule according to European standards, not Russian standards.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000031"></a>My penultimate point is about the Muslim population. It is very easy for us to forget that there is a large Muslim population outside Bosnia in the Sandžak and the area around Rožaje in Montenegro. By the way, the Montenegran Government have been extremely good at understanding the importance of preserving ethnic harmony with the Muslim minority in Albania. I have no word of criticism for their policies in this regard, but it is an area in which we would wish to support them and help them to ensure that they continue to observe those policies. They always have done so and the policies stand in stark contrast to, for instance, the policy that was followed in neighbouring Serbia-at least in the days of President Milosevic.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000032"></a>My final point is the most important one. It gives me real pleasure to see Montenegro reach this point, which I hope will be reached by all other countries of the western Balkans. But there is a problem. The precedent created by the breakaway of Montenegro from Serbian Montenegro, as it was originally, is being followed actively and explicitly by Milorad Dodik, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Srpska, as a precedent to follow in Bosnia-with a deliberate intention, explicitly stated by him, that if he is to make Bosnia dysfunctional in the same way as, in effect, happened in the Serbia-Montenegro state, the consequence will be that the Republic of Srpska could follow Montenegro and split away. That would be a catastrophe and would lead us straight back to war. If we were to tolerate that, it would mean that the European Union was prepared to lay its hands to the policy of Radovan Karadzic in dividing up Bosnia, as it were by absentmindedness or worse.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000033"></a>The noble Baroness referred to "bratstvo", which is the word for brotherhood. In the old days of Tito it was "bratstvo i jedinstvo"-brotherhood and unity. That has been followed more recently by that other Balkan saying which has dominated-"Da komsiji crkne krava", which means, "My neighbour's cow is dead, that makes me happy". That has been the policy. I hope that we will return to a policy of bratstvo i jedinstvo within the European Union. But that means-and I hope that the Minister will respond to this  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC7"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC7</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>directly-that we must make it explicitly clear to the Government of Podgorica that their passage further down the road to Europe would be blocked if they did not support European policy in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that if they continued to give tacit encouragement to cessationism by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Srpska, Milorad Dodik, that would effectively block any further passage towards membership of the European Union. If we allowed Dodik to use Djukanovic as the model for breaking up Bosnia, whatever we do to help Montenegro towards a European future, we will be denying Bosnia a similar future. I hope we will take a very strong line on that.</p>

<p><a name="09120236000034"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="09120236000115"></a>Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead:</b> I thank noble Lords for their questions, to which I shall attempt to respond.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000035"></a>The issue of the rule of law ran through much of what has been said, relating to organised crime, corruption and how we anticipate this being managed in the negotiations. As I said in my opening remarks, the EU accession process is rigorous, condition-based, and not time-bound. Before accession negotiations begin, justice and home affairs issues are front-loaded in the SAA process. Many noble Lords will be aware that we learnt that lesson from the Bulgarian and Romanian accession process, which was subsequently adapted to comprise a more rigorous assessment process to ensure that candidate countries absolutely meet the criteria for membership. The EU has designated a significant chapter of the negotiations to the judiciary and to fundamental rights. That is important, as noble Lords said. This means that issues falling within this area will be much more thoroughly scrutinised than was the case in the past.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000036"></a>On the related issue of people trafficking and organised crime, I re-emphasise that the accession track is rigorously condition-based. That applies to Montenegro even at this stage of the process; people do not always realise that it applies at this stage. Before Montenegro can open accession negotiations, it needs to demonstrate a track record of SAA implementation, as well as obtaining a positive opinion from the European Commission. We need to recognise that we have learnt lessons from previous accessions, and the introduction of the chapter on justice and the rule of law is very important. The Commission will now have to consider its response and form an opinion on the avis. We expect this to take several months.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000037"></a>I turn to the issue of the Schengen visa. As we know, the UK is not part of Schengen. The agreement applies to Schengen countries to liberalise visas for Montenegro, so that does not apply to the United Kingdom. However, the UK will be reviewing Montenegro's visa requirements in 2011.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000038"></a>Russia's relationship with Montenegro is a good one; it is a very popular holiday destination for the Russians. I have no concerns to draw to the attention of Members on this issue at this time.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000039"></a>I understand that there has been a satisfactory level of co-operation with the ICTY, and there are no outstanding issues. The noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, raised a question on how it reached its estimation: it is based on having satisfactory reports from Prosecutor Brammertz's office in the ICTY-as the Committee  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC8"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC8</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>knows, that is very important-and on our own diplomatic reporting on the matters. Are there wanted war criminals in Montenegro? We have not been given to suspect the existence of any indicted criminals in that country.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000040"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, also raised the issue of the Prime Minister. I am aware that there have been allegations linking the Prime Minister to organised crime and corruption; I understand these relate to the 1990s-I am sure noble Lords are well aware of the circumstances-when the country was subject to international sanctions. However, I am not aware of any connections which give us reason to doubt his Government's willingness to improve their record in tackling corruption and organised crime. Their willingness seems strong, such is their seriousness in beginning this process towards, hopefully, accession. Indeed, I also understand that a case against him in the Italian courts has recently been dropped.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000041"></a>The Government strongly support the European perspective on Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the part it has played in encouraging politicians to agree on necessary reforms. The UK supports the goal of transition from the OHR to the EU special representative. However, I was there myself in the early summer and we consistently stated then, and continue to do so now, that this can only happen when the 5+2 objectives and conditions required for transition have been fully completed. I agree we must stick very firmly to that position. We continue to urge Bosnian politicians to seize the opportunity presented by the EU-US initiative to reach agreement on completing these 5+2 objectives and conditions. The Foreign Secretary visited Sarajevo in November, and urged Bosnian politicians to focus on making the reforms necessary for the closure of the Office of the High Representative, which would facilitate clearer movements towards EU integration.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000042"></a>I turn to the issue of regional co-operation. It is significant that Montenegro recognised the independence of Kosovo on 9 October 2008: that is a signal of its seriousness in trying to be an effective and co-operative regional actor. We also recognise that the latest progress report we have seen mentions regional initiatives and efforts as significant, welcome developments for the country.</p>

<p><a name="09120236000043"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="09120236000116"></a>Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon:</b> I am most grateful to the Minister for her answer. I fully understand the British Government's position on Bosnia. I support it and am delighted that the British Government follow that position. However, with great respect, the point I was trying to make is that there is not much point in our pressing for Bosnia to fulfil the conditions laid down by the European Union if Montenegro, seeking to join the European Union, actively undermines our policy in Bosnia. By giving comfort to Milorad Dodik, the Prime Minister of Republika Srpska, who is pursuing a policy which not only blocks Bosnia's passage to the European Union but encourages secessionism and the break-up of the state, we are allowing Montenegro to act in a way that is contrary to European policy and to the policy of the British Government.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000048"></a>Noble Lords who have followed the reform of legal services regulation will be aware that it has long been the Government's intention to see the new Legal Services Act 2007 regulatory regime go live at the beginning of 2010. The sixth Legal Services Act commencement order, which we intend to bring into force in January 2010, will see the Legal Services Board assume its full regulatory powers and approved regulators authorising individuals and bodies to carry on reserved legal activities. Provisions relating to the Office for Legal Complaints and alternative business structures will be commenced at a later stage.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000049"></a>The 2007 Act contains provisions needed for the new regulatory regime to be effective, such as the repeal of current mechanisms for authorising legal professionals, transitional arrangements for those currently authorised, and consequential amendments to primary legislation which ensure that references in primary legislation to the authorisation of legal professionals take account of the new regime.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000050"></a>The 2007 Act also provides powers to make subsequent amendments to primary and secondary legislation to accommodate the changes being brought about by the Act. These two orders use those powers to make amendments to existing legislation to ensure that it will be compatible with the changes being commenced in the sixth commencement order.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000051"></a>I turn first to the Legal Services Act 2007 (Consequential Amendments) Order 2009. This order is made principally under Sections 208(2) and (3) of  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC10"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC10</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the Legal Services Act 2007, to which I shall refer as the 2007 Act. Section 208(2) allows the Lord Chancellor to make any supplementary, incidental, consequential or transitional provision necessary to give full effect to the Act. Section 208(3) allows the Lord Chancellor to amend, repeal or revoke existing legislation, again as necessary to give effect to the Act.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000052"></a>As I mentioned in my introduction, one of the key elements of the new regulatory regime is the requirement for persons to be authorised by approved regulators if they are to carry on reserved legal activities. This will replace a number of existing provisions that allow persons to carry on legal activities by virtue of their professional titles or by definitions such as "authorised advocates" and "legal representatives". Schedule 21 to the 2007 Act amends references in primary legislation so that they refer to the new authorisation regime, once commenced in early 2010.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000053"></a>However, Schedule 21 does not include changes needed to secondary legislation, such as references to "authorised advocates" and "appropriate officers" in the Coroners Rules 1984 and the definitions of "legal representatives" and "professional legal advisers" in the Family Proceedings Rules 1991. This order amends such references in secondary legislation to ensure that they refer to the authorisation regime established under the 2007 Act.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000054"></a>The order similarly amends references to "legal representatives" in the Court of Protection Rules 2007 and the Mental Health Review Tribunal for Wales Rules 2008. As these rules were made after the Session in which the 2007 Act was passed, the amendments could not be made using the Section 208 powers and had to be made instead using the powers in the original enabling Acts for those rules-Section 78 of the Mental Health Act 1983 and Section 51 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The necessary statutory consultation process, with the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council, the Lord Chief Justice and the Judicial Appointments Commission, was followed for the amendments to these rules.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000055"></a>The order also updates the definition of "qualified lawyers", specifically in relation to compromise agreements. This ensures that fellows of the Institute of Legal Executives may continue to advise on compromise agreements if they become managers of legal disciplinary practices, a possibility introduced by changes made to the regulation of solicitors' practices by the 2007 Act in March 2009.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000056"></a>The order also makes minor consequential and technical amendments to primary and secondary intellectual property legislation when the responsibility for the registers of patent attorneys and trade-mark attorneys passes from the Intellectual Property Office to the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys and the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys respectively. For example, references to "agent" will be replaced by "attorney" and references to "individual" will be replaced by "person", recognising that entities as well as individuals can apply for registration.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000057"></a>Finally, the order amends a number of outdated references to "taxation", "taxing officers" and "taxed" in the Charities Act 1993. The Legal Services Act replaces most outdated references to "taxation" in  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC11"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC11</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>primary legislation, primarily the Solicitors Act 1974, with the more modern terms relating to "assessment". However, no provision was made for the references in the Charities Act, and it has therefore not been possible to commence related amendments to other legislation. This order amends the Charities Act, and other related amendments will now be commenced<I>.</I></p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000058"></a>As the order amends a range of existing legislation, it was important to consult other government departments and key stakeholders, such as the Law Society and other professional bodies, at an early stage and gain their approval. The Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, the Judicial Appointments Commission and the Administrative Justice and Tribunals Council also gave their approval to the amendments.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000059"></a>I turn now to the Legal Services Act 2007 (Functions of an Approved Regulator) Order 2009. Again, this order is necessary as a consequence of changes that will be introduced with the sixth Legal Services Act commencement order. The order amends an inadvertent drafting error in the 2007 Act which, if left uncorrected, would result in the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys being unable to regulate trade-mark attorney work undertaken outside the UK when it becomes an approved regulator at go-live. Correcting the error will also ensure that the scope of regulation applying to trade-mark attorneys mirrors the scope of regulation applying to patent attorneys.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000060"></a>New Section 83A of the Trade Marks Act 1994, as inserted by Section 184 of the 2007 Act, replicates a drafting discrepancy between the two statutory instruments which govern the registration of patent attorneys and of trade-mark attorneys. Unlike the instrument relating to patent attorneys, the definition in the trade-mark order of trade-mark attorney work does not include "or elsewhere". The result is that the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys would not be able to regulate trade-mark attorney work undertaken outside the UK, while its counterpart, the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys, is able to regulate patent work outside the UK. It is not the policy intention of the 2007 Act to make such a distinction, so the order corrects the oversight and ensures parity between the regulation of patent and trade-mark work.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000061"></a>The amendment is being made under Section 69 of the Legal Services Act, which provides for the Lord Chancellor, by order, to modify or make other provision relating to the functions of an approved regulator or any other body. As required by Section 69, the order is being made on the recommendation of the Legal Services Board. The board is obliged to consult whenever it recommends a statutory instrument to the Lord Chancellor under these provisions. Accordingly, a consultation paper, together with a draft order and draft impact assessment, was circulated to consumer organisations, regulatory bodies, other professional representative bodies and other key stakeholders during the summer. Six responses were received, which either provided no comment on or approved the proposed amendment.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000062"></a>These orders are required to reflect the changes introduced by the 2007 Act and to ensure consistency of terminology across different pieces of legislation.  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC12"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC12</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>It is important that the orders are made to coincide with the sixth Legal Services Act commencement order, so that references to the new regulatory regime are consistent when it is commenced in early 2010. It is also important to note that the orders do not expand the scope of existing policy or extend the categories of person who can carry out reserved legal services. I commend these orders to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09120236000063"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="09120236000120"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, for that lengthy explanation of the two orders, and assure him that I will be considerably briefer; I want to make only two or three points. He dealt with the instruments in inverse order, so I will follow him and start with the Legal Services Act 2007 (Consequential Amendments) Order 2009. I was not involved with that Act-I think Lord Kingsland dealt with it-but I remember its passage. As the Minister made clear, the purpose of the instrument is to amend both primary and secondary legislation. It is obviously appropriate that secondary legislation be amended by secondary legislation but, in the main, we regret Henry VIII powers-they are obviously used here-that allow the amending of primary legislation. I say "in the main"; having looked at what the consequential amendments order tries to do, I think that it is probably right that the powers were there and were used. On this occasion, we are content with the order and what it is seeking to do. We think it is right to ensure, as the noble Lord put it, that members of bodies such as ILEX who are managers of legal disciplinary practices are able to continue to advise on compromise agreements as set out in the order. I have no further comment to make about that.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000064"></a>The second order regarding the functions of an approved regulator appears at first sight to be innocuous. The Minister made clear that it amends an inadvertent drafting error in the Legal Services Act 2007. He ought to think long and hard about those words, "inadvertent drafting error", and remember the remarks of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, on the second day of the Queen's Speech debate when he referred to the torrent of legislation emanating from departments, particularly the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office. If there had not been quite such a torrent of legislation and the Government had confined themselves to properly drafted Bills dealing with single subjects-for which I commend the Bribery Bill, which we are dealing with next week, and which was also commended by the noble and learned Lord-we might not have had those inadvertent errors that have involved the Government having to come back with obscure orders of this sort later on. Those are my only comments on this and I hope that the Minister will take them on board, particularly with regard to future orders that he might want to put before us.</p>

The concept is still being maintained, with assessments and costs officers, so why we have to modernise the terminology, I am not sure. I have no objection to either of these orders going through.</p>

<p><a name="09120236000068"></a>I apologise on behalf of the Government for the drafting errors. I do my best to ensure that we make no errors, but I am afraid that we do.

<p><a name="09120236000074"></a>As noble Lords will recall, Sir Andrew Leggatt's review, <I>Tribunals for Users: One System, One Service</I>, lead to the creation by the Government of the Tribunals Service in 2006, and this was followed by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007. The 2007 Act provided for the first-tier tribunal and upper tribunal, creating a unified appeal structure.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000075"></a>These orders form a further part of a series of tribunal transfers into the unified appeal structure under the 2007 Act, which commenced in November 2008. This has since been followed by subsequent transfer orders in 2009.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000076"></a>I shall deal, first, with the draft Transfer of Tribunal Functions Order 2009. It provides for the transfer of the gambling appeals tribunal, adjudication panel for England, claims management services tribunal and immigration services tribunal into the general regulatory chamber of the first-tier tribunal. This chamber commenced work on 1 September 2009 and the functions of these tribunals are already allocated under the existing chambers order.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000077"></a>The order also provides for the transfer of the information tribunal into the first-tier tribunal-general regulatory chamber-and the upper tribunal, with the question as to which one of them is to exercise the functions in a particular case being determined by or under the tribunal procedure rules. Appeals from all these jurisdictions will be heard in the administrative appeals chamber of the upper tribunal.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000078"></a>The jurisdiction of the family health services appeal authority is transferred to the first-tier tribunal-health, education and social care chamber. A separate order, which is subject to the negative resolution procedure, will amend the existing chambers order to assign the functions of this tribunal to the chamber.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000079"></a>The transfer of the family health services appeal authority, as well as the tribunals transferring into the general regulatory chamber, is to take effect on 18 January 2010.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000080"></a>The jurisdiction of the financial services and markets tribunal is transferred to the upper tribunal and the former tribunal is abolished. An amendment to the chambers order will provide for the former jurisdiction of the financial services and markets tribunal to be dealt with by the tax and chancery chamber of the upper tribunal.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000081"></a>The jurisdiction of the pensions regulator tribunal in Great Britain is transferred to the first-tier tribunal and the upper tribunal. Currently, that jurisdiction arises under the Pensions Act 2004, and amendments to that Act made by the order provide that those cases will be heard by default in the upper tribunal. An amendment to the chambers order will provide for those cases to be dealt with by the tax and chancery chamber of the upper tribunal.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC15"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC15</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000082"></a>The pensions regulator tribunal in Great Britain and the financial services and markets tribunal transfer into the unified structure with effect from 6 April 2010 to coincide with the start of the financial year. In all cases, the tribunals are abolished and the existing judges and members are transferred into the first-tier tribunal or upper tribunal as appropriate. This is essential for ensuring that a good service is maintained for users and existing specialist expertise is protected.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000083"></a>The Amendment to Schedule 6 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 Order 2009 adds the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to the list of tribunals that are transferable into the unified structure created by the 2007 Act. The transfer of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal was consulted on for 12 weeks from August 2008. The majority of consultation respondents were in favour of the transfer and, on 8 May 2009, it was announced that the tribunal would transfer as proposed.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000084"></a>The Transfer of Functions of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal Order 2009 provides for the transfer of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal into the first-tier tribunal. The transfer will take effect on 15 February 2010. Appeals from the immigration and asylum chamber of the first-tier tribunal will be heard in the upper tribunal. A separate order, which is subject to the negative resolution procedure, will amend the existing chambers order to establish an immigration and asylum chamber of the first-tier tribunal and an immigration and asylum chamber of the upper tribunal, and assign functions to the chambers as appropriate.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000085"></a>Again, in common with previous transfer orders, transitional provisions ensure that cases currently being heard by the transferring tribunals will not be adversely affected by the transfer. Directions and orders made by a transferring tribunal prior to each of these orders coming into force will continue in force as if they were directions or orders of the first-tier tribunal or upper tribunal as appropriate.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000086"></a>I turn to the detail of the orders. Articles 1, 2 and 3 of the draft Transfer of Tribunal Functions Order 2009 provides for the abolition and transfer of each tribunal into the unified structure on the dates outlined above. All the tribunals are transferring into chambers within the first-tier and upper tribunal that have already been created and are currently in operation. Article 4 of the order provides for existing judges and members of each tribunal to be transferred to hold offices in the first-tier tribunal and in the upper tribunal as appropriate. Article 5 provides for consequential amendments to, and repeals and revocations of, primary and secondary legislation, and transitional and saving provisions. These are set out in full in the schedules.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000087"></a>The Amendment to Schedule 6 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 Order 2009 amends Schedule 6 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 by adding the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to the list of tribunals that are transferable into the unified structure as created by the 2007 Act. Following on from that order, Article 2 of the draft Transfer of Functions of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal Order 2009 transfers jurisdiction  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC16"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC16</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of that tribunal into the first-tier tribunal in its entirety and abolishes the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000088"></a>Article 3 of the order provides for immigration judges of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to be transferred in as first-tier tribunal judges, and for designated immigration judges of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal to be transferred in as first-tier tribunal judges and deputy judges of the upper tribunal. Senior immigration judges and non-legal members are transferred in as judges and members of the upper tribunal respectively.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000089"></a>Article 4 of the order provides for the current Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 and the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Fast Track Procedure) Rules 2005 to transfer to the immigration and asylum chamber of the first-tier tribunal and to have effect as if they were tribunal procedure rules upon commencement, as mentioned earlier. I confirm that the power to make procedure rules for this chamber will in future lie with the Tribunal Procedure Committee.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0002.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000090"></a>The Tribunal Procedure Committee was created under the Act and is chaired by a Lord Justice of Appeal-currently Lord Justice Elias-and includes representatives from a number of organisations, including the Administrative Justice &amp; Tribunals Council, the Bar Pro Bono Unit and the Free Representation Unit. Honourable Members may be aware that we had originally proposed that the procedure rules for immigration and asylum should continue to be made by, and under the ownership of, the Lord Chancellor. However, following consultation on this we have decided that it is appropriate that this power should rest with the Tribunal Procedure Committee.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000091"></a>Article 5 of the order provides consequential amendments to, and repeals and revocations of, primary and secondary legislation, and transitional and saving provisions. These are set out in full in the schedules and include the revocation of Section 26(6) of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, which inserted Sections 103A to E into the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. Those sections of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 established the higher court review and reconsideration process following an appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000092"></a>The schedules also provide for the revocation of Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, which established the higher court filter review and reconsideration process. This process enabled a disappointed party, following an appeal to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal, to apply to the tribunal for reconsideration of its decision. If the tribunal decided not to reconsider its decision, the party could then go to the higher courts to seek an order for reconsideration. This will be replaced by the onward appeals process provided by Section 11 of the TCE Act, whereby initial appeals will be dealt with by the first-tier tribunal and the reconsideration process will be replaced by onward appeals to the upper tribunal. Those wishing to appeal to the upper tribunal will be required to seek permission to appeal from the first-tier tribunal in the first instance.  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC17"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC17</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Where the first-tier tribunal refuses to grant permission, a party may then apply for permission directly to the upper tribunal. We will, however, maintain the current bar on onward appeals against procedural, ancillary, preliminary or interlocutory decisions and decisions on bail applications. We will be bringing forward an excluded decisions order under Section 11(6) of the TCE Act for this purpose.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000093"></a>The Government are committed to ongoing transformation of our tribunals, placing the user at the heart of the service. The unified system will have greater flexibility in absorbing new work and responding to fluctuations. The order before the Committee today is another step in achieving this process. I commend the draft statutory instruments to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="09120236000094"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09120236000126"></a>Lord Henley:</b> My Lords, again I thank the noble Lord, Lord Tunnicliffe, for such a detailed explanation of these orders. I do not know whether he was using the same speech as was used in another place when these orders were taken-I am not even sure whether they have been taken in another place-but I noticed that he referred to us as "honourable Members" rather than "noble Lords". So it possibly was lifted from another place.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120236000095"></a>We have dealt with a number of these transfer of tribunal function orders over the past few months, some of which were controversial-the noble Lord will remember when we were dealing with war pensions-and some of which were negative orders, as the noble Lord pointed out. Are these the last of the transfer of function orders to be brought forward under powers created by the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007? In dealing with that point, given the difficulties of dealing with secondary legislation, would it not have been possible for these to have been brought together into one order on which we could have had one simple debate and got it over at once?</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000001"></a>That point is underlined by the Amendment to Schedule 6 to the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 Order 2009. Again, would it not have been possible to get all these matters right at once, rather than bringing forward an amendment as early as this? I hope the Minister will give an assurance that we will be able to deal with these matters in a more felicitous manner in the future. A raft of orders going through in this manner is not the easiest of way of dealing with the issue and, to some extent, brings the process of secondary legislation into disrepute. Having said that, we welcome the range of tribunals-the gambling appeals tribunal, the claims management services tribunal, the information tribunal, the immigration services tribunal, and so on-that are moving over and we wish them well under the new system.</p>

<p><a name="09120247000002"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09120247000031"></a>Lord Thomas of Gresford:</b> I am grateful to the Minister for his statement. We have always supported the concept of the tribunals being unified into one body, and the division into a lower or first tier and an upper tier has been very acceptable. We welcome, in particular, the transfer of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal into its own chamber of the first-tier tribunal. That is a very good step. One reason that we welcome it is that the previous tribunal had procedures which  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC18"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC18</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>favoured the Home Office over the applicant. I noted that the Minister said that the applicant-I think that he meant the applicant-was to be placed at the centre of the new tribunal procedures. I hope that that is right and that his rights are considered.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000003"></a>Having regard to the unsatisfactory nature of the procedural rules in the old system, we also welcome the fact that the procedural rules are now to be put in the hands of the Tribunal Procedure Committee. When the consultation paper, <I>Immigration Appeals: Fair Decisions; Faster Justice</I>, was published by the UK Border Agency in 2008, it asked for comments on the rule-making powers for the new chamber. As a result of representations made to it, the border agency decided that the Lord Chancellor would no longer make and amend the procedure rules but that the Tribunal Procedure Committee would have that job.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000004"></a>The Tribunal Procedure Committee has consulted on draft rules which it has promulgated, and the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association has responded in a document dated 23 November 2009. It raises certain very serious issues, and I should like to have a response one way or the other on some of them. It mentions reporting determinations, which I do not need to follow up on, but it also refers to evidence in the upper tribunal, the European Court of Justice and fast-track provisions. It makes some very worthy comments and I shall read the Government's response to its submission in due course.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000005"></a>However, ILPA also states that, whereas previously there was a case management review hearing, nothing in the draft rules that are now promulgated maintains that hearing. It is a hearing of great advantage in determining what issues the tribunal has to determine. There has been no consultation on abandoning case management review hearings. There is undoubtedly concern that, for many years, applicants and appellants have faced endemic and systemic obstacles in persuading the Home Office to disclose its case on the relevant issues with sufficient clarity and sufficiently in advance. There are a number of aspects to that, but basically the problem is that presenting officers are told that they can change the basis of the Secretary of State's decision, including raising new matters, without reference to the original decision-maker, so long as notice is given. That is to say that the applicant will receive reasons for the refusal of his application, but they can be changed by the Home Office when the matter goes on appeal.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000006"></a>The Home Office has said that, as a matter of policy, the "reasons for refusal" letter will not necessarily identify all matters that the Secretary of State for the home department proposes to raise at the hearing, and that new issues may well be raised much less than 48 hours before the hearing, including at the hearing itself. It is fundamental, and contrary to basic justice, that a person bringing an appeal against a decision based on particular reasons should know, and know plenty of time in advance, if those reasons are to be fiddled about with and changed to the advantage of the Home Office. If that system has become, as ILPA says, the practice in the old tribunal, I hope that when this comes before the first-tier or upper tribunals we will not have a similar system in operation, whereby reasons can be changed at any moment, even up to the  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC19"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC19</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hearing itself. That is one aspect that I would like some response to, not necessarily now but certainly in due course. I want to hear from the Home Office why it has had this practice in the past and whether it will persist with it in the future.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000007"></a>The other matter about which ILPA has considerable concern is that the draft practice directions that have been put forward do not include the provisions that exist with respect to children and vulnerable adult witnesses. Children involved in asylum appeals are likely to have experienced serious physical and psychological harm and ILPA considers that their treatment should be addressed by a further practice statement in the immigration and asylum chamber of both tribunals. This matter is the subject of a Private Member's Bill coming before your Lordships shortly, dealing with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is very important when we are dealing with practice rules for a new tribunal and for a new procedure that the articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child should be followed, so that, in all decisions affecting children, whether directly or indirectly, the tribunal must ensure that its procedures satisfy the highest standards in relation to children's rights. We all know of the detention of children that is taking place in the Yarl's Wood detention centre in asylum cases; that is highly unsatisfactory. Concern for children should apply to all judicial administrative hearings.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000008"></a>The new procedure rules, when they are produced, should be flexible in order to give positive effect to the rights of children in terms of their immediate and longer term best interests, principles of non-discrimination and effective participation rights. Such practice directions exist in the Family Division of the High Court and in the criminal courts, and it is essential that they apply in asylum and immigration cases. I hope the Minister will be able to give me some satisfaction, either now or at some later stage, that these principles will be followed in the practice rules put forward by the tribunal. Having said that, we do not object to these orders and will not oppose them.</p>

<p><a name="09120247000009"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="09120247000032"></a>Lord Tunnicliffe:</b> My Lords, I apologise for using an inappropriate form of address. I shall scrutinise my speeches with even more care in the future to make sure that does not happen. I had the same thought as the noble Lord, Lord Henley-can there be any more of these orders? We are considering how best to transfer the remaining tribunals, many of which have few or no cases, and will do so when the benefits for users and the Tribunals Service can be gained. We have one further appeal to consider under the Transport Tribunal, which was not transferred, and I will consider when to bring this forward. Are they the last? I think the answer is that they are almost the last. I share the noble Lord's reaction.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000010"></a>Would it not have been possible to have put all the transfers into one order? A large number of tribunals have been transferred. Perhaps it is slightly unfair to call it a messy system, but this Act addressed a very diverse system, and it has been appropriate to do this in phases, with more than one order, to ensure that the system could properly support the transfers.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000011"></a>The points raised by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, seem to be generally welcoming. I did say the systems were designed to bring the applicant to the centre of the system. As he pointed out, we responded to consultation and transferred the rule-making process from the Lord Chancellor to the Procedure Committee. I think the noble Lord was responding, in a sense, to a Procedure Committee consultation of 21 November, and I acknowledge the importance of the points he made. Equally, given their importance, it would be much more satisfactory if I were to respond to them in writing, which would give officials and Ministers time to consider his points in some depth.</p>

<p><a name="09120247000016"></a>The census is the most important source of population statistics, and is the only source of statistics for both small areas and minority population groups. For over 200 years it has provided the underlying information which successive Governments have used to devise policies, take decisions and deliver services.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000017"></a>Billions of pounds of public funding and resources are allocated to local and health authorities each year using census-based information.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000018"></a>Since the 2001 census, a new independent body that reports directly to Parliament, the UK Statistics Authority, has been created. The ONS, the executive office of the authority, will lead on the census in 2011. I can therefore present the census order today confident that its content has been produced not by Government but by the ONS, following extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders and with rigorous question testing. The independence of the census is essential if we are to build public trust in official statistics.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000019"></a>I will now take you through the detail briefly. Under the Census Act 1920, an Order in Council is necessary to prescribe the date of the census, the people to be counted, the people responsible for making a census return, and the information to be given in the census returns.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000020"></a>The date of the census will be 27 March 2011. Everyone will be recorded at the place where they are usually resident. Household members who are temporarily absent on census night also need to be counted. Some additional information will be collected on household visitors, which is essential if the ONS is to ensure that visitors are properly counted at their usual residence. The person responsible for making a census return is to be the householder or joint householder, but any individual aged 16 or over may make a separate individual return. The information to be given in the census returns is covered by Article 6 of the order and is set out in Schedules 2 and 3. Regulations, to be laid before the House in spring 2010, will set out the detailed content of the census and will contain copies of the various questionnaires.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000021"></a>On the information to be given in the returns, the ONS has carried out extensive consultations with central and local government, including members of all-party parliamentary groups, with community groups, with businesses, with academia, with the third sector and, most importantly, with the general public.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000022"></a>The ONS has also carried out in-depth question testing between 2003 and 2009, building on the valuable experiences and the lessons learnt from previous censuses. This is to ensure that the proposed questions in the 2011 census are justified, both in terms of the need for the information itself and of their acceptability to the public.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000023"></a>Under the terms of the Census Act 1920, some items-those in italics in the draft order-may only be included in the census if they are approved by an affirmative resolution. It is these that we are debating today. Only a few are new to the census, and I will now deal with these specifically.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC22"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC22</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000024"></a>First, people born outside the UK will be asked about their date of entry into the country and, for those who arrived in the past year, the length of their intended stay. There is an increasing need for more accurate and reliable statistics on migration in general, particularly on short-term migration. The census will therefore provide information on shorter-term migrants and temporary foreign workers, and help to give a better understanding of their needs and their impact on local labour markets and demand for local services.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120247000025"></a>Secondly, people will be asked to state the country of any passport that they hold. Government departments and the European Union require statistical data on the citizenship of the population. The question asks about passports rather than about citizenship. Asking directly about a person's citizenship confuses respondents, who may mistake the question for one of national identity. People give much more consistent answers to a question about passports, with the result being easier to use to produce the necessary citizenship-related information.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000001"></a>Thirdly, people will be asked to register another address where they actually spend time. Such information will be particularly useful to local authorities which need to know the number of people who stay within their area and use local services during the week but who have a usual residence elsewhere.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000002"></a>Fourthly, people will record their national identity in addition to their ethnicity. Noble Lords will be aware of the amendment that was voted down in the other place to add a tick-box for "Cornish" in the national identity question.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000003"></a>Fifthly, people will be asked about their main language, allowing central and local government better to target language support and resources to those sections of society unable properly to access public services due to language barriers.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000004"></a>People whose main language is not English will be asked to state their proficiency in speaking English, with an additional, similar question about proficiency in Welsh in Wales. This will give a greater insight into the need for language training and community work to combat any possible discrimination and social disadvantage suffered by people whose language skills could be improved.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000005"></a>All other items requiring affirmative resolution cover topics that were included in the 2001 census, but I shall refer specifically to two where there have been some slight changes to the information to be collected. The question asking people to assess their general health during the past 12 months has now been expanded to a five-point scale ranging from "very good" to "very bad". This information is for the planning of health policy and the provision of services, particularly for the elderly. The question on qualifications has a new tick-box to indicate any foreign qualifications held.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000006"></a>Other questions deserve mention either because the proposed wording has been revised since the last census or because particular interest has been shown by noble Lords. Following the Civil Partnership Act 2004, the traditional census question on marital status has been expanded to include response categories for civil partnership status.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC23"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC23</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000007"></a>Noble Lords may be aware of lobbying campaigns by Kashmiri, Sikh and Cornish groups, for example, on the ethnicity question. It has not been possible to include a tick-box for every ethnic group category requested. Each request was compared against a detailed set of prioritisation measures before the final recommendation was made. This identified strongest need for additional response categories for "Gypsy and Irish Traveller" and "Arab", which have therefore been included for the 2011 census.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000008"></a>People can record their ethnicity in whichever way they choose by writing this in the write-in spaces provided. All such responses will be counted. In the case of Sikhs, there is the additional option of ticking the specific "Sikh" box in the religion question. The Government are satisfied that the census is compliant with national legislation on race relations and any international conventions on the protection of national minorities.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000009"></a>I shall refer briefly and specifically to the proposed question on religion. A number of noble Lords have made representations to the House during previous debates and directly to the ONS on the proposed question. In particular, concerns have been expressed that the question on religion is leading and overstates the extent of religion within the country. The proposed question measures an affiliation with a religion and not belief or practice. It provides information which can be used together with responses to the ethnicity question to monitor equality and discrimination by identifying minority ethnic subgroups that may otherwise be missed, particularly those originating from the Indian subcontinent, in terms of their religion.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000010"></a>As a result of concerns expressed, the ONS tested alternative questions on religion. The testing concluded that no single question on religion can be worded in such a way as to capture suitably information on religious belief or practice and to justify losing comparability with the 2001 census. There is a strong user requirement for comparability with the data from the 2001 census. The proposed question on religion therefore remains unchanged, and remains the only question in the census for which a response is voluntary.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000011"></a>There is a new question asking for the number of rooms designed for use as bedrooms. This will measure overcrowding and assist in the planning of housing investment and the addressing of social and economic need. There is also a new question asking about the type of fuel used for central heating, to provide data on basic housing standards and fuel poverty and deprivation.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000012"></a>Despite some strong user demand for an income question, testing by ONS revealed that including a question on one's income leads to a significant drop in response rates. There were also concerns over the quality and accuracy of the income data collected as part of the test.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000013"></a>There was a strong requirement for information on sexual identity in order to monitor equality. After investigation, the ONS recommends that a compulsory census is not a suitable means to collect information on sexual identity, again because of the quality of the resulting data, and including the question is likely to  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC24"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC24</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>reduce the overall response to the census. Although the ONS does not recommend that a question on income or sexual identity be asked on the census, it recognises the user demand for this information and is taking steps to provide some data through other sources.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0003.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000014"></a>I shall say a few words about security and confidentiality. The ONS has an excellent track record when it comes to security. Additional measures are being instigated and all internal and external threats that could affect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of census information are being carefully managed. The information will be protected by strong physical and electronic data security arrangements.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200910/ldhansrd/text/91202-gc0004.htm"/>


<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000015"></a>Census information will be used only for statistical purposes, and ONS will not release any personal-level information. Noble Lords will know that it is a criminal offence to unlawfully pass on personal census data. Census information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and the Data Protection Act.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000016"></a>The Government's policy is that data from questionnaires should be kept secure and closed to the public for the next 100 years, with the paper questionnaires being destroyed in a controlled and secure manner. The resulting electronic data will be registered under the Data Protection Act 1998, and the arrangements for handling the information during processing are to be the subject of an independent security review.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000017"></a>I turn to the cost of the census. The 2011 census in England and Wales is expected to cost around £480 million over the 10-year period. In its report on the 2001 census, the Treasury Select Committee recommended that any future census should be justified in cost-benefit terms. The ONS business plan to the Treasury for the 2011 census clearly demonstrated the unique value of the census and that the benefits of having the information far outweigh the costs of its collection. The identified cost benefits exceed £700 million, compared to a cost of £480 million.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000018"></a>More than £1 trillion is allocated to local authorities and to NHS primary care trusts in the 10 years between each census, on the basis of census information. The census cost equates to just 87p a year per person, which we believe demonstrates excellent value for money. The per capita costs in the UK are less than those for many other European countries that carry out similar censuses, and considerably less than the costs in America.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000019"></a>In summary, this census will meet crucial requirements for the statistical information that Governments and others cannot do without. The burden on respondents will be kept to a minimum and the questions have been fully tested and found acceptable and compatible with both UK and EU legislation. I am confident that we have the right census package for helping to shape tomorrow. I therefore commend the draft order to the Grand Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="09120252000020"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="09120252000029"></a>Lord Bates:</b> I thank the Minister for that thorough presentation of the detail of the order before us. I can keep my remarks brief in response as many of the issues were covered this week, as I am sure the Minister is aware, in the debate on this issue that took place in the First Delegated Legislation Committee in another place. That debate raised a number of the issues which  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC25"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC25</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>we would otherwise have wanted to explore today, but I do not wish to detain the Grand Committee too much.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000021"></a>A number of questions were asked by my honourable friend Nick Hurd in the First Delegated Legislation Committee, but I wish to take this last opportunity to scrutinise the order and to elicit responses from the Minister, if possible, to his fair and reasonable questions. I should like to go over again the questions on which we seek clarification.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000022"></a>The first question relates to costs, to which the Minister has just referred. The costs of the census in 2001 were £214 million; it is projected that the costs will rise to £482 million in 2011. Clearly this increase in costs represents a significant increase over the rate of inflation. As not many more homes will be covered, and given that the public finances are in a state of distress, would it not be appropriate to revisit that figure to see whether it can be reduced? However, before pursuing that line, can the Minister respond to the specific question of whether the increase in costs can be explained?</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000023"></a>The second question asked by my honourable friend Nick Hurd in the Committee in another place concerned the assumptions used in awarding the contract to the American company Lockheed Martin. What assumptions were made about the response rate for the 2011 census? Some data show that the census response rate in 1991 was 96 per cent and that in 2001 it had fallen to 93.9 per cent. An essential critique of the order before us is that, by lengthening the form and increasing the number of questions and their potential complexity, the level of response might be lower, and presumably when the contract was awarded to Lockheed Martin an assumption was made. Could that assumption be put on record?</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000024"></a>During the previous census there were seven times more calls than expected to the helpline which had  been set up to assist people in completing the  form-2.6 million in total. Given that the new census form is longer and more complex, what assumption has been made about the number of calls that might be made to the call centre, and what steps are to be taken to ensure that the extraordinary delays which people experienced previously are not experienced this time round?</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000025"></a>This will be effectively the first census carried out during the broadband era, if one might loosely describe it as such, and a lot of people will use computers to submit their response. There was e-mail help and technical support in 2001 but that system, too, was inundated. Can the Minister say what the response is likely to be in 2011 and what provisions have been made to ensure that people receive the help that they need with the forms to ensure as high a completion rate as possible?</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000026"></a>The next question relates to the overall costs of those two factors, and this was one of the assumptions to which I should be very interested to hear the answer. What assumption is being made about the number of respondents who will complete the form online? That is an interesting point because my intuitive judgment is that the figure will be significantly higher than was the case in 2001. If that is so, again, intuitively   


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC26"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC26</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>one would expect that if more people complete the form online, there will be a need for fewer enumerators to knock on doors and fewer pieces of paper to be printed and processed, and that should surely reduce and not lead to a doubling of the costs.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000027"></a>Fourthly, my honourable friend Nick Hurd asked whether the Minister could publish the response rates to the 2009 rehearsals which the ONS and the Government conducted in a number of areas. This would place important findings in the public domain and would, had they been available, have informed the debate and perhaps allayed some unnecessary fears. Some have suggested that if the Government had found the response rates and the responses during the 2009 rehearsals helpful to their case, they might have deployed information received from them in support of these orders. Therefore, the fact that no information has been made available to the House on those rehearsals raises some concerns about confidence.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120252000028"></a>Fifthly, can the Minister tell the Committee roughly what proportion of responses will be extrapolated from fields that have been left blank? I understand that statistically what happens is as follows: if all 36 questions on the form have not been responded to-if, for example, five have not been answered-the enumerator extrapolates or guesses what the response would have been. Clearly, given that the Government are placing a great deal of store on the accuracy of data, if a significant amount of the data is the result of guesswork, that will raise a serious concern. Will we be guessing 20, 30 or 40 per cent of the answers? If, for example, as we were told, more than £1 trillion of taxpayers' money is to be directed by these data to health and local authority spend alone over the next 10 years, can we be confident that the data informing these choices are correct? Is it possible that the cost arising from misdirecting and misallocating funds could be much higher than the cost of the exercise itself?</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000001"></a>Does the Minister agree with some of the expert opinions that have been expressed about the complexity of the data? Is she aware of the remarks of Professor Rees, a leading UK statistician, to the Public Accounts Committee on 19 November, when he said that as you expand the number of questions there must be a deterrent effect on response? Has she noted those comments? Could she respond to them?</p>
<h5><a name="09120258000083"></a>5.30 pm</h5>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000002"></a>Is the Minister aware of remarks that were made by Sir John Kingman, who was chairman of the Statistics Commission when the 2001 census was undertaken? He wrote to my honourable friend Nick Hurd on 28 October 2009, saying, in commenting on the nature of the census preparations for 2011:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09120258000079"></a>"It all happens with the best of intentions. The ONS consults government departments, local authorities and a variety of public and private organisations hungry for information on all sorts of matters. The result however is that the unfortunate citizen is presented with an array of questions which few will have the time or inclination to take seriously. Some will put in frivolous answers"-</p>

<p><a name="09120258000075"></a>we have the famous example of the Jedi faith, apparently the fourth largest religious group in the United Kingdom, which came out of the 2001 census-</p>
<ul><a name="09120258000081"></a>"while others will just put the form behind the clock on the mantelpiece",</ul>



<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC27"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC27</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="09120258000076"></a>and forget it. He continues:</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="09120258000080"></a>"Yet the statisticians take the results seriously, and provide the interested organisations with statistics with little indication of the inevitable margin of error. In 2001 the National Statistician even announced an exact figure for the total population, a figure which later proved to be greatly in error. You will recall the problems with the population count in London and Manchester. If the Census cannot accurately count the population, how reliable can it be on matters such as number of bedrooms?".</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000003"></a>In the previous census, 38 people were prosecuted for non-completion of forms, but 7 per cent of the households that the forms went to did not respond. What assumptions has the Minister made about the number of people who are likely to be prosecuted this time around, especially as the powers that were referred to are rather draconian? The ONS has asserted, and this was cited by my honourable friend Nick Hurd, that it will be,</p>
<ul><a name="09120258000082"></a>"employing appropriately trained specialist field staff, dedicated solely to following-up cases of reported non-compliance and conducting the necessary formal Interviews Under Caution".</ul>
<p><a name="09120258000077"></a>That is pretty heavy stuff, as is a £1,000 fine. It would be useful to know what assumptions have been made.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000004"></a>What steps have been taken to stop citizens falling victim to phishing attacks? Apparently this is an IT term, although I was not familiar with it. It relates to these spam e-mails that we receive purporting to be from a bank, a building society or the Inland Revenue service. What has the ONS done to avoid such attacks from fraudsters?</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000005"></a>How many census enumerators will be hired for the 2011 census? How many of them will be trained in the issue of cautions under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act in order to chase non-compliance? As was stated earlier, they are going to have the power to formally interview under caution. If those data are to be used afterwards in a court of law, they would need to follow precise guidelines. If the person is being questioned under caution, would they not also have the right to some legal representation? They may be vulnerable people who would be intimidated not only by the form and its length but by overzealous enumerators coming down to ask why they had not responded.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000006"></a>I turn finally to overcrowding and bedrooms, which has excited great interest. I have even heard suggestions from student groups that census parties will be held on 27 March, where tens, if not hundreds, of people will be invited round to certain houses with one or two bedrooms and will all be listed, complete with their names and dates of birth, as being at that address at that time. That seems to us a step too far, a level of meddling way beyond what is necessary.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000007"></a>Will the Minister give us a specific example of where knowing the sex, date of birth and name of the person who was staying in a property overnight on 27 to 28 March would be used to inform an aspect of government policy? In other words, when would it be useful to ask that question? When, without an answer to it, would the Government not be able to know X or Y? I am sure that it is a fairly easy question and that the Minister will be able to give many examples, but it represents a level of infringement of privacy that many people of a liberal disposition would find very uncomfortable.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000008"></a>I am grateful to the Committee for bearing with me while I have put these questions again. I hope that the Minister can offer reassurance.</p>

<p><a name="09120258000009"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="09120258000088"></a>Lord Maclennan of Rogart:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving us a clear exposition of the importance of the census as an indicator of factual information that is utterly vital to determining, among other things, the distribution of public expenditure. I also suggest that this is quite an important debate, because, as the noble Lord, Lord Bates, said, it is the last public opportunity for consideration of these issues before the process goes into its concluding stages. He raised many points which I shall largely take as put so that the Minister can focus on them, but I have a number of questions and points of my own.</p>

<p><a name="09120258000010"></a>The consultation to which the Minister referred has been extensive, which is entirely appropriate, and I am glad that it has been conducted in the way that it has. It would be of interest to know whether the stakeholders to whom she referred, particularly the institutional stakeholders, had any comments to make about the costs. I was slightly surprised to read in the Explanatory Notes that no impact assessment had been produced for the order since no impact on the private or voluntary sector was foreseen. I am surprised not least because of the responsibility of those in communal establishments for providing information or for ensuring that information is provided. That includes hospitals, care homes and prisons-although they are not private institutions. There are cost implications for those complying with it. I accept that, for individuals, half an hour would probably be a sufficient allocation of time to reply even to the enlarged questionnaire.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000011"></a>The second broad policy question which I would like to raise-I am not aware that it has been raised in earlier debates-concerns the frequency with which the census is held in this country. There has been a 10-year census for a long time, I think, since it was introduced in 1801. However, I have noticed that a substantial number of countries, including Australia, Canada, Eire and New Zealand, conduct a census every five years. I do not know what extra cost that involves, or indeed whether some of the costs in the 10-year census might be obviated by having one more frequently, but it is fair to say that we are living in a very rapidly changing society. To some extent, that is reflected in the enlargement of the questionnaire to four pages from three-a 25 per cent increase-in the 10-year census. If we are making judgments about the statistics which it will yield, perhaps we should think about whether a census ought to be conducted within a shorter timeframe in future, so that the responses of Government to many of the issues to which the Minister referred could be more immediate and less "after the event".</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000012"></a>The cost, which has been extensively referred to, is not inconsiderable. The Minister referred to the cost benefit, but £482 million is a very substantial sum. I would be grateful if the Minister would say a little more about the extent to which competition has been, and can yet be, involved in conducting the necessary preparations for this census. The competitiveness of contractual offers should be borne in mind, as well as the robustness of the testing of the possible conduct of  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC29"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC29</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the individual parts of the exercise. The census has produced a highly valued series of statistics historically, and this country has a good record on that which is generally recognised. It would not be proper to imply that I am seeking in some way to cut corners. Nevertheless, with very substantial contracts of this kind, it would be helpful to know about the process-who conducted it and how it was scrutinised-not necessarily because changes will be made on this occasion, but perhaps if they have been made in the process which has run in the 10 years since the last census.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000013"></a>As far as the range of questions is concerned, I have no great problem with the enlargement of the number of questions in principle because, as I have said, there have been considerable changes in the mobility of our society, in the ownership of second homes, and in the movements into and out of this country. The only question about that latter point is whether the personal information being sought in respect of visitors is really required or whether it is unduly intrusive. I have no doubt that the Minister will have a view about that.</p>
<h5><a name="09120258000084"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000014"></a>Many of the questions seem a little arbitrary, but no doubt they were thrown up by the consultations. For example, it is interesting that a question about the ownership of cars is there but not one about the ownership of IT equipment, which has expanded rapidly in the past 10 years and has become a principal mode of communication. How has this come about? How were these decisions taken? I am sure that there is a natural and proper reluctance to enlarge the questions, partly because the bigger they are the less incentive there is to make a complete return, or indeed to make a return at all.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000015"></a>There are some other new questions-for example, in respect of ethnicity. There is the category of "Arab" but no category of "Arab/White" or any kind of mixture. That, again, seems slightly arbitrary. Furthermore, as this country becomes more and more ethnically integrated, it raises a question about what it is proper to declare. I have a son-in-law who is half Bengali and half Irish; he lives in this country and will be expected to respond to the census. I am not entirely sure how he should answer these questions. When it comes to the point, although they are a little young to do it this time around, I wonder what my grandchildren will feel is an appropriate answer. These questions seem to be becoming a little sensitive. Although I understand the motivation to take account of the cultural backgrounds and interests of those sectors, we should reflect on this issue from now on because the younger generation is considerably more mixed ethnically than my generation and the one that followed it.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000016"></a>The question about a person's workplace address is open to subjective questioning. Individuals will have to assess what is their central workplace. Some people do a number of different jobs; some people may never attend the headquarters of the business to which they are attached; some people, such as contracted plumbers, move around all the time; others, of course, can conduct a great deal of their work from home but also work elsewhere. I am not sure how revelatory that question is or could be.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000017"></a>The principal questions that I have in mind are, admittedly, of a general and broad nature. However, they raise issues about how the census is compiled. The Minister has helpfully indicated broad categories of people who were consulted, but some of the issues about national identity and whether you speak English very well, well, not very well or badly are entirely subjective. Some people who have spoken nothing but English all their lives might be regarded by others as speaking English very badly, but not necessarily by themselves.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000078"></a>Although I can see the point, the answers to these questions will not necessarily be entirely convincing. There has to be a certain awareness of the breadth of the questions and a certain amount of self perception is required to answer them in statistically reliable ways. I thank the Minister for her introductory remarks.</p>

I was very interested in the remarks I did hear and the speeches of both noble Lords opposite. I suppose I should be proud to be the only representative of the Back-Benchers in the House of Lords to attend this erudite debate.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000019"></a>I do not have too much to say. but I wish to raise the issue of confidentiality and the Freedom of Information Act. The noble Baroness assured us that the security could not be breached, which one has to accept. However, I remember that during the problems-if I can call them that-in the House of Commons over expenses, the Members of the House were assured that they were covered by privilege. However, it turned out that they were not covered by privilege; the information they were given about the security of the details, which they had given in confidence and expected would not be revealed to the general public, proved to be completely and utterly wrong and has caused certain problems. I hope the noble Baroness can reinforce the assurance she has given this afternoon that the information is definitely confidential and cannot be released to anyone.</p>

<p><a name="09120258000020"></a>My second point is on ethnicity.</p>

We need those important assurances.</p>

<p><a name="09120258000023"></a>I will move on to ethnicity. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, raised this, and it was right and proper that he did. We are becoming obsessed with two things: ethnicity and sex, which I will come to in a moment.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000024"></a>The drive in this country should be for unity; instead of multiculturalism, we want integration. We want people to be happy that they are in Britain. We want people to feel British, and to feel that they belong here, rather than anywhere else. They should feel that they are a part of us, no matter what their colour, creed, religion, or anything else. I feel strongly that the motivation of Government, and indeed of Parliament, should be towards integration. I am not at all sure that asking people to define their ethnicity does that.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0004.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000025"></a>My wife and I had a recent experience with our local authority in Reading-not about the census, but about the electoral registration form. We decided to test the market, so to speak, to see what would happen. I put my nationality down on the form as Welsh, and my wife said she wanted me to put hers down as English. Lo and behold, when the register was proclaimed and I got the form for next year, there it was. My nationality-Welsh-was fine. I could be Welsh, but my wife could not be English. That was very worrying. The local authority would not accept "English", so it put "England". This, of course, was a ridiculous answer to the question of nationality, because there is no such nationality as England. For three years, I have been trying to get the local authority in Reading to accept English as a nationality. I still have not succeeded-they keep blaming it on a computer. I do not know whether English is to be accepted as a nationality by all authorities now, bearing in mind that it is on the census as such, and I would be interested if the Minister could comment on that. Perhaps it is a little unfair to ask her to do so, but nevertheless if she could I would be most obliged. My wife is very offended, and I am sure there are many other people who are offended that they cannot be English. As a Welshman, I am standing up this afternoon for the English.</p>

It is just conceivable that there are people, and I would certainly count myself one, who regard themselves as glad to be Scottish, British, and European. I do not expect the noble Lord to be enthusiastic about that proposition, but it might be of interest to have such a multiple identity disclosed in the census returns.</p>

<p><a name="09120258000029"></a>I am glad that the question on income has been dropped. It is clear that there was a lot of discussion. I think that the Government perhaps favoured our being forced to answer questions on it, which would have been very difficult. A lot of income comes from the black economy. You cannot really expect people to put, "This is my income from work but then, on the other hand, I do some other jobs on the side and this is how much I earn". I am not sure, therefore, that one would get an accurate view of people's incomes. People have all sorts of income, some of which they forget or do not want to put on a tax return. They will not fill in a census which, although they are told it is confidential, may lead to the taxman getting hold of some income that they have not declared to him. I am glad also that the question on sexual proclivities has been dropped, because there are so many of them. It would require a very long list of questions to get a true answer.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000030"></a>However, I am concerned that these intrusive questions should not be put about by other means. While they will not be included in the census, it is clear that there is curiosity among the Government about people's incomes and how they behave themselves sexually. I would like the Minister to give me the relevant assurances.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000031"></a>My final point echoes one raised by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan. Our population since the end of World War II has risen by more than 15 million, much of it taking place in the past five years. Consideration should be given to taking censuses at shorter intervals. It might not be as dear as one would think, because a lot of surveys about various things are being done up and down the country in the interim, and they cost money, too. While we might on the one hand incur additional costs because the census would be conducted at shorter intervals, we could save money on the other because there would be less need for individual surveys on various items. In the hope of one or two assurances from the Minister, I shall sit down.</p>

That was as it should be because, as the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, said, this is an extremely important subject. Like the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, I am a little disappointed that more Members of the House were not interested in it, because, as the noble Lord, Lord Bates, said, the census will influence not millions or billions but trillions of pounds of spending by the public sector during the next 10 to 12 years. So it is big stuff.</p>

<p><a name="09120258000034"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, asked about costs and whether there was a possibility of a reduction in them in the light of the economic climate that we are  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC33"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC33</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>experiencing. Costs have been drawn very tightly by the ONS and its contractual programme. It has already spent 20 per cent of that sum of £480 million, 50 per cent is further committed to fixed-price contracts and any further reduction would impact on the quality of the census population estimates. I go back to the point, which we have all appreciated, that the quality of these statistics will influence an enormous amount of spending over the next decade. Therefore, the quality has got to be right. We must not skimp or cut corners, as the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, put it, on quality-it is the main point that we have to keep our eye on.</p>

I hope that answers more fully the noble Lord's question.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000037"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, also asked about the justification for the cost as a general question. The full 2011 census business case has been produced, which will fully justify the census investment. For a subset of the different uses, the benefit has been assessed as exceeding £700 million. This is thought to be a significant underestimate of the total benefits.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000038"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, talked about the assumptions that were made about the level of response when awarding the contract to Lockheed Martin. We believe that we will get a 94 per cent overall response, and that was the assumption when awarding that contract.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000039"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Bates, Lord Maclennan and Lord Stoddart, raised the issue of security and the awarding of the contract. The contract for the census was awarded to Lockheed Martin UK as it offered the best value for money in an open-procurement scheme carried out under European Union law and EU procurement directive. The company has a good track record on census work, having supported the 2001 UK census. All persons acting in any capacity for the UK Statistics Authority in the conduct of the census will be covered by the same stringent confidentiality restrictions as are applied to members of the Office for National Statistics themselves. There are severe penalties, as the noble Lord, Lord Bates, was saying, for breaches of census confidentiality laws. No Lockheed Martin employees will have access to the data.</p>

I shall go into that a little more. Lockheed Martin UK is the prime contractor. It has engaged a number of specialist UK and EU subcontractors for the different components of the contract. The main ones are Polestar for the printing-so the ONS would not necessarily be appropriate there-UK Data Capture for the scanning and the data processing, Cable and Wireless for the communications and the data centre, bss for the contact centre, Logica and Steria. I hope that answers the noble Lord's question.</p>

These arrangements include that all data processing will be carried out in the UK, no data will leave or be held at any point outside the UK, all data are the property of the ONS and only UK/EU-owned companies will have access to the personal census data.

<p><a name="09120258000044"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, asked about response rates for the recent census rehearsal. The responses are still coming in so the number is increasing, but at the moment they are at around 35 per cent. This is lower than hoped, although we have to remember that this, unlike the census, was a voluntary exercise. The ONS anticipated a much lower response than we will get in 2011, because a compulsory response will be much higher. After a promising start with response rates ahead of expectations, returns are now levelling off and lag behind expected levels. But the rehearsal is voluntary, and known hard-to-reach areas were selected for the rehearsal, which also tips the result. The exercise was not spread across, as it were; those areas were selected for the rehearsal as being hard to reach.</p>
<h5><a name="09120258000086"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000045"></a>Follow-up activities have concluded with census collectors calling on households that have not responded in order to obtain a response, and this follow-up has increased the response rate considerably. A number of measures have been taken to rehearse the actions that we will take in 2011 to increase response rates, and research is now under way to discover why response rates are lower than expected.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000046"></a>Another question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Bates, was how many people are expected to respond online. The current assumption is that around 25 per cent are expected to do so. Perhaps I may give noble Lords a few comparisons. Canada achieved 18 per cent in 2006. Scotland offered online completion for its rehearsal in March 2009 and had an 11 per cent internet response rate without any real publicity campaign advertising that the internet was available. However, in  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC35"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC35</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the England and Wales rehearsal, only around 9 per cent of returned responses have been made via the internet. Again, there was little publicity about the internet option. ONS is building the system to cope with 6 million returns. If more people try to use the online system at once than the system can cope with, new users will be asked to try again later. This is called "graceful deferral". However, the answer to the noble Lord's original question about assumptions is 25 per cent.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000047"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, also asked how many of the data are estimated-he rather bated me by using the word "guessed"-as opposed to actual. He may be thinking of a figure that was quoted during a recent Public Accounts Select Committee by Professor Rees. The professor now accepts that the figure was wrong and has requested that a change be made to the Public Accounts Select Committee transcript. Six per cent of people did not return a census questionnaire in 2001. On top of this, 4 per cent of census data were missing from the returned forms and had to be imputed. This means that 10 per cent of the total census data set had to be imputed, not 40 per cent. Therefore, we are saying that the estimate was 10 per cent in the 2001 census, not 40 per cent.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000048"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, asked about published response rates from the rehearsal. At present-they are still coming in-the figure is 35 per cent. He also asked about the assumptions made about calls to the helpline and what steps are being taken. Many steps have been taken to reduce the likelihood of a crisis of calls to the contact centre. In addition, there will be a self-help website, reducing the burden, we hope, on the telephone contact centre. So we are hoping to learn from the lesson of 2001.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000049"></a>The noble Lord talked about the complexity of the forms and asked whether that reduced the response rate. He asked why, for example, the questionnaire was so long. Widespread consultation by the ONS shows that there is a demand for far more questions than could possibly be accommodated. As the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, said, the number of pages per person has gone up from three to four, but this is due partly to making the layout of the pages clearer. The number of columns has been reduced from three to two, which makes the form easier to complete. The 32-page booklet for households contains forms for six individuals. In 2001, the booklet had forms for five individuals. Therefore, fewer households will need to request further forms from the ONS.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000050"></a>The issue of visitors has also been raised. Visitors had always previously been counted but not in 2001; before 2001, full details were collected. In 2011, only a small set of questions will be included in order to reduce the burden on the public. We are asking the question about visitors to enable an accurate count. We believe there was an undercounting in 2001 because the fact that people were visiting homes other than their own was not taken into account. We have learnt this key lesson from 2001; the question about visitors on the night is important.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000051"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, referred to the 2001 census not accurately counting the population and asked how this would be dealt with in 2011. There are  


<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC36"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC36</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>more questions about visitors, residents, second addresses and so on, which will enable a better, more accurate measurement, and there will be a much better follow-up to non-response. We are focusing the enumerators on those hard-to-count areas. They will physically go to people in real time and say, "Have you any problems? Are you able to fill in your form? How can we help?" That will, we hope, institute a far better follow-up than in 2001. Local liaison will identify hard-to-count areas and we will increase the hours spent on follow-up to non-responding households. In that way, we will develop an improved register.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Bates, referred to 7 per cent of respondents not completing a form but only a few being prosecuted, and asked what steps we are taking to improve the situation. There will be a dedicated non-compliance staff to strengthen the process. In 2001, it was part of the regular field staff's responsibility to caution people, but this time there will be a dedicated non-compliance staff and prosecutions will be pursued in cases of persistent refusal to respond.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000053"></a>The noble Lord said that the 2001 e-mail support was inundated and asked how provisions could be made to improve it in 2011. Online help is available and is expected to reduce demand on public help facilities. E-mail queries will not be supported in 2011. I shall write to the noble Lord on that. I am confused by that answer and he may well be too. I shall make sure that he has a written answer.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000054"></a>On the question of what steps ONS has taken to avoid spam e-mails, ONS will never request information from the public via e-mail and we will make this publicly known. I was asked how many enumerators we envisage for 2011; the answer is 35,000. I do not have at hand the numbers who will have the right to caution, but there will be a dedicated team within those enumerators with that right.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000055"></a>Why do we ask the question about the number of bedrooms? It is to provide a more accurate and comparable measure of overcrowding. The two older measures of overcrowding were the space standard and the rooms standard. These can now be expanded to include the bedroom standard. This is explained in the Government paper <I>Tackling overcrowding in England: An action plan</I>, published by CLG in December 2007.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000056"></a>The charity Shelter has urged the Government to use the bedroom standard to measure overcrowding. Overcrowding, as noble Lords will know, is an indicator of housing deprivation. Living in overcrowded conditions is associated with adverse personal and social health effects. Information will be essential for taking forward work on decent homes. There is also a direct link with the allocation of improvement grants for local authorities. The question will help to ensure that resources are directed to the areas of greatest need.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000057"></a>The noble Lord also asked about dealing with frivolous answers-for example, the Jedi issue in 2001. It is a legal requirement to complete a form correctly. However, if a person believes themselves to be a Jedi knight, the ONS must make use of those data. ONS publicity nearer to the census will aim to counter any such campaigns arising by highlighting the benefit to communities of having an accurate census.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000058"></a>I hope that that has answered the noble Lord's questions. If I have left any out, we will look at <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

<p><a name="09120258000059"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="09120258000101"></a>Lord Bates:</b> That was masterful. It was a wonderful answer to a series of complicated and focused questions. I am very grateful to the Minister.</p>

<p><a name="09120258000060"></a><b><a name="91202-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="09120258000102"></a>Baroness Crawley:</b> I thank the noble Lord. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, asked why there will be no impact assessment. As no business or voluntary body will be required to undertake any duty that the ONS believes might prove detrimental to their work, delay their normal day-to-day business or place an additional cost upon them other than asking the manager of any commercial establishment to hand out or collect questionnaires to any usual residents and then complete a short questionnaire in respect of their establishment, the ONS believes that the 2011 census impact on the private or voluntary sector will be minimal. The noble Lord talked about it taking half an hour to complete a form; I have seen in my briefing reference to 10 minutes, but we will see. An impact assessment will be published before the census regulations are laid in the spring of 2010, so there will be one before the regulations.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000061"></a>Other countries have a five-yearly census, and the noble Lord highlighted those countries. Given our highly mobile population, particularly considering the money being allocated, why would we not have a five-yearly census? There were proposals for a five-yearly census in 1976, 1986 and 1996, but they were all rejected on cost grounds. The ONS is currently reviewing the option beyond 2011, so there will be a review of how we take it from here, given the issues that the noble Lord raised about the great changes in our society-the electronic changes, the ethnic changes and the way our country looks now compared with how it looked 10 years ago. There will be a review of whether a 10-yearly census is the way forward.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000062"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, asked about stakeholders being consulted on costs. Stakeholders were widely consulted on the pros and cons of different options. Population-estimate quality is paramount. This cost and this level of investment are required to provide data of a profoundly excellent quality.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000063"></a>The noble Lord asked about competition for preparations in order to reduce costs. Fifty per cent of the census costs are for outsourced services, all of which have been subject to full competitive tendering. If the noble Lord wants more information on that, I shall be happy to correspond with him.</p>
<h5><a name="09120258000087"></a>6.30 pm</h5>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000064"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, took as an example the Arab tick-box and asked why it should not say "Arab/White" or "Arab/Mixed". He reflected with us on what it will be appropriate for people to tick both now and in the future, given our increasingly mixed community. At present, we say that people should tick the mixed or multiple options. There is always a space to write in, so if people think that none of the options refer to them, they can always use the blank write-in space, and that will have to be used as part of the statistical dissemination.</p>




<notus-date day="2" month="12" year="2009" textMonth="Dec"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC38"></a><b>2 Dec 2009 : Column GC38</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000065"></a>The noble Lord talked about questions relating to national identity and spoken English-for example, "How good is your English?"-and asked how subjective and not necessarily convincing answers could be measured. It is true that if English were not my first language, I might think that it was better than someone else considered it to be. The main purpose of the national identity question is to encourage participation in the census by allowing respondents to express their identity in a manner that is meaningful to them. English language proficiency has been well tested. A lot of surveys and testing have been carried out by the ONS and have shown that information of sufficient quality has been provided for the respondents. Therefore, it may not be perfect but it is of a sufficient quality.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000066"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the workplace address where people have more than one job, and he quoted the contract plumber who moves around. People should give the workplace address for their main job, or state that they have been based at home in the case of the plumber who moves around. This will be made clear in the instructions within the question.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000067"></a>I was asked how the questions were chosen. The key requirement for the 2011 census is to provide a robust estimate of the population count and a benchmark for key population statistics on a consistent and comparable basis for small areas and small populations. The specific criteria used by the ONS for judging the priority for topics to include in the census are set out. User need is one; others include data needed for small geographies of populations, a lack of alternative sources to the census, and UK comparability-there is a need for UK-wide outputs. Continuity with previous censuses is also very important. A lot of users want continuity; they want to see trends over 10, 20 and 30 years to decide what services they need to provide. Respondent burden and costs are criteria that are taken into account, as are operational requirements, population-based requirements, international recommendations, equality legislation and use for coding and derivations.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000068"></a>I think that I have already dealt with the issue of the Lockheed Martin employees.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000069"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, was concerned about the confidentiality of the census data. Personal census data are kept confidential at all times and released into the public domain only after 100 years. The ONS takes very seriously the confidentiality of any individual's information and it has a 200-year track record of maintaining census confidentiality. The information is used only for statistical purposes, and anyone unlawfully disclosing personal census information will, as we have said, be liable to prosecution. The noble Lord referred to the recent troubles in another place. However, the data are even exempt from the Freedom of Information Act under Section 40 of the Statistics and Registration Service Act. Confidentiality is written into primary legislation. All persons acting as agents for the UK Statistics Authority in the conduct of a census will be covered by the same stringent confidentiality restrictions as apply to census officers themselves. There are penalties for breaches.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000070"></a>Completed questionnaires will be posted back or returned securely online. They will be seen only by those census staff responsible for processing data.

The paper questionnaires will be destroyed in a controlled manner. Some specialist researchers are allowed supervised access to record data under licence, but not until they have signed confidentiality agreements. I hope that that answers the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000071"></a>The noble Lord has said that government data have been lost; that is true. He said that he would need assurances that data will not be lost by the ONS or by contractors. The ONS has a two-year history of protecting personal data. It is an utmost priority for it to continue to ensure security. Any possible threats have been assessed and tested to destruction, but obviously there are still possibilities. We shall just have to keep a very

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000072"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, asked whether data will be stored on discs or memory sticks. All USB ports on computers with access to census data will be disabled.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000073"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, asked whether he could be identified as Scottish, British and European. The national identity question on the census form will allow multiple responses.</p>

<a name="91202-gc0005.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="09120258000074"></a>I hope that I have covered most of the questions that noble Lords have put. I thank them for an important debate, and I am sure that we will meet again when the regulations appear, should this order go through.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="09120235000004"></a>The Economic and Financial Affairs Council will be held in Brussels on 2 December 2009. The following items are on the agenda:</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="09120235000007"></a>Ministers will discuss regulations establishing three European supervisory authorities (ESAs): a European banking authority, a European insurance and occupational pensions authority and a European securities and markets authority. At the June European Council the UK supported the establishment of a European systemic risk board (ESRB) and the three new ESAs. The Government will now be looking to ensure those agreements are upheld.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="09120235000009"></a>VAT: Draft directive on reverse charge on emission allowances and certain goods-the council will seek a general approach on a draft VAT directive regarding an optional and temporary application of the reverse charge mechanism in relation to supplies of certain goods and services susceptible to fraud. The presidency has tabled a compromise proposal which includes emissions allowances, mobile phones and computer chips and extends the application until June 2015. The Government support the draft proposal.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="09120235000011"></a>Savings tax directive-ECOFIN will be asked to reach political agreement on proposed amendments to the savings tax directive, which is the main EU instrument for tackling cross-border tax evasion on savings income, by automatic exchange of information. The proposal closes loopholes in the directive and extends its scope to cover income substantially equivalent to savings interest, such as income from life insurance products and low risk securities. This and the following items have strong links to the international transparency agenda, including work by the G20 on tax havens and non-co-operative jurisdictions, which has been led by the UK under its G20 presidency in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="09120235000012"></a>Recovery directive-the recovery directive is aimed at improving existing procedures for recovery of direct and indirect tax debts, including on income tax, VAT, excise duties and EU agricultural levies. The Government support the extended provisions, which will reduce the opportunities for businesses and individuals to escape paying tax which is legally due in one member state, by moving to another member state.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="09120235000023"></a>Exit strategies-Following on from discussions in November, Ministers will be asked to agree a set of conclusions on financial exit strategies. The UK is content with the conclusions as they stand, which recognise that it is important to start designing the strategy for a transparent and co-ordinated phasing out of the different support schemes, but emphasise that it would be premature to initiate an exit from the support schemes whilst markets are still fragile.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="09120235000025"></a>ECOFIN will discuss and agree conclusions on financial stability, focusing on improvements in cross-border crisis management in the banking sector. The Government are content with the conclusions, which recognise the value of co-ordination among member states and with external partners. They also endorse the principles of firm-specific recovery and resolution plans.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_1"></a>
<a name="09120235000026"></a><b><a name="91202-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="09120235000070"></a>The Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Lord Hunt of Kings Heath):</b> I am pleased to inform the House that the Department of Energy and Climate Change is today publishing <I>Towards a smarter future: Government response to the consultation on electricity and gas smart metering</I>. This document summarises responses to the consultation on smart metering published by the Government in May 2009 and sets out the Government's conclusions.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="09120235000027"></a>Smart meters will pave the way for a transformation in the way that energy is supplied and consumed, contributing to our goals of energy security and carbon reduction. They will provide energy consumers with real-time information about their energy use, enabling them to monitor and reduce their energy consumption and carbon emissions. Smart meters will support improved energy efficiency advice and facilitate smoother, faster switching between suppliers. They are an important first step towards the future development of a smarter grid delivering improved network efficiency and responsiveness; in turn this will help facilitate the introduction and increased use of renewable energy and ultra low carbon vehicles (electric and plug-in hybrids).</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="09120235000028"></a>In October 2008 we announced our intention to mandate a roll out of electricity and gas smart meters to all homes in Great Britain with the aim of completing the roll out by the end of 2020. The May 2009 consultation document addressed fundamental issues for the organisation of the roll out. In particular the consultation document made proposals for the delivery model for domestic smart meters, the minimum high level functional requirements for smart meters, and the approach to extending meter functionality requirements in the small and medium non-domestic sector. Our decisions on these fundamental points will provide the platform for the detailed work now required to move towards the roll out of smart meters.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="09120235000030"></a>The Government have concluded that the central communications model offers the best approach to Britain's domestic smart meter roll out. Under this model the energy supply companies will be responsible for procuring and installing meters, while communications between the meters and utility companies will be co-ordinated centrally. The central communications model combines strong incentives for energy suppliers to deliver a high quality service to their customers, with wide scope to simplify and improve industry processes, making it easier to switch between suppliers. We believe that this approach will minimise the time and risk involved in preparing for roll out, in particular since it avoids changing the disposition of responsibility for metering services. Metering is currently the responsibility of energy suppliers and this model avoids fundamental change to these arrangements. We also believe that the development of smart grids can be fostered effectively under this approach, in particular by ensuring the requirements of network business are reflected appropriately in the minimum meter specification and the communications solution.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_27"></a><a name="09120235000032"></a>The Government also confirm the proposals set out in the consultation document on high-level smart meter functionality requirements, with the exception of functionality to remotely enable/disable gas supply. In respect of the latter issue, we believe further work is needed to assess issues raised in consultation responses before reaching final decisions. A range of proposals were made in relation to the requirements of smart grids, but we have concluded that smart grid functionality is a subset of the high level requirements already proposed in the consultation. The next stage is to develop these high level proposals in more detail.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_28"></a><a name="09120235000033"></a>Consultation responses expressed a range of views on the issue of standalone displays. Having considered the response, the Government's position remains that a standalone display should be provided with the smart meter. In our view the provision of a display is important to securing the consumer benefits of smart metering, delivering real time information to consumers on their energy consumption in a readily accessible form. The next step will be to develop the requirements in more detail. As part of this work we will consider further what specific requirements should apply in cases where it is clear that the individual consumer does not wish to have such a display. However it will be important that this does not detract from the general premise that a freestanding display should be provided with the meter.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="09120235000034"></a><I>The approach on smart functionality requirements for non-domestic meters</I></p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="09120235000035"></a>The Government have adjusted their proposals in this area following the consultation. We are confirming our intention to mandate the installation of meters with smart functionality at non-domestic sites covered by the consultation (those in electricity profile classes 3 and 4 and non-domestic gas sites with consumption of less than 732 MWh per annum) on the same timescale as for domestic sites, with exceptions under certain circumstances. However, under our revised proposals, the exceptions will be much more limited in respect of meters installed after April 2014. We therefore propose to require that electricity and gas meters at sites in this category must have smart functionality by the end of 2020 except:</p>
where advanced meters have been installed before April 2014 and the customer wishes to retain the existing meters; where advanced meters have been installed  after April 2014 under pre-existing contractual arrangements; orwhere there are technical constraints on the achievement of smart functionality.
<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="09120235000036"></a>We consider that this approach will best balance the need to support future smart grids by maximising installation of smart functionality with the desirability of allowing energy and carbon savings from advanced installations to continue in the short- to medium-term. However, we recognise that exceptions will need to be carefully framed, taking into account the technical and commercial complexities. We will discuss these

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="09120235000038"></a>Decisions set out in the response document provide the platform for the major programme of detailed implementation work that will be needed to support the mass roll out of smart meters under a mandate. A central smart meter implementation programme is therefore being established to design and implement new cross-industry arrangements, in co-ordination with the change programmes which industry participants will need to implement themselves. The first phase of the smart metering programme will be a joint DECC/Ofgem initiative. DECC will chair an overarching DECC/Ofgem Strategic Programme Board. This board will provide the necessary strategic oversight and direction to the programme. Ofgem E-Serve will manage and ensure effective delivery of phase one of the programme on behalf of DECC.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="09120235000039"></a>We firmly agree with those consultation respondents who have emphasised that the implementation programme must effectively engage the full range of stakeholders. In particular, a focus on the needs and perspectives of consumers must be at the heart of decision-making at each stage under the programme, as well as the views of industry participants who will take on responsibility for delivery. The implementation programme will therefore develop a range of mechanisms to ensure that stakeholders' views are captured and taken into account.</p>

The police service has worked with the Government to lock in the significant falls in crime over the past decade; and we are beginning to see the improvements in public confidence that were such an important element of the Green Paper vision. The service is now well placed to meet the challenges ahead.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="09120235000044"></a>The White Paper addresses four specific issues.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="09120235000045"></a>First, it sets out the specific action we are taking to ensure that anti-social behaviour is tackled, not tolerated. We will ensure that the police and their local partners work together effectively, with the right tools and information, to place greater emphasis on prevention and support for victims.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para40"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="09120235000046"></a>Second, it commits police forces and police authorities to ensuring that the public know their entitlement to clear standards of service, how to make their voice heard and shape local policing priorities, with timely local information on performance they need to judge progress. Police authorities have an important role to play and I am very grateful to my right honourable friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside for his recent report on how police authorities could increase their public impact and strengthen their links with local councils, without the risks structural upheaval would bring. The White Paper's proposals have benefited greatly from his contribution.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para41"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="09120235000047"></a>Third, the White Paper addresses the challenging financial climate in the years ahead, which demands more urgent and radical action to squeeze out unnecessary costs, raise productivity and ensure that we continue to focus on frontline delivery. The White Paper lays out a wide ranging programme to drive national and regional procurement, reduce overheads, improve benchmarking information and strengthen commitment to collaboration between forces and voluntary mergers where appropriate.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para42"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="09120235000048"></a>Fourth, the White Paper endorses the guiding principles and style of policing championed in Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's Report <I>Adapting to Protest: Strengthening the British Model of Policing</I>, published on 25 November 2009. This is a significant contribution to the future direction of the policing of protests, and sets out our commitment to work with the service to take forward the report's recommendations.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="09120235000049"></a>I am also publishing today <I>Reducing Bureaucracy in Policing</I>, the first full report by Jan Berry, the Independent Reducing Bureaucracy Advocate.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="09120235000050"></a>Jan's report acknowledges the complex demands placed on the service, and rightly challenges the Government and those who lead forces to continue to work to simplify the performance landscape, crime recording processes, and data collection and other

Through the White Paper the Government have endorsed 13 of Jan's recommendations immediately and will consider a further 22 with police service colleagues in the months ahead.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="09120235000051"></a>Both Jan Berry's final report and this White Paper have benefited from open and constructive discussion with the police service and its partners. I am determined that we will continue to work together to create the service the public want-professional, responsive and grounded in communities. The achievements of the past decade give us much to build on. The next steps in the reform programme set out in this White Paper will help ensure that the police get the support they need as well as the credit they deserve, and strengthen further public confidence in this key service.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para46"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_46"></a><a name="09120235000053"></a>In accordance with the provisions of Section 37A of the Police Act 1996, as inserted by paragraph 25 Schedule 2 of the Police and Justice Act 2006, this Statement sets out my strategic policing priorities for the police service for 2010-11. These priorities provide the national framework for policing for the next financial year, within which police authorities will set their local plans.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para47"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="09120235000054"></a>Last year, the priorities reflected the radical vision for policing at the heart of the Government's Green Paper, <I>From the Neighbourhood to the National: policing our communities together</I>, and other national strategies, aimed at putting the public much more at the centre and empowering them to work with us to tackle local crime and ASB. The effect of these initiatives is now starting to be seen. They include the introduction of the policing pledge and crime maps in all forces in England and Wales, providing the public with a set of national minimum policing standards to which they are entitled and access to information about crime in their area and empowering them through involvement in neighbourhood policing meetings. Through the Justice Seen, Justice Done campaign we have raised public awareness of the rights they should expect.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para48"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="09120235000055"></a>Elsewhere we are rolling out a programme of police authority inspections and continuing important work on reducing unnecessary bureaucracy and workforce and performance management reform. The policing White Paper will take the principles of the policing pledge further with clear standards that the public can expect from other agencies that help to keep them safe and ensure that justice is done</p>

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para49"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_49"></a><a name="09120235000056"></a>The thrust of all this work is to allow police officers and police staff to focus on the public's priorities and provide an accessible, transparent and consistent service that meets public needs and expectations. All but one of the top-down numerical targets for police forces in England and Wales have now been removed. The remaining target is to increase the public's confidence

<a name="91202-wms0001.htm_para50"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="09120235000057"></a>My strategic policing priorities for 2010-11 include particular reference to the single remaining national target on generating public confidence but generally retain the broader vision of the current priorities. This vision focuses on the strategic context in which action is taken at the right level. The priorities acknowledge the policing White Paper and the current set of PSAs and reflect the recently updated crime strategy. Central to this is a renewed focus on tackling the harms caused by anti-social behaviour and requiring victims' concerns to be taken seriously. The Government will continue to monitor performance to ensure PSA commitments are met and provide strategic leadership. However, local accountability and planning should be undertaken so that forces tackle the issues that are most important to their local diverse communities, including hate crime, and get best value for money for the public from the resources devoted to policing.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="09120235000058"></a>Forces should continue to work collaboratively with local partners (including through crime and disorder reduction partnerships and community safety partnerships and local criminal justice boards) to meet shared local objectives. In England this includes those objectives that are agreed through local strategic partnerships within local area agreements.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="09120235000059"></a>Serious and organised crime is a constantly evolving problem. I believe there is a continuous line stretching from the local to the regional and on to the national which needs a continuum of effective policing in response. The Home Office/Cabinet Office strategy for tackling serious organised crime which was published in July recognises the importance of close working and effective collaboration and coordination between partners; and that means forces and authorities working outside and across individual force boundaries where necessary.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="09120235000060"></a>My expectation is that forces and authorities will continue to work in the interests of regions and the country and build on existing collaboration to achieve improvements. Collaboration takes various forms, from tackling serious and cross-border crime to the development of the national counterterrorism network in bringing together intelligence, investigative and operational activity against the terrorist threat. This relies heavily on confidence in policing. The success of a key component of our counter terrorism strategy-PREVENT-depends, in part, in the confidence local communities have in their police service.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="09120235000061"></a>The priority must be how building confidence in the service leads to a more effective police service at all levels. There is little benefit in increasing public confidence through local policing and ignoring protective services. These may be services with less of a public face and more uncertain demand, but they have the potential to impact heavily on public confidence if they fall short. Greater collaboration across the police service is essential to mitigate this risk and to realise the necessary improvements in protective services. The same emphasis should apply for specialist crimes.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="09120235000062"></a>The police service shares the public service duty to maximise value for money. Locally, it is the responsibility of police authorities to set ambitious targets for the

Senior policing leaders must help drive the organisational change required to make significant improvements in value for money, both in their forces and authorities and working with others taking into account the policing White Paper and the forthcoming report of the High Level Working Group on police value for money. This includes getting better value from spending on goods and services through collaboration and by making use of national or regional contracts. As part of the much more robust inspection regime for the service the new police authority inspections will probe how authorities manage resources and people and all forces will be inspected on value for money. During 2010-11 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary will test that the police workforce is led, organised and developed to be productive through the working for the public inspection.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="09120235000063"></a>In summary, the SPPs for 2010-11 are to:</p>
 continue to increase public confidence so that by March 2012 60 per cent of the public agree that the police and local council are dealing with the anti-social behaviour and crime issues that matter in their local communities; work jointly through partners and local communities to reduce and prevent crime and anti-social behaviour and the problems caused by drug and alcohol misuse and youth offending, in line with PSAs 14, 23 and 25, and in a co-ordinated approach with other CJS partners deliver an effective criminal justice response in line with PSA 24, putting the needs of victims, including young victims, at its heart; work jointly with police forces and other agencies, such as SOCA and UKBA, to ensure that the capability and capacity exists across England and Wales to deliver effective protective services, including tackling serious and organised crime;work jointly with and through partners and local communities to tackle terrorism and violent extremism in line with the counter terrorism strategy (CONTEST) and PSA 26; andin all of the above, ensure that value for money is central to the strategic vision for improving policing; that best use is made of resources in line with the policing White Paper and the efficiency and productivity strategy for the police service, both within forces and through collaboration between forces and with the wider public sector; and that chief officers and senior leaders are visibly associated with this organisational priority.

It stands at the heart of communities up and down the country, offering face to face access to essential services through its network of 11,500 branches. The Government are committed to a secure and sustainable future for the Post Office network, and have committed up to £1.7 billion of funding to support the Post Office network to 2011.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="09120235000065"></a>The Post Office is already a successful provider of financial services. It provides a wide range of savings, loans (including mortgages), and insurance products. It is also the UK's leading foreign exchange provider. But we want it to do more and to build on this successful platform. It is for this reason that the Prime Minister announced on 29 September that he wanted the Post Office to play a much bigger role, bringing banking services back to the heart of people's communities.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_58"></a><a name="09120235000066"></a>To take this forward, the Government are today launching a 12-week national consultation on Post Office banking. The consultation will set out clearly what the Post Office already offers in terms of financial services; it will draw comparisons with Post Banks around the world; and it will set out the Government's vision for Post Office banking and the values that should underpin it. These values are that Post Office banking should be universal, trusted, accessible and sustainable.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_59"></a><a name="09120235000067"></a>In addition, the consultation invites views on a number of proposals for new financial products that the Post Office could offer. These include: a Post Office current account, a children's savings account to encourage saving at the Post Office from an early age, new services for small businesses including a Post Office business account, and a weekly budgeting account to allow those on low incomes to take advantage of direct debits and reduced bills.</p>

<a name="91202-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="09120235000068"></a>We will be asking people whether they agree that these are the right areas to focus on and which banking services they would like to see at their local post office. This consultation sets the scene for an expansion in banking in Post Offices. It could result in important new business for our Post Offices and important new services for the public.</p>

<a name="09120239000018"></a><b><a name="91202w0001.htm_spmin6"></a><a name="09120239000249"></a>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Kinnock of Holyhead):</b> We are greatly concerned about the high numbers of political prisoners in Cuba and the conditions in which they are held. We are also troubled by the existence and use of pre-criminal social dangerousness charges to target behaviour that contradicts Cuba's socialist norms. These pre-emptive charges, often used against political dissidents and critics, allow the authorities to imprison individuals before they have committed any crime, on the suspicion that they are likely to commit an offence in the future. This has included prostitutes, unemployed people and alcoholics.</p>

<a name="91202w0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="09120239000019"></a>It is difficult to get accurate figures on the number of political prisoners in Cuba, as the Government of Cuba tightly control information about their prisons. Furthermore, there is inconsistency in reporting cases and many go unreported. We therefore have to rely on a range of sources to get estimates. A report published in August by the unofficial Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation documented 208 cases of political prisoners. Fifty-three of the 75 political prisoners arrested during the 2003 clampdown remain detained. Amnesty International recognises 57 prisoners of conscience in Cuba.</p>

<a name="91202w0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a><a name="09120239000020"></a>Based on a fact-finding mission to Cuba this year, Human Rights Watch documented more than 40 cases in which the Government have imprisoned individuals under the dangerousness provision. In April 2009 our embassy in Havana wrote to the Ministry of Justice in Cuba, asking how many people had been charged with social dangerousness in the past five years. We are still waiting for a response. The Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation believe that there may be between 3,000 and 5,000 prisoners in Cuba convicted of pre-criminal dangerousness.</p>

<a name="91202w0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_8"></a><a name="09120239000021"></a>We continue to raise our concerns about political prisoners regularly with the Cuban authorities in London and Havana. Human rights also form an important part of the EU's political dialogue with Cuba, including monitoring a list of political prisoners in poor health. Although we have not specifically pressed for Red Cross access to Cuban prisons, during Cuba's universal periodic review at the UN Human Rights Council in February, the UK recommended that Cuba allow independent international observers including UN special rapporteurs to review the prisons. In addition to highlighting concerns about political prisoners, the UK also recommended that Cuba refrain from using such laws as those against dangerousness, enemy propaganda and contempt for authority to restrict the rights of freedom of expression and association.</p>

Under procurement regulations, buyers are unable to specify the purchase of local food as such, as this discriminates against non-local suppliers from the United Kingdom and European Union member states.</p>

<a name="91202w0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_11"></a><a name="09120239000029"></a>On 6 May 2009, the department published guidance entitled, <I>Sustainable Food - a guide for hospitals</I>. Advice to the NHS in this document included:</p>
the use of local, in-season ingredients where possible, to minimise energy used in food production, transport and storage; andspecifying food from farming systems that minimise harm to the environment, such as certified organic produce.

<p><a name="wa_stpa_13"></a><a name="09120239000032"></a>However, evidence from NHS Supply Chain (NHS SC), which has approximately 60 per cent of the spend on food by the National Health Service, shows that in the past 12 months, purchasing decisions by NHS trusts have favoured conventional products rather than organic. NHS SC's estimate for the purchase of organic food by the NHS trusts that it supplies is about 4 per cent.</p>

DNA samples can be split into two categories. Subject samples are taken from an arrested person (or in some cases from a volunteer), usually by means of a swab which picks up cells from the inside of the cheek. Crime scene samples are retrieved from material at crime scenes, for example blood, semen or saliva. Both types of sample are collected by the police and sent to an accredited forensic supplier for analysis to produce a DNA profile. The profile is then loaded onto the NDNAD where it can be compared with the other profiles held on the database. The original physical sample is retained by the forensic supplier in a secure environment. When a match occurs between profiles held on the NDNAD the relevant police force is informed.</p>

Capital investment plans for the NDNAD can be broadly separated into maintenance and development. Maintenance costs equate to approximately £200,000 per annum and relate to the in year costs of replacing equipment that has either failed or reached the end of its lifespan. Development costs are determined firstly by the prioritised development requirements of the NDNAD strategy board, and secondly by the available capital funds within the NPIA and their relative prioritisation across the development requirements of the police service as

This makes it difficult to draw comparisons between numbers of RDA staff working on particular issues as each agency will have different directorates, teams and job titles for roles relating to work on education, employment and skills. Often, staff activity will overlap on many issues in a way not conducive to disaggregation. For example, the primary role of RDAs is to facilitate economic growth. Therefore to some extent, all RDA staff will have some involvement in these drivers of productivity.
