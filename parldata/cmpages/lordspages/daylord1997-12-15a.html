<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "71215-01_para0"></a>Whether they will carry out early consultation with the mining engineering industry to consider the maintenance of an adequate home base for its national and international activities.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="71215-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend asks about early consultation. I am pleased to say that the Minister for Science, Energy and Industry will meet with the Association of British Mining Equipment Companies to discuss issues relating to the industry in two days' time.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Hardy of Wath: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend's response to the Question is most gratifying, but will he ensure that his ministerial colleagues recognise that continuing international mining activity will be considerable, presenting the British industry with substantial opportunity provided that a significant home base is sustained?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Haskel:  </B>   My Lords, certainly the Department of Trade and Industry is working closely with the Association of British Mining Equipment Companies. The department provided financial assistance to conduct a detailed study of the relationship between the UK and worldwide markets. The survey included identifying how export markets could be developed further, which countries offer the best opportunities, and how the industry could export more effectively. This report has been completed, it is being studied and hopefully will be acted upon.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Mason of Barnsley: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that mining engineers would benefit considerably from a more rapid development of clean coal technology and a slow down in the approval of gas fired stations? Has he had talks with the electricity generators with a view to--or at least the possibility of--assisting the coal-mining industry in the short term?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, as regards clean coal technology, the DTI's clean coal technology research and development programme, which involves the industry, universities and overseas organisations, has funded many projects. These projects are continuing and the department is committed to clean coal technology. As regards the use of coal by the electricity generators, that is a matter for two private companies to settle between them. The Government are not involved in any negotiations on that matter.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ezra: </B>   My Lords, I support the Question tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hardy. Is the noble Lord aware that the British mining machinery industry developed its substantial overseas market on the basis of the use made of such machinery in British mines, and that one of the big selling points was being able to demonstrate to overseas customers how those machines were used on coal-faces in this country? Will the Government ensure that that will still be possible?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I acknowledge the noble Lord's concern. The UK mining equipment industry has made considerable strides in recent years to reduce its dependence on British markets by selling into export markets and by diversification. But the study which I mentioned has tried to tackle this question. Some demonstration of British equipment will be arranged, if possible, in British pits.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Skelmersdale: </B>   My Lords, how can an adequate home base for mining be maintained when most of the coal that is currently used is imported and is either subsidised or mined using cheap labour?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that I agree with the noble Lord that most of the coal that is imported is subsidised. Certainly the British Government are taking up vigorously with the German and Spanish Governments the question of their coal subsidies and considerable progress is being made on that matter.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend consider--if he has not mentioned this already--holding consultations with the National Union of Mineworkers?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Haskel: </B>   My Lords, this is a matter for the coal-mining companies and the electricity generation companies with whom they are negotiating. The sale of coal from one to the other is a matter for them, not the Government.

<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington </B>   asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "71215-01_para1"></a>Whether they will consider moving the statue of Sir Walter Raleigh to a more suitable site.
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="71215-01_spnew13"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, a proposal by Madam Speaker to move the statue of Sir Walter Raleigh to St. Margaret's churchyard was approved in principle by the then Secretary of State for National Heritage under the Public Statues (Metropolis) Act 1854. That approval was conditional upon Madam Speaker obtaining the necessary planning consent from Westminster City Council. I understand that planning consent was refused for the site proposed but that discussions are continuing about an alternative location in the vicinity.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Trumpington: </B>   My Lords, it seems to me that this is a very simple matter and that planning <P>


<a name="column_383"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 383</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>permission should be granted immediately. Would Victoria Gardens, for instance, be a suitable location? Sir Walter Raleigh was a very great man, particularly as the first importer of tobacco; however, his statue makes him appear minuscule--especially since it stands next to perfectly enormous statues of two very gallant field marshals. The sooner he is moved, the better. I ask the Minister again for a date when it can be done.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, in response to the noble Baroness's first Question, Madam Speaker, the Royal Fine Art Commission and English Heritage were all in favour of the move to St. Margaret's churchyard. That is still possible; the site was, however, deemed unsuitable by Westminster City Council. I agree with the noble Baroness that the statue of Sir Walter Raleigh looks rather small in comparison with Viscounts Alanbrooke, Montgomery and Slim. However, it must be remembered that Raleigh himself thought that his future location was in doubt. He wrote:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Like to a hermit poor in place obscure

I mean to spend my days of endless doubt". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, would it not be better to leave him where he is as a demonstration to young people of how smoking stunts your growth?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew17"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, as a non-smoker but one who is a supporter of smoking in public places, I prefer to think of Sir Walter Raleigh as a very great love poet.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Weatherill: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that this saga started about 10 years ago, that we have Sir Walter Raleigh's body in front of the High Altar at St. Margaret's, Westminster, but that we lost his head? It was our feeling at the time that he should be reunited with, and relocated near, his body in St. Margaret's, Westminster.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew19"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, Sir Walter Raleigh was in fact executed in Old Palace Yard, the site of our current car park. I do not believe that the authorities would look kindly on that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-01_para2"></a>To return to the second question of the noble Baroness, Lady Trumpington, no doubt if St. Margaret's churchyard does not work out as a site, other sites could be looked at. I agree with her that it should be done quickly.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew20"></A><B> Viscount Montgomery of Alamein: </B>   My Lords, in view of the fact that Sir Walter Raleigh was a distinguished seafarer, would it not be more appropriate to put him overlooking water, such as beside the Thames?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew21"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am tempted again to quote from Sir Walter himself:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"When I was gone, she sent her memory,
<P>
<BR>
More strong than are ten thousand ships of war". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME="71215-01_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Monkswell: </B>   My Lords, bearing in mind the revenues generated by tobacco sales, would it not be apposite to consider placing his statue either opposite No. 11 Downing Street or by the doors of Her Majesty's Treasury? Returning to the substance of the initial Answer, surely it is right that the local planning authority has some significant input into where the statue will eventually be placed?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-01_spnew23"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I was afraid that this would develop into a Christmas question, and I see that it has. Yes, the local planning authority has the ultimate right to agree or disagree.

<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "71215-01_para4"></a>What is their policy on the detention of young offenders following the recent statement by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons that he does "not believe that children under 18 should be held in prison".
<P>
<P>
</UL><A NAME="71215-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office   (Lord Williams of Mostyn): </B>  My Lords, the Government recognise and share the concerns expressed. This is a long-standing issue which the previous government failed to resolve. This Government's policy is to move towards a situation where it is no longer necessary to remand 15 to 16 year-old boys to prison. We have reviewed this whole difficult area and decided that the priority is to give the courts the right range of powers to remand juveniles to secure accommodation, and that is what the Crime and Disorder Bill will do. We hope that the outcome of the current review of the secure juvenile estate and the work which the Prison Service is currently doing will see the end of the practice of detaining juveniles with adults.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. However, while in no way underestimating the scale of the problem which this Government inherited on coming to office, does my noble friend accept that the uncompromising words of the chief inspector are really very sobering? He said,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The vast majority of young people in custody need individual attention given to the problems which produced their criminal behaviour. If all they get is akin to being stored in a warehouse, then the chances of their reoffending, creating yet more victims, are very great indeed". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-02_para0"></a>Does my noble friend agree that it has not been rational to put young offenders in prison, in the sense that that has increased the cost and the number of victims in the future? Will he further agree that the real challenge to an enlightened Administration is how we win over the young to civilised behaviour and to a constructive place in society?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I agree with almost everything my noble friend said. The inspector said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The current system is not a system at all. The chaos which surrounds the treatment of children and young adults in prison service custody leads me to the conclusion that separate arrangements for dealing with young prisoners are essential". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-02_para1"></a>One of the functions of the new youth justice board--which will be set up under the Crime and Disorder Bill, which will have its Second Reading before your Lordships tomorrow--is to monitor carefully the standards of accommodation in which juveniles are held. Echoing the thrust of what my noble friend said, we believe that there should be a youth justice board specifically charged with dealing with these issues.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister say how many girls of 15 and 16 are in prison today? Is not their situation even worse than that of the boys? Is the Minister aware that in this country there are no young offender institutions for girls? Does he not think that they would be better in a school environment, where they would learn skills for life instead of crime for life?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, there is accommodation within the prison estate which is designated as young offender institutions and which is capable of dealing with young women. At the moment there are about 270 15 and 16 year-olds in adult prisons. Not one of them is a young woman because they are in the accommodation designated, as I indicated. I agree that education is extremely important for young people in the prison estate, but it is not always possible to educate serious offenders in mainstream education as opposed to having some degree of protection for the wider public.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Elton: </B>   My Lords, can the noble Lord tell us the ages of the youngest of each sex of juveniles in adult accommodation at present?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, the youngest male and female juveniles held in prison custody are aged 15. Provisional figures for those in prison custody up to 31st October this year show the following: there were nine young women aged 15, but all those were sentenced and held in accommodation which, as I indicated a moment ago, is designated as young offender institutions. There were 232 young men aged 15, 66 were unconvicted or were convicted and awaiting sentence; 166 had already been sentenced. Of the 232 young men aged 15, 20 were in adult establishments--Cardiff, Doncaster, Hull and Norwich.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Lincoln: </B>   My Lords, in the light of Clause 81 of the Crime and Disorder Bill, will the Minister confirm that it remains government policy to end the practice of remanding 15 and 16 year-olds to custody?

<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the right reverend Prelate will remember the precise terms of my Answer:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This Government's policy is to move towards a situation where it is no longer necessary to remand 15 and 16 year-old boys to prison".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-02_para2"></a>I am happy to reaffirm that.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, the Minister may perhaps be aware that I have been trying for about eight years to discover what proportion of 16 and 17 year-old offenders enjoy no visible legal means of support. Will the Government see whether they can do a little better than I have?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I am always willing to do my best to do better than the noble Earl.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Judd: </B>   My Lords, as regards the review which the Government are undertaking, will my noble friend assure us that it will be possible for the Government to look at two other specific matters? One is the dreadful statistic that between 1995-96 and 1996-97, the number of suicides by young teenagers in prison increased from nine to 20--more than double. Also, there is increasing concern about the way in which young people, caught up in the complicated issue of seeking asylum, are similarly being placed in establishments which are at the very least suitable only for adults.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, of course the question of suicide, particularly for young persons detained, is very grave. It is unfortunate that the suicide rate generally among that section of the population has risen, but it still cannot be tolerated that any death, self-inflicted, should occur in prison. I can assure my noble friend, as well as your Lordships' House, that we are deeply concerned about the matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-02_para3"></a>There are difficulties about asylum seekers. The best we can do is to assure your Lordships that we wish to be as open, civilised and correct as we can in the treatment of young persons who seek asylum and who perhaps have to be detained, although no one would wish it to be that way if we were able to have a different regime. We cannot. Young people sometimes come to this country with false papers. They are then detained. It is necessary to make proper investigation as to their true age. No one can tell immediately what it is; we have to make inquiries. However, I stress that all young people ought to be particularly protected because, as the chief inspector said in his report, they are different--they are not just small adults.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Masham of Ilton: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may return to the Minister's answer to me. Is he aware that I did not mean mainstream schools, but secure accommodation? Will he agree that that would be better for 15 and 16 year-old girls?

<P>

<A NAME = "71215-02_para4"></a>I hope that that meets the noble Baroness's point.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew14"></A><B> The Earl of Longford: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister realise that those concerned for many years with penal reform will never be satisfied until our Government, the Government to which I am loyal, repudiate totally the policies of the past few years and return to the earlier policies of Conservative and Labour governments?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, without being unduly partisan, I indicated that the findings of the chief inspector in his report, which was published in October this year, made entirely the point which the noble Earl has just reiterated: that a chaos surrounds the treatment of children and young adults in Prison Service custody. I recognise that the noble Earl and I share this one view that over the past 18 years things have gone badly wrong in the Prison Service. But that is the basis of a challenge for the future, not reproach for the past. I hope that this Home Secretary will respond appropriately to that challenge, as your Lordships will be able to see at Second Reading of the Crime and Disorder Bill tomorrow.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Anelay of St. Johns: </B>   My Lords, as the Minister has referred to the Second Reading tomorrow, how does he justify the provisions of Clauses 80 and 81 of the Crime and Disorder Bill? Under them, children and young people will be remanded in custody while awaiting trial for an offence of which they may subsequently be found guilty. However, they cannot be given a sentence of detention for that offence.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the proper opportunity to scrutinise Clauses 80 and 81 will be tomorrow. However, perhaps I may say generally that this will be the first Bill which sets out plainly the purpose of the youth justice system. It will be described thus:

<A NAME="71215-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Parkside: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. Perhaps I may assure her of my complete support for the schemes that she has announced which will give employment opportunities to many youngsters, some of whom have never had a job in their lives. However, is she aware that many firms in Great Britain, large and small, are already starting to suffer from serious skill shortages? In that respect, is she aware of the statement that was made recently by the senior vice-president of Pfizer's, the American pharmaceutical company, which is proposing a &#163;109 million expansion of its laboratories in Kent? The statement was that it may be impossible for the company to recruit the 1,000 scientists that it needs to staff the new establishment. It went on to castigate the previous government for their neglect of scientific training in this country. Does my noble friend agree that the reason for the serious shortage of skills which exists in the United Kingdom today is the complete neglect of all forms of training over the 18 years of the previous Tory administration?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I was not aware of the announcement by the chief executive or managing director of Pfizer in this country. However, we are aware that more employers are reporting skills shortages, particularly in IT and in the construction industry. I agree that we must be far more ambitious than we have been in relation to the need to improve our training and education opportunities for all young people, and, indeed, adults.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-03_para0"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced last month at the CBI conference that we shall be developing a national skills agenda in order to deal with such shortages which are very damaging to our economy and to economic growth. We are setting up a skills task force and a skills unit in my department. The aim will be to try to reach a consensus around our key skill needs and to set out broad areas where skills need to be developed. Of course, we must also ensure that the education and training systems are responsive to the longer-term skills needs of the economy.

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 389</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>NVQs. We are trying to address that. We have set up new NTOs (national training organisations) which consist of groups of employers whose role will be to try to develop the highest possible standards in the provision of NVQs which are largely competency-based and work-based skills training. Employers therefore have a key part to play. We will be monitoring the performance of NVQs. We are also trying to cut out some NVQs which clearly have not been performing because of the small number of people who have taken them up.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Quirk: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that "work-related skills" is an expression that should not be restricted to manual skills? It should include mathematics, literacy and foreign language learning.

<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, NVQs cover a vast range of possible areas, including many non-manual occupations. It is important that we develop good vocational qualifications right across our occupational system. It is important also that we ensure that all young people have the appropriate key skills of literacy to which the noble Lord particularly referred--numeracy and IT skills.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Davies of Coity: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for informing the House of the proposals of the Labour Government to increase the skills of young people in this country. We are all aware that skill shortages have not arisen overnight. However, does my noble friend agree with me that what is required is to assess the enthusiasm, and indeed the co-operation, of employers in regard to the Government's proposals.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, it is vital that employers participate in the raising of skills. Modern Apprenticeships is a successful scheme in which the Government recently invested an additional &#163;10 million for a further 10,000 places. It is a scheme which is largely the responsibility of the employers. They are working effectively to develop skills and expand them through Modern Apprenticeships.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister tell the House what the level of youth unemployment is at this time and by how much it has fallen in the past two years? Secondly, will she explain the inconsistency between the employer who under the new proposals takes on a young person on the welfare-to-work programme and receives a compensatory benefit and the employer who takes on a 16 or 17 year-old under Clause 23 of the Teaching and Higher Education Bill, who will incur a cost over and above the salary for employing that young person?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, it is important that employers who take on 16 and 17 year-olds should also take on the moral responsibility and provide training for them. I entirely accept that there will be some cost to employers from doing that. It is reasonable to expect employers who take on very young people and people who left school at the early age of 16, many of whom <P>


<a name="column_390"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 390</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do not have adequate skills to remain employed over long periods of time, to invest in the future of those young people. That is part of the responsibility of taking on a 16 or 17 year-old. If employers are not willing to do that, more 18 to 25 year-olds will be unable to obtain and keep jobs and there will be larger numbers of people in the new deal.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Renton: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that a great many young people are taken on and learn skills while they are in the Armed Forces, especially the Army? Would it not be wise therefore to make the fullest possible use of that opportunity?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I am aware that the Army has a long tradition of undertaking successful training programmes for young people, as do the other Armed Forces. They are particularly successful in training young people in technical skills. Many of those young people will not necessarily remain for the rest of their careers in the Armed Forces. Therefore, in carrying out that training, the Army is supporting the skills base of the nation and in that sense it is extremely helpful.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend Lady Blatch asked the noble Baroness a question on statistics. Is the noble Baroness prepared to answer that question now?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness asked three questions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Strathclyde: </B>   My Lords, two.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness actually asked three questions. In those circumstances it is difficult to answer all of them when other people are waiting to speak.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew16"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I might say to the noble Baroness that I asked one question on statistics and one on inconsistency, which is just two questions.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-03_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness Blackstone: </B>   My Lords, I thought that three questions had been asked. If there were only two I am happy to accept that. In those circumstances, I am sure that the noble Baroness will agree that it is difficult during Starred Questions to answer several different questions at once. The level of unemployment is 5.9 per cent. I cannot give the precise figure relating to young people. But that is a long way from the Question on the Order Paper, which actually concerns skills and training for skills.

<P>


<a name="column_392"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 392</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para1"></a>In looking forward to the debate, like the rest of the House, I anticipate with pleasure the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Levene of Portsoken, with his long and distinguished association with London and its affairs. I am sure, too, we will all await with particular interest the speech of the noble Earl, Lord Carnarvon, who, through his stewardship of the All-Party London Group, has contributed so much to the development and scrutiny of policy on the capital in this House; and the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, whose paper to the Institute for Metropolitan Studies in 1993, A Fresh Start for London, did much to stimulate renewed debate on the future of London government; and of course we look forward to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare, to see, if nothing else, whether he has interests to declare. Who knows, among today's other speakers there may be others who wish to declare that at some point in the future they will be candidates for the office of mayor or for membership of the assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para2"></a>Before setting out in detail the provisions of the Bill I believe the House would wish me to put it in the context of our plans for the governance of London, an issue in which this House has had a long-standing interest. London is a great city, a world city, comparable only perhaps to New York and Tokyo in size, influence and economic activity. It is our seat of government, a vital engine for our economy and a world-class centre for culture and the arts. And for more than 7 million people who have chosen to live and work here it is their home. Yet, despite its size, importance and complexity, for 11 years London has been bereft of strategic leadership. Unlike other great cities it has had no one to plan, to lead, above all to represent its community. Since the GLC was abolished, London has stood alone among western capitals--in a desolate league of its own--as the only major city in Europe with no form of strategic city-wide government.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para3"></a>Since 1986--and the dark days of Thatcherism--London has had to get by on ad hoc arrangements, obscure and unaccountable committees and unelected quangos. There has been no one to take responsibility for the important issues facing the capital. That has meant that too often nothing has been done about those issues. Of course there have been strategies and initiatives; committees set up to address this and that; reports published; but never anyone to take action forward; no real--no legitimate--leadership for London.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para4"></a>All of us who live or work here have seen the result of that strategic neglect: a decaying infrastructure, worsening air quality and a growing division between rich and poor. While knowing these were inevitably piecemeal and ad hoc measures, with typical resourcefulness and resilience, London and its citizens and institutions have done their best to fill that strategic vacuum. London First and the Association of London Government, individually and with others as part of the London Pride Partnership, have devoted time and effort to thinking about London's needs and developing practical solutions. They have mobilised local government, business and the voluntary sector. Many taking part in their activities have never before thought <P>


<a name="column_393"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 393</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of their responsibility as to London as a whole. But the vacuum demanded filling and ways were found to fill it as far as was possible given that central problem. I think we must all be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Sheppard of Didgemere, for his personal efforts in this regard.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para5"></a>But strategies and devices could never be enough. Busy people with many other responsibilities and no democratic mandate could never fulfil the fundamental strategic role, never maximize London's potential, never address its problems and never speak with its voice. London, a great world city, has drifted.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para6"></a>The Bill is a crucial stage in the task we have set ourselves of remedying the 11 years of London's isolation and providing democratic strategic leadership to the capital. I should make clear that that strategic leadership--the strategic government we are proposing for London--is not seeking to recreate the Greater London Council. What we want, and what we believe Londoners want, is a new democratic settlement for London, a settlement that is streamlined, modern and efficient, and one that is capable of taking our capital and its citizens into the next millennium. That aspiration is shared with many of different political persuasions and many who are not interested in conventional politics at all.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para7"></a>As part of the careful process of introducing a Greater London authority--consisting of a separately elected mayor and assembly--in July this year we issued a consultation document called New Leadership for London. It generated a huge response--more than 700 letters from individuals and more than 500 submissions from organisations representing tens of thousands of Londoners. That response showed an overwhelming level of support for our basic proposals. Many of the responses went into great detail. All of them demonstrated how intensely Londoners feel about the future of their city and the way it is governed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para8"></a>At this point I should mention the response of the All-Party London Group of this House and thank it for its helpful and considered work on the Green Paper consultation. As with all its efforts, it demonstrated the valuable contribution the group makes to the consideration of policy issues affecting the capital. I should like to assure members of the group that the views they express will be taken seriously and will be addressed in our deliberations on the eventual shape of the White Paper and the legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para9"></a>When I first went into politics I was told that no one was interested in constitutional change. Yet that has not been the experience in Scotland; it has not been the experience in Wales; it is not even the experience in debates on the future of your Lordships' House. Six months before the referendum is envisaged on a Greater London Authority and two years ahead of the earliest date for the mayoral election, people in London, Members of your Lordships' House and Members of another place, not to say the newspapers--I see a new flurry of anticipation in recent newspapers about potential candidates--are already talking about who might stand and what their manifestos might say. Last week the Association of London Government published <P>


<a name="column_394"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 394</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a survey showing that, some six months ahead of the referendum and without the benefit of any formal public campaign, six out of 10 Londoners already know they will have the chance on 7th May next year to vote on London's future.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para10"></a>We believe that the people of London are enthusiastic because they are being trusted to have a say in what their government should be; trusted, I have to say, in a way that, I understand from reports, even the Cabinet of the day was not trusted on the issue of the abolition of the Greater London Council in the first place. The Government are committed to creating a strategic authority for London but it is right and proper that before we make these changes, Londoners should have the chance to say whether they agree with what we are putting forward. That is the crux of this legislation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para11"></a>Perhaps I may now explain the provisions of the Bill in more detail. Clause 1 provides for a referendum to be held on 7th May 1998, or at a later date if so appointed by Order in Council. Subject to the Bill gaining Royal Assent in sufficient time for arrangements to be made, we fully intend the referendum to take place on the date set out in the Bill. The provision for changing the date is there for use only in the event that unavoidable circumstances force a postponement of the poll. Noble Lords will be aware that 7th May is also the date of local elections in the London boroughs. That brings with it benefits and challenges. Considerable money will be saved by the sharing of facilities and administrative arrangements--around &#163;2 million to &#163;3 million when compared to the cost of a stand-alone referendum. It will increase the chance of a good turnout for both polls. However, the combination of two elections on the same day will need careful planning.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para12"></a>We are discussing arrangements for the referendum with representatives of the Association of London Government, with returning officers and with electoral officials from the London boroughs and the City of London. Their help, assistance and experience have proved invaluable in planning for the referendum and the combination of polls.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para13"></a>As I said, the Government believe that it is right that the people who live in London, who will be the most directly affected by the new authority, should have the chance to give their consent as to how they are governed. Clause 2 of the Bill defines the classes of persons entitled to vote in the referendum; namely, those eligible to vote in local government elections in any of the London boroughs and those entitled to vote at ward elections in the City of London by virtue of residency. This will provide for a uniform franchise across the capital. I am sure that noble Lords resident in London will be pleased to learn that, as a result of this and provided they are on their local electoral roll, they will be entitled to a vote next May. I am certain and confident that they will use their votes well.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para14"></a>Clause 3 provides for the appointment and functions of a chief counting officer for London and of counting officers for each borough and the City.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para15"></a>Clause 4 sets out regulations governing the conduct of the poll. It provides for the poll to be combined with local elections, if they occur on the same day, and for <P>


<a name="column_395"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 395</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provision to be made as to the conduct of the referendum and the combination of polls. This would be by Order in Council, following affirmative resolution of both Houses.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para16"></a>Clause 5 enables grants to be paid to London boroughs and the City of London in respect of expenditure incurred in connection with the referendum. While we are intent on minimising the cost of the referendum to the public purse, we will ensure that local authorities do not lose out as a result of their administration of the referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para17"></a>Clause 6 excludes legal proceedings to question the results of the referendum as certified by the chief counting officer or a counting officer. Such a provision is well precedented in previous referendum legislation and a similar clause was fully debated by this House during the passage of the Referendum (Scotland and Wales) Act. The clause is designed to prevent frivolous challenges and legal obstructionism, not to prevent any legal action when there has been serious malpractice or a failure to fulfil statutory duties.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para18"></a>Parts II and III of the Bill deal with expenditure and paving provisions. It is intended that there should be fast progress towards the creation of the new authority. The Bill therefore provides for initial work to be done on the electoral areas of the authority and for expenditure, primarily on obtaining and preparing accommodation for the authority. Ministers in another place have already undertaken that paving provisions will not be used until an affirmative vote in the referendum and that significant expenditure will be incurred only after Second Reading of the substantive Bill establishing the authority. I can repeat that assurance this afternoon.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para19"></a>Clause 7 confers new functions on the Local Government Commission, requiring it, at the direction of the Secretary of State, to prepare a report recommending electoral divisions into which Greater London should be divided for elections to the new authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para20"></a>Clauses 8 to 10 set out the framework within which the commission must operate. They enable the Secretary of State to give the commission directions as to how it should carry out its functions under this part. Clause 11 provides for payment to be made to the commission in respect of its functions under this part of the Bill.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para21"></a>Clause 12 of the Bill provides for expenditure to be made in connection with the referendum and in preparation for the Greater London authority. The explanatory memorandum attached to the Bill makes clear that, if it takes place on 7th May, the total cost of the referendum will be some &#163;3 million. This compares favourably with the costs of referendums in Scotland and Wales, reflecting the savings to be gained from sharing facilities with local elections. If the referendum were to take place on any other date, its cost would rise to around &#163;5 million. It is estimated that the maximum cost of expenditure under this clause on paving provisions, in particular obtaining and preparing accommodation, will be around &#163;20 million.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para22"></a>The form of the question on which London will vote is set out in the schedule to the Bill. This was the issue most fiercely debated in another place with various and, I have to say, inconsistent criticism made of the single question set out in the Bill. That question reads,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Are you in favour of the government's proposals for a Greater London Authority, made up of an elected mayor and a separately elected assembly? Yes or no". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para23"></a>We believe that this question is as clear and as fair as possible. In drafting it we have taken expert advice and rigorously tested it for comprehensibility. We believe it is the right and the only practical question to ask of London.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para24"></a>The case that has been made for more than one question arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of what it is the Government are proposing. I would like, therefore, at this early stage to set out the reasons underlying the Government's position.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para25"></a>The Government made a clear manifesto commitment to deliver a new deal for London: to establish a new Greater London authority made up of a mayor and assembly, both directly and separately elected. However, we undertook first to establish the consent of the people of London to see what it was we proposed. In keeping with our manifesto commitment, what we will put to the people of London, in a White Paper to be published in the week of 23rd March, is an integrated and balanced package of government--a mayor and an assembly, together making up the Greater London authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para26"></a>The White Paper will be comprehensive and it will be comprehensible. It will have to set out clearly to the people of London what they are voting for or against. If people vote yes, we will implement our proposals. If they vote no, we will not. It is as simple and as clear-cut as that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para27"></a>We have never said that the pre-legislative referendum should be an opinion poll. We do not think it would be right to make it so now. We made a clear manifesto commitment to establish a new Greater London authority which has two separate but important and complementary parts: the mayor and the assembly. We undertook to establish the consent of the people of London to that proposition. It is a balanced package that we are putting forward. To put forward anything else would not be clear-cut and neither would it be responsible, given that as a government we are certain that it is important that we put what we believe is a workable and balanced package to the people of London and one that we are willing to implement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para28"></a>A White Paper that said, "If this, then that, but, on the other hand, perhaps the other", would not be offering real choice. No one would know what they were voting for or what the impact of their vote would be. It would lead to confusion. There would be a confusing White Paper and a confusing ballot paper. There could be no clear mandate at the end of the day. It would deny the point of holding a referendum in the first place, because that referendum is to seek consent to the Government's proposition, not to put a range of alternatives about which the Government have no separate views. We have clear-cut views and it is those views to which we are seeking assent.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para29"></a>I have explained our position to the House. The Bill is both about implementing a manifesto commitment and testing out our views as to how London should be governed with the people who will be governed by the new proposals. It provides a clear and straightforward question to be asked of the people of London. It is capable of providing a clear mandate on detailed proposals. If Londoners vote yes on 7th May, they will know not only what they are voting for but that it is a workable solution in which the Government have full confidence and which they intend to legislate to implement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para30"></a>The people of London have waited 11 years for the return of city-wide government to the capital. This Bill gives them the chance to shape their own future and give London the leadership that it deserves. I commend it to the House.

I shall endeavour to concentrate on its proposals, although if one were to do that exclusively, one's contribution would be very short. I wish that there was a good deal more detail about the arrangements and functions of the mayor and the authority. However, if the Bill is passed and there is a positive vote in the referendum, I am sure that there will be extensive debate on the consequent legislation. We have had some indication of the Government's thinking in the Green Paper, but that is not before us; still less do we know what will be in the White Paper to be published following consultation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para32"></a>We on these Benches do not oppose the Bill in its entirety. We recognise the commitment made in the Labour Party's manifesto,
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para33"></a>and we accept the expression of popular opinion in favour of the mayor.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-04_para34"></a>Nevertheless, we are concerned about a number of principles and details, and consider the Bill flawed in different respects, not least the lack of important detail to which I have just referred.

<P>

<A NAME="71215-05_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her intervention, but I do not think that that answer escapes the point that the referendum will be authorising, confirming and approving a principle with no detail. The legislation will not have passed through Parliament. The Minister cannot say that there are firm proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para0"></a>In the light of popular views expressed and the changed circumstances, my party has reviewed its policy on London; we accept the concept of a mayor and an authority. However, there are many different powers and methods of working available to a mayor and there are different options for the authority. The method of election of the mayor and the assembly has still to be decided. Irrespective of whether that appears in the White Paper, when the people of Greater London vote that information will not have appeared in legislation which has passed through Parliament. The number of members of the assembly and the nature of the electoral areas are unknown. Yes, there may be popular support for a mayor and an assembly, but not at any price. Why should the people not cast their vote in the referendum in full knowledge of such matters? If there has to be a referendum, do not the Government trust the people to express a view upon detailed proposals or is it suggested that they can be consulted only on an idea?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para1"></a>However supportive of the general concept, many people would feel strongly that the mayor should be elected on a straight first-past-the-post system. Others might feel equally strongly that the alternative suggestions of the Green Paper are preferable. Some people will feel particularly strongly that the members of the assembly should have a clear and distinct representational role in respect of the towns and the cities that make up Greater London and would wish to see a system of election and electoral areas recognising that. We believe that the assembly should be indirectly elected. After all, Greater London is the sum of its constituent boroughs. There are other merits to that particular proposal which I believe would be more properly discussed in Committee. I hope that when they are discussed the Minister will give them proper consideration. I must advise the Minister that the reaction in another place was not encouraging. Suffice it to say that I believe that when the details are known it is possible that people will say, "We like the idea in principle, but given the way in which it is to be done, we can no longer support it". It is possible that people may say, "We like the idea of a mayor, but we no longer like the concept of the assembly as proposed." In this case, as in so many others, it is possible to be in favour of something but not, as I have said, at any price.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para2"></a>It is precisely because of such issues that we believe that in order to give the people choice there should be two questions in the referendum. We shall pursue that <P>


<a name="column_399"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 399</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>point in Committee. We shall press for two questions. Are you in favour of a directly elected mayor? Are you in favour of a directly elected assembly?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para3"></a>The arguments in favour of a mayor do not, I submit, extend to a directly elected assembly. Of course, we on these Benches accept the need for an assembly to provide the necessary scrutiny, the relevant counterbalance to the mayor, and to approve the mayor's budgets and strategies, but the assembly should also be the voice of Greater London speaking to the mayor--and the voice of Greater London is, I submit, the voice of the boroughs. They will not always be united, but they are the people speaking through their democratically elected representatives. It would be for the boroughs to reach agreement among themselves in the light of the mayor's proposals. The alternative directly elected assembly would not have its roots in the towns and cities that make up Greater London. I submit that it is bound to seek functions. An elected body, the principal function of which will be scrutiny and approval of someone else's activities, will inevitably seek power--and that power can come only from the cities and boroughs of London.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para4"></a>I want us to look forward in deciding how we should proceed in London, but we need to remind ourselves of where we have been in the past. When considering some of the options, we must try not to rewrite history or to forget past lessons. Debates in another place and some of the Minister's remarks have tempted me to deal with certain myths and misconceptions about London without a London-wide authority. I draw attention to this only because people need to know as much as possible when they come to make their decision. They need the ability to give as full an answer as possible.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para5"></a>What are some those lessons and myths of the past? It has been said that the removal of the Greater London Council was somehow a destruction of local democracy. It was no more than a local government reorganisation with which one can agree or disagree. We should not imagine that all the problems, real or perceived, of Greater London will disappear with the creation of a mayor and a new authority. The question of resources will be paramount. The question of powers and functions will be extremely important. When such information is known, I believe that people may have different views about the desirability of a directly elected assembly, supporting my contention that there should be two questions. We need to ensure that the new authority does not create the possibility of conflict with the boroughs. We need to ensure that it does not take away their powers. Those are the lessons that we need to learn from the past. Any objective assessment of previous arrangements points to the duplication, delay and cost which resulted from a system which did not seek to avoid duplication, conflict and unnecessary cost.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para6"></a>I draw the Minister's attention to paragraph 2.02 of the Green Paper. Although the document as a whole talks of the authority not taking functions away from local government in the capital, that paragraph refers to the interest of the authority in economic regeneration, planning, transport and environmental protection--examples of borough activities. That is not just the view <P>


<a name="column_400"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 400</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the Conservative Party; it is the view of the last leader of the Greater London Council, as forcefully expressed in another place.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para7"></a>For that reason we attach importance to the consideration of two questions and the ability of the people to decide whether or not they want a directly elected assembly. Our preferred answer is to have an indirectly elected assembly. We say that because we do not believe that the boroughs will take a parochial view. Each is part of an area of the capital and each is vital to the other. If the new authority is to work, there must be an end to the view that boroughs are good only for dealing with allotments and pedestrian crossings provided they are not on main roads. That is something which has bedeviled previous arrangements and is an argument that sadly has been hinted at in your Lordships' House in other debates on London.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para8"></a>My party is committed to the success of London, the capital of the United Kingdom. We endorse all of the comments of the Minister about London as a world class city. We are second to no one in our desire to ensure that it enjoys pre-eminence among the cities of the world. We accept the desire of the people to have a champion in the person of a mayor of London. At another stage we may need to consider the effect of this title on the traditional valued institutions of mayoralty not just in the City where the Lord Mayor has served the whole of London but in the whole of the United Kingdom and in the towns and cities that make up Greater London. We also accept the need for an assembly but not the need for a directly elected body which has the potential to replicate all that was bad about the Greater London Council. We want people to vote in the referendum with the benefit of the answers to some of the questions that have been posed and with the benefit of the Government's firm legislative proposals in answer to questions posed in their own Green Paper. Because they cannot and because, as proposed, they can answer only one question and not two, we have reservations about the Bill. We hope that as it passes through its stages we can remedy some of these ills.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para9"></a>In another place it was said that the Government promised a mayor and an assembly with the proposals being put to a referendum. The Minister repeated that argument today. We were told that the Government did not promise to pick and mix; in other words, "We do it our way. You do it the way we say". What kind of trust is that for the people? If that is the trust that the Government are prepared to place in the people, why bother to ask any questions at all?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-05_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I too begin by thanking the Minister for starting us on the road to strategic government for and by London. The Minister invited declarations of interest. I certainly do not declare an interest as a potential candidate for either of the positions; nor on this occasion do I declare an interest as a London borough councillor--which I am--because we on these Benches see the government of London as a regional and not local matter. I was a little startled to hear the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, refer to the <P>


<a name="column_401"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 401</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>abolition of the GLC as a reorganisation of local government. It felt rather more fundamental than that at the time.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para10"></a>This Bill is only about the referendum, but the need for a new level of government, and the effectiveness and importance of the functions of that new level of government are relevant to the structure of the new authority and therefore what is to be put to the electorate. The electorate will not have long to assess those functions. The estimated date of the arrival of the White Paper is about six weeks before the 7th May. Much is to be said for a post-legislative referendum. I note what the Minister has said about the electorate knowing about the Government's proposals. On this point I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Bowness. Those will be merely proposals and not tested proposals that have gone through the parliamentary process.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para11"></a>The Government have set out in their Green Paper the criteria for the new authority. I do not take issue with them on those. They have said that it should be consensual. One wonders whether that is the right term. It suggests that there may be evidence of the lowest common denominator or perhaps even a code for ignoring minorities. I prefer to think of the new authority as a co-operative model. It also says that it should be audible. The audibility appears to refer only to the mayor. One hopes that "audibility" also means that it will be listened to by central government. One word that does not feature in the list of criteria--I hope it is implicit--is "subsidiarity". It is essential for the success of the new authority that there is a clear distinction between it and the boroughs and that its powers are drawn down from central government.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para12"></a>As to the functions of the authority, we believe that the Green Paper is rather on the timid side. It is widely agreed that transport is an area that must come under the aegis of the new authority. One may say that that is enough for anyone to tackle. But we see the job as being to govern London strategically, and that is a job for the body, not one individual.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para13"></a>In particular we see important strategic roles in the health services--these are matters that are not proposed; but it would be interesting to debate this matter in the context of the new White Paper--and in further education. We are not alone in identifying these as areas that merit further consideration. I have seen a long list of organisations and individuals, including many who have no axe to grind on this subject but who have a useful perspective, who believe that education and health could usefully be dealt with by the new authority. For instance, citizens advice bureaux have mentioned education, and London First has mentioned health. Practically no one has commented that these functions should be excluded. I believe that it is important to get the new authority up and running. If we cannot have everything perfect to start with, we should at least allow for the possibility of adding functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para14"></a>What is to be done is as important as considering how it is to be done. It is essential that not too much power is placed in the hands of one individual. The reasons for the creation of the new authority that may also be taken as benchmarks against which the proposals can be tested <P>


<a name="column_402"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 402</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>can be summarised as follows: the provision of a voice for London; the introduction of local democratic control to a number of services currently provided by government agencies, joint bodies and departments; the increased capacity of London government to achieve identified policy objectives; and ensuring the overriding, or perhaps the reconciling, of parochial interests for the good of London as a whole--in other words, the strategic role. The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, referred to parochial interests. I am delighted if I can rightly read into his speech that Croydon sees itself as part of London.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para15"></a>I believe that at the moment we have what has been described as the world capital of quangos and joint committees whose functions are left almost to the whim of joint arrangements. Certainly, London needs a voice. When for eight years I chaired the London Planning Advisory Committee I was constantly irritated by the fact that foreigners believed that the Lord Mayor of the City of London was Mr. London. But the provision of a voice for London does not necessarily mean that only one individual gets the melody. In my view, not only is London too big for one individual--its population is more than that of Scotland and Wales--but it is inappropriate to allow one person to be cast as having the mandate of 5 million electors. That is empowerment with a vengeance. This is a presidential model, not the prime ministerial model with which we are all familiar.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para16"></a>I was a little disturbed by a comment by the Minister in another place in a debate on 19th November 1997:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The mayor and the assembly are not separable". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para17"></a>We on these Benches agree with that.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An authority without a directly elected mayor would be a very different organisation--one not qualified to give London the clear leadership that it needs".--[Official Report, Commons, 19/11/97; col. 416.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para18"></a>That was an interesting comment, but led me to write in the margin, "Where does this leave the Prime Minister?"
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para19"></a>However, I recognise that there are differences of view. Liberal Democrats generally believe that there is a need to avoid the dangers of an elected dictatorship; to ensure that all the constituent parts of the new authority pull together; to ensure that its members are not merely doing the job of a rubber stamp, or causing gridlock--the two extremes--but do something in between; and to ensure that they have a job worth doing so that the right people are attracted to stand for membership. That goes to our argument that the mayor should come out of the assembly, and, essentially, that a separately elected mayor would not provide effective accountability of the kind that I am sure your Lordships will want to see--accountability on a day-to-day basis, not just once in four years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para20"></a>There are other views which my noble friend Lord Dahrendorf will effectively make. That leads me to say: let there be a debate. The Green Paper did not consult on the different models. Advocates of a directly elected mayoralty often point to New York. Success there in turning things around, as happened in the city, must surely, in large part, be due to the powers being made available. The crackdown on crime, of which we have heard so much, must in large part be due to putting more <P>


<a name="column_403"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 403</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>police on the beat. I was told by someone who has recently returned from a delegation to observe how New York functions, that the Mayor's Office of Budget there has 350 officials; the council, which has a responsibility to scrutinise the budget, has 35 officials--one-tenth.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para21"></a>The comment was made, "If you want to see a democratic deficit in action, go to New York". It is also often said that having a directly elected mayor will lead to an increased turnout. If the revival of democracy depends upon personality politics alone, that leaves me with a sense of unease for the future of our democracy.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para22"></a>I take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, about the desirability of the assembly consisting of London leaders. I had some related experience of that in chairing the London-wide committee, which I have mentioned. It is impossible for London borough councillors to take as their first priority, and to give proper strategic consideration, to the interests of London if their main job is their job in their own boroughs. Not just that, but to have an assembly consisting of London leaders would blur lines of accountability. Good relationships between the boroughs and whatever strategic authority we end up with must not be lost.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para23"></a>The Liberal Democrats are not alone in their concerns. We call for two questions on the referendum so that the matter can be debated publicly. There has been much discussion, especially in another place, on that issue. I will not this afternoon trade lists of names with the Minister. Many people have mentioned to me the report in last Friday's Evening Standard about the postponement of the London Labour regional conference. According to the article, it was to avoid the London Labour Party embarrassing the Government on that issue. I fully expect the Minister to deny that that is the reason for the cancellation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para24"></a>It is fair enough to say that the recommendations are those of the Government; but there are two questions whose answers will be clear. Some people may not like the answers if those two questions are asked, but that is no reason not to ask them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para25"></a>I turn briefly to other parts of the Bill. The referendum, and the question or questions, are not the only novelty. So too will be the electoral arrangements. We urge a "son" of the Scottish Constitutional Convention to bring together interested parties to reach the best solution for the electoral model.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para26"></a>If there is to be a directly elected mayor, there will be two elections. It will be helpful not to have ballot papers, one of which requires a cross and one a one-two-three-and-onwards answer. We will have to have one to six, or however many, probably by the alternative vote when we elect the mayor, if we do so directly, otherwise there will be a serious risk that the mayor will be someone who obtains only 15 per cent. of the vote. So it would be appropriate to have a proportional system for members of the authority. As well as proportionality, we shall look to voter choice and a degree of local connection. London, after all, is of a size, and has enough historically cohesive areas to allow for such a system.
<P>


<a name="column_404"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 404</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para27"></a>Other points, which are not headline points but which are important, relate to the hours of the poll. I hope that it will be possible to give voters longer than the 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. which applies to local elections, given the hours that so many Londoners work, and the distances they have to travel. As to the cost, and how the money is spent, it is important that publicly funded publicity encourages voting but does not encourage the outcome. Some people think that some other people have already started their campaign. Will the Minister explain when election expenses will start running or indeed whether they have already started running?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-05_para28"></a>We welcome the Bill. The referendum must be one which leads to a widely accepted outcome. The Minister talked about trusting Londoners. We must enable the electorate to express its views, and not have just one question to which many Londoners--I should be one--would want to answer, "Well, yes and no". I want to be able to answer resoundingly, and without reservation, "yes" to the whole package.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="71215-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, with the leave of the House I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister on the European Council in Luxembourg on 12th and 13th December, which he attended with my right honourable friends the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. A copy of the conclusions has been placed in the Library of the House. The Statement is as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<A NAME = "71215-06_para0"></a>"The main business of this European Council was the historic decision to launch the enlargement process for Cyprus and the countries of central and eastern Europe. We also discussed EMU. I will deal with this first.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para1"></a>"The question before the Luxembourg Council was how to give effect to the remit from Amsterdam 'to improve the processes of economic co-ordination in stage 3 of economic and monetary union consistent with the principles and practices of the treaty'. Most of this was straightforward. But there was a proposal for the establishment of a body of members of the single currency area only--the so-called Euro-X group--to discuss not only specific questions about the management of the euro, but also a wide range of economic issues of common concern to all 15 member states, including tax reform and the labour market.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para2"></a>"Our concern was to avoid a role for this body which would undermine the role of the ECOFIN Council and cut across the treaty provision that economic policies are a matter of common concern to all member states. This would have created quite unnecessary divisions in the EU.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para3"></a>"The outcome at Luxembourg has confirmed that the ECOFIN Council is the sole decision-making body on economic co-ordination and that the remit of <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_405"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 405</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>the informal body of euro participants will be limited. Whenever matters of common interest to all member states are to be discussed all 15 are entitled to be there, wherever the discussions take place. What is more, in the event of any dispute over what is of common interest the issue can be tabled at ECOFIN, which is the only place decisions can be taken. This is a reasonable and sensible agreement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para4"></a>"The European Council also agreed to intensify further efforts to complete the internal market; to give priority to the computer problems arising from the millennium date change, the so-called millennium bug; and to ensure that environmental protection requirements are integrated into the Community's policies and activities. We also issued statements on the Middle East peace process, food safety, and the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para5"></a>"Let me turn now to enlargement, where we took a series of important decisions. First, we agreed to establish a European conference for the 15 EU member states and those European countries aspiring to join. It will cover co-operation on foreign and security policy, justice and home affairs, and other matters of common concern, particularly economic issues and regional co-operation. Countries respecting certain fundamental principles and values will be invited to take part. Such offers will be made to the 10 central and eastern European applicant countries, Cyprus and Turkey. The first meeting will take place under the UK presidency in London in March at head of government level.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para6"></a>"Secondly, an inclusive enlargement process for all 10 central and eastern European applicant countries and Cyprus will be launched by a meeting at foreign minister level on 30th March. The process will involve accession partnerships with each of the 11 countries and pre-accession aid, which will be increased substantially.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para7"></a>"Thirdly, on the basis of the Commission's recommendations on readiness for membership, formal accession negotiations will open in spring with Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Estonia and Cyprus. Each negotiation will be conducted separately at its own pace. In the case of Cyprus, the accession negotiations should contribute to a political settlement of the inter-communal problem and the Council made clear that in our view representatives of the Turkish Cypriot community should be part of the Cypriot delegation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para8"></a>"For the other five central and eastern European countries--Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia and Slovakia--preparations for the opening of their accession negotiations will be speeded up. The readiness of all 11 applicants will be reviewed regularly. There is no pre-determined order of accession. Individual countries can catch up or be caught up.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para9"></a>"Fourthly, the Council agreed on the importance of a special strategy to prepare Turkey for future accession once the necessary political and economic conditions have been satisfied, according to the same <P>
</UL>

<a name="column_406"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 406</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=3>criteria as other candidates. Turkey herself recognises that time and changes are needed before actual accession negotiations can be envisaged. But full recognition of her eligibility for accession is a marked step forward for Turkey, and I welcome it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para10"></a>"I wrote immediately to Prime Minister Yilmaz to encourage him to take full advantage of this opportunity. I understand Turkish disappointment at being treated in an apparently different way from others. But I continue to hope they will come to see the advantages for them of participation in the European conference as a further step towards eventual membership.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para11"></a>"The House will recognise the significance of these decisions. A giant step has been taken towards the elimination of the divisions in Europe left by the Cold War. Although the negotiations themselves will inevitably take some years, we have a historic opportunity to secure freedom and prosperity across our continent. This has been a longstanding British objective. I am delighted that this process will be launched during the British presidency. We will ensure it gets off to a flying start. I know the whole House will welcome this.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para12"></a>"Reform of EU policies will of course be essential if enlargement is to be successful. In July the Commission circulated its proposals for this reform and for the future financial framework. These envisage further desperately needed reform of the common agricultural policy, reform of the structural and cohesion funds and maintenance of the current 1.27 per cent. ceiling on own resources. The European Council agreed that these ideas represented a good working basis and called for formal legislative proposals from the Commission as soon as possible. We will push this vital work as far as we can during our presidency, although the timetable for final decisions is necessarily longer than that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para13"></a>"This was an important meeting of the European Council. We agreed to launch enlargement negotiations and set a strong framework for all the potential candidates, including Turkey. We gave real impetus to the process of CAP reform. We ensured that the position of the UK in economic policy co-ordination is fully safeguarded. This is an excellent launch-pad for our presidency in the first half of next year. Our priorities will be those which can help transform people's lives, above all jobs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para14"></a>"The Luxembourg Summit showed again that this Government are both positively engaged in Europe as a leading and influential player and resolute in the defence of our interests and what is right. I commend the outcome of the summit to the House as good for Britain, good for the European Union and good for the wider interests of Europe, too".
<P>
</UL>
<A NAME = "71215-06_para15"></a>My Lords, that concludes the Statement.

<P>
<A NAME="71215-06_spnew1"></A><B> Viscount Cranborne: </B>   My Lords, the whole House will be grateful to the Leader of the House for repeating the Statement today. We welcome much of what was achieved in Luxembourg, in particular the maintenance <P>


<a name="column_407"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 407</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the ceiling on own resources. We also welcome the recognition which the Statement gives to the benefits of the agreements on enlargement. Nevertheless, the Leader of the House will recognise that the weekend was overshadowed, in particular for this country, by the Prime Minister's demands for what we were told must be a seat for Britain in any discussion about the euro.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para16"></a>Despite my best efforts, I cannot help but conclude that that seat has not been secured and that, on the very test which the Prime Minister set for the summit, it was not entirely the success which predictably he returned from Luxembourg claiming to be the case.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para17"></a>The Prime Minister wrote an article on the Euro-X issue in today's edition of The Times in which he also claimed a considerable success. The words which he employed--for instance, references to "new rhetoric" and "new substance" on Europe--have a particularly empty ring today. I am sorry to have to say to the Leader of the House that they ring to me as tortuous, repetitive and self-justifying. They remind me more of an excuse from a guilty schoolboy than of a Prime Minister returning triumphant from Luxembourg.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para18"></a>If the Prime Minister's influence is so great, how did he fail so completely to convince even the foreign minister of Luxembourg, with whom he played out a somewhat embarrassing tiff for the benefit of the media, that Britain must have a seat on Euro-X? Furthermore, can the Leader of the House explain an issue which is not entirely clear to me even now having heard the Statement repeated and having read the Prime Minister's article in The Times today? Is this country now a member of Euro-X? If not, when precisely can we attend the committee? Is it when we decide or when our partners invite us to do so? Are there any limits on Britain's power to speak and vote at such meetings? By what mechanism precisely will this country play a part in decisions in Euro-X on the introduction of the euro? Who precisely decides whether matters discussed by Euro-X are of common interest?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para19"></a>The Statement refers to a dispute. If there is a dispute, is only one person--one disputant--required in order for the matter to be transferred to ECOFIN, or is some agreement or common conclusion necessary? If it is one reference, we should be very much happier.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para20"></a>Will the matters of common interest include the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar and the yen, and, indeed, the exchange rate between the "ins" and "outs"? Does the Leader of the House agree with the French Foreign Minister that Euro-X will be able to discuss European Union tax harmonisation and budgetary matters without the presence of non-EMU members? If that is so, is this country not going to be presented with a fait accompli on key matters affecting the future of the Community? Is it not the case that in Amsterdam the Government sold out British business on the social chapter and surrendered our veto in 15 areas? It seemed to me that, as a result of that treaty, they have given away a mass of hard-won British positions and asked nothing in return. Is it not equally clear that in Luxembourg, on the euro, the Prime Minister thought he could demand a pay-off for his Amsterdam surrender and got a brush off in return?

<A NAME = "71215-06_para21"></a>On enlargement, on this side, we welcome the decision to enlarge the frontiers of the Union. That was something for which the last Prime Minister, Mr. Major, fought long and hard and the success of this agreement is in no small measure due to the foundations laid then. We fully support the opening of membership talks for 10 East European countries and Cyprus next year and we support the decision to fast track negotiations for the five so-called first-wave countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para22"></a>Does the Leader of the House recognise, as I am sure he does, that there is a genuine common interest across this House to see a wider Europe come to pass? But will he also accept--I am sure he will--that the position of Turkey is extremely delicate? After all, Turkey has been a stalwart member of NATO. It has a free market and a functioning government who, for all their imperfections at times, are far older than some of the other aspirants to European Union membership. It plays a responsible and pivotal role in an increasingly unstable area of the world which shares a common frontier with a number of nations in which war and dictatorship sometimes seem to be endemic. Therefore, will the Leader of the House assure us that Turkey will be treated with the respect it deserves and will be judged no more harshly than other aspirants to membership?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para23"></a>Will the noble Lord outline what plans the Government have to bring Turkey into the enlargement process? Will he explain a little more precisely what is planned at the conferences proposed with Turkey as an alternative to membership talks and what response, if any, there has been from the Turkish Government to that idea?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para24"></a>The Statement also refers to CAP reform. That is something which is very dear to noble Lords on this side of the House, as I am glad to see it is to those on the government side. However, I wonder whether the Prime Minister used the excuse of discussion on CAP reform to discuss the even more urgent matter of beef. If he did, did he manage to secure any concrete assurances in relation to the early lifting of the ban on British beef in view of the precipitate and draconian action against beef farmers which the Minister of Agriculture has announced in the past few days?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para25"></a>Despite the Prime Minister's presence at the summit and what Mr. Blair called in The Times with perhaps--and I hope I am not being unduly rude--a touch of Walter Mitty, a new understanding in Europe of Britain's influence and determination, will the noble Lord also confirm that only today the European Union has deferred action for another three months to bring its rules on the slaughter of cattle in abattoirs into line with UK practice? Is it not also the case that, while those events were unfolding in Luxembourg, the Minister of Agriculture was outvoted by 14 votes to one this morning on the proposal to ban the sale of beef on the bone?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para26"></a>In view of all that, I wonder whether the Leader of the House, on second thoughts, is really so pleased with the effectiveness of "the new presentational style" in Europe. If he is, I wonder whether he should be. Should he rather not ask himself whether the Prime Minister <P>


<a name="column_409"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>was not in error in thinking that such a style would be all that would be required in order to change the difficult realities of international diplomacy?

<P>
<A NAME="71215-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Hillhead: </B>   My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord the Lord Privy Seal for discharging his duty to this House and repeating the Statement. The last time I attended the European Council in Luxembourg, the noble Baroness, Lady Thatcher, threw away a settlement which the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, then had to labour throughout a whole night a month later, nevertheless with a great deal of loss of goodwill, in order to put it together in almost exactly the same shape. I mention that partly retrospectively and partly because we must remember that in some ways that Ruritanian city of Luxembourg of high plateaux and deep gorges is not always a happy terrain for British Prime Ministers.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para27"></a>I have asked myself whether the Euro X battle was a wise or necessary one in which to engage. As I think Mr. Blair has, retains and deserves a good deal of goodwill in Europe, a face-saving compromise was achieved. But I believe that the battle which could not have been won was unnecessarily elevated as an issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para28"></a>There is also a paradox as the Government, following the Chancellor's statement in October, are now generally recognised to be set on a course towards entry into the single currency. As that will necessitate a referendum, it will inevitably be one of the most powerful arguments which the Government will have to deploy that you cannot have full influence without full participation. If we had been given full participation in the management committee without membership of the club, a good deal of ground would have been cut from under the feet of the Government in that important argument which is to come.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para29"></a>We are now embarked on a great programme of enlargement which leaves the first enlargement, which brought Britain, Denmark and Ireland into the Community--and at least one of those three has been a very popular member of the Community--the second enlargement when Greece came in, the third for Spain and Portugal and the fourth for Sweden, Finland and Austria looking minor and easy compared with that on which we are now embarked. I welcome that course. It is necessary and appropriate to discharge our duty to unify Europe. But it is also somewhat hazardous. If the outcome of between 20 and 30 members is not to be an amorphous mass, it certainly requires the strengthening of the sinews of decision-making in the existing Community.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para30"></a>Turkey is put in a special category. I retain certain doubts. Turkey is clearly a country of great strategic importance. It was one of the hinges of that old board game, which never lasted as long as Monopoly, called Diplomacy. There were about three countries and if you secured them, that almost always determined the result. Consequently, the United States, as the one remaining world power, is strongly in favour of Turkish entry. I am certainly not in favour of being against the United States for its own sake. In general, I tend to take the contrary view. But America is not a member of the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>European Union and does not have responsibility for its internal cohesion. I have always believed that three criteria were necessary for admission: first, the country should have a settled will to join; secondly, it should clearly be European in nature; and thirdly, it should be indisputably a democracy with all the human rights which go with that word. Spain and Portugal in the late 1970s--although only fairly recently democracies--with which it fell to me to open negotiations clearly fulfilled all three criteria, and very good members of the Community they have been.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para31"></a>With the best will in the world, I am not sure that Turkey fulfils more than one of the three--the first. It cannot change its geographical position or its ethnic composition. But I think it must at least fully meet the third criterion on democracy and human rights before membership arises.

<A NAME="71215-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the part of the noble Viscount's contribution which welcomed the Prime Minister's Statement. I am also grateful for the broad welcome which the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, gave it. I have to tell him at the outset that I do not accept his magisterial rebuke about Euro X. I shall say a few words about that in a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para32"></a>The noble Viscount criticises what the Prime Minister said when he returned from the European summit. I cannot help but recall the phraseology of Mr. Major when he returned from Maastricht. Your Lordships may remember that he said, "Game, set and match". I believe that was the exact phrase that he used. The game went wrong; the set was not in his direction; and as far as the match was concerned, he certainly lost it. Compared with that it seems to me that what my right honourable friend the Prime Minister stated in his article in The Times today is extremely moderate and exceedingly accurate.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para33"></a>I begin with Euro X. Of course those countries that are "ins" are entitled to meet. Not only are they entitled to meet but I cannot forbear from reminding the noble Viscount that the right of the "ins" to meet is enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty which his party negotiated when in government. It seems to me that in those circumstances the one thing we cannot do is to prevent that kind of meeting. What we can do on the other hand is to make sure that decisions which affect the future of the euro are not taken in that meeting but are taken in ECOFIN. We can also ensure that in circumstances where they are discussing matters of common interest, Britain will have the right to be represented. I do not think, with respect, that the noble Viscount can have had the opportunity yet of reading the conclusions. When our positions were reversed, he will remember that the theme I reiterated to him and to the House was that they should read the conclusions and not merely the Statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para34"></a>I am happy to say that the conclusions are clear. They state:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the ECOFIN Council is the only body empowered to formulate and adopt the broad economic policy guidelines which constitute the main instrument of economic co-ordination. The defining position of the ECOFIN Council at the centre of the economic co-ordination <P>

The Ministers of the States participating in the euro area may meet informally among themselves to discuss issues connected with their shared specific responsibilities for the single currency ... Whenever matters of common interest are concerned they will be discussed by Ministers of all Member States. Decisions will in all cases be taken by the ECOFIN Council in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para35"></a>The noble Viscount asked me who could take a matter to ECOFIN if there was an argument as to what was a matter of common interest. Any one country can do that. As the noble Viscount will know, ECOFIN is the only place where the decisions can be taken. The noble Viscount asked for some reassurance on Turkey. The noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, also referred to Turkey. The Presidency conclusions state:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Council confirms Turkey's eligibility for accession to the European Union. Turkey will be judged on the basis of the same criteria as the other applicant States. While the political and economic conditions allowing accession negotiations to be envisaged are not satisfied, the European Council considers that it is nevertheless important for a strategy to be drawn up to prepare Turkey for accession by bringing it closer to the European Union in every field".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para36"></a>The conclusions then set out what that strategy should consist in:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"development of the possibilities afforded by the Ankara Agreement; intensification of the Customs Union; implementation of financial co-operation; approximation of laws and adoption of the Union acquis; participation, to be decided, case by case, in certain programmes and in certain agencies provided for in paragraphs 19 and 21". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para37"></a>It goes on in some detail. I hope I may quote one other sentence on the attitude of the European Council towards Turkey. It states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The European Council recalls that strengthening Turkey's links with the European Union also depends on that country's pursuit of the political and economic reforms on which it has embarked ... The European Council endorses the guidelines that emerged from the General Affairs Council ... on future relations between the Union and Turkey and asks the Commission to submit suitable proposals". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para38"></a>I hope that I have been able to give the noble Viscount some reassurance on that. However, if I have managed to reassure him as regards Turkey, I suspect that I have not reassured the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para39"></a>I accept that the position of Turkey is delicate. However, almost all members of the Community, with the possible exception of Greece, believe that Turkey should be encouraged to get its policies and affairs into a state where it is eligible for accession negotiations to start. In some ways it is perhaps unfortunate that--one can see that this is what the Turkish Government might feel about it--it cannot be treated in precisely the same way as the others at this stage. My right honourable friend wrote to the Prime Minister of Turkey immediately after the conference urging him to recognise that from the Turkish point of view this was a considerable step forward. I have not yet seen a response to that telegram, although I think it is probably fair to say that the position of the Turkish Government at the moment is not one of unalloyed enthusiasm for the Statement as it emerged from Luxembourg.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-06_para40"></a>When the noble Viscount sat down I was not sure whether he thought we had achieved a good deal on Euro X or a bad deal. I was not sure whether he thought <P>


<a name="column_412"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 412</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>we should have said, "If you want to talk, go ahead and talk, and we shall have nothing to do with it", or whether he thought that a situation in which we took one view and the other countries took another view and they arrived at a sensible accord in the middle is not the way in which negotiations should be carried to--as in this case--a successful conclusion.

Is it not really the case that what comes out of this kerfuffle is that being outside the institutions of the Union, whether they be formal or informal, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkins of Hillhead, pointed out, is an uncomfortable position for Britain to be in?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I have always taken the view--I have taken this view consistently since I first entered politics many years ago--that if events are taking place in Europe it is important that Britain should be part of them and should be able to influence them. I merely point out that what has been achieved at Luxembourg in relation to Euro X and in relation to the enshrinement of ECOFIN as the decision-making body--the noble Lord may shake his head, but he knows as well as I do that that is the place where decisions can be taken and should be taken, and under this agreement will be taken--and the expression that it has in the communique goes a long way to safeguarding Britain's position.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   My Lords, I do not think we should be unduly worried by the fact that this new committee, Euro X, will meet from time to time to discuss matters of common interest on the assumption that the members have some constructive plans of their own which may differ from the plans that the United Kingdom seeks to propose. Surely the boot will be on the other foot. They will need the expertise of the United Kingdom in order to arrive at some rational conclusion.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para0"></a>It must not be assumed that this unofficial committee has a monopoly of wisdom. The United Kingdom has contacts in many fields and organisations that are right outside the scope of many of those who are members of the Euro X committee. So I am not particularly bothered about that. There has been an unofficial committee in existence ever since the Franco-German treaty of 1963. France and Germany have been meeting a fortnight before every council meeting in order to determine what their joint policy will be. There is no reason why that should not be extended among the remainder of the hoi-polloi, and to the Government. I view the existence of the new committee with a certain degree of equanimity. I am quite convinced that our own intellectual, economic and ordinary contacts throughout the world are just as powerful as any combination that it may propose.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para1"></a>What does bother me is the degree to which it may become institutionalised. Who is to pay the budget costs of the new Euro X? Will it be like the European <P>


<a name="column_413"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 413</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Parliament, which departs every now and again to rather more favourable climates, at considerable expense, in order to deliberate under rather more climatically favourable conditions? Who is to determine the budget for the Euro X committee and its meetings, bearing in mind that all budgetary decisions are determined by qualified majority vote?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para2"></a>Will the Government inform the House as to whether the Commission will be present at the new Euro X committee? If the Commission is to be part of the new unofficial committee, then I sense danger. If I were in the Government and dealing with questions of that kind I should ensure a formal insistence now that an unofficial (or informal) meeting at whatever geographical location be made without the presence of the Commission. The Commission has a genius for insinuating itself into everything that happens everywhere in the Community. Let us bear in mind that it still maintains the monopoly on making any proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para3"></a>Subject to that, I view the visit of the Prime Minister as one of qualified success. He spoke in general terms. Of course there are always hard choices to be made; however, he spoke in general and expressed a view with which I believe most people in the country would agree. We shall watch with interest, but with an eagle eye, the way in which the Commission seeks to insinuate itself in this new development with a view to accomplishing its own ends.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, my noble friend once said that he thought the Government's European policy was a qualified success. I have to tell him that I am in danger of rushing out to re-examine it! However, I am delighted to hear his comments. Indeed I could agree in part with what he said. Again, that does not always happen on European issues. My noble friend said that the committee has no monopoly of wisdom. That is true. But, with great respect, neither do we. An accumulation of combined wisdom is rather more likely to produce sensible results than wisdom in isolation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para4"></a>My noble friend asked whether the Commission would be present. I understand that it will.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Bruce of Donington: </B>   Ah!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, he asked who will pay. Any proposals to meet expenses of informal meetings will need to be handled through the normal budgetary procedure. Officials will therefore need to discuss it. I believe that those were the only two questions asked by my noble friend until he gave us his accolade of "a qualified success", for which, to be serious for a moment, I am grateful.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Williams of Crosby: </B>   My Lords, we cannot expect to be part of the strategic discussions on monetary union until such time as we decide one way or the other whether to join European monetary union. Perhaps I may add my congratulations through the Leader of the House to the present Prime Minister for having achieved a satisfactory outcome in all the circumstances.
<P>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 414</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para5"></a>Perhaps I may also draw attention to the other part of the Statement dealing with the major responsibility that the UK presidency will have to make a success of the first stages of enlargement. Given the Foreign Secretary's commitment to democratic institutions and human rights, will the Leader of the House confirm that the issue of the third requirement of new members will be very much in mind in the negotiations that will start under the UK presidency to begin the process of enlarging the European Union? Perhaps I may underline that this is one of the great historic moments of the century: the enlargement of the European Union to include the former central and east European states.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the noble Baroness's remarks. The answer to her question is yes--we are very conscious of it, and the Foreign Secretary underlined the issue in the course of the past month or so.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may put a short question. The Statement refers to an impetus towards reform of the CAP. The noble Lord the Leader of the House referred to it, as did my noble friend the Leader of the Opposition. Which way was that impetus leading? What was discussed? Will the noble Lord give the House more information, as it appears to be the policy of both the Government and the Opposition, although it may be somewhat disparate?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I commend the communique to the noble Lord. I am glad that he was able to ask a question; however, I do not believe that he was here when I began the Statement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para6"></a>Perhaps I may refer to paragraph 40 on the common agricultural policy, which states that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The European Council took note of the outcome of proceedings of the Agriculture Council ... European agriculture must, as an economic sector, be versatile, sustainable, competitive and spread throughout European territory, including regions with specific problems. The process of reform begun in 1992 should be continued, deepened, adapted and completed, extending it to Mediterranean production". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para7"></a>That is what the Council wishes to see achieved.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The reform should lead to economically sound, viable solutions which are socially acceptable and make it possible to ensure fair income, to strike a fair balance between production sectors, producers and regions and to avoid distortion of competition". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para8"></a>The Commission has already produced proposals which will go some way--not totally, but some way--in that direction. The Council requested that the Commission should put those proposals into legislative form and bring them in front of the Agriculture Council. So to sum the matter up in a sentence: the show is now on the road so far as reform of the CAP is concerned. It is now a live issue as opposed to merely being the odd paragraph in a communique.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Barnett: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may suggest to my noble friend that he makes my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington an official or unofficial observer at the Euro X meetings, since nothing seems likely to emerge from them that will matter very much to us. Is it strictly the case that ECOFIN can make quite sure that <P>


<a name="column_415"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 415</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any formal decisions of an economic and financial nature will be decided by that body rather than by Euro X?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para9"></a>Secondly, perhaps I may thank the Prime Minister and my noble friend as chairman of the Select Committee which decided that negotiations on enlargement should be broadly in line with what has been decided. At least, I think that is the case--that they will start with five plus one, and Britain will be in charge of the start of that process.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para10"></a>As to the resources limit of 1.27 per cent., while I accept that that will be the case, do my noble friend and leaders of the other member states believe that they will have enough resources, both in advance of enlargement and after it, to meet the serious problems that will clearly arise?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-07_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for welcoming the Statement and for the role that my honourable friend played. However, I thought that I read out specifically Clause 44 of the Conclusions which reiterates the fact that:

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"ECOFIN Council is the centre for the co-ordination of the Member States' economic policy and is empowered to act in the relevant areas.

<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para11"></a>A little later the document uses the phrase that,

<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para12"></a>So there is no doubt as to where the decision-making power lies in these areas.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-07_para13"></a>The key at Luxembourg is that in relation to informal discussions outside ECOFIN in which the "ins" may wish to take part, wherever matters of common interest are concerned, they will be discussed by ministers of all member states. What it says is fairly clear and, if I may echo my noble friend, it is a reasonable result to come out of the negotiations.

<A NAME = "71215-08_para0"></a>However, I am afraid that I am not so happy about the relationship between the so-called Euro-X and ECOFIN. I do not dispute for a moment what the Leader of the House said about the absolute supremacy of ECOFIN in making decisions. It alone can make decisions; that is part of the Maastricht Treaty. But that treaty makes no mention whatever of a Euro-X committee; it does not exist; it has no basis. A treaty would have to be agreed unanimously before it could be set up and given a major role. So what is left for this so-called Euro-X? Informal meetings. The essence of informal meetings in part is that the members have not been able to have the presence of the Commission and the other institution, as it would be, the European Bank. That was the position. If we had stuck to that and if the Community had not been agreed, even if they had informal meetings without us being present, they would not have been able to bring the Commission in, to give it authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para1"></a>The other point that worries me is what the Leader said, when being questioned. He said that if there was a dispute about our wish to attend a particular meeting of the Euro-X committee between the committee and ourselves, such as if there was a dispute over whether we had the right to attend because it was of common interest, the matter would then go to ECOFIN for a decision. But by what vote? Qualified majority voting? The members of Euro-X and the common currency would more than account for the majority, the qualified majority in ECOFIN.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para2"></a>All we seem to have done, as a result, is to give a kind of status to the new body, a seven-page resolution, although resolutions do not have all that much status. It is a seven-page resolution describing what it can do and others cannot. I see no reason why we should feel that this is an advance over the position that was absolutely clear under the Maastricht Treaty.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I have to say, not for the first time to my noble friend, that I do not share his apocalyptic view of European politics. The short point is that a number of countries have agreed to come together for matters of what they conceive to be in their common interest. To assume, as my noble friend does and other Euro-sceptics have done in the past, that because there is some lacuna somewhere by which if you are tortuous enough you can trace a danger to a possible future British government and its position, is unfortunate. I say that respectfully to my noble friend who has considerable experience in these matters. There has to be some trust in European countries and European institutions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para3"></a>A situation in which the countries under Maastricht meet by themselves, whether the Commission is there or not, does not seem to me to be of vast consequence. It seems to me that would be a pretty good protection of British interests for us to have the right to attend that committee meeting whenever it discusses matters of common interest which would affect Great Britain and then, if there is a row--and it is difficult to envisage it <P>


<a name="column_417"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 417</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>being serious--as to what is or is not a matter of common interest, to have the right ourselves to take it to the only body that is entitled to take the decision, which is ECOFIN.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para4"></a>I know that my noble friend Lord Bruce of Donington will not agree and I hear him behind me saying "No". However, if we had it copper-bottomed, tied in a treaty, ratified by all the nations in the Community, I suspect that even then my noble friend would find that there was something wrong with the copper, the seals were not in the form they should be, the treaty had not been ratified properly and it was all a plot to do the British down. I do not share my noble friend's view as to the inherent dangers in anything European.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-08_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Tordoff: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may take the Leader of the House back to the conference which is being arranged for the complete list of applicants. The noble Viscount raised the point and asked about the agenda for such a conference. It will be a pleasure to your Lordships' Select Committee to hear that the conference is taking place. As we heard in the recent debate, there was concern that people who were not in the first phase might feel shut out and this might well be a way of helping them through that difficulty.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para5"></a>However, would the noble Lord care to comment on the reports in the press that Turkey has already rejected membership of that conference for itself and has gone further? It has said that if the accession of Cyprus is proceeded with, without it being the whole island, Turkey would incorporate Northern Cyprus into the Turkish Republic.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, I have not seen those reports and I would not dream of commenting on press reports I had not seen; nor on a telegram from the Turkish Government which I had not read. However, my understanding--and I put it no higher than that--was that the initial reaction of the Turkish Government, though heavily critical, did not absolutely reject the possibility of its attending the European conference.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para6"></a>While I am on my feet, perhaps I may answer my noble friend Lord Shore, and maybe I should have done so earlier. It may go some way towards reassuring him, though I am not confident of that. If there is a dispute as to what is or is not a matter of interest, the matter goes to ECOFIN. ECOFIN will then decide the issue on the substance, not merely the procedural point as to whether it is a matter of common interest that should go back to Euro-X. I hope my noble friend finds that reassuring.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-08_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare: </B>   My Lords, I begin by answering the question the Minister asked in the first few moments of her speech: the only thing that <P>


<a name="column_418"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 418</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I will be declaring today is that I supported the Prime Minister when, as Leader of the Opposition a year ago, he suggested that there should be a mayor and an authority. I supported him again when he became Prime Minister and I am delighted that my Front Bench decided that it too approved of there being a mayor.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para8"></a>My support was given because I began my political life as a Greater London councillor, defeating Sir William Fiske, the great Labour leader of the Greater London Council, in Romford and Hornchurch. Being only 26 at the time, Sir William was one of the finest politicians I had ever dealt with in my young life. It was a privilege to be allowed to follow him on the Greater London Council.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para9"></a>I add too that, despite the abolition of the GLC and the amount of discussion that may go on about the removal of that body, like the Minister I admire greatly the work of London First and congratulate it and my noble friend Lord Sheppard on the amount it has done. However, it would be unwise for anyone to declare their interest in the post of mayor before we see what the people of London decide on 7th May next year and-- I go further--until we know what shape the Bill will take. We will not even see the Bill until 23rd March.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para10"></a>A point was made by the Minister on the question in two parts. I watched her closely when it came to her argument on the subject. Like the Deputy Prime Minister in another place, she read the wording very carefully indeed. It led me to believe that many people on the Benches opposite--not just ourselves and the Liberal party--are not convinced by the arguments that she and the Deputy Prime Minister put forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para11"></a>I remind the House, because we heard a Statement in between, that on 7th May the question will be:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Are you in favour of the government's proposals for a Greater London Authority, made up of an elected mayor and a separately elected assembly?". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para12"></a>Most people reading those words would not be in much doubt that it is already two questions for the price of one. I join the Liberal party in believing that it should be two questions. Can the Minister say, when she replies, why the people of Scotland are allowed two questions and we are not? Are they in some way superior to we Londoners? Cannot the people of London be trusted with two questions? Cannot those two questions be put to us?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para13"></a>The Minister suggested that when we see the White Paper on 23rd March we will then have enough knowledge on which to decide this question. I ask: is the Minister suggesting that every word in the White Paper will automatically go through and be the law of our land? I think not. I think there may be some changes. We saw a rebellion in the House last week. Is the Minister suggesting that the Labour Party is now such a machine that it can deliver a White Paper and it will be law? I do not accept that, and I am shocked that the Minister does.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para14"></a>I hope that when the Minister comes to reply she will not read out a carefully worded statement but that she will have the courage to say that perhaps we should recognise the position of two questions. The Green Paper, in its strength, allowed us to discuss what we felt, <P>


<a name="column_419"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 419</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>although I do not agree with the Minister that 700 replies from a city of 7 million voters is pleasing. That is 0.001 per cent. The Minister can consult her replies; I have studied the matter extremely carefully. There are 1,200 replies--500 from institutions and 700 from individuals. The 700 individuals represent 0.001 per cent. of the people entitled to vote in London. That is certainly not a result which many of us would consider conclusive.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-08_para15"></a>I hope that the Minister will be courageous enough--if she believes in it--to say to the Deputy Prime Minister, "We would gain great credit in saying in the White Paper that we think it should be two questions." The Minister laughs. I can tell her that the people to whom I speak in London are not laughing; they are insulted at being asked one question when the people of Scotland are offered two.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-09_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I laugh at the noble Lord's suggestion that I would not have the courage to say to the Deputy Prime Minister what I believe to be right. I shall not put that point to the Deputy Prime Minister because I do not believe it to be valid. That is a point to which I shall return at some length in my summing-up.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare: </B>   My Lords, I apologise to the Minister. I have heard her speak from the Dispatch Box ever since she came to this House and I would not suggest for one moment that she lacked courage. As many are in this House, I am full of admiration for the standard she displays at the Dispatch Box. But that does not stop me saying, "Get out and tell the Deputy Prime Minister if you disagree with him". Ask him, "Why do we not put two questions on the paper?".
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para0"></a>In relation to the figure of 700, I wonder how many people in this House actually knew that there was to be a referendum on 7th May. It may be that everybody can raise their hands and say "Yes, of course I knew about it". But I was stopped in the street the other day by a man who said to me, "Jeffrey, will Tony Blair allow you to be the mayor of London?" I had to explain to him that it had absolutely nothing to do with the Prime Minister. Only last night someone said to me, "I am a livery man and I hear you want to be Lord Mayor of London". The point of those two stories is that we have a huge education job to do between now and 7th May and whenever someone stands as mayor of this great city.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para1"></a>I turn to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, on the Liberal Democrat Front Bench. She said, niggardly and gained laughter--rightly so--that one or two people had already started campaigning for the job. I hope they have. We are asking someone to govern a city of 8 million people and 32 boroughs, not including the City, and 74 constituencies. I say, without any fear, that I have visited the Mayor of Moscow, the Mayor of Jerusalem, the Mayor of Paris and the Mayor of New York. Even before one knows what the White Paper says, it may be wise to go to cities where mayors have <P>


<a name="column_420"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 420</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>governed great areas. I do not agree when the noble Baroness says that it would place too much responsibility in one hand.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. Perhaps he will accept that my point was not merely about the merits or otherwise of a direct election. My specific question to the Minister related to starting election expenses. As the noble Lord said, some people may well have started campaigning for the position.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare: </B>   My Lords, I accept that totally. It will fascinate the noble Baroness to know that I have thought of that as well. I approached the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, and asked if I was doing anything wrong in visiting the mayors of Moscow, Paris and New York. He assured me that I was not. The only reason he gave me that assurance is that he does not have the authority to do otherwise.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para2"></a>People are taking this important post seriously. If they are not, we will have a mayor and an authority in two years' time who will sit down and say, "Now we have got the job, what do we have to do?". It may be wiser that whoever considers that they may be in for the post--whether they be individuals or in parties--should arrive on the day with some idea of what they want to do and of the organisation that is needed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para3"></a>I totally agree with those on the Liberal Benches about time. I hope the Minister will allow more time to vote on 7th May than is normally given in an election of this kind. The Deputy Prime Minister has said that this is a very important election and that he considers it to be a change even in the way we work our system in this country. So why do we not spend a lot of time making sure that people know, first, what they are voting for and, secondly, give them enough time? The point was made very well by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee. For those who travel into London early in the morning and travel back, it is important that we do not close the polls before they return or do not open them before they have started out for work. We must not disqualify people from being able to say "Yes" or "No" to whether they want a mayor.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para4"></a>Perhaps I may conclude on the problems of proportional representation. I feel strongly on this matter. If we are to have a system of alternate votes or possibly a list system the whole idea may be thrown into disarray. We are discussing today whether we have a mayor. We must take very seriously indeed how that mayor and how that Greater London authority will be elected. I hope the Minister will be able to say to the House that nothing has been decided, that the Government are still listening and are still thinking, and that we shall not have double ideas on how the mayor should be elected and then have the Greater London authority elected in a totally different way.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para5"></a>I conclude as I began. I welcome the Bill. I congratulate the Government on having brought it forward. But I must say to them that I look forward to seeing the White Paper on 23rd March because I feel one will have a more robust attitude to that than one has to the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Levene of Portsoken: </B>   My Lords, I claim no exemption from the trepidation which grips each newcomer to your Lordships' House at the time of their first speech. Such trepidation is, nonetheless, softened by the great honour which I deeply sense in becoming a Member of this House, together with the warmth of the welcome, both from your Lordships and from the extremely helpful and courteous staff.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para6"></a>In terms of experience, I hope that the unusual privilege for one who did not start out in the Civil Service of having served for a period of six years as a Permanent Secretary, followed by a five-year stint advising the last Prime Minister, will have proved a good apprenticeship and source of understanding for some of the work with which your Lordships have to deal.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para7"></a>More unusually, however, I have also been a member of the Court of Common Council of the Corporation of London for the past 14 years, 13 of them as an alderman. I can thereby take some comfort in the familiarity which I find in your Lordships' House, in terms of both its layout and proceedings, with those found in Guildhall. There are those who contend that the practices of Guildhall may even pre-date those of Westminster. Indeed, if there is one element of good house training I can particularly claim to bring to Westminster from Guildhall, it is an extremely good hat-doffing technique.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para8"></a>But, just as your Lordships would readily claim that in this House the obsolete nature of the introduction ceremony is purely incidental to our main work here, the same applies in the City, too. Beyond the pomp and circumstance, the Lord Mayor and the Corporation have a serious, time-consuming and increasingly important task, which is to help to market the City as an international financial centre, to enhance its attractiveness to inward investors, to maintain an orderly and efficient planning process and property market, and to ensure that the training needs of the City are properly met.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para9"></a>The City is an exceptional place. It is primarily a place where business is done rather than where people live, which is reflected in the great disparity between its residential population of 5,000 or so and its working population of almost a quarter of a million every day.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para10"></a>The attitude of the Lord Mayor and the Corporation towards the proposed new mayor and assembly is straightforward. The relationship would work perfectly satisfactorily, as in the past, first with the LCC and subsequently with the GLC. It will, of course, be very important to ensure that the delineation of responsibilities between the two mayors and the two authorities is clear and that the job of preserving and enhancing the City of London as the world's leading international financial centre, which is central to the Corporation's role on behalf of the City's business community, is maintained.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para11"></a>To this end the Lord Mayor and the Corporation take a pro-active role in inward investment and export promotion, marketing the City worldwide through trade missions and the Corporation' specialist departments. The Corporation was a founder member of the London <P>


<a name="column_422"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 422</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>First Centre which, together with the Westminster City Council and the London Docklands Development Corporation, works for the encouragement of inward investment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para12"></a>The co-ordination of the critical task of promoting the London financial services industry overseas is now undertaken by British Invisibles, which is shortly to be merged with the Corporation's own CEENET organisation, and this combined group will be under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Hurd. The new combined group is working hard to ensure that all the promotional activities which are organised for the industry overseas are carefully co-ordinated.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para13"></a>But the Corporation's primary role must be to work on behalf of the City and the immediate surrounding areas where there should be a reservoir of local talent for the City and its service industries. In reality those areas are some of the most deprived to be found in the United Kingdom, as I saw in Tower Hamlets when I was working to resurrect Canary Wharf. For that reason, the Corporation took a lead in the establishment of the City Fringe Partnership with the London boroughs of Camden, Hackney, Islington and Tower Hamlets; it is also a member of the Pool of London Partnership which aims to improve the area around the Tower of London, Tower Hamlets and north Southwark.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para14"></a>The Corporation is involved too in the Cross River Partnership which links the Corporation with the London boroughs of Lambeth and Southwark, the City of Westminster and other groups, which are working on harnessing the potential of the river as part of the Deputy Prime Minister's Thames 2000 Initiative.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para15"></a>At the last general election no party stood on a platform of abolition of the Corporation, and the Corporation is happily now recognised as an efficient local authority for the business City, a good neighbour to other London boroughs and a fine ambassador for London as a world financial centre.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para16"></a>Much has been heard recently about the need for the City to revise its franchise. What is not generally understood is that the Corporation has wished for many years to modernise its franchise and that following the election it put forward proposals, which have been discussed very constructively with the Government, to bring us into a format suitable for the 21st century.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para17"></a>The Lord Mayor and the Corporation are ready and willing to work in harmony with a new mayor and assembly. The Lord Mayor is committed to continue to play a constructive and co-operative role in terms of the future governance of London and to play his unique role as a spokesman and ambassador for the City of London. If I am fortunate enough to be elected to succeed him at the end of next year, then it is certainly my intention to continue in the same way. I am most grateful to your Lordships for your courtesy, patience and kind attention.

<A NAME="71215-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, as I follow the noble Lord, Lord Levene, it is my pleasure to congratulate him on his speech. We were indeed privileged to have a maiden speech on this subject by someone who has been so deeply involved in London <P>


<a name="column_423"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 423</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the City and who is able to speak with such authority. I know that we shall hear a great deal more from him as time goes by.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para18"></a>I was quite shocked by some of the opening remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman. She described London as being in a pathetic state. She went on to say that for too long nothing had been done. A further comment was that the citizens of London had done their best to fill the vacuum. That sounds almost like a Blitz mentality. I do not believe that London is in a desperate mess. It is good to have a voice for London and I am pleased that we are returning to that arrangement. But London has not been surviving and deteriorating non-stop since 1986. I was a member of the GLC at that time until the flag was lowered. I was there that night. What the noble Baroness said over-estimated the situation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para19"></a>The London boroughs have taken on many responsibilities and a good many of them were far better passed on to the boroughs. I have spoken before in your Lordships' House about my own constituency where there was a dreadful nightclub, full of people with drugs and knives who broke up the area. No matter how much we attempted to prevent the club being re-licensed, the GLC always did so. However, when the local borough took responsibility for it, it knew how bad the situation was and rapidly a solution was found. So there are issues that are far better dealt with locally by people who know about them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para20"></a>However, there are other important issues. It is important to have a strategic authority. We want to see better control of traffic, routes and roads throughout London. I hope that the Government will introduce a power to control minicabs in the capital. When the present Government were in opposition they strongly supported that suggestion, but nothing has yet been done about it. It constitutes quite a danger to the public because London is the only part of the United Kingdom where there is no control or protection for those who use minicabs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para21"></a>I shall not go on about the noble Baroness's references to stratagems, devices and there being no democratic mandate at the present time. That is quite an exaggeration. Every local authority in London has a democratic mandate and they do what they do because they were elected for their area. The old GLC was a vast bureaucracy which began to meddle in all kinds of things which had nothing to do with regional government.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para22"></a>When the time came to disperse the assets of the GLC I was appalled to discover that it owned not hundreds, but thousands of properties that it did not even know it owned. It had owned them for so long and had acquired them for such a variety of purposes, that it had totally overlooked the fact that the properties were even in the ownership of the GLC. Some of the properties had not had rent collected for them for many years. There was no liaison between departments. The surveyor's department never spoke to the legal department and they never sent copies of correspondence to one another. If one tried to help in a particular case one found oneself up against an impossible barrier between the <P>


<a name="column_424"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 424</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>departments. So when the strategic authority arrives it is important that it comes in a practical, strategic and small way and not as a vast bureaucracy which does not benefit anyone.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para23"></a>We also need to be sure that we do not get the "big brother" effect. When I was an area housing chairman I remember a decision was taken to build garages in a certain area. I went to visit the people concerned and I was told by the residents, "We love our gardens and we do not want garages. We have not got cars". But the GLC said, "We have decided you have got to have garages and we are going to build them." I said that I was not prepared to support that and that we must delay it. The GLC said that it was not possible to rescind a decision that had been made. I thought that I would not rescind it, but defer it. The people should be allowed to live out their lives with their gardens and when people live there who want garages then they can be built. That was a typical situation. If a person bought their house and changed the front door, as the officers of the GLC drove past they would remark how deplorable it was that someone should have a different front door. Fortunately, I believe that all that kind of thing has now gone with the demise of the GLC, but we want to be very sure that it does not come back again.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para24"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Archer, referred to 1,200 replies. That is quite a large number to have been studied in detail in just five days between the closing date for the responses and the date on which this Bill was published. I cannot believe that in those five days every one of those consultations was carefully considered.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para25"></a>I am not really in favour of a mayor for London because I do not like the word "mayor". I am for someone in that position of authority, but I would like to see him or her called "governor" or something different. The noble Lord, Lord Levene, may be distressed to discover that the title of Lord Mayor of London either gradually vanishes or becomes unimportant because the new London mayor has taken over that role. London has over 30 mayors and two Lord Mayors now. Their roles are all threatened by the title "Mayor for London". I believe that we should be looking for different names such as "governor" so that this conflict does not exist. I do not want a local authority to feel threatened, as can be the case now.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para26"></a>I was also disturbed by the statement of the noble Baroness,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We have very clear views". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para27"></a>She went on to say that those views would be put to the public. At the moment certainly the public have no knowledge of what those views are. Many suggestions were put forward in the Green Paper, but no conclusions. I am not sure whether the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, was supporting the measure because she sounded slightly ambivalent. I do not believe that the National Health Service should be involved with London government. It is good to have a partnership between health and the social services and the different authorities, but I do not believe that the health service should suffer the interference of a mayor for London or a strategic authority for London. I am in fact concerned <P>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 425</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>about the new proposals as regards the National Health Service. I think of the parallel situation with the Bank of England. The Government are pushing all responsibility onto the GPs so that when things go wrong they can be blamed in the same way as the Government can blame the Bank of England if it gets something wrong.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-09_para28"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Archer, said that no one is standing for the authority and I do not suggest that I am. But I look around the Chamber and see many people who were members of the Greater London Council. I would not rule out standing myself. Indeed, seeing the noble Lord, Lord Mishcon, I recall his history as chief whip on the LCC. There is a need for representation of the older population of London.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-10_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mishcon: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for being so courteous. I am really incapable of being a Whip in any sense of that word. But I did have the honour of being chairman of the London County Council.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-10_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for that correction. I arrived only when that body became the GLC and the noble Lord was there in the days of the LCC. The noble Lord, Lord Archer, said that he followed Sir William Fiske and he said very nice things about that. I shall not comment further other than to say that I followed the noble Lord, Lord Archer.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para0"></a>In particular, there is a need for the older people of London to be represented because there is a large ageing population. Their needs are not sufficiently recognised and valued. It is very important that we do not get just a pop figure as leader who looks on the position as a ladder to move up into a higher political position, or someone who is more concerned with presentation than substance. It will need to be someone who is hardworking.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para1"></a>When I had the privilege of going to Beijing as an escort to one of the Lords Mayors, the people there could not understand how we could be representing one thirty-third part of London. They found it incomprehensible. Although they did not "twin", they had a special relationship with Paris, Bonn and other European capitals. They could not understand that there was no one in London with whom they could have the same special relationship. That clearly brought home to me the need for a voice for London, as did the fact that London's Olympic bid did not succeed because there was no one to pull it together. That was another example of how important it is to have such an authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para2"></a>Therefore, I support the setting up of such an authority, but I do not support the proposals as drafted. I was worried when the Minister said that by the time the White Paper is published people will know the information that is now hidden. By the time the White Paper is out, the Bill will have passed through all its stages and the question, as set out in the Bill as drafted, will have been clearly and unalterably determined. It will be on the face of the Bill. Therefore, I cannot see how the White Paper can help to create two questions. The only time to change one question into two questions <P>


<a name="column_426"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 426</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is now, while the Bill is still in amendable form. I support a change to two questions and I echo the arguments of those who have made that point.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-10_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Carnarvon: </B>   My Lords, I speak primarily as chairman of the All-Party London Group, but I have some comments of my own to make. I am grateful to the Minister for her kind remarks about the group's work.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para3"></a>Your Lordships may recall that in 1996 the London Group published a paper entitled  The question of a strategic authority for London, which I hope that many of your Lordships found useful in the debate on the matter which I initiated on 16th February this year. In the introduction to that paper, we put forward the proposition that there should be an authority responsible for dealing with those issues which affect London as a whole and that the authority should be directly elected by, and be accountable to, the citizens of London. That was not a recommendation by the London Group--indeed, not all members of the group would support it--but we felt that it was a proposition which required debate both in this House and beyond. Our paper suggested that the people of London should be given a say in the form of authority to be adopted. The limited extent to which the referendum will do that is to be welcomed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para4"></a>The London Group reviewed various possibilities for the form of the authority and recognised that some might be combined. The group did not envisage the particular combination which the Government have adopted. In considering the recent Green Paper, New Leadership for London, we noted at the outset that the Government had in effect determined that the form of the Greater London authority would be a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly. Not all members of the group accepted that determination as final, but in responding to the Green Paper, the group did not seek to challenge it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para5"></a>However, the London Group noted, and commented on, the novelty of the form of authority proposed in the Green Paper and in this Bill. The concept of an authority with two distinct and separate arms--the executive (the mayor) and the scrutinising and deliberative body (the assembly)--is totally unfamiliar in British local government. In our response to the Green Paper, we sought to impress upon the Minister--I have no reason whatever to suppose that Ministers will be unreceptive--that considerable efforts will need to be made to ensure that the arrangement is fully understood by the people of London; by the other agencies (including the borough councils) with which the authority will have to work; and not least by those elected to office within the Greater London authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para6"></a>Clause 7 envisages the Local Government Commission for England reporting to the Secretary of State on the constituencies for the election of members of the assembly. The London Group recognised the great importance of this issue, but was unable to reach agreement on it. There were two distinct views within the group--each strongly held. One view was that there must be a clear link between electors and their <P>


<a name="column_427"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 427</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>representatives, and that that could be effectively provided only by making each London borough a constituency. The opposing view, which was equally strongly held, was that if members of the assembly were each elected from a single borough, they would inevitably tend to think in terms of the interests of the borough, whereas if the assembly was to be capable of taking a London-wide view, as its duties will require, its members should be elected from large multi-seat constituencies. However, we were able to agree on one point: if it is eventually decided that the assembly should be based on boroughs as constituencies, it must be made clear that it is the duty of each assembly member to represent the views of the residents of the borough, not necessarily those of the borough council.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para7"></a>I should like to make two general points. First, if the public are to give an informed response to the simple question posed in the referendum, they must be given beforehand a clear idea of the powers, duties, organisation and funding of the new authority. I imagine that such matters will finally be settled in the legislation which will follow an affirmative response to the referendum, but the London Group has already made many points about such matters both in its original paper and in its response to the Green Paper. I understand that the Government are now preparing a White Paper. We heard today from the Minister that it will be published in March. I strongly emphasise the importance of giving the electorate full and clear information about the nature and functions of the authority on the creation of which they are being invited to vote.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para8"></a>My second point relates to my first. The London Group shared what I believe to be a general desire that if there is to be a Greater London authority it should be a lean body, rather than a large one. It follows that the authority should not be charged with responsibility for organisations and activities which, however worthy and important, are not essential to its strategic role. The London Group recognises the tendency of all powerful bodies, once established, to seek an extension of their powers in their areas of operation. At the same time, the group recognises the difficulty of determining at the outset precisely what functions should be assigned to an authority with such a unique character and role. That suggests that there should be some provision with suitable safeguards for extending--or, indeed, restricting--the role of the authority in the light of experience of its operation.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para9"></a>Strategic planning is one of the most important functions which the Greater London authority will undertake. In the past, planning has been a major source of conflict between the tiers of government in London, as was said by the noble Lord, Lord Bowness. It is absolutely vital that the role of the authority should be clearly and precisely defined so that there is no confusion. The authority must have the powers required to ensure that its strategic planning policies are implemented. Those powers may need to include the power to deal with planning applications of major strategic importance. The public, including developers, must know where responsibility lies. The right of a developer to appeal to the Secretary of State against an <P>


<a name="column_428"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 428</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>adverse decision must also be preserved. I hope that the Minister will reply to those particular points, which I believe are very important in the new authority's strategic planning role.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para10"></a>Transport is no less important. It is right that it should come under the aegis of the Greater London authority. I have strong views as to the name of the body that is to be responsible for transport. I hope that it will not be called the London transport authority. I believe that that would create confusion by implying that it was wholly separate from the Greater London authority as it would be in effect a committee of the Greater London authority, with added members drawn from other sources. Perhaps it would be better described as the London transport agency.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para11"></a>Finally, with regard to the election of the mayor, I hope that serious consideration will be given to allowing each candidate the free circulation of one electoral message to the constituency of 5 million people and, quite importantly, to require that, once elected, the mayor should hold no other elected or appointed office. I greatly look forward to reading the White Paper in March.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_time1"></A><H5>5.31 p.m. </st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Dahrendorf: </B>   My Lords, I rise to support the Government's Bill without any ifs and buts. I do so at an appropriate distance from my noble friends on the Front Bench, although I hope in the same friendly spirit of debate and openness of mind to argument.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para12"></a>The Bill marks a vital staging post in a highly desirable process that may give London the kind of government that it needs. Just over seven years ago, on 6th December 1990, I was asked by London Weekend Television to give the London Lecture on the subject "Does London need to be governed?". Incidentally, I was asked by a producer, Mr. Trevor Phillips, whose name is now on the list of those who may stand as candidates for mayor. I very much hope that he will stand. At the time my conclusion appeared to many to be Utopian. I said that, on reflection, it appeared to me that London needed a mayor. What is more, the mayor should be directly elected by the people of London. I went on to argue for a mayor who had the independence and legitimacy to speak for the whole city and its people--a political figure who, once elected, was not primarily a party figure. In that sense all analogies with national government are misleading.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para13"></a>It is also an open question whether the government of London should be described as regional. Of course, the size and importance of this great capital city make its leadership more than just local government. Clearly, its voice will be heard along with those of Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and in due course perhaps other regions of England. Yet there is a unity to London which is not present in the regions. Large cities suffer if they are treated like regions. That is the weakness of Berlin, a Land within the Federal German Republic, with all the institutions of a parliamentary democracy; and it is the strength of Munich, the capital city of Bavaria, which is roughly the same size and is run by a directly elected mayor with a separately elected city council.
<P>


<a name="column_429"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 429</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para14"></a>It seems to me that continental examples are more relevant to the issue of London than American ones. It is worth mentioning that in Germany the mayoral system has spread from the south to the north, where it has replaced the British system introduced by the occupation authorities. In Italy elected mayors have recently and successfully been introduced. I for one would not be at all surprised if the London example were soon adopted by other cities, large and small, in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para15"></a>Since my London Lecture in 1990 I have been exposed to many arguments on the subject. The most direct involvement was with the Fresh Start for London Group, set up Sir Alan Greengross, with the all-party group invented and chaired so admirably by the noble Earl, Lord Carnarvon; and also the efforts of the Liberal Democrats to produce a blueprint "Home Rule for London". Respectable cases have been made for divergent views but they have not persuaded me that my original view was wrong. Indeed, I felt delighted and exhilarated when the Government took up the proposal after 1st May which produced the Bill now before us. If throughout the debates I have changed my mind at all it is in one rather sad respect only. I am now--and certainly shall be by the time of the first mayoral election--beyond the age of ambition. A few years ago I should have loved to declare my interest in joining the campaign for mayor as a candidate. To take our great metropolis forward, if only a few steps, and give it the sense of civic pride that it deserves is a task worth every effort.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para16"></a>When we last discussed London government in your Lordships' House in February of this year in a debate initiated by the noble Earl, Lord Carnarvon, I gave six reasons for a directly elected mayor: a face as well as a voice; a position that cut across parties; a focus upon particular issues; a visible representative who was exposed and approachable; someone who could properly and legitimately do what the best Lord Mayors had tried to do; and an increase in local pride and civic sense. There is no need to go over the ground again, except perhaps for one point that I want to stress to my noble friends and others.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para17"></a>Accountability is crucial, but it is more than a technical requirement. There can be no true accountability without visibility, and to local government it is sadly not sufficiently visible. A directly elected mayor will be. He or she will be exposed to public scrutiny every day. I see the need for accountability as a case in favour of the proposal.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para18"></a>Several major issues remain to be resolved, and no doubt we shall discuss them here in detail. It would, for example, be regrettable if in the interests of false homogeneity we lost the very important role that the Lord Mayor of the City of London had played in the past and must continue to play. Like many of your Lordships, I was particularly pleased by the maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Levene, which made that point so forcefully.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para19"></a>It is important to make sure that the electoral system ensures a popular majority for the mayor, either by a second ballot, which is my preference, or by the <P>


<a name="column_430"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 430</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>alternative vote. However, the most important issues will arise around the question of the relationship between a directly elected mayor and a separately elected assembly. Ways need to be found to ensure that the two are encouraged to co-operate rather than set against each other. The first question is not how the assembly will be able to depose the mayor, but rather how a workable set of rules to stimulate initiative and control can be devised.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para20"></a>That latter issue--who takes the initiative; who exercises control--is relevant to the question at hand today: the referendum on a Greater London authority. In the schedule to the Bill the Government have suggested a form of words which comprises the entire proposal; that is, the elected mayor as well as the separately elected assembly. Many noble Lords, and others outside the House, have stated clearly that in their view the question should be split, and even that one or two other questions, including one relating to tax varying powers, should be added. I do not have strong views on the substance of such demands. If the Government wish to accede to them, so be it. There is the wider question of what referenda--do we absolutely have to call them referendums?--are about.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para21"></a>I remember the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, arguing, when the Scottish referendum legislation came before your Lordships' House, that we might well first need a Bill relating to the purpose and conduct of referenda. That seemed, and still seems to me, to make sense, although we are in the process of developing case law on this matter. My view is that referenda should not be exploratory and open-ended. They should test the views of the people about government proposals. The first duty is therefore that of government to make such proposals and to argue for them. It is for that reason that I find the single question, as it stands, acceptable.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para22"></a>If the people of London do not like the Government's proposals--for two separately elected components of the Greater London authority--the Government will have to think again. If, as I hope, the people do like the present proposals, we shall no doubt have lively discussions about the substantive Bill when it comes before your Lordships' House.

<A NAME="71215-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Naseby: </B>   My Lords, it was my privilege to represent a constituency in middle England for 23 years, but I started my political career in the London Borough of Islington. I am probably one of the few Conservatives to have been leader of that borough. The Bill, as the Minister said, is about the referendum only, although in response to an intervention from my noble friend Lord Bowness she said that the White Paper would be published towards the end of March.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para23"></a>As I understand it, if the timetable is to be met that leaves some six-and-a-half weeks before the proposed election. The White Paper, by definition, is not definitive. It is the Government's firm ideas, although by tradition White Papers can and do change. So around the Easter Recess we shall have at most a few weeks in which to take on board the answers to the many <P>


<a name="column_431"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 431</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>questions so rightly raised by the Government in their Green Paper. I wonder whether noble Lords feel that it is sufficient an answer from the Government Front Bench to say that replies to the Opposition's queries will be contained in the White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para24"></a>I was worried when the Minister said that the lessons of the GLC, and the problems that it created, had been learnt. It is not evident--I have read the Green Paper several times--that those lessons have been put into print. They may have been learnt, but so far they remain a secret on the Government Benches. The rest of us have to guess whether they have been learnt.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para25"></a>The one reassuring element is the feeling I have of a general welcome for the role of mayor. There has been press comment of a similar nature. No one, so far as I know, has come out against the concept. What is less clear is whether the role of mayor is to be that of just one person or whether, as one or two speakers have said, it is to follow the example of the Continent or the US. One could have an independent candidate of substantial ability but with no political backing who might wish to put forward a slate in terms of having perhaps two deputies--one with a knowledge of the eastern half of London and the other with knowledge of the western half of London. Such a concept should not be ruled out.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para26"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Levene, said, special care needs to be taken over the relationship between the Lord Mayor of London and a future mayor of London. I have spoken about slates and potential running partners. I wonder whether, as political parties, we should think about running primaries. If we are in for constitutional change, perhaps we should look at how we produce our candidates for mayor.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para27"></a>Much play is rightly made in the Green Paper of what should be the form of the constituency. The City Corporation might well feel that, as its wards originated in Saxon times, that would be a pretty good basis from which to move forward. When I was leader at Islington I would not have felt my views on the strategic problems facing London coloured by the fact that I represented a particular borough. I am not one who is worried about the little-borough nature of the leaders. That is not a problem.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para28"></a>Mention of the City brings me to the point that none of us should forget that the City Corporation is a success. The concept is that it is a city run for business by business. It is a success story. It is something that we all greatly value. It is a world leader in financial and business services.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para29"></a>Of course, there are some elements which those of us who come from a more democratic background question. I find no favour in the aldermanic veto, and an alderman being elected for life is also somewhat questionable. The plea I make is that we should listen to the corporation and let it find its solution to the problems that it has perceived.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para30"></a>In my few weeks in this House I have learnt that your Lordships have a particular ability to speak succinctly. Therefore, I conclude by referring to democratic safeguards. Does the Minister believe that the new body, particularly the mayor and the assembly, will come <P>


<a name="column_432"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 432</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>under the control of the Audit Commission and therefore the somewhat questioned role of the district auditor? Will it come under the control of the Comptroller and Auditor General and his control of Whitehall? Or will it come under some new Nolan-plus control body? If she is unable to answer tonight will she ensure that that point is covered in the White Paper?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para31"></a>Democratic control and visual accounting for what has happened are vital today. If we get it right from the start the role of those who serve the public will be enhanced. If we get it wrong, those same people, whether they be right or wrong, will be hounded beyond belief. Members of this Chamber and of the other place have a responsibility to take the issue very seriously.

<A NAME="71215-10_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to follow a leader of a London borough, as I was 35 years ago. It is petrifying to think that it was so long ago. I remember the noble Lord, Lord Archer, visiting the Enfield Grammar School, deputising for his good friend Christopher Chataway at the prize giving. I follow the noble Lord, Lord Naseby, with a great deal of humility. The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, represented Southgate, which is part of my old stomping ground.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para32"></a>We are talking about London and Londoners. Many people such as I came to London to work, and found our niche in local government. We are proud to call ourselves Londoners and we try to speak on behalf of the people of London. However, I cannot honestly say that the people of Edmonton talk of little other than the future of the GLC or whether there should be a directly elected authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para33"></a>There is a danger of self-aggrandisement as regards people such as I who have a claim to leadership. We shall not know the views of Londoners until we give them an opportunity to express them. I warmly welcome the Bill and endorse what the Minister says as regards its raison d'etre. However, politically we believe that we should give the people of London an opportunity to express a view. Whether we like what they say remains to be seen.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para34"></a>We examine the issue against the background of what has happened to London government. When I became the leader of Enfield council the London County Council was in existence. The Conservative Party's great idea was that, having failed to control the LCC, it would change the council's boundaries and turn it into the Greater London Council. It believed that the old concept of the LCC, over which it could never win power, would be changed in its favour by adding to it. It added small parts of Surrey, Essex and Hertfordshire. Surprise, surprise: at the first election in 1964 the Conservative Party was hammered and beaten. Politicians do not always get it right.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para35"></a>In a difficult political and economic climate, the GLC tried to do what it was designed to do. At the end of the day, the people of London were not given the choice of whether they wanted the GLC or not; other people took the decision for them. Therefore, with a great deal of <P>


<a name="column_433"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 433</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>humility, we must measure the strength of what is offered in the Bill against what the people of London were denied during the past 35 years of my experience.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para36"></a>If one wishes to see the meaning of the abolition of the GLC one has only to walk on to the Terrace and look across at County Hall. When I have visitors who ask, "Tell me, Ted, what is that old building?", I reply, "It used to be the centre of London government". They ask, "What's happened to it now?". I say, "It's been sold. The London Residuary Body sold it". They ask, "Who did they sell it to?", and without making any point I say, "To the Japanese". They tell me that the same thing has happened somewhere else. I believe that it is to the shame of the Conservative administration that they kept silent about the net effect of what they did in abolishing the GLC.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para37"></a>The GLC was no more heavily criticised than by the London Borough of Enfield and other Labour authorities. They were standing up and attempting to do something which they believed had to be done. The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, made two telling comments. She spoke of the absence of a focus and of a visible, coherent body to represent Londoners as regards Olympic bids and so forth. Despite the efforts that have been made by various bodies to try to do what the GLC did, they have failed in expressing the views of Londoners.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para38"></a>I am not sure whether the election of an assembly and a mayor will prove to be right. But, as was said by the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, the people of London will decide when they vote and the Government must pick up the pieces. I have been impressed by the number of questions which the Minister has been asked tonight. I am prepared to extend her time to one hour and 40 minutes, but she still will not have answered all the questions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para39"></a>We have heard a good trailer for the many problems which will emerge after the election and after flesh has been put on the bones of the proposal. We may never get it right, but the Government are to be congratulated on bringing forward innovative measures into local government. I am not frightened of doing something for the first time. The proposal might not be the best way and it might not be successful, but the Government are attempting to say, "We don't want the LCC nor the GLC. We want to give London a body and a mayor which we believe will be the answer". That might not be the answer, but unless we make progress with the Bill we shall never get the answer.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para40"></a>I like the way in which the Bill seeks to define the functions of a government for London. I refer to land-use planning, environmental protection, transport, culture and leisure, economic development and regeneration, police and fire services and so forth. Those are all core services. Tourism, which is not specified, can best be managed across the whole city. I like the idea that is contained in that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para41"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, is quite right to say that there are 32 mayors and separate entities which are all very proud and fierce. When I was leader of Enfield, before it became the London Borough of Enfield, there were very proud boroughs called <P>


<a name="column_434"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 434</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Southgate, Edmonton and Enfield. It was not the wish of any of the three that they should marry. Edmonton and Enfield would have liked to have become part of Tottenham, along the Lea Valley, and Southgate would have liked to become part of Wood Green. Lord Joseph was the man in charge of local government at that time and Henry Brooke was at the Home Office. They made the decisions. The people of Edmonton still long to look after themselves. But we must move on and we must take account of the fact that those actions will be taken only by collaboration.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para42"></a>I liked very much what the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, said as regards what we are looking for in a mayor of London--a face, a focus, a voice, visibility, exposure, approachability, local pride and a civic sense of purpose. We must bear in mind the importance of making sure that we do not lose things which are worth preserving. However, having a mayor can be a powerful incentive. London has lost out a great many times because it is seen as a disparate unit. Whether or not the man is a politician or whether he has special qualities remains to be seen.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para43"></a>In a debate such as this, we must bear in mind what kind of London we are talking about. London is economically rich but it has many social problems. We are talking about a London which contributes 17 per cent. of the UK's GDP; where there is access to 9 million employees; where London's financial sector contributes &#163;6 billion--75 per cent.--to the financial services sector; which brings in &#163;7.7 billion in tourism. But in that same London, throughout the area, there are serious social problems; for example, 45 per cent. of the ethnic minority population lives in London. That means that only 55 per cent. lives in the rest of the country. Moreover, 25 per cent. of the inner-London workforce is ethnic, but 40 per cent. are unemployed. In London there is more unemployment than in Scotland or in Wales and one in five young people is targeted in the welfare-to-work scheme. In London, one in three black men are out of work, and the manufacturing sector has dropped from 650,000 to 328,000 in the past 10 years.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para44"></a>Some of my colleagues from the London Borough of Enfield, on both sides of the Chamber, are struggling and sweating to try to solve some of those problems. I hope that in time--not too far ahead--we shall have a group of people, men and women of all political parties, who will see it as their responsibility to deal with some of the problems that I have just outlined. It is far too easy for London boroughs to say to themselves, "We have too much on our plates to bother about London transport or tourism or the economy of London". We need a fresh look. I believe that the Minister and her colleagues are striving to give the people of London an opportunity to say whether or not they like that possibility.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para45"></a>Reference has been made to the Corporation of London. It has done and is doing a grand job. Yesterday, I was in Epping Forest. I went to visit a place which has had a great deal of money spent on it. It is the Queen Elizabeth Hunting Lodge in Chingford. I do not knock anybody who has done anything to try to serve the interests of the people of London. I hope that people will not believe that the provisions of the Bill are designed to <P>


<a name="column_435"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>supersede or take the place of anybody who is doing good. I believe that if we have the authority and the mayor which we are promised, the prospects for the people of London are better for the future than they have been in the recent past. Therefore, I warmly welcome this opportunity provided by the Government to give the people of London leadership, life and pride.

<P>
<A NAME="71215-10_spnew6"></A><B> Viscount Chelmsford: </B>   My Lords, this Bill invites Londoners to vote on whether they want to have an elected mayor and a separately elected assembly. But it makes no attempt to set out what powers either would possess; nor does it say who would give up the powers which the GLA would take.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para46"></a>A key point in the proposal must be the power balance in the relationship between mayor and assembly. The Bill does not specify that. The Minister says that by the time of the referendum there will be answers to those concerns since the White Paper will be published by then. But that does not cover the point that the referendum is on the Bill, not on the Bill plus the White Paper. Since there is nothing specified in that Bill, there is nothing to prevent government changing their mind post-referendum. If the Government wish to campaign on the policy of the White Paper, there should be some linkage in the Bill to that White Paper so that responsibilities and powers are identified.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para47"></a>London certainly needs its own voice. Everyone has said so, and I agree. Currently it does not have that single voice. On the other hand, the Corporation of London has a very successful single voice--the Lord Mayor, who is the voice of the Square Mile. His job has become increasingly important as a marketing tool for the City of London. Many of us believe that the same formula could be applied to the needs of Greater London--the London that lives within the M.25.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para48"></a>The infrastructure behind the City's Lord Mayor is modest. Behind the Government's proposal is a new tier which looks remarkably like a third layer of government sitting in between national and local government. The Bill proposes a referendum to decide between whether to establish a mayor and an assembly or not to have anything. Like others, and like my noble friend Lord Bowness in particular, I suggest that there is a case for having separate votes in relation to a mayor and an assembly. Many of us would vote for a mayor, particularly if he were seen as the marketing arm for London, but not necessarily for an assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para49"></a>The Government's consultation paper, New Leadership for London, suggests that the mayor sets the strategic direction and the assembly examines and approves that. It adds that changes could be proposed. Therefore, it must be presumed that the Government see the mayor's strategy as possibly being rejected. What happens then? Despite the executive nature of the mayor and the wide range of his responsibilities, which have just been referred to--land use, planning, regeneration, transport and so on--the Government say in their consultation paper that they do not envisage a large number of staff. I ask the Minister what numbers are envisaged and what large or not large means.
<P>


<a name="column_436"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 436</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para50"></a>It is noticeable that those new devolved powers are by no means absolute. If central government disagree a strategy they can block it. Therefore the question arises as to whether government will block a GLA strategy which has formed a platform on which the mayor was elected.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para51"></a>Recently I have heard many points made about the importance of London to the rest of the United Kingdom and how the fortunes of London have a knock-on effect in respect of other parts of the UK. When London does well, it is suggested that it adds value to the UK in general. But when it comes to funding, the consultation paper suggests that there will be no extra money and that if more money is needed, it must be found out of savings. I should have thought that the money could be switched to some extent from the regions to London to reflect London's influence on regional ability to grow.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para52"></a>London is a major driver of the United Kingdom's wealth. The campaign for a better infrastructure for London, particularly in transport, started in the City, which is concerned that London stays an attractive place for the international company and for global trade. Can it truly be said that three layers of government fingers in London's pie will achieve more than two? Are we quite sure that the views and powers of mayor versus assembly will not end up in contradiction, cancelling each other out and thus adding to London's burdens rather than adding value?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para53"></a>I turn briefly to transport, improvement in its communications being London's greatest need. I am supportive of a London transport authority inasmuch as the management of road traffic using modern technology is already emerging in an infrastructure which divides between urban management and inter-urban management. Clearly the interface between these management teams will be important. Where London is concerned, with its territorial definition which covers everything within the M.25, care will be needed in the interface where motorways--managed by the Highways Agency--penetrate inside the M.25.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para54"></a>The Government's consultation paper talks about national, regional and local roads. Yet the management control teams currently being set up split only between urban and inter-urban or regional teams. Effectively control does not have a national presence, yet the Highways Agency is national and is based on a different concept of infrastructure. It seems to me that there is still a lot of thought needed about how the future of our road system will be driven forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para55"></a>In conclusion, the real reason in my view that London needs a mayor is to intercede with central Government on London's behalf. I submit that it is not local government which stops London from implementing a grand strategy. I think that it has always been central Government and that it probably always will be. I do not see how another layer of local government can possibly address the real problem.

<A NAME="71215-10_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Ludford: </B>   My Lords, this Bill is specifically about the form and conduct of the referendum by which Londoners will have a say in their <P>


<a name="column_437"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 437</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>own future. However, as others have found, it is impossible to discuss the Bill without also discussing the merits of the substantive proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para56"></a>Indeed the Liberal Democrats are suggesting, like the Conservatives and indeed many in the Labour Party, that Londoners should have some choice in the matter and not just be presented with a "like it or lump it" question. That makes some discussion of the options necessary. We appreciated the welcome given by the noble Lord, Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare, for many Liberal Democrat points made by my noble friend Lady Hamwee. I hope that in return we are not required to endorse his candidacy!
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para57"></a>The Minister mentioned that traditionally there has been a lack of interest in constitutional change. I am glad to say that that is not reflected in this debate today. We are usually told that it is only the Liberal Democrats who are interested in such a subject. The Liberal Democrats believe that the Government's proposals are a mixture of the timid and the risky. They are timid in that it is strange that the Government do not have the confidence in their own proposals to allow Londoners to be able to choose between essentially a parliamentary and a presidential model for their own regional government. I thought that the Minister was remarkably defensive in her justification for refusing two questions in the referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para58"></a>The proposals are also timid in that they essentially--this comes over time and time again when government spokespeople mention the proposals--talk about London government as local government. Most of us on these Benches see it as regional government. London is a region as well as a city; it is a city region. That is why we propose more extensive powers and functions such as strategic responsibility for health functions, but not the delivery of the health service--that is clear. We also want London government to have tax varying powers, which need not mean an increase in taxation; it is a question of where the tax is raised.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para59"></a>Government proposals also risk a concentration of power, even the danger of corruption, with a directly elected mayor who is not sufficiently scrutinised. There is a difference here in that we are talking about regional government having an extensive degree of power devolved down from central Government. The more power that we want a London authority to have, the less happy we are to see those powers concentrated in the hands of a single individual. I respect very much the views of my noble friend Lord Dahrendorf on the question of a directly elected mayor. However, I need hardly remind him that he is in a rather small minority in the Liberal Democrats. That is why we want a debate. We are open enough to show that we have differences of view in the Liberal Democrats. That is not the case in the Labour Party, where people are not allowed to voice different views.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para60"></a>We have already heard today of the dangers of a personality contest arising in the election of a directly elected mayor. That is perhaps why the mayors of almost all European capital cities are elected by their assemblies and are not directly elected. I take the point made by my noble friend when she spoke of Munich. <P>


<a name="column_438"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 438</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>However, there is a difference between a city the size of Munich and a city region of 7 million people, as in the case of London.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para61"></a>As others have said, if the Greater London authority does not have powers devolved down from central Government, the problems will be recreated of the GLC interfering in the affairs of the boroughs. The Government risk that by being timid with the powers and through the lack of financial powers that they are willing to give Londoners to run their own affairs. I was interested to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, talk about the licensing powers of the GLC, of which I confess I was not aware. I would hate to see a Greater London authority tempted to interfere in the affairs of my local street market in Islington, Chapel Market, although perhaps it could not make a worse job of it than the council.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para62"></a>The Government talk of the directly elected mayor as a champion, a voice and as someone to speak up for London. That is a valid role but it is a limited one. What we are talking about is better government--that is, accountable and responsive government--for this diverse, cosmopolitan capital city region. Perhaps that is summed up in the different titles we have used for our papers. The Government's paper is entitled New Leadership for London and the Liberal Democrat's response is entitled Home Rule for London. We think that the best way to obtain better government for London is through the traditional parliamentary model developed over a thousand years, and not through the alien import of a US-style presidential model. I think that voters can grasp the essence of the difference. They are quite intelligent enough to be able to make that choice. They can see, for instance, what happens in the United States between president and Congress. If a parliamentary style of government in which the leader--who for London may or may not be called a mayor; I take the point about the risk of confusion there--answers to his or her colleagues, and through them to the voters, is good enough for the UK, for Scotland, for Wales and for local government, why is it not an option that Londoners should be able to choose?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para63"></a>I am afraid I do not agree that to be visible someone has to be directly elected. I do not think that there is any problem with the visibility of Prime Minister Blair. I do not agree either that just because there are problems in local government and in some of our town halls, we should blame the structure of the traditional parliamentary model. One could equally blame the culture of the Labour Party which runs many town halls, or the lack of a fair voting system. I do not think it is fair to say that we need to shake off the reputation of local government in order to go for what is essentially a gimmick of a directly elected mayor.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para64"></a>But if the Government are so convinced of the virtues of their preferred structure, what have they to fear from a two-question referendum? They rightly can point to progress they have made since May in bringing forward proposals for a more open, democratic British constitution. I applaud that. How strange it would be, therefore, if this reputation for openness was marred by a rather stubborn and high-handed refusal to let the <P>


<a name="column_439"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 439</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people decide how they wish to be governed. The Government are in danger of creating a democratic deficit by imposing a "top down" solution.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para65"></a>The Minister gave several reasons why only a one-question referendum was appropriate, why Londoners should only be able to endorse the proposal, not choose an alternative one. She said that it would only be practical to ask one question; she thought that two questions would be confusing. That was not true in Scotland, and it need not be true in London. Londoners are perfectly capable of intelligent choice.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para66"></a>The Minister also said that the case for two questions misunderstands what the Government are proposing. We have heard rather too often recently that those who oppose the Government's proposals have "misunderstood" them. It is not a matter of lack of clarity; it is opposition to the substance which needs to be tested. The Government are in danger of attracting the charge that they are covering up a lack of confidence in the people's support for this novel and alien system.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para67"></a>It would be extremely dangerous if a form of government was imposed which was unstable. After the history of the past 11 years, the last thing we want is a system that does not endure. We want a secure and stable system with broad support.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para68"></a>I am glad that the Conservatives have seen the light and now support giving the citizens of London the right to choose. They abolished the GLC, after ignoring overwhelming opposition to its abolition. I am glad, however, that they have changed their minds on consultation and democracy. After that history, London government would have been a party political football, and it should not be so. It needs to be constructed on a sound basis.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para69"></a>We are happy to discuss the precise form of the two questions. It is not difficult. The noble Lord, Lord Archer, had a point when he said that there are already two questions wrapped up in one in the existing phrasing. Liberal Democrats will accept the outcome. We have some suggestions as to how the mayor and the assembly under the Government's proposals can have co-operation and how the assembly can control the mayor. We are not being ostrich-like; we are not saying that we will not engage in a debate. We have put forward specific proposals for the relationship between the mayor and the assembly. We are prepared to engage in debate, and we invite the Government to do so as well.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para70"></a>In the view of most of us, the arguments for a directly elected mayor are weak. However, that is not the main point today. The issue is that the arguments for a one-question referendum are weak indeed. We know that many Labour as well as Conservative politicians want two questions. It would be fair and democratic to allow the people of London that chance.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para71"></a>Dick Whittington would not only turn again on Highgate Hill; he would turn in his grave to see Londoners denied a voice. We ask the Government: please trust Londoners and make provision for a <P>

<P>
<A NAME="71215-10_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, the Bill seeks to authorise a referendum on the establishment of a Greater London authority and a separately elected mayor. Some of your Lordships may recall the words of a song--which, I hasten to say, I do not propose to sing to you this evening:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Love and marriage,
<P>
<BR>
Go together like a horse and carriage.
<P>
<BR>
You can't have one without the other". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para72"></a>At least, according to the Government you cannot: you have to take a mayor and an elected assembly--both, not just a mayor or just an assembly--or you get nothing.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para73"></a>The fact is that different groups want different things. Government Members in the other place apparently want whatever their pagers tell them they want. The Liberal Democratic Party wants an elected authority, but not a mayor. The group of Labour-controlled borough councils are reported to be emphatically against a separately elected assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para74"></a>In a paper published on the Internet as recently as 24th November, the Greater London Labour Party reported that its conference rejected the idea of a mayor. How exactly the author of the paper knew that is not clear, as she complained that the conference was not allowed to take any votes, only "soundings". Even the conclusions of the "workshops" held at the conference were disallowed. So much for democracy!
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para75"></a>The views of the Conservative Party are clear. They support the creation of a mayor. They oppose the creation of another layer of local government--making the mayor more remote from the citizens of London. They oppose the expense that it would involve. But, above all, they oppose the elected assembly, for the same reason as we assume the Government's supporters in the London borough councils oppose it. It will remove important features of government from the local councils into a more distant authority with no local connections or knowledge. It will create a body which may, according to one of the Government's proposals, have fewer members than there are boroughs. That would ensure that no member will be able to represent one borough, but may have to reconcile the conflicting interests of two of them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para76"></a>Indeed, the Minister gave the game away in his speech at Second Reading in the other place, when he complained that if the assembly were to be made up of the borough leaders they would:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"quite understandably use his or her influence to seek advantage for his or her borough".--[Official Report, Commons, 10/11/97; col. 591.] </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para77"></a>What a terrible idea!--the very thought of an assembly populated by persons who would be advancing the interests of their constituents, or as Labour would put it, "the people", and not necessarily following the party line.
<P>


<a name="column_441"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 441</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para78"></a>The fact is, the Government want a separately elected assembly for one reason. They want to remove from the local councils as many of their powers as they can and to put them in the hands of a remoter body answering to no individual constituents. They are trying to create what I can only describe as "un-subsidiarity". They are doing so despite the claim in the fine print of their manifesto that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Subsidiarity is as sound a principle in Britain as it is in Europe." </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para79"></a>The Minister made much of the manifesto commitment to give a new deal to London; that is, with a strategic authority and a mayor. As my noble friend Lord Bowness commented, in the other place it was described as not being an opportunity to pick and mix. But elsewhere in the manifesto the Labour Party stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Local decision making should be less constrained by central government and also more accountable to local people". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para80"></a>How can that fine-sounding objective be achieved by creating another, even remoter layer of government?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para81"></a>Whether they intend it or not, they are creating a situation of potential conflict between the boroughs and the assembly. Indeed, they go further than that. They support the creation of a London development agency, and it seems likely that the Government Office for London will also be retained. Perhaps the Minister, in replying, will tell me if I am wrong on this matter. If I am not, then we shall have no fewer than four bodies competing with each other, or having to spend time and money consulting with each other or duplicating each other's work.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para82"></a>Why are we even having to discuss the pros and cons of an elected assembly in this debate--the topic of which is simply the referendum? It is because, as with the Scottish and Welsh referenda, the electorate are being asked to sign a blank cheque. There are some 61 unanswered questions in the Green Paper about the future government of London. The Government will undoubtedly feel themselves free to deal with those problems in whatever way they choose to interpret the consultation results. But in the interests of open government, will the Government publish the result of the consultation, tabulating the number and nature of the replies that they receive to each of those 61 questions?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para83"></a>I return to the central question. Since the Government have offered Londoners a referendum, why cannot both questions be separate? The same question has been repeatedly asked in the other place and, indeed, during our debate today, but so far we are without an answer that we find acceptable. I hope that in her reply the Minister will give the House a more plausible explanation than that the manifesto simply referred to a complete package. Why cannot Londoners have just one or other, if that is what they want? Why cannot the assembly consist of the democratically elected leaders of their respective local--and I stress the word "local"--councillors? The fact is that the Government are afraid of the answer they will get. The answer to the question of an assembly, if asked separately, would probably be a resounding "no".
<P>


<a name="column_442"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 442</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para84"></a>I shall not take up your Lordships' time by repeating at length the many objections we have heard here today and in the other place about the proposed separate assembly. How will it be elected? What will it cost? What will its powers be? Will it be able to raise taxes?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para85"></a>The Government have failed to explain why 32 or perhaps fewer assemblymen beholden to their party of whatever political hue for their position, are better placed to decide the strategic needs of the capital or to hold the mayor to account than 32 democratically elected borough leaders, each with an intimate expert knowledge of the problems and interests of the residents of a major part of the city. In other words, why are the Government afraid to allow two questions rather than, in the tradition of the Labour Party conference, the composite they seek to impose?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para86"></a>On the question of an assembly, Labour's manifesto is ambiguous and contradictory. Apart from the contradiction about subsidiarity to which I have already referred, point 9 of their so-called contract promised to decentralise political power. An assembly for London will do exactly the opposite of that. Indeed, the Green Paper itself identifies no fewer than 15 diminutions of the powers of the boroughs. For that reason, as my noble friend Lord Bowness said, we shall reserve the right to reintroduce the amendment splitting the question into two.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para87"></a>There can be no reason why a party which claims to be wedded to democracy should not allow the people to decide on the two entirely separate issues to be posed in the referendum. As my honourable friend said in the other place on 10th November, at col. 669 of the Official Report,

<A NAME="71215-10_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, it has been a fascinating debate and one that illustrates that the issues we are discussing are not as simple or straightforward as is put forward by those who suggest that we should take one question and turn it into two.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para88"></a>I shall return to that in a moment. First, perhaps I may congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Levene, on an excellent maiden speech, one founded on knowledge and experience. I am sure that it made us all wish to hear more from him in the future.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para89"></a>Perhaps at this point I may say that we very much take the points he made about the Corporation and the role of the Lord Mayor of the City in relation to the mayor and assembly. I think we share his optimism that the two could work well together, not diminishing each other's roles but complementing them in speaking together for the capital. We believe that that is the way forward. It will be necessary to have clarity in the relationship, as the noble Lord outlined.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-10_para90"></a>The desire for clarity was a theme of the debate. The noble Earl, Lord Carnarvon, suggested that we needed clarity in terms of the functions, powers, responsibilities and division of responsibilities. That point was made too from the Opposition Front Benches, although not always <P>


<a name="column_443"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 443</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with unanimity as to what the clarity should bring. I have to say that there are views that nothing should be done to diminish the power of the boroughs. That point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Bowness. The noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, also said that the new authority should not encroach on the power of the boroughs. However, she should not just look behind her for opposition within the Liberal Democrat Party: she should consider what the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said with her plea for education, for example. The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, picked up the point in relation to health and asked for it to be something with which the new strategic authority would deal.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-11_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. My reference to education was to higher education which at the moment is a matter for the TECs and so on. I referred to higher education. On education there is no difference between my noble friend and myself.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-11_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness. However, we need to explore a wealth of detail in terms of the functions and powers of the authority. That exploration is taking place at the moment. My noble friend Lord Graham of Edmonton kindly offered me one hour and 40 minutes in which to sum up and to make all clear. If I had two hours and 40 minutes, I should not be able to do that. I would be pre-empting the consultation which is not something I wish to do.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para0"></a>The number of responses to the consultation was disparaged slightly by the noble Lord, Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare. I have to say to him that the reason I was looking at my papers when querying the 700 individual responses that I received from organisations was that I was seeking the precise number of Londoners represented by the organisations. I had a quarrel with those who were briefing me who said that it was hundreds of thousands when one added up the membership of the organisations in the responses. I kept to a cautious tens of thousands in what I said in reply.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para1"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, asked whether the White Paper would report on the outcome of the consultation exercise. Certainly. At the moment all the responses are in the library of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. I know that they are being examined and that we shall be happy to make them explicit in the White Paper.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para2"></a>There will not be unanimity, however, and that means a need for leadership and decision-making on exactly what the Government propose. It was fascinating in the debate today that the noble Baroness on the Liberal Democrat Benches argued passionately that we were not talking about city government but regional government in London. There is a semantic issue here. I noticed the noble Earl, Lord Carnarvon, shaking his head at the time because he has responsibility for regional planning in the south east, which is a different region from the one suggested for London. The noble Lord, Lord Bowness, <P>


<a name="column_444"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 444</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>said it had nothing to do with regions and that abolishing the GLC was just reorganising local government. He did not know why everyone became so excited about it.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. If she wishes to challenge me, I must remind her that it was in the context of how the abolition had been described. She knows that it was described as the removal of democracy in London and far worse. In fact, will she agree that it was no more of a reorganisation than the imposition of the GLC was a reorganisation which also took away many people's powers?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-11_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Graham of Edmonton: </B>   By the same party!
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-11_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, by the same party. The changeover from the LCC to the GLC was slightly different, I suggest, in form and nature from the abolition of the GLC and any strategic authority for London.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para3"></a>There have been a number of themes running through the debate. One is about the principle of the referendum and the principle of the pre-legislative referendum. It is well established and, as the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, said, we are establishing case law on it. We have already had two such referenda--and I shall follow his nomenclature--since 1st May. What we suggest is putting the detail of what we propose to the people of London to seek their consent before we introduce legislation in this House. As the Government have repeatedly made clear during the debate on the Bill--but I shall say it again for the benefit of those who query it--we shall put a detailed and comprehensive set of proposals to the people of London in a White Paper which will be published ahead of the referendum.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, rightly said that this Bill would be passed before the White Paper is published. That is absolutely right. On the issue of whether there should be one question or two and the nature of that question, that is not out for consultation; that is a definite decision that the Government have made. I shall come to that in a moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para5"></a>As to the detail of the many issues that have rightly been raised--I am sure they will be raised again--the responses to the 61 questions in the consultation document will be clear. When the referendum is put to the people of London they will know about the division of powers that is being suggested; they will know about voting systems, an issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee; and they will know about how we envisage the assembly and the mayor interacting in order to provide strategic leadership for the people of London.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para6"></a>What is more, we will ensure that a neutral, factual summary of those proposals is put through the letterbox of every household in London. There will be copies on the Internet so the noble Baroness can scan it to see whether anything else can possibly be of embarrassment. We will translate the summary into eight languages as well as having versions in braille, in <P>


<a name="column_445"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 445</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>large type and on audio cassette. Everybody will have the opportunity to find out about the structure, functions, budgets and electoral systems of the authority.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para7"></a>Given all that, I do not seriously believe that a Bill, no doubt with many clauses because it will be a complicated piece of legislation written in the language of the parliamentary draftsman, will be any more accessible than a comprehensive and clearly considered White Paper.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-11_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hamwee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. Can she answer the question that the White Paper will represent the Government's proposals but will not have been tested by the scrutiny procedures of both Houses of Parliament? That was a point made very forcefully from a number of corners.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-11_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, that was a point that was made. It was made also in relation to Scotland and Wales. The opposite course was adopted in proposals for devolution for Scotland and Wales in the past. I am not sure that the clarity that proceeded from the alternative of a post-legislative referendum is one that I would urge. The Government were clear in the proposals that they put into their manifesto that they were seeking consent prior to implementing that legislation on proposals to which they were committed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para8"></a>Perhaps I can say a few words about the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, and the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, in relation to the authority being some sort of "proto-GLC". They were concerned that we will be transferring borough powers to the authority. We take the point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Carnarvon, that the authority should be a lean, strategic authority. It should not be an enormous, burgeoning authority. It should not take powers and functions away from other bodies where they are rightly focused. But it should tackle exactly those issues that are best tackled at a city-wide level.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para9"></a>Most people now accept--I am grateful to see the change on the Front Bench opposite since the last time we debated this matter in your Lordships' House--that there is a role for city-wide government in London. There may be an argument as to how the assembly will be constituted and how the mayor should be elected. But the fact that a vacuum exists and that London could benefit in the future through having strategic leadership is one that is now agreed upon.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para10"></a>We are carefully considering the responses to the consultation, many of which address the responsibilities. But the guiding principle made clear in the Green Paper is that the boroughs will retain the vast majority of their functions and responsibility for providing services and that the GLA will set the strategic direction for London--the strategic direction which at the moment it lacks.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para11"></a>Another theme of the debate was the arrangements for the referendum itself. The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, raised the question of voting hours and suggested that they should be extended, as did the noble Lord, Lord Archer. That issue was fully debated in another place. We do not believe that extending the <P>


<a name="column_446"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 446</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>hours for the poll from those conventional for a local government election would be in the interests of an efficiently conducted, combined poll. Complex polls, such as London borough elections, with multi-member constituencies, will take a long time to count. Boroughs will not thank us for the extra delay and expense caused by an extension of hours. It will be almost impossible to administer combined polls where one poll closed before the others.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para12"></a>It is important to maximise the number of people who know about the referendum and who are able to participate in it. Those who are unable to attend the polling stations to vote will be able to apply for an absent vote. We will make sure that the facility is well advertised in the pre-referendum publicity campaign so that anyone who is eligible to vote should be able to do so.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para13"></a>Inevitably, much has been said about the wording of the question proposed in the Bill. Many noble Lords expressed a preference for a two-question referendum which, on the surface, is an attractive proposition. It seems to give more choice. I can understand how those coming new to the debate are attracted to that proposition. However, as I explained in my opening speech, the arguments in favour of it are fatally flawed. Perhaps I can take noble Lords through the logic of our position.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para14"></a>We made a commitment in our manifesto to establish a Greater London authority made up of an elected mayor and a separately elected assembly. We also undertook to subject our proposals to a referendum to establish the consent of the people of London to what it was we were proposing. We have always made clear that that was the purpose of the referendum provided for in the Bill. It was not meant to be an opinion poll of Londoners, although every opinion poll carried out shows overwhelming support among the public for what we are proposing.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para15"></a>If multiple options were on offer, it would not be possible to provide the clarity, leadership and direction that we are seeking. The mayor and the assembly represent a package of government; they cannot be separated. A mayor without an assembly or an assembly without a mayor would be very different forms of government for London. Necessarily, they would have different powers and different responsibilities. How could that be represented in a single White Paper or, indeed, a clear factual summary? The need for clear, factual advice for voters has been made absolutely clear. It could not. It would be full to the brim of qualifications and exceptions. People would be confused by what was on offer or the information that they had would be so limited that it would be difficult to make an informed choice. I suggest that it is naive to suggest that it would be otherwise.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para16"></a>Even if it were possible to construct some sort of credible White Paper along the lines I outlined, there are other reasons why two questions seriously do not work. I do not believe that anyone tonight suggested that a mayor on his own, unchecked by any form of assembly, would be a desirable outcome for London. Without an assembly to scrutinise the mayor, to hold him or her to <P>


<a name="column_447"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 447</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>account, the danger of unchecked incompetence or even corruption would always be present. Yet the two-question formulation would put that proposition to the people of London. That would be the height of irresponsibility. It is no good saying that such questions could be aired during a campaign on a two-question referendum with the people being left to decide for themselves. The fact is that no responsible government would put a proposition to the people of London which they believed to be unworkable and that could not be implemented. The people of London would rightly ask, "If you knew it was not going to be implemented, why did you offer it to us as a choice in the first place?"
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para17"></a>A two-question referendum is not justifiable on democratic grounds. As the Minister for London explained during debate in the other place, the questions look simple enough, but in fact they risk real confusion. They would force Londoners to guess what their vote would actually achieve. Some could vote not knowing whether they would end up with a mayor and assembly, a mayor without an assembly, or an assembly without a mayor. How they vote could well depend on these permutations. They might vote "yes" to both questions because they favour both the mayor and the assembly as a package, only to find out when the results are counted that the voters have said "no" to a mayor and "yes" to an assembly. But an assembly on its own might have been their least favoured option. Had they known that this would be the actual outcome, they might have voted "no" to that question. These questions would force voters to second guess the outcome of the poll.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para18"></a>Of course, all of this assumes that the proponents of more than one question can decide what the second question should be. When the noble Baroness, Lady Ludford, said that she had some specific proposals, I thought she would give two questions that would give clear and definitive answers. But they were specific proposals about the relationship between the mayor and the assembly.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para19"></a>The proponents cannot actually say what the two questions would be because there are at least five permutations on the subject of the mayor and the assembly alone if we are to give people real choice--and that is the criticism that has been put to the Government today. There is the choice of the mayor plus the assembly, both separately elected--the Government's view. There is the choice of a mayor alone; there is an assembly alone; there is a mayor plus a council of borough leaders; and there is a mayor selected from the assembly itself. Those are five separate choices that would have to be made before we started to talk about the issue of voting systems. Indeed, some might want to say that they wanted neither an assembly nor a mayor--a sixth option.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para20"></a>How can these differing options be reflected in two questions? They cannot be. There simply is not a magic second question. If we ask all the questions, or offer some kind of multiple choice, we would not get a clear answer or a usable mandate.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para21"></a>The Government are not dogmatic about the question they wish to put to the people of London. If a better one is proposed, they are willing to listen. But they do <P>


<a name="column_448"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 448</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>believe that the case for two questions has not been made and actually cannot be made. It is a mirage. Any referendum question, when what we are doing is seeking the consent of the people of London to the proposition that the Government believe right for London, must be clear and straightforward. Complex, multiple choice questions which run the risk of giving answers that the Government would not be willing to implement are not the way for a responsible government to go forward.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para22"></a>I was brought up with one definition of "chutzpah". That was the definition of the man who killed his parents and asked the judge for leniency on the basis that he was an orphan. There is another definition of "chutzpah". It is being lectured by the party opposite about not giving enough information on what would replace what we have at the moment and not consulting in enough detail and with enough clarity the people of London as to what form of government they would like when the GLC was abolished without so much as a "by your leave" or a nod to the people of London. I accept that the position of the Liberal Democrats is different on this issue, but I do not think we should take any lectures from the main Opposition party on this matter.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-11_para23"></a>It has been a valuable debate. The Bill marks a step forward in giving Londoners back some responsibility.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME="71215-12_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Bowness: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for giving way. I do not want to delay the House. Now that she has left her long explanation as to why we cannot have two questions, perhaps I may follow with a question. If the Government put a proposition to the people--a mayor and an assembly--and they were to put it in two questions, and if one of the propositions was to be rejected, as it is a consultation and as we are seeking the consent of the people, the Government would have to think again about what they proposed to do with regard to the element that has been rejected. What advice would the noble Baroness give to a voter who is convinced by her arguments for a mayor and is convinced by the arguments in the White Paper about the arrangement for a mayor, but, having seen--I use her words--the wealth of detail, is not convinced by the case for a new directly elected assembly? Should that voter vote "yes" or "no" to one question?
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-12_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hayman: </B>   My Lords, that voter has to make up his own mind as to whether he wants one enough to accept the other with it or whether he is prepared to give up one because it comes with the other. That is the horse and carriage of the noble Baroness, Lady Miller. We believe the two are part of a package. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Bowness, is confusing the consultation which is going on following the Green Paper and which will be formulated into the White Paper with the consent that we are seeking for the Government's proposals.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para0"></a>There is much work yet to be done. There will be a White Paper in March, followed by a referendum in May. If, as I confidently expect, the people of London answer our question with a resounding "yes", we can look forward to debate on the substantive Bill in little more than a year's time.

<A NAME = "71215-12_para1"></a>It has been a fascinating debate. We did not have great certainty about candidates from your Lordships' House. As I understood the noble Lord, Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare, he did not say "yes" and he did not say "no", but he checked with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nolan, just in case. The noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, ruled himself out. That was rather sad, particularly given what the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, said about the elderly voters in London having a constituency and needing a voice. Perhaps he might care to reconsider his decision.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para2"></a>The people of London have waited 11 years for the return of a form of government to the capital. During those 11 years there has been a gap. Something has been seriously missing. Perhaps the worst gap has been the missed opportunities for London. We believe that with this Bill we will help put that situation right and that the people of London will not have to wait much longer for the leadership they deserve.

<A NAME = "71215-12_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, perhaps these regulations will prove to be slightly less contentious than the issues we have debated earlier this evening.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para6"></a>The regulations make technical amendments to the non-domestic rating transition scheme that phases in the effects of the 1995 revaluation of non-domestic properties. The amendments are entirely consequential to the introduction, on 1st April next year, of the rate relief scheme for village shops and post offices.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para7"></a>Under the village shop rate relief scheme qualifying village general stores and/or post offices will be entitled to a 50 per cent. reduction in their rates bill. To qualify, they must be located in a rural settlement with a population of fewer than 3,000; be the sole general store or post office; and have a rateable value of less than &#163;5,000. Local authorities will also have discretionary powers to reduce or waive the remainder of the rates bill. Without these regulations, village shops which are having their bills phased in under the transitional arrangements would not benefit from village shop rate relief. That would be manifestly unfair and I therefore commend the regulations to the House. I beg to move.

<A NAME="71215-12_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, I welcome this order and the benefit that it will bring to young people who have the misfortune to be in care or to be looked after by a local authority. It is certainly in line with the kinds of amendments that I failed to move successfully in the Children (Scotland) Act. In that case I was trying to bring forward the local authority's priorities to people who are up to 21 and 25 years of age. I set that in the context that the average age of leaving home is still 22 years of age. So this new measure, which I certainly welcome, is not quite as generous as I would have liked it to be.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para12"></a>I am pleased that it covers all young people who have recently been in care or looked after and particularly that it includes those under Section 44(1)(a)--that is certainly how I remember the regulation--as regards domestic supervision requirements. These are vulnerable people and their exclusion to date has been unhelpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para13"></a>I believe that the children's panel's habit of ending supervision requirements before the school leaving age will probably change because it will see the benefit of extending the supervision requirement until just after the person has left school. It would be expedient if that happened. Similarly, I believe that it would be useful to extend this provision to young offenders, but I accept that that is not in the order at the moment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para14"></a>"Expedient" is definitely the right word. By that I mean it is correct, but not necessarily just. Active offenders who are both homeless and unemployed cause more misery to other people than their non-offender counterparts. That is regrettable but true. It is clearly a matter for another day and the next order. Ultimately, I hope that all young people will end up in the priority category, but again that is for another day. I continue to <P>

It is a matter of balance as regards how one extends the degree of priority. All the statistics indicate quite strongly that those being looked after by local authorities are particularly at risk of homelessness. It is singularly appropriate that we recognise that and extend the support of the priority category to those individuals. I commend the order to the House.

As I said, the Government made a manifesto commitment to put the environment at the heart of their policy-making. Fundamental to this pledge must be a duty to ensure that the air in the United Kingdom is fit to breathe. Fortunately we have moved on from the days in the 1950s which I can remember, when smog episodes caused an estimated 4,000 deaths of sick and mainly elderly people in just a few days. So we have made considerable progress already from that dreadful position. Nevertheless, some recent statistical analyses suggest that, even at the substantially lower levels of airborne pollution that we experience today, there are associations with premature mortality, chronic illness and discomfort for sensitive groups.

Part IV of the Act has two principal components. First, there is the requirement for a national air quality strategy, containing air quality standards and objectives and measures to meet those objectives. That was published in March this year. The strategy contains air quality objectives for eight pollutants. These objectives determine the Government's air quality policy. Furthermore, the air pollution enforcement agencies must have regard to the strategy and its objectives in the performance of their functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para19"></a>The second component of the Act is the system of local air quality management. Under Sections 82 to 86 of the Act each local authority has a duty to review air quality in its area and to assess the air quality against the air quality standards and objectives laid in regulation. Where it judges that those standards or objectives are not being achieved or are not likely to be achieved, it must designate the area as an air quality management area; and, secondly, it must, in consultation with all relevant and interested bodies, draw up an action plan in pursuit of those standards or objectives.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para20"></a>These regulations need, therefore, to be in place before local authorities can perform their review and assessment of air quality in their area. Once in place, we will be able to commence Sections 82 to 86 of the Act, and the last vital element of the framework for air quality policy will be in place.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para21"></a>This new system of review and assessment will give us a nationwide survey covering every local authority in Britain. Not only will we have a comprehensive picture of air quality, but we will be able to target action to clean up the pollution hotspots in our towns and cities.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para22"></a>The Government are aware that local air quality management will mean new responsibilities for local authorities. When we commence the duties under the Act, detailed guidance will be issued to help local authorities undertake their new tasks.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para23"></a>We are also providing additional resources to help local authorities to purchase the capital equipment for monitoring and analysis that they need. This in addition to the provision which has already been made for current expenditure in the local government settlements.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para24"></a>But we do not expect local authorities to take unreasonable or disproportionate action in pursuit of the objectives. This is why, for example, these regulations do not include the National Air Quality Strategy's objective for ozone. Ozone is a long-range, transboundary pollutant whose source can be 1,000 or more kilometres away. No single local authority--nor even a group of authorities--can be expected to control ozone levels in an area. The UK is therefore involved in the development of strategies for ozone within the European Union and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.

<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para25"></a>That brings me to the second set of draft regulations we have before us today, the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) (Fixed Penalty) Regulations. These have been drafted to enable local authorities in Great Britain to undertake roadside testing of vehicles and, where vehicles fail to meet prescribed emission standards, to impose a fixed penalty on the driver of the vehicle.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para26"></a>As noble Lords will no doubt be aware, we already have well established legislation which is designed to ensure that vehicles using our roads are not only safe, but also do not cause unnecessary and avoidable pollution. It is, for example, already an offence to use a motor vehicle if its exhaust emissions do not meet certain specified standards.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para27"></a>Many noble Lords will be familiar with the fact that exhaust emissions are now comprehensively tested as part of the annual MoT test. Vehicles which fail this part of the test are deemed to have failed their MoT. In addition, the Vehicle Inspectorate has powers to undertake roadside testing of emissions and, where a failure to comply is detected, that vehicle cannot be used further. Moreover, the driver is liable to prosecution.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para28"></a>However, in spite of the very stringent standards which have been introduced, there are still many vehicles using our roads which do not meet the current emission standards. For example, in 1996-97, almost 8 per cent. of petrol-engined vehicles failed the MoT test due to excessive emissions. However, the problem is not confined only to cars and light vehicles since nearly 3 per cent. of heavy goods vehicles and buses failed the annual roadworthiness test because of excessive smoke emissions. Similar levels of non-compliance can be found with those vehicles which have been subjected to roadside testing by the Vehicle Inspectorate.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para29"></a>Clearly, we have a serious problem and the Government are committed to taking the steps which are necessary to reduce avoidable emissions. This means that we must continue in our efforts to make motorists and operators of vehicles aware of the problems and nuisance caused by unnecessary emissions and to ensure that engines are maintained in a suitable condition. However, this may not on its own be sufficient and we need to ensure there are sanctions which can be applied against irresponsible motorists who fail to maintain and keep their vehicles in a proper condition.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para30"></a>Under the Road Traffic (Vehicle Emissions) (Fixed Penalty) Regulations 1997--several brackets there!--which we are considering today, local authorities will, in collaboration with the police, be able to stop vehicles and test at the kerbside whether the exhaust emissions comply with the prescribed standards. Where a vehicle fails to comply with the standards, the driver will be served with a &#163;60 fixed penalty notice, rising to &#163;90 if the recipient fails to pay the notice within 28 days. Drivers would, of course, be able to challenge the notice and take the matter to court in the same way as existing arrangements for fixed penalty notices issued by the police for a road traffic offence. In addition, there are similar provisions to discourage drivers running their engines while parked at the roadside.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para31"></a>During our consultation on the draft regulations, some concerns were expressed that since local authorities would be able to retain the income generated by the fixed penalties, this would lead to "over-enthusiastic" application by the authorities since they would see it as an opportunity to raise revenue. However, it is not the Government's intention that local authorities should be seen as profiting out of these regulations. We will issue guidance on the application of the regulations and this is an issue which will be properly addressed. The authorities will, for example, be obliged to apply a degree of discretion when deciding when to issue a fixed penalty notice and to ensure that money raised through the system will be reinvested back into enforcement. In effect, the regulations are designed to be self-financing, not as a money-making scheme for local authorities.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para32"></a>Nevertheless, we recognise this is an innovative way of regulating vehicle emissions and, because of this, it is our intention to limit initially the powers to just seven local authorities. I am sure that some noble Lords may be thinking, "Why is it that the Government are so confident about their proposals yet they are not being applied across the country straightaway?". I hope I can put noble Lords' minds at rest on this point.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para33"></a>It is our desired intention that in due course these powers will be available to all local authorities but, first, we wish to monitor closely the effectiveness of the scheme. Limiting the powers to just seven local authorities will make it easier to undertake this assessment. We recognise how difficult it is to forecast precisely what benefits the new scheme will bring but, above all, we believe that, given the scope of the problem, local authorities could have a significant role to play in detecting polluting vehicles and encouraging the drivers of these vehicles to comply with the law.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-12_para34"></a>In conclusion, I remind the House of the Government's commitment to achieving the highest possible safeguards to protect local air quality and, more generally, the global environment. This requires a policy where air quality is assessed and action taken to meet clear, precise objectives. These objectives are set out in the draft Air Quality Regulations. The vehicle emissions regulations are one of the tools by which local authorities can meet these objectives. I commend both sets of regulations to the House.
<P>

<A NAME="71215-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that there is much between the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, and myself on these two sets of regulations. However, I wish that government spokesmen would not lace every speech with the suggestion that before 1st May nothing was done on any particular subject whereas after 1st May everything has been marvellous. I do not think that that is the case. Indeed, perhaps I should point out that the Act under which the regulations are being brought forward is the 1995 Act. That suggests that the previous government had laid the foundations. Indeed, under many other parts of that Act we had already taken steps to bring the various regulations into effect. This is <P>


<a name="column_455"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 455</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>but another of those steps. With that small chastisement to the noble Lord, Lord Sewel, perhaps I may underline the fact that we warmly welcome the steps that are now being taken.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para0"></a>I turn first to the Air Quality Regulations and the air quality areas. I was a little puzzled, but I am now fairly clear, about what the relevant period will entail and what an authority will have to do if it finds that the air quality in a designated area is way below par. It must then bring forward a scheme in order to put that right.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para1"></a>Sometimes local authorities seem far too quick to think that if they somehow make the traffic flow more slowly, that will help the situation. I suspect that the contrary is the case. If traffic is forced to move slowly, perhaps because a bus lane or chicanes have been installed, and traffic must slow down and change gear the position can become worse, not better. There must be some clear-sighted thinking when it comes to traffic management as against air pollution.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para2"></a>It is in relation to the second regulation before us that I say a few more words, perhaps in part because I notice that the City of Glasgow, where I live, is one of the seven areas where this experiment is being carried out. I make no complaint about that. Indeed, I hope that the police will look carefully at vans, which I believe to be one of the main culprits when it comes to vehicles belching out smoke. Sometimes one wonders how the vehicles pass the MOT. Perhaps they have not, and that is the point. It may be that the authorities should look at the various devices that people use to get vehicles through the MOT which would not otherwise get through it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para3"></a>I have no problem about the roadside tests. Clearly, there will be a prima facie reason for the vehicle being stopped: it will be belching forth fumes. That is fairly easy to see. If the police test the vehicle and find that it contravenes the regulations, a fixed penalty will be imposed. Perhaps I missed the point, but I listened in vain to hear what happened after that. The person pays the fixed penalty. If he does not pay that penalty there are arrangements under the regulations to ensure that he does. But what does the person do when he drives off to ensure that the next time the vehicle is on the road it is roadworthy and no longer belching out offending fumes? It is one thing to say that the driver will be told that he cannot use the vehicle until he sorts out the problem. That is fine. He goes off. But how will his obedience be enforced? Perhaps in summing up the Minister can explain the follow-up that the authorities have at their disposal to ensure that a vehicle that has been stopped and failed the test, with the driver being fined, is not used again and again and again but that the problem will be resolved.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para4"></a>The Minister said that one of the reasons why the Government wanted to use seven local authority areas as the first tranche was to monitor how the system worked. I welcome that. One lesson we have all learned is that sometimes the best ideas do not work out well in practice. Therefore, I believe that monitoring and pilot schemes are a particularly useful way to advance any policy, whether it be in this field or in social security, where a lot of pilot schemes have been initiated.
<P>


<a name="column_456"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 456</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para5"></a>But if pilot schemes are to provide an answer--not so much the answer that is desired but the correct answer--it is important to work out how one is to judge their success. Are the Government to earmark seven similar areas where the regulations will not come into effect and use them as a control group? I see the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh of Haringey, on the Front Bench opposite. He very much agreed with me about the need for control groups on another issue that we discussed. Perhaps the Minister can say a few words about control groups. Are the Government to set up a parallel group of seven cities--I believe that all of them are cities--where without these regulations some kind of check can be made on vehicles emitting unnecessarily large amounts of pollutants?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para6"></a>I do not want it to be thought for a moment that I am grudging of these regulations, but I shall be interested to hear the answers to these questions from the Minister. With those few words, I welcome the regulations.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Beaumont of Whitley: </B>   My Lords, I too welcome these regulations. I too am old enough to remember when London was beset by killing smog. It has now achieved a much healthier position. Indeed, three nights ago on the way back from the theatre my wife remarked to me that she found the London air invigorating. That does not mean that there is no room for improvement. Nevertheless, a great deal of improvement has already been made.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para7"></a>I read the debate on these orders in the 8th Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation in another place, as no doubt have all of your Lordships who are interested in this matter. I do not have a great many questions. Most of my queries were answered then. However, I should like to confirm that these regulations will not put local government to any long-term expense which will not be recompensed. That is my first query.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para8"></a>My second query, which I am not sure was answered in another place, is that the Minister said that authorities would be obliged to observe a degree of discretion. I am not entirely certain how they can be obliged to observe a degree of discretion. How does one do it? How does one judge whether one is observing a degree of discretion in the right way? That is a question to which we should have an answer.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para9"></a>Apart from that, my only complaint, as was mentioned in another place, is that a good deal of the second order, particularly the schedule, is in jargon that is almost incomprehensible. One Member of the other place drew attention to the fact that paragraph 4(1) of the schedule stated:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A running annual mean is a mean which is calculated on an hourly basis, yielding one running annual mean per hour". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para10"></a>I find that fairly difficult to follow. I find the following sentence even more difficult to follow:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The running annual mean for a particular substance at a particular location for a particular hour is the mean of the hourly levels for that substance at that location for that hour and the preceding 8759 hours". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para11"></a>I imagine that 8,759 hours--I have not made the calculation--equal a year, thus producing the annual mean. It would be helpful if these matters were written <P>


<a name="column_457"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 457</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in a more comprehensible manner. The Minister in another place in the Committee could reply only the following:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The hon. Gentleman must recognise [the purpose of the definition] rather than trying to understand it as English words. It is a statistical definition". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para12"></a>Ordinary human beings who have to put this into practice must understand it as English words. It may be a statistical definition as well, but I do not believe that to be a serious defence. I hope that an attempt is made to put these matters into more acceptable English.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para13"></a>With those two queries, we on these Benches fully support these regulations and hope they will be extended to the whole country.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Mishcon: </B>   My Lords, I believe that the House recognises the Automobile Association as a very responsible body. I have been asked--I believe I am not alone in this--to make certain representations in regard to the second set of regulations before the House tonight. The Minister is well aware of certain concerns that that organisation has. I believe that they have been expressed especially to the Department of the Environment over the past two years. First, it has made it abundantly clear to me that it supports any regulation that limits, if not stops completely, the pollution of our air. Where that is caused by motorists it supports any sanctions that may be imposed. But the three questions that the AA has raised with me, and which I respectfully raise with the Minister, are the following.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para14"></a>First, my noble friend the Minister mentioned the words "irresponsible motorist". We would all want to punish the irresponsible motorist. But what about the motorist who is stopped, having carried out, almost to the letter, all the things he is supposed to carry out? The manufacturer passes his vehicle on to the retailer, he purchases it from the retailer, and, lo and behold, through no fault of his, there is an emission which is due to be punished under these regulations. Is he to be punished in the same way, with the penalty of &#163;60, which if he does not pay up promptly becomes &#163;90, as the irresponsible motorist, or is that something upon which the seven local authorities which have been chosen will be lectured upon by my noble friend as to the exercise of their commonsense discretion?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para15"></a>The second point raised by the AA is much more weighty. It was spoken to by the representative of the Opposition--I talk happily about representation, because I realise that we are all speaking amidst a crowded House. The second point which arises is: are we here by these regulations trying to collect a great many penalties which go to the local authorities so that they may pay for enforcement, or are we trying to see that someone who is polluting the atmosphere, through these emissions from his vehicle does not do it any more or that he has it immediately corrected? Here, the regulations omit any sanction. He pays his penalty--presumably a fine. He pays his &#163;60. He drives off and again, quoting my noble friend and his word "irresponsible", the irresponsible motorist under these regulations can go spiriting abroad to other authorities which are not subject to this test, and the regulations fall short.
<P>


<a name="column_458"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 458</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para16"></a>Surely there should be a procedure under which the motorist who offends is handed a little notice, a notice similar to the one that one receives--I must confess that I have received one--to produce one's licence and certificate of insurance at a police station, presumably within the area of the test that we are applying within the seven local authorities. What is to stop a notice being served which says, "You must, within a reasonable period, produce to a police station a verification by someone licensed to do the test of which we are all aware, saying that the fault has been put right"? Surely there is a gap here.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-13_para17"></a>The third matter upon which the AA feels strongly is that money is being collected to cover the cost of enforcement by local authorities. But what about the money which is supposed to pay for this monitoring, as my noble friend called it? Monitoring can be of use in helping Parliament to decide eventually whether this requirement should be imposed upon the whole country. Parliament will want to have facts. Will there be a thorough analysis of the seven authorities which are undertaking this test period? Are they to prepare statistics showing the reaction of motorists, what should transpire and whether pollution within those areas has been reduced as a result of the regulations? Are analysts to be called in to deal with this matter? If so, will we be left with local authorities which will say that the moneys which they have collected just about cover enforcement and that there is nothing left over to do thorough monitoring, or will the Government make good that shortfall?<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<A NAME="71215-14_spnew0"></A><B> Viscount Simon: </B>   My Lords, I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, has said that he is confused by some of the definitions in the Air Quality Regulations. I am not a philologist, a mathematician or even a statistician. They are double Dutch to me. So I am delighted that he brought the subject up.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para0"></a>In respect of the Air Quality Regulations, one of the things that I am sorry to see is that particulates are being measured to PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub>  whereas they should perhaps be measured down to PM <sub>2</sub> &#189;, which would be better for health. In that respect your Lordships might be aware of the smokey vehicle hotline to which one can report commercial vehicles with badly smoking exhausts. It does a commendable job.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para1"></a>I am tempted to say that the regulations in respect of road traffic vehicle emissions represent a step forward in our efforts to reduce pollution and force polluting vehicles off the road, but the regulations could be described as fine-taking rather than enforcement. I make no apology for repeating some of the things that my noble friend Lord Mishcon mentioned because I, too, have had words with the AA.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para2"></a>As the regulations stand, no discretion is allowed the responsible driver who can show that a vehicle failing an emission test has been properly maintained. So at the moment the irresponsible driver of a polluting vehicle pays the same penalty. Further, there will be no requirement in law for offending motorists to take the vehicle off the road or get the fault fixed. The responsible driver will effect repairs. The irresponsible one will continue to pollute the atmosphere.
<P>


<a name="column_459"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 459</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para3"></a>Perhaps my noble friend the Minister would consider a system of vehicle rectification at a later stage, as applies in other cases of vehicle defects, which would give the motorist, say, 14 days in which to present a new MOT certificate to the local authority and pay a reduced fine. After that period, a punitive fine could be enforced. That method would ensure that motorists would effect suitable repairs and adjustments and at the same time that the local authority would cover its costs. If it is possible to do something along those lines, I hope that consideration will be given to it. Perhaps my noble friend will assure the House that the pilot scheme will, in addition to the methods he has already mentioned, be monitored in respect of cost-effectiveness, public and police reaction, police resources and the age and type of offending vehicles.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-14_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sewel: </B>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have contributed in the most constructive way to our consideration of the regulations. I should perhaps point out that the regulations do not of themselves create any new offence. They are basically to do with a more robust enforcement regime. In that sense, the powers contained within the regulations complement existing powers.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para4"></a>I think that I draw from the contributions the fact that there may be four basic areas of concern: first, remediation and enforcement; secondly, the nature of the pilot study; thirdly, what I will call the innocent victim; and, fourthly, the position of local authorities and the support that they are receiving. I shall deal with the points in a different order. We have already made provision in the revenue settlement for local authorities to ensure that they have the revenue contribution to deal with the problem. We are making specific contributions on the capital side for the necessary equipment. Local authorities should be able to carry this through.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para5"></a>With the innocent victim, we get down to the degree of discretion. I am afraid that I am old-fashioned and pragmatic in that I fall back on ideas of common sense. Local authorities have a degree of discretion. If the vehicle has been properly serviced in line with the manufacturer's instructions and regularly--and I wish that all manufacturers would insist upon emissions being part of the servicing regime--I believe that an individual has nothing to fear.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para6"></a>In any event, there are clear warning signs that something is going wrong with emissions. I refer to poor reliability, difficulty in starting and high fuel consumption, to say nothing of the fundamental point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish, about there being a great deal of smoke. The warning signs exist and people should respond appropriately.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para7"></a>As regards enforcement, there is a fine but no remediation is required. I believe that most motorists who find themselves in this position are responsible motorists. Once they become aware that they fall into the category of making unlawful emissions they will seek remedial treatment. If they do not they will run the real risk of being stopped again, when action will be taken.
<P>


<a name="column_460"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 460</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para8"></a>As regards commercial vehicles--I refer to heavy goods vehicles and those in the PSV category--the vehicle inspectorate can take action up to and including taking the vehicle off the road. A real sanction is therefore available. I am slightly tempted by the idea of my noble friend Lord Mishcon that a little bit of paper should be issued to them and we may wish to reflect on that later.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para9"></a>That is one issue which may arise as a result of the pilot study. Indeed, we are carrying out the pilot study in order to have the opportunity of reflecting and considering all the ways in which to proceed. The pilot study will produce important data on non-compliance and how difficult a problem it is. That should be welcomed. It will also provide us with data on the extent to which the fixed penalty route is the appropriate way forward by identifying the rate at which people pay the penalty. It will also provide invaluable data on the extent to which people are exceeding the emissions limit. Therefore, we will have a good quantifiable set of data on vehicle emissions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para10"></a>When I examined the issue I was attracted by the arguments that we have heard tonight; carrying out a test to ascertain the improvement which such an approach would bring about on local air quality. However, having discussed the matter at a technical level, I am aware of the difficulty of isolating out among a number of complex variables the single variable of vehicle emissions and the contribution which they alone in a complex set of variables make to local air quality. I am afraid that at the moment that is beyond our scope.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para11"></a>We are proposing these regulations in the spirit of moving forward in improving air quality. I hope that the House will believe that through the pilot studies we have chosen a way forward which will enable our proposals to be tested and important data to be collected. If the pilot studies prove that to be the case we can move forward with confidence. I commend the regulations to the House.

<A NAME = "71215-14_para14"></a>In July 1995, EU member states signed a draft convention based on Article K3 of the Treaty on European Union on the establishment of a European police office, the Europol Convention. The convention was subsequently published as a command paper and laid before Parliament on 8th December 1995. It was ratified a year later on 10th November 1996. I must stress that under the convention Europol staff will have no operational powers. They will focus on the exchange and analysis of intelligence relating to serious international crime. A single national unit in each member state will be responsible for providing Europol with relevant intelligence and for acting as the link to law enforcement agencies in the member state. The National Criminal Intelligence Service will undertake this role in the UK. The national units will remain under national control. The director of Europol will be its legal representative and he will report to a management board comprising representatives from all member states.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para15"></a>The convention also makes detailed provision for the protection of data held by Europol and will establish an independent joint supervisory board drawn from national data protection supervisory bodies. However, before Europol's practical work can begin, in addition to all member states ratifying the convention, under Article 45(4) of the convention it is also necessary for a number of implementing regulations to have entered into force. Among those is the ratification by all members of the protocol on the privileges and immunities of Europol, a copy of which was laid before this House on 8th October. The protocol is ancillary to a Community treaty and therefore comes within the terms of Section 1(3) of the European Communities Act 1972.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para16"></a>It is therefore proposed that the first draft order before the House--that relating to the definition of treaties--should be made under Section 1(3) of the 1972 Act specifying the protocol as a Community treaty. That order provides the basis for the second order, which relates to the privileges and immunities of Europol provided by the protocol, which will be made under Section 2(2) of the 1972 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para17"></a>The UK fully supports the establishment of Europol and is committed to creating an organisation which will work effectively and add real value to the existing European police and customs co-operation. We were the first member state to ratify the convention and we see considerable advantage in being among the first to ratify this protocol. In doing so, we will demonstrate our commitment to Europol, send a wider message about the importance that we attach to effective inter- governmental co-operation against international crime under the third pillar of the EU and allow the United Kingdom to comply with the relevant recommendation of the EU high level group on organised crime, which was endorsed by the Amsterdam European Council.
<P>

<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para18"></a>It is important to emphasise that the privileges and immunities which will be given to Europol staff by the second order are comparable with those routinely afforded to staff of international organisations based in the UK. I also draw attention to Article 8 of the protocol which confines that immunity from legal process for Europol staff to acts which are in the exercise of their official functions and to Article 12 which obliges Europol to observe national laws and to waive immunities where possible in cases where immunity would impede the course of justice.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para19"></a>I should also re-emphasise that Europol will not be an operational police force. Its role will be to bring together and develop intelligence in support of the law enforcement agencies of the member states. It is essentially a supporting role. Europol staff will not undertake investigations, arrests and other executive policing functions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para20"></a>I appreciate that there are some who would like Europol to take on a wider role in the future. But that is not the current view of Her Majesty's Government. However, were the role of Europol to be developed in any way beyond that presently set out in Article 3 of the Europol Convention, then Article 17 of the Protocol would provide that there must first be a review of the current proposed privileges and immunities. That would ensure that the protocol continues to be appropriate for the tasks which Europol staff are undertaking.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para21"></a>I turn now to the order relating to the OSPAR Commission. The order allows the London-based secretariat of the OSPAR Commission and its staff to benefit from the privileges and immunities they previously enjoyed while working in the United Kingdom for the Oslo and Paris Commissions. OSPAR is not an acronym but is a merger of "Oslo" and "Paris". It took me a long time to work that out.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para22"></a>The secretariat currently administers the 1972 Oslo Convention and the 1974 Paris Convention. The contracting parties to those two conventions considered that those conventions no longer adequately controlled some of the many sources of marine pollution. They decided, therefore, to merge them into a single convention under which all sources of pollution which might affect the maritime area could be addressed. As a result, the convention for the protection of the marine environment of the North East Atlantic was concluded in Paris on 22nd November 1992. The Government ratified that convention on 15th July 1997.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para23"></a>The 1992 convention established the OSPAR Commission which consists of representatives of each of the contracting parties. It established also a permanent secretariat headed by an executive secretary. I am pleased to report that the commission agreed that the new secretariat should continue to be based in London and, to that end, the Government have negotiated a draft headquarters agreement with that commission.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para24"></a>This order is therefore specifically about the privileges and immunities to be accorded under the draft order which are necessary to fulfil our obligations under the draft headquarters agreement. Apart from allowing the secretariat the facility to employ part-time staff and extending the period of first importation of personal <P>


<a name="column_463"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 463</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>goods by staff from three months to 12 months, all other changes from the 1979 agreement are due either to updating or nomenclature.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para25"></a>We consider that the privileges and immunities being granted are no more than is necessary to enable the secretariat to operate effectively in the UK and, indeed, are broadly similar to those accorded to other international organisations. They are granted in accordance with the limitations imposed by the International Organisations Act 1968 as amended, under whose provisions the order is made.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-14_para26"></a>This order needs to be formally made at the meeting of the Privy Council on 17th December 1997--that is, this week--so that the headquarters agreement, which will enter into force on signature, can be signed shortly thereafter, enabling both the order and the agreement to come into force and allow the secretariat to administer the new convention. It is for that reason that the order is before the House today. I beg to move.

<A NAME="71215-15_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey </B>   rose to move, That the draft order laid before the House on 20th November be approved [14th Report from the Joint Committee].
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the order forms the first stage in the phasing out of the Channel 4 funding formula. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State announced in July his conclusion that the funding formula was no longer justified in the current broadcasting environment and his intention that the Government should therefore take action to bring it to an end.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para1"></a>The draft order is made under Section 27(7) of the Broadcasting Act 1990, as amended by Section 83(4) of the Broadcasting Act 1996. It will reduce from 50 per cent. to 33 1/3  per cent. the percentage of excess revenues Channel 4 must pay to the Independent Television Commission (ITC) for distribution to Channel 3 companies in 1998. The Government intend to bring forward a further order in 1999 to reduce the percentage to zero.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para2"></a>Under the terms of the 1990 Act, Channel 4 is guaranteed funding from the Channel 3 companies should its income from advertising fall below 14 per cent. of total national television advertising revenues. The liability of the Channel 3 companies is limited to 2 per cent. of total national advertising revenue in any one year.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para3"></a>Should, on the other hand, Channel 4's income from advertising rise above the 14 per cent. threshold, then the excess revenue above that threshold must be distributed according to arrangements also specified in <P>


<a name="column_464"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 464</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the 1990 Act--50 per cent. of that excess goes to the ITC for onward distribution to the Channel 3 companies and 50 per cent. can be added to Channel 4's current expenditure plans.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para4"></a>The funding formula was introduced by the 1990 Act as part of the new arrangements whereby Channel 4 was to sell its own advertising rather than rely on financing from the Channel 3 companies. Prior to the 1990 Act, Channel 4 had been financed by a subscription from the ITV companies which sold Channel 4's advertising airtime. The funding formula was a safety net because it was feared that the new arrangements might not provide Channel 4 with sufficient income properly to fulfil its remit.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para5"></a>Such fears were unfounded. Since the funding formula provision came into force in January 1993, the flow of funds has always been from Channel 4 to the Channel 3 companies--to the tune of &#163;256.6 million to date.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para6"></a>During the passage of the 1996 Broadcasting Act, there were calls to abolish the Channel 4 funding formula. Many, including Channel 4 itself, believed that, in the light of the success that Channel 4 has enjoyed since it began selling its own advertising, the financial safety net was no longer required and the payments being made by Channel 4 to the ITV companies should be ploughed back into the channel's programme production.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para7"></a>The previous administration were not wholly persuaded by these arguments. It was accordingly decided to retain the basic framework of the funding formula but to take steps to increase the level of income Channel 4 can retain. The Broadcasting Act 1996 therefore introduced the power to adjust by order the distribution of Channel 4's excess revenues above the statutory threshold of 14 per cent. of television advertising revenues. It is under these provisions that today's order is made. I commend the order to the House. I beg to move.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para8"></a>Moved, That the draft order on 20th November be approved [14th Report from the Joint Committee].--(Lord McIntosh of Haringey.)
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-15_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Rawlings: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his clear and concise explanation of why this order has been brought before us. On these Benches, we welcome the order and are cheerful in supporting it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para9"></a>The landscape of broadcasting has been changing constantly and the pace of that change has recently accelerated. The arrangements set in place in the 1990 Act, which were highly controversial at the time, have been to some extent superseded by the 1996 Act and in the same way the 1996 Act arrangements are creaking in a number of ways.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para10"></a>We have no difficulty in supporting the Government in their conclusion regarding the funding formula arrangements. The Secretary of State said:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no continuing need, or real justification, for the Channel 4 Funding Formula now that Channel 4 is a well established broadcaster with a steady income stream". <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_465"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 465</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para11"></a>The main change in the landscape of broadcasting has been the explosion of the number of channels, which is about to expand dramatically once again. There has also been an expansion in the means of delivery--analogue, satellite, digital-terrestrial, digital-satellite, digital-cable and soon the Internet. That points to the fact that viewers have much more choice than they ever dreamt of. In a few years, that choice will be unimaginably greater. In a world where the viewer has an extraordinary range of choice, it is to be hoped that the Government will be of the opinion that the type and level of regulation that applies should be changing in response.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para12"></a>The Secretary of State has linked that closely to the issue of the funding formula. Britain has led the world with its choice and diversity because of arrangements that have typically been increasingly liberal, often to the point of being highly contentious. Those arrangements have given broadcasters the opportunity to expand their production. That liberalism arises from a government attitude that it is right to give people choice and to trust them to exercise it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para13"></a>The Opposition fully support the removal of the Channel 4 funding formula but wonder whether the logic of the progression has been followed through. Having decided that there was no justification or need for the funding formula to continue, why has the Secretary of State decided to keep it as a sword of Damocles to hold over Channel 4's trembling neck to ensure that it signs up to his diktats?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para14"></a>In the Secretary of State's letter to the chairman of the Independent Television Commission he wrote about his first legislative opportunity to change Channel 4's remit and to negotiate licence changes. Perhaps that is desirable but surely it is meddlesome. These are essentially Channel 4's management responsibilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para15"></a>Channel 4 is run by highly responsible and serious people who have to make and justify strategic choices. I wish to pay tribute briefly to the tremendous contribution made by Michael Grade during his chairmanship of Channel 4, apart from making it the success that prompts this order. He pressed tirelessly, too, for years for this change in the funding formula. I also wish to pay tribute to the present chairman, Sir Michael Bishop. I hope that the funding formula will not be a pretext for further interference and regulation. At a time of rapid expansion of choice, the route that the Government are following seems somewhat perverse. The rules and remit date from the days of the controlled duopoly, when Channel 4 was born as a late Siamese twin to Channel 3. There are now three independent channels, Channels 3, 4 and 5, which all compete for advertising revenue. There should surely be a looser framework rather than a tighter one that the Secretary of State is using the order to impose.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para16"></a>Why is it necessary to go into extraordinary, elaborate detail about exactly how Channel 3 and Channel 4 should invest in their digital terrestrial capacity? Should not grown-up independent organisations decide those matters for themselves? They want to make the best possible digital television; that is how they will make money. They will make money by providing it well. <P>


<a name="column_466"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 466</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>They do not need the Government to tell them how. It is a slippery slope, and a tempting one down which it is easy to slide, towards a government controlled television, like that which exists in some other countries.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para17"></a>Channel 4 is still state owned. The correct approach is to ensure that the right people are in charge. I assume the Government are ruling out unequivocally any change to the ownership structure of Channel 4. Will the noble Lord confirm what the Minister said in the other place; namely, that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there are no plans to privatise Channel 4", </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para18"></a>as I can imagine a glint in the Chancellor's eye as he scents a quick &#163;1 billion or whatever? People want to know the Government's views. Regulation and funding are tied together. However, as I said, we support the order.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-15_spnew2"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I am afraid that I cannot go quite as far as the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, in her desire for deregulation. I still think it is important that we safeguard the best of our public service broadcasting. Sometimes I wonder whether the slippery slope that we are on leads not towards state controlled television but to the kind of television available in North America where one finds, to one's joy, that one has 64 channels to choose from and the best programme available is "I Love Lucy".
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para19"></a>It is worth remembering that Channel 4 is one of the bricks in the wall which defends public service broadcasting in this country. I declare a retrospective interest in that I was an adviser to the ITV association during the passage of the 1990 Act. I remember all the discussions about the Channel 4 formula. All those discussions concerned a formula that would act as a safety net for Channel 4. I do not think that at that point anyone in their wildest dreams saw it as a honeypot for the ITV companies. However, as the Minister indicated, that is what it has become. Channel 4 is to be congratulated on the successful lobby it has mounted to change the Government's mind on the formula. As the Minister said, we are today seeing an order that envisages the phasing out of payments.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para20"></a>ITV might ponder why it has lost friends, or found few friends, in this battle. That is partly because over the past few years the bean counters have taken over from the programme makers in setting a strategy for ITV. I hope that for Channel 3 we are coming to an end of a process of dumbing down in which finding the cultural dross of Australia or the United States and calling it popular programming is its strength. ITV's strength is still its regional strength.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para21"></a>That is why I am also pleased that Channel 4, in talking about the future, is talking about its own regional commitment. I believe that is a commitment for 30 per cent. of programming to be made in the British regions over the next four or five years. That is in the great tradition of Channel 4 in a distinguished career that is, I suspect, the thing that its creator, the noble Viscount, Lord Whitelaw, is most proud of. It is one of those curious British accidents often created by Conservative governments; that is, a state owned piece of broadcasting that fulfils a separate remit in our <P>


<a name="column_467"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 467</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>broadcasting structure. Thus far Channel 4 has done that remarkably well. I refer to "Film on Four", "Channel 4 News" and other programmes which have successfully fulfilled that remit. As I said, it has made a new commitment to regional programming.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para22"></a>The lesson I take from that--and which I hope the Minister will take--is that the title that the Conservative government chose for its White Paper at the beginning of this decade, Quality, Diversity and Choice, should still be the watchwords for those who look after our broadcasting policy today. I do not believe that quality, diversity and choice are defended by letting the market completely loose on broadcasting. I am worried when I hear David Elstein of Channel 5 calling for an end to the BBC licence. There are still powerful vested interests attacking some of the strongest parts of our public broadcasting system. I hope that what we are seeing here today from the Government is a long-term commitment and a vote of confidence in Channel 4.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-15_para23"></a>We wish Michael Jackson well and we hope that he soon has a chairman of stature to lead Channel 4 into the next millennium. Like the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, we would like to hear the Minister give another undertaking as regards privatisation. This is a juicy plum for the Treasury. Ministers in the department of culture must defend it from Treasury designs. Again, I commend Channel 4 for its regional initiative. I urge it to continue to experiment and innovate because that is the way it will continue to be a strong and valuable asset to British broadcasting.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215-16_spnew0"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords for welcoming the order and for their thoughtful comments about the issues that surround it. I share the appreciation that the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, expressed to Michael Grade and Sir Michael Bishop. In fairness, examining the history of Channel 4 over the past 15 years, we ought to add Edmund Dell, the first chairman, and Jeremy Isaacs, the first chief executive; and now, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, has done, Michael Jackson, the present chief executive.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para0"></a>However, having said that, I simply do not recognise the truth of the phrase that the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, applied to the process that we have gone through. She referred to, the "sword of Damocles over Channel 4's trembling neck". Nothing of that sort has happened at all. After we entered office in May, the Secretary of State asked the ITC to consult Channel 3 and Channel 4 about the future of the funding formula. We wanted to see under what conditions it was thought that the funding formula could safely be removed and what changes to the licences might be required.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para1"></a>We are grateful to the ITC for taking that matter forward and are satisfied that the commitments it obtained from Channel 3 and Channel 4 are adequate for securing our objectives. The ITC has indeed been taking forward work on revising Channel 4's licence; but it has not been doing so in any threatening way.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para2"></a>As the House will know, on 24th October, the ITC published for public consultation draft revisions for the licence. Those revisions had already been agreed in draft <P>


<a name="column_468"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 468</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with Channel 4. They include proposals for increased commitment to, and targets for, original productions, first-run programmes, productions commissioned outside the London transmission region and a specific commitment to assist the British film industry. All of those draft revisions seem to us to be sensible. We hope and expect that they will be in place before the end of the year.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para3"></a>I acknowledge the truth of what the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said. Channel 4 is not just another commercial channel alongside Channel 3 and Channel 5. It is a public service television channel. The achievements which the noble Baroness rightly attributes to Michael Grade and Michael Bishop, and I added other names, are in the circumstances of its being a public service television channel and it has been working gladly to the remit set out in the 1980 Act under which Channel 4 was established.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, used another curious phrase. She described Channel 4 as, "a late Siamese twin to Channel 3". I simply do not recognise that description. It is not like that at all. Channel 4, with the benefit of the remit from the 1980 Act, has been, to use the phrase of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, safeguarding the best of the public service television tradition. That is, I believe, what Channel 4 will want and will continue to want. The strength of the regulatory position that we have, as a result originally of the statutory remit and subsequently by means of changes in the licence, will be greater under conditions of wider choice and digital television than they are now. The great fear in relation to digital television is that it will be, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, said, 60 channels on which the best programme you can find is "I love Lucy".
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para5"></a>We have established, under the 1996 Act, a series of quite elaborate formulae under which the most available digital channels will go to the existing analogue producers. The purpose is to ensure that we receive the variety of programming under digital that we have come to expect under analogue. That is why the combination of commercial and public service television is so necessary.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para6"></a>Both noble Lords asked for confirmation that we do not intend to privatise Channel 4. I can confirm that Channel 4 is expected to continue to be part of the public broadcasting sector, providing a distinct and innovative programming of the highest quality. It is not intended that it should be the lowest common denominator. This Government have no intention of privatising Channel 4. I commend the order to the House.

<A NAME = "71215-16_para8"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I should like to start by thanking all noble Lords who are taking part in the debate on this important Question. That of course includes my noble friend Lady Darcy de Knayth. I am especially delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, has chosen this subject on which to make his maiden speech. It was on the noble Lord's Chronically Sick and Disabled Person's Bill in 1970 that I made my maiden speech at its Second Reading in your Lordships' House. The noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, is a past Minister for Disabled People. He understands how wide and varied are the needs of disabled people. I am sure that we all look forward to his speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para9"></a>I hope that the Minister will have a message of forthcoming help for children and parents who have to overcome the problems of dyslexia. I also hope that there will be understanding and help for people who still struggle, having reached adulthood, as a result of dyslexia.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para10"></a>There are others far more qualified than I speaking in this debate. However, I wish to relate my personal involvement to illustrate how necessary understanding and training of teachers is if they are to help the many children who seem to be dyslexic.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para11"></a>My noble kinsman, my husband, and I adopted two children. Soon after the boy had gone to school, it became evident that he was having problems. At a children's party to which I had invited 15 children, I got them to line up and see who could kick a football the furthest. Two of the children, our boy being one of them, kicked the ball with their left foot. Both were right-handed. Both had writing and reading problems. This cross-lateral condition seems to cause dyslexia.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para12"></a>For many years I have been involved with boys from a young offenders institution, having been on the board of visitors. It was there that I met a remedial teacher, and our boy used to go to her, at her home, for some extra teaching when she had the time. She saw the need after helping our boy, and taught many other children who were struggling, with no help coming from their schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para13"></a>I believe that there are many people in our prisons who have the problem of dyslexia and have become so frustrated and demoralised that they have dropped out of school, marked as stupid and lazy when their learning difficulties have not been picked up.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para14"></a>I have a great nephew whose father is dyslexic. He is a very active boy who wants to achieve. He is only six, but already he is having problems at school and is becoming withdrawn. He kicks a ball with his left foot and is right-handed. Does the Minister know how many children like him there are across the country?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para15"></a>On Friday, while driving in my car, I heard someone from the British Dyslexia Association speaking on the programme "You and Yours" about the need to help dyslexic children. Some of the ways forward seem to be: screening of all children at school entry, with closer observation and diagnostic assessment of children found to be at risk of having special educational needs; teacher training to enable effective learning of early skills for children with difficulties; further screening in years <P>


<a name="column_470"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>three, six and nine, to identify potential areas of difficulty. There should be teacher training across all curriculum areas on meeting individual special educational needs within the classroom, and supported parent partnerships through the school-based stages.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para16"></a>Parents are often told that their child cannot have extra help with reading and other work because he must have access to the national curriculum. Can children have this access if they cannot reach the basic skills? Many parents feel that their child is doomed to increasing under-achieving. It is too often the case that children have access to the curriculum only through reading and demonstrate their understanding only through writing. In those circumstances, the dyslexic child will always be substantially disadvantaged.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para17"></a>Children sometimes stay on the lower levels of work schemes because they cannot read the text or copy it wrongly. Where the child has the task read and the copying checked, he may have no difficulty with the concepts.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para18"></a>What would be helpful would be teacher training in modifying the curriculum to meet individual special educational needs within the classroom and space within the curriculum to develop learning skills. There should be no buck-passing between schools and LEAs. LEAs should require schools to be accountable for spending their special educational needs resources effectively. Communication to parents should be clear and helpful. There should be a specialist teacher in every school who understands dyslexia so that teachers can be helped to help children. When dyslexic children take exams, they should be given extra time, and technical aids such as word processors should be available.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para19"></a>With so much press coverage today about the Government wanting disabled people to work rather than to be on benefits, I would like to put the question now to the Government about children with dyslexia, which is a disability. Would it not be an investment for the future to give those children special help when they need it so that they can overcome their learning problems before being cast out from the competition for jobs and doomed to fail? With motivation and help, many people who have the problem of dyslexia have proved that they can achieve as much as anyone else.

<A NAME="71215-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Newby: </B>   My Lords, I should like to begin by thanking the noble Baroness for introducing the debate on this extremely important issue. I should also like to welcome the noble Lord, Lord Morris, to the debate and say how much we look forward to hearing his maiden speech.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para20"></a>I speak as a parent of a child with dyslexia--not very severe dyslexia by many standards. However, that has meant that I have been able to see at first hand the frustrations and stress which can occur before the problem is identified and the effort and support that is needed by the combination of form teacher, specialist teacher, parents and the child, to manage the problem and enable progress to be made.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para21"></a>As the noble Baroness has already said, the reason this debate is necessary is that many children are not getting the help they need in this area. In some ways, it <P>


<a name="column_471"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 471</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is particularly a problem for children whose disability is not quite severe enough for statementing because those children still find it extremely difficult to get ideas down onto paper or to process information in a classroom. They are often branded as lazy, careless or stupid. As a parent who attempted to correct homework time after time, week in week out, before the problem was diagnosed in our son, I know how easy it is to fall into that category. Without adequate support, it is hardly surprising that under-achievement is common. Once that occurs, emotional and behavioural problems often follow. As the noble Baroness said, in extreme cases dyslexic children turn to crime out of a sense of frustration and failure. In reality, it is a failure of the educational system and one which we must all work hard to put right.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para22"></a>The importance of early identification of the problem and teacher training have already been mentioned by the noble Baroness, although I wish to underline the importance of the latter point. Our son was finally diagnosed as being dyslexic at the age of nine. If it had happened two or three years earlier it would have saved much heartache and trouble for him and, to a lesser extent, for his parents.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para23"></a>I want to deal specifically with two issues. The first has to do with the difference of approach which different schools have to the problem. Many schools are willing to take pupils with dyslexia and make good provision for them. Unfortunately, many others, particularly secondary schools--no doubt overanxious about their position in the league tables--make it clear that dyslexic pupils are simply not welcome. If they do somehow get through the entrance exam or test, or whatever it is, they will not receive special help in the school. This seems to me to be wholly unacceptable and I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that the Government will make it clear to schools that they do not believe that segregation by dyslexia is a satisfactory form of determining admissions to secondary schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para24"></a>The second point I wish to speak on has already been covered to a certain extent by the noble Baroness. It is the catch-22 situation that dyslexic children find themselves in with respect to the national curriculum. On the one hand, they underperform because they have not had the necessary additional tuition to enable them to take in the lessons adequately. On the other hand, if they take time out of mainstream lessons to get up to speed in reading and writing, they run the risk of getting behind on the subjects covered. Many schools seem unwilling to accept this as a problem and insist on the children sitting through certain lessons although they are manifestly incapable of getting the most from them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para25"></a>Getting the balance right between the national curriculum and special provision is crucially important, is often not achieved, but is inherently not hugely complicated. First, clearly teachers, whether they are specialist teachers or--more important--other teachers, need to realise what the symptoms of dyslexia are and how they can begin to deal with the pupils in the classroom. I was encouraged to read in the recent Green Paper Excellence for all Children that the DfEE is <P>


<a name="column_472"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 472</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>funding research projects in this area and that good progress is being made with them and improvements are being made. I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that these pilot projects will not sit on a dusty shelf at the DfEE, once completed, as many pilot projects in other areas have in the past. If there is good practice out there and good practice is being developed, it is crucially important to get it down to the classroom level.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para26"></a>Secondly, to deal with the national curriculum and special tuition, as the noble Baroness said, we must find space in the curriculum for it. It is not "rocket" science; it is not hugely difficult. For example, it may mean taking children out of English lessons so that they can obtain special tuition; it may mean staggering the point at which children are taken out of lessons during different subjects on different weeks. Teachers then spend a small amount of time enabling the child to catch up on the lesson. In our experience, that is a perfectly feasible way of dealing with the issue.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para27"></a>Again, it is important that children have access to the technology which will enable them to make more success of learning. As the noble Baroness said, that is partly a question of enabling them to use technology in exam circumstances. But, almost more important, it is a question of giving them early access to technology, to laptops, tape books, and so forth, so that they get a taste for learning and feel that they are making progress before they become disillusioned and frustrated by being unable to keep up with their peers.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para28"></a>Finally, it is crucially important that all the teaching staff retain high expectations for a dyslexic child. Far too often dyslexic children are judged by their abilities on paper rather than their inherent abilities. That again leads to the kind of frustrations I mentioned. Even with perfectly enlightened teachers, additional resources are needed in many cases to deal with the issue. Specialist teachers cost extra; so do laptops. In our family we have been willing and able to make payments for special tuition, but many parents are unable to do that. That is why, during the general election, Liberal Democrats argued for additional spending in this area. That is why we will continue to press the Government to make more funding available for education.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para29"></a>Many public policy issues that come before this House are seemingly intractable. In my view that is not so with dyslexia. We need best practice understood by all the teachers implemented in the classrooms and more resources to enable that to happen. Parents and children with dyslexia are looking to a Government committed to "education, education and education"; to show a determination to see real improvements in this area.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para30"></a>In conclusion, I again thank the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, for introducing the debate. I look forward to hearing from the Minister as to the positive steps the Government are proposing to take to respond to the challenge of dyslexia.

<A NAME="71215-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Morris of Manchester: </B>   My Lords, the only possible defence I can offer for inflicting on the British Parliament a second maiden speech is that, subject to <P>


<a name="column_473"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 473</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>correction by anyone who heard my first in another place 33 years ago, the survivors of that occasion will hopefully, now have recovered.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para31"></a>I am naturally most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, for initiating this debate. Her maiden speech, as she said, was made at Second Reading in your Lordships' House of my Private Member's Bill that became the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. Hence it seems appropriate for me now to repay the compliment, more especially since the 1970 Act was the first ever statute to legislate on dyslexia in this or any other country.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para32"></a>Memorably effective maiden speeches were also made in that Second Reading debate by, among others, the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, the noble Lords, Lord Ingleby and Lord Cullen, and the late and deeply-mourned Lord Crawshaw.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para33"></a>My Bill was not universally welcomed. Several Ministers made no bones about their hostility to one or more of its 29 clauses, while others were against the Bill as a whole. Some were more subtle. I recall in particular a meeting with the education Minister dealing with the clauses affecting his department. He was known to be anguishing about the cost implications of my clause on dyslexia and I expected him to argue that it was unaffordable, so it came as no surprise when he began by saying: "I have some bad news for you, Alf". He went on to tell me that, "sadly for us both" his department's finding, based on exhaustive inquiries going as far back it seemed as Robert Lowe's reign as vice-president of the Committee of the Council on Education after 1859, was that dyslexia simply did not exist. Thus I was guilty not only of thinking the unthinkable and speaking the unspeakable, but of "discovering" the undiscoverable. All of which sounded highly culpable to me as a barely five year-old parliamentary toddler. But needs must: I told the Minister that I would be retaining the clause, but that if he was right and dyslexia did not exist, then at least it would not cost him anything.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para34"></a>I felt no antipathy to the Minister. Your Lordships may recall that Mark Twain made his name as a music critic by saying: "Wagner's music is not as bad as it sounds". Some of my best friends have been education Ministers and none was ever as bad as they sometimes had to sound.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para35"></a>My Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Bill was, as I said at the time, about social inclusion for disabled people. It was about making them a part of instead of being apart from society. So the seeming finality of the official response to my clause on dyslexia was disappointing for everyone who knew how socially isolating it could be. For innumerable children it meant inadequate education, contempt for their abilities and no prospect of worthwhile employment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para36"></a>It was the warmth of public backing for the Bill and the support it received from both sides of both Houses of Parliament that changed official attitudes. Not only was the Bill emphatically approved by this House: it was also improved, not least by the unanimous insistence here, to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, recently so perceptively and <P>


<a name="column_474"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 474</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>eloquently alluded in the case of R. v.  Gloucestershire Council, ex parte Michael Barry, that help for disabled people must in future depend not on where they lived but strictly on the extent of individual need.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para37"></a>At no time did party animus impede the Bill's progress, and it delights me now to be able to acknowledge, 27 years on, the humane leadership this House gave at what a French legislator was soon afterwards to describe as "un moment critique" for disabled people everywhere. It delights me also now to be able to thank from the Floor of this House my noble friend Lord Longford for sponsoring my Bill here with so much sympathy, skill and success.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para38"></a>Since the 1970 Act became law, dyslexia has become much more widely understood and accepted, due in no small part to the British Dyslexia Association's work on the importance of early identification and its excellent help and advisory services.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para39"></a>The condition which did not exist is now known to afflict 10 per cent. of us to some extent. For over 2 million children and adults it is a serious barrier to learning. Too often parents are still told that their children will "grow out" of their difficulties. Assessments come too late, valuable time is lost and the child's self-esteem is shaken. Some children think they have a "disease" because they cannot learn to read like their friends. Yet screening tests are available to focus teaching on specific weaknesses. If they were used more widely many dyslexic children would not develop special educational needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para40"></a>As Jackie Stewart has said, dyslexia is often still only diagnosed in adult life. He was not aware of his dyslexia until he was 42 and many people who are undiagnosed and unhelped lose all hope of achieving their potential in sheer frustration. Many develop secondary emotional and behavioural difficulties and are excluded from school as disruptive.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para41"></a>Sadly, dyslexia is over-represented among offenders, usually because their frustration at not being able to do right for doing wrong at school led to truancy, petty and then more serious crime. Bob Turney, of whose instructive case Carol Orton of the BDA informs me in a most helpful note, was called "that idiot boy" at school. After 18 years drifting in and out of prison he joined an education class and his teacher thought he might be dyslexic. Finally achieving literacy, he took a degree and has written a book. Now a constructive member of society, he works to prevent other young people falling into the same trap.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para42"></a>The Prime Minister said famously that a new Labour Government would be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime. As Bob Turney's case demonstrates, few causes of crime cry out more urgently for remedy than the continuing failure to give many dyslexic children the right help, at the right time and in the right place. I hope my noble friend in replying will confirm tonight that their claims merit the highest priority. I am sure he needs no persuading to do all he can to help, nor any reminding of the wise public statement of our right honourable friend David Blunkett that:

<A NAME = "71215-16_para43"></a>I referred to Robert Lowe. His great dictum as the "first-ever Minister of Education" was that, under him, what was not cheap would be efficient and what was not efficient would be cheap. Not to give people with dyslexia the specialist help they need to take their rightful place in industry and society is neither cheap nor efficient. Nor is it humane.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para44"></a>I have sometimes been accused of asking too much for disabled people. It was said in 1970 and again when I introduced the mobility allowance, the severe disablement allowance, the invalid care allowance and the disabled housewife's allowance, among other benefits for disabled people, their families and carers. But I am not alone in having been so accused.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para45"></a>I recall being deeply moved by the case of a young man whose doctors gave him just three years to live. He was both well qualified and keen to study for a degree, but inevitably some argued that it would be a profligate waste of resources to let him do so. Happily the university's vice-chancellor, unafraid of being accused of profligacy, saw him as being as much entitled to enter upon a degree course as any other qualified candidate. The young man died soon after graduating. But the vice-chancellor had boldly asserted his right not to have to spend his final years simply waiting to die when he was qualified to achieve his life's ambition. It was impossible to add years to his life, but the vice-chancellor unquestionably added life to his years. That was man's humanity to man at its most sublime: an example for every Minister with any responsibility for the well-being and status of disabled people to ponder most carefully. I say that as the first Minister for Disabled People in any country.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para46"></a>The vice-chancellor was the late Sir Edward Boyle, Minister of Education in the Macmillan Government, who later came to your Lordships' House. He was, I am glad to say, among those who helped me and my good, abiding and noble friend Lord Ashley and other close colleagues to enact my Bill. Let the nobility of his example inspire us to demonstrate again that, in seeking to make life better for disabled people, not least those with dyslexia, our Parliament can act as one and is ultimately concerned not only with costs but also with human values.

<A NAME="71215-16_spnew3"></A><B> Viscount Allenby of Megiddo: </B>   My Lords, it is my pleasurable duty to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, on his first contribution to your Lordships' House. Apart from holding the very highest awards given by the New Zealand Government--the QSO--and the Australian Government--the AO--he brings a breadth and depth of experience, having been MP for the Manchester, Wythenshaw constituency for the past 33 years. For nine years, between 1970 and 1979, he was successively Front Bench spokesman for social services and Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the DHSS with special responsibility for the disabled. So it is most apt that he chose dyslexia for his maiden speech, a maiden speech remarkable for its clarity and interest and for showing us the way forward and giving <P>


<a name="column_476"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 476</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>us a clear understanding of the background to the subject we are discussing tonight. We very much look forward to future contributions from the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para47"></a>I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, for introducing this subject tonight. Dyslexia is sometimes blamed as a "catch-all" phrase for slow readers. Others insist that it is a definite condition. The root cause is uncertain but it is clearly hereditary and genetic. Here I must say that my late mother was probably dyslexic, I am certainly dyslexic and my son is dyslexic. But he copes through the use of a lap-top computer. I had no help. All I remember is being locked in a tennis court and being told to learn six words a day, which I never did learn. I am still blind to those words today.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para48"></a>The belief is that one child in five suffers from the condition and is in need of special education. I also believe that it runs in families and not necessarily across families. Discovering that your child has the condition of dyslexia can be devastating. But it can also be a relief that there is an identifiable and, to an extent, curable cause.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para49"></a>I wish to confine my remarks to two areas of the problem: early assessment of children in schools, and adults seeking employment, which relates to the second part of the noble Baroness's question. First, I give an unreserved welcome to the Green Paper, Excellence for all Children--Meeting Special Needs, which has already been mentioned. This surely must be a big step forward for teachers, parents, education authorities and the many voluntary organisations which do so much to help those who struggle to cope with dyslexia and need help.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para50"></a>At present, one of the most common complaints by parents is that schools are reluctant to identify children as dyslexic, often because of the pressures on the teachers themselves and the lack of recognition by education authorities. This, in turn, leads to a lack of support and further aggravation of the children's problems, very often leading to bullying of dyslexics. According to the British Dyslexia Association, schools are reluctant to identify dyslexia and rarely address its effects until the child has fallen as much as four years behind in reading age. As the BDA goes on to say, this amounts to an unacceptable tolerance of under-achievement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para51"></a>On the other hand, many schools and education authorities now spend much more time working with parents. Sadly, all too often parents will blame teachers or will not fully accept that their children have special educational needs. This is where direct face-to-face discussion between parents and teachers is so vital on a regular basis. This is also where such organisations as Parent Partnerships have an important part to play.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para52"></a>Bearing in mind the code of conduct in the Green Paper and the need for early identification of special educational needs, can the Minister confirm the need for a national curriculum for all teachers that will enable them to identify problems in children? I fully appreciate that reaction to the Green Paper must be awaited and I recognise the very important role of the National Advisory Group on Special Educational Needs, chaired by Estelle Morris, MP.
<P>


<a name="column_477"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 477</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para53"></a>Finally, on assessment, with only approximately 2,000 fully trained teachers and 200 teachers being trained every year, is it the Government's intention to increase the number of those being trained so as to have on each teaching establishment a fully trained teacher, or will teachers have to be shared between teaching establishments?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para54"></a>I should now like to turn to adult education in the hope that sufferers among the unemployed might receive encouragement and possibly help. A 1995 survey carried out on adult students by the British Dyslexia Association showed that 70 per cent. were not diagnosed until after the age of 21 and that nearly half of those were unemployed. I believe that a number of those students will have been classified in the past at school as lazy or unco-operative or even badly behaved, when they were in fact in need of urgent help.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para55"></a>While I recognise that there are a number of financial incentives for dyslexic adults to gain employment and, indeed, to go on to further education and higher education, leading in some instances to dyslexic people becoming scientists and engineers, there would appear to be little chance and little help for those in the severe category who cannot read or cannot write or, in some cases, cannot do either.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para56"></a>This problem was highlighted by a recent letter sent to the Secretary of State by a 45 year-old married man who had been unemployed for three years. He was called into a job club but because he could not read or write, he could not fill in any of the forms. In his letter, written with the help of his wife and a typewriter, he movingly describes his frustrating visits to jobcentres, then to a psychologist and eventually to the Dyslexia Institute at Staines, where for the past 14 months he has received one two-hour lesson a week. He describes being passed from person to person and ends with the words,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I wish there was something they could offer me with my Dyslexia". </UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para57"></a>While the organisations such as the British Dyslexia Association, the Dyslexia Institute and many other very worthy bodies do an excellent job, their funds and resources are limited so that they really can only scratch at the surface because of the sheer numbers of adults who need help to gain employment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para58"></a>I believe that there is a great need for a full-time regional organisation, possibly based on the British Dyslexia Association, but with Government help and encouragement from the voluntary sector to help the unemployed to gain confidence; to obtain the basic skills and where the LEAs and jobcentres can refer people who clearly have problems. It simply is not only children who suffer from the effects of dyslexia, but adults as well. Very often the most hard working and loyal citizens do desperately seek a bit of extra help to achieve employment.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para59"></a>It is easy enough for a psychologist to diagnose traditional dyslexia with the well-tried methods, but dyspraxia and dysphasia and other difficulties are now being identified and recognised. Can the Minister say what the Government are doing in the way of research and in particular the project at the Manchester Metropolitan University?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para60"></a>It goes without saying that there are far too few educational psychologists and trained teachers to carry out the assessment, let alone remedial teachers to cope now and in the near future. But the Green Paper is a very welcome step in the right direction and we look forward eagerly to the White Paper in due course.

<A NAME="71215-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Annaly: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, for putting down this Unstarred Question and giving us the chance to air this important subject. I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, on his interesting maiden speech. It does not seem very long ago since I made mine on a different subject. I remember being rather frightened, but I had not got 30 years of experience gained down at the other end of this building.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para61"></a>Until about four years ago I knew very little about dyslexia. What I have learnt in the past four years has come about through the fact that my three children, now aged 10, eight and seven years, are all dyslexic to varying degrees. The primary schools that they have been attending enrol the help of special needs teachers and only in the case of one child was that not sufficient to enable my daughter to keep up with the rest of the class. In this case, after much thought, a change of school was thought the best course. In this one case, the change of school is proving to have been the right decision. Sibford, which is near Banbury, practises a "whole school approach" to support, so that the specialist provision is recognised and carried through into the mainstream classroom.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para62"></a>While that is an easy label, it necessitates the care and training of all staff, not just teaching staff. All staff need training and a will to enable these children to access the curriculum and reach their own potential. It is easier to ensure that in a smaller school where all staff are in regular contact.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para63"></a>The Green Paper which the Government produced in October is a step forward. That recognises dyslexia and takes it seriously. The Green Paper has a section on working with parents. It is of great importance that any learning difficulty is identified at as early an age as possible. This may happen at school when a child is finding reading difficult. However, parents might pick up on a child finding it hard to remember rhymes or to do things in sequence. A child may be slow to acquire language or may be a bit clumsy or slow to learn to tie a shoe lace, which is a sequence action. These are all things which might indicate possible dyslexia.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para64"></a>Some of the "working with parents" measures proposed in the Green Paper are sound practice. Much of the concern among parents in mainstream schools is because of a lack of trust between anxious parents and schools. The delay in acknowledging an educational need causes frustration and anger.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para65"></a>In the time I am allowed I am going to run through a few points in the Green Paper. I have gained from talking to, and seeking advice from, people at my daughter's school in the dyslexia department. I hope that this will be of benefit to the Government when they are considering their Green Paper. I turn first to "Policies in <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Excellence". In general terms, it makes good sense and certainly it is moving in the right direction. In many cases reading difficulties have not been addressed in the primary school and the figures for those moving to secondary schools with reading difficulties is a cause of great concern. Early identification and the training to do this and to teach literacy and numeracy skills are crucial.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para66"></a>There is no doubt that the strategies for teaching special learning difficulty pupils benefits all, but I am concerned that, even with good teaching, many special learning difficulty pupils do not make progress and that specialist teaching needs to be available for some pupils. With good practice and early identification, I believe that the picture will generally improve, but it will take several years for this to feed into the system.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para67"></a>I turn to the practical support section of the Green Paper. There is still no mention of the gifted child and I feel that this should be addressed. One of the links suggested to improve special educational needs provision at stages one to three is the use of the inter-school e-mail links, and I know that the SENCO link has been very valuable to many SEN workers. The idea that speech and language and occupational therapy and so on should be seen as part of the "educational" support is vitally important. These divisions are counter-productive.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para68"></a>Personally, I would not welcome the introduction of national criteria for statementing or a statutory limit. There are already guidelines in the code. It is in part the legal framework of the statement, which makes the statement such an attractive option for parents. Once they have the statement then they have a guarantee of provision for their child. Once parents have fought so long and hard for a statement, one can understand that they are unwilling to have it discontinued. The process of statementing is bound to be a long one because of the range of information involved, but there are still instances where the paperwork is delayed.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para69"></a>I turn now to increasing inclusion. Parents of special educational needs children very often do not want to send children to special schools and may well welcome a move towards inclusive education, but it will need to be well funded. The expertise within the special schools is valuable and it is needed in the wider context as the complexity of special educational needs provision grows, but it must be devolved and not diluted.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para70"></a>In the current LEA climate it is unlikely that the LEAs will put the funding and resources into the movement of children from special to mainstream. Some inclusion programmes have been successful, but it is not something that can just be thrust upon the staff and parents concerned. The intention is to give more background information to inform readers of league tables, but if this is to be benchmarked on free school meals, that will not be very helpful.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para71"></a>I now turn to the planning provision in the Green Paper. The response to regional planning will vary. In some cases the independent sectors will be as eager as the maintained sector to participate, and it may be a good thing that the planning groups will not be entirely LEA based. There does not seem to be a great deal of <P>


<a name="column_480"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 480</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>change in placement structure for schools such as my daughter's school at Sibford, but I think the fact that the responsibility for the decision now comes down wholly on the LEAs may mean that some LEAs take a different view on placements.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para72"></a>I shall now say something about developing skills. It is important because we are talking about learning support assistants. The Green Paper states that the role of the learning support assistants is central to a successful SEN policy in special and mainstream schools. The level of reliance on LSAs means that training and career development are essential if that is to be successful. Currently fewer than half the LEAs provide appropriate training for learning support staff although some have developed accredited courses with higher education institutions and training and enterprise councils. Health authorities may also need to be involved in training.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para73"></a>It seems increasingly that the LSAs are being asked to put in place the provision of the statements. Giving access to the curriculum is one thing but this Green Paper seems to justify and further promote this trend; LSA jobs are likely to be part-time posts taken very often by mothers of younger children who want their work to fit into the school day and term. Many want it as a temporary post and in many LEAs they are only bought in on temporary contracts. Some may, indeed, be excellent teachers and classroom supports but there is a huge responsibility being placed on them and this is not reflected in their job status (or pay). Talk of training and career structure sounds good and in some cases may be successful, but there are many cases where training may be given but with little gain to those providing it, and it is difficult to envisage a career structure for this role.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para74"></a>The change in role of the educational psychologists started with the code but it seems that their whole focus is changing, and they are being asked to take on roles which they are not necessarily trained to do and may have no interest in doing. While future training is being set up, I am concerned that they are being asked to cover a huge range of important specialist areas, including counsellor, family therapist and manager, and these do not all sit well with the specialised training and traditional role of the educational psychologist. The emphasis on SEN training and continued training is very welcome.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-16_para75"></a>I am aware that I have overshot my time. Perhaps those on the Government Front Bench will nod if I may continue. I shall curtail my remarks, however, if noble Lords want me to shut up quickly.<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para0"></a>Finally, I refer to inclusive education. The policy of inclusion is a good principle, but cannot easily be imposed on all mainstream schools. Many pupils need the specialist provision of the special schools. Those with special educational needs do not form an homogenous group. There needs to be a range of provision. Perhaps I may give the example of withdrawal teaching. In my daughter's class, every day five of the 15 children are taken into the room next door, where they are given specialist teaching for a period. It has to be carefully timed because the teachers do not want them to miss the lessons that they are good at as that might mean that they become demoralised. That is an important point. It is useful that such teaching takes place in a group, and not individually.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para1"></a>Parents increasingly expect choice to be available. Some special schools do not currently meet the potential of certain pupils who have been placed in them, but this could be addressed by some of the measures mentioned in the Green Paper.

<A NAME="71215-17_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Darcy de Knayth: </B>   My Lords, I too thank my noble friend Lady Masham for giving us the opportunity to question the Government on their plans to improve educational provision for people with dyslexia. My noble friend gave an interesting portrayal of the problems associated with dyslexia.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para2"></a>I very much enjoyed the excellent and witty maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester. The erstwhile toddler has now definitely become a most experienced maiden, having given birth, as it were, on the way to the 1970 Act which was the first ever to mention dyslexia.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para3"></a>I am only sorry that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, cannot be here tonight. In 1994 she spearheaded through this House the code of practice which is so important for children with special educational needs, clearly setting out a system involving identification, provision, monitoring and evaluation. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that there will be no weakening of the provisions of the code of practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para4"></a>Much has been said by noble Lords about the importance of early identification. I am very conscious that many noble Lords know a very great deal more about dyslexia than I do. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, gave a graphic description and the point was mentioned also by the noble Viscount, Lord Allenby. I warmly support the call for all teachers to be able to identify specific learning difficulties and for the adequate provision of trained teachers. Ideally, all children with special educational needs should be educated in mainstream schools--that aim is expressed in the Green Paper--so, there should be no need for a statement. After all, the necessity for a statement depends rather more on the degree of provision available locally than on the degree of special educational need of a particular child. But until we reach that ideal situation, the statement offers the only assurance that children with special educational needs will obtain the special educational provision that is required. The noble Lord, Lord Annaly, has just highlighted that point. So, <P>


<a name="column_482"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 482</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>whatever legislation is forthcoming, I very much hope that it will either leave the code of practice in place or incorporate its provisions.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para5"></a>Since the 1970 Act, the parents of children with dyslexia have had to overcome two hurdles. It is those who have had to cross the second hurdle on whom I should like to focus. The first hurdle was the refusal to acknowledge the existence of dyslexia by many psychologists and teachers. Parents were deemed pushy and middle-class, unable to accept that their children were "backward", and so the development of teaching techniques and materials to help children with dyslexia was seriously held back until research into brain functioning provide convincing evidence of the condition. Broadly speaking, this barrier has been overcome. As has been said, there are still problems. There are instances of dyslexia being picked up too late and the BDA talks of "widespread tolerance of under-achievement". The noble Lord, Lord Newby, and the noble Viscount, Lord Allenby, referred to that.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para6"></a>The second hurdle is the refusal to acknowledge that dyslexia could also be the reason for children with low average or below average IQs failing to read. Perhaps because it was initially the more articulate and educated parents who pressed for recognition of dyslexia, it was regarded as a condition which applied only to children with above average intelligence, despite the fact that research had identified causal factors in terms of memory and perception which could clearly affect children regardless of their intelligence. So, for many years specialist provision was withheld from dyslexic children with lower IQs despite their continued failure to benefit from traditional literacy teaching and despite their showing many of the classic signs of dyslexia. The noble Lord, Lord Annaly, has just spoken of the classic signs of dyslexia in children.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para7"></a>It was only in the code of practice in 1994 that professionals and LEAs were given specific guidance that dyslexia should not be regarded as affecting only children of above average intelligence. Parents of children with average or lower IQs often have particular difficulty in obtaining specialist provision. Certainly, as late as 1995 the publicly stated policy of one LEA was that children with dyslexia had to be of average or above average intelligence before the county considered that they had dyslexia. I very much hope that the Minister will ensure that the needs of this group of children are understood and that they receive the appropriate educational provision to enable them to reach their maximum potential.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para8"></a>I turn now to the other end of the spectrum: students with dyslexia in further and higher education. The numbers of dyslexic students in higher education have been growing. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency there were 7,305 in 1995-6--a record of which we should be proud. Nevertheless, dyslexic students in further and particularly higher education still come up against the assumption that dyslexic people are less intelligent and able than others. They are still routinely turned down unseen for courses in teaching and medicine by academic staff who assume that dyslexia debars them from these careers.
<P>


<a name="column_483"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 483</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para9"></a>If a qualified person were turned down for a job as a teacher or doctor on the ground of his or her dyslexia, recourse could be had to the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act for protection. Because the Act does not cover education some people are prevented at the training stage from pursuing careers to which they may very well be suited. Will the Government consider amending the DDA to cover further and higher education or will subsequent anti-discrimination legislation include education?
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para10"></a>My noble friend spoke of the special help needed by dyslexic children when undergoing exams. Those students with dyslexia who enter college and university can have problems at exam time. Many institutions continue to turn down requests, for example for extra time in examinations or the use of a computer to help a dyslexic student, even though it would be available at work and would not prejudice the integrity of the examination or the quality of the qualification. If education were included in anti-discrimination legislation, institutions would have to take seriously students' right of access not only to the education provided but to the related qualification.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para11"></a>I hope to hear a positive response from the Minister when he replies on plans to ensure early identification of specific learning difficulties, increased provision in particular for those with average or below average IQs and an assurance that the provisions of the code of practice will not be weakened by any imminent future legislation. I also hope that the Government will consider including further and higher education in anti-discrimination legislation.

<A NAME="71215-17_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I have listened to this debate with both interest and frustration. The frustration arises because many of the areas on which I intended to speak have been covered well by previous speakers. This is a debate in which I have the cheerful task of congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Morris, on a very good and humane maiden speech which dealt with many of the problems of and approaches to dyslexia and disability in general. It is the kind of speech that should be heard more often in this Chamber. It reminds us that we have a duty to bring people fully into our society. The noble Lord began a tremendous tradition in regard to such legislation back in 1970. I also feel a degree of comradeship with him. Nearly 11 years ago I made my own maiden speech on an Unstarred Question on dyslexia at the end of business. However, I was not quite as polished in my delivery as the noble Lord.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para12"></a>The background to this debate can be seen in the consultative paper Excellence for All. Everyone who knows anything about education to whom I have spoken agrees that the document makes all the right noises. It speaks about the early recognition of disabilities, bringing people into the classroom and adopting good practice. But it will have to be resourced. It will require a degree of will behind it that will not be dictated first and foremost by Treasury convenience.
<P>


<a name="column_484"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 484</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para13"></a>None of the legislation in this area would ever have become law, as the noble Lord, Lord Morris, has described, if it had not had sufficient will behind it to tackle the problem and tell the Treasury what needed to be done. I believe that the noble Lord quoted Robert Lowe, the first speech of the first education Secretary. I believe that he also said of his new voters, having opposed the second Reform Bill, that his new masters should at least be taught how to read. I suggest that that attitude should be carried through to the last and biggest disabled group in this country--approximately 10 per cent. of the population--who should be given support.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para14"></a>I belatedly declare an interest. I am vice-president of the BDA and vice-president of the Adult Dyslexia Association and I am dyslexic. So I think that I should be given all the support that I need. I was given most of what I needed through the state system, parental persistence and good luck. Many did not make it. I was always just a step ahead of the legislation that gave support, until the 1983 Act.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para15"></a>By being able to convince people that there was flexibility within the process, I was given support. I could give noble Lords a series of anecdotes but that would be self-indulgent. Apart from anything else, I am sure that Hansard has already recorded most of them. For instance, one of my history teachers said, "I cannot have him in my class because I dictate notes and everyone takes notes in my class". As my final degree was in history I am glad that that recommendation was overruled.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para16"></a>As an adult, one's problems do not end, as all speakers in the debate have said. In some ways they are only just beginning. Once one has managed to convince a teacher that there is a problem with a child in school but that the child can be helped, support will be given. The teachers want to extract the information from the child. That does not exist in the workplace.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para17"></a>We have already heard anecdotes about someone trying to fill in a form in front of a busy official in an employment office. That causes tremendous pressure. I have made half of my political career out of admitting that I am dyslexic, but it is still difficult for me to admit that in public. It is difficult for me to ask for three forms to fill in by myself quietly because I am likely to make a mistake. I have had to accept a few snide remarks over that. People do not realise what dyslexia means. When I say that I am dyslexic people even now say, "What is that then?". One needs support. A large part of the work of the Adult Dyslexia Association is taken up by members saying to people, "Don't worry. It's not your fault. You have a disability".
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para18"></a>I do not claim to be totally up with the scientific claims, but parts of my brain that deal with the speech process have different levels of electronic activity from other people's. We are talking about a differently constructed brain. The problem is that fundamental.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para19"></a>People who say, "Oh, he has got over it", or, "I used to be dyslexic", are talking garbage. It is a disability which is with you for life. You will need support throughout your life, or at the very least, understanding. If you do not have that you will be fighting an uphill battle. If one considers that that level of disability will <P>


<a name="column_485"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 485</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>always exist, it is not surprising that people with dyslexia do not like admitting it. The squiggles on pieces of paper to which we have given an abstract meaning--that is, writing--will always be difficult for someone suffering from dyslexia. We are talking about the ability to translate a series of arbitrary symbols in an organised pattern to convey information. We are talking about that whether it is on a piece of paper or a screen. Dyslexics will always find writing difficult.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para20"></a>I return to the document Excellence for All. I should like to emphasise, as other speakers have, the current obsession with league tables. League tables giving exam results--most of the exams taken in the conventional manner with pieces of paper with squiggles on them--will mean that dyslexics will always be a liability. It is like selecting a football team with a goal keeper who has only one arm. He may get by, but there is a good chance that he will let you down.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para21"></a>Unless some form of value-added points is offered to the system, something the Government could easily do, for taking on people with disabilities, there will always be a disincentive. That is something that the Government could achieve easily, and, dare I say it, at no extra cost to the Treasury. I hope that we get a favourable response to that suggestion, if not tonight then in the foreseeable future.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para22"></a>If we are to stop the future flow through the system of people whose problem is not recognised, or who receive insufficient support, we shall have to ensure that all teachers, not just the new ones, are trained. Days should be put aside to train teachers in how to recognise dyslexia.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para23"></a>We must try to cut down on the amount of paperwork. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, that it is a pity that the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, is not here today. The 1994 Act took a great step forward. It provided the statement; the legal document which showed that one required help and that it must be given. It may have been done slightly over-bureaucratically, but the provision must remain. With the best will in the world, we will occasionally need it.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para24"></a>Teachers must recognise the problem and pass it on to others who can act upon it. We must also give them sufficient resources to do so. The statement is still required. Greater integration in the classroom can be achieved with correct teaching and back-up procedure, but that cannot be achieved overnight. I advise the Government to have an easy hand with special schools. It is more important that a person acquires an education in a certain way. I hope that the Government can give an assurance about that because it is true of all disabilities.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para25"></a>I am slightly overrunning my time, but 10 minutes is much too short for a subject such as this. Unless we have an open attitude towards people with dyslexia being able to learn throughout life--that is, having support during junior, secondary and higher education--we will miss people. Furthermore, there must be support from the social services, because with the best will and the best teaching in the world there will always be a problem that has not been met.

<A NAME="71215-17_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, for initiating the debate. It has been impressive and moving because dyslexia causes much distress to many children and adults. We are all the better for hearing the experience of many noble Lords tonight. I congratulate my noble friend Lord Morris of Manchester on his maiden speech. In a debate of this kind, I do so with diffidence because my noble friend has made such a large contribution to tackling disablement in general. He has an understanding of the problems faced by those with various forms of disablement. He has such a long and distinguished record that I shall not rehearse it today. I am sure that all noble Lords in the Chamber are aware of it. I am glad that he is now able to give the benefit of his experience to this House.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para26"></a>We heard a number of moving speeches, one being from the noble Lord, Lord Addington. Other noble Lords outlined their own experience, that of their children or others they have known. It is clear that dyslexia is a major problem in our education system and in our society as a whole. I begin by assuring the noble Baroness and others of the Government's awareness of the problem. Our understanding of the condition is in no small part due to the work of the Dyslexia Institute and the British Dyslexia Association. Coincidentally, both organisations celebrate their silver anniversaries this year.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para27"></a>Perhaps I may deal first with the situation of schoolchildren. The noble Baroness asked how many children we can identify who are afflicted with dyslexia. We consider that 350,000 children are afflicted with some degree of dyslexia; that is, 20 per cent. of all special educational needs. It is not always easy to define and identify the problem and, as several noble Lords have said, it varies in severity. It is true that the term is still occasionally misused. There are still serious problems of identification. After all, children learn to read at different stages and early identification is not as easy as it sometimes sounds. I assure the House that the Government, local authorities and schools recognise the need to engage in early identification and recognise the importance of special attention to dyslexia among schoolchildren.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para28"></a>It is part of our general priority to raise the standards achieved by pupils in schools, and we have made clear that our vision is excellence for all children, including those who are disabled. We know that a lack of understanding about dyslexia and late diagnosis have meant that some children have not been given the extra help they need in order to achieve in the early stages of schooling. I argue that the general initiative that we are introducing to raise standards, taken together with new requirements--in particular, for the courses of initial teacher-training, which is vital, as the noble Baroness said--and the clear targets we have given for special educational needs in the Green Paper and elsewhere give a much higher profile than before and should ensure that many children with dyslexia and other reading difficulties have their problems addressed at an early stage.
<P>


<a name="column_487"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 487</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para29"></a>In relation to the teacher training curriculum, we have introduced a first national curriculum for initial teacher training which greatly heightens the attention of SEN issues. But we recognise that there is not time in initial training to develop the full range of skills required to deal with dyslexia or similar problems. Therefore, we attach importance to special educational needs in the induction year for teachers and in subsequent professional development for all teachers. In addition, we have asked the Teacher Training Agency to develop standards for special educational needs co-ordinators in all our schools.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para30"></a>We expect many children with special educational needs, with that kind of support, to meet our national targets for literacy and numeracy. We have proposed a substantial programme of initiatives to equip schools to meet that challenge and we are providing some resources for them to do so. Overall, some &#163;2.5 billion per year is spent on special educational needs--one-seventh of local education authorities' budgets. So far as possible, we want to encourage the shift in resources from expensive and often very late remediation to cost-effective early intervention.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para31"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morris, and others referred to the link between dyslexia and behavioural problems. I assure my noble friend that we accept that problems associated with basic literacy, including dyslexia problems, can lead to problem behaviour and sometimes to delinquency. The cost of such behaviour is obviously high and is an eloquent argument for the early identification of dyslexia and determined action to respond swiftly. I accept also what the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy, said, and that recently a link has been identified in some cases between dyslexia and other learning difficulties and low IQ. It is important that we recognise that a differential or disparate cognitive co-ordination applies at all levels of IQ and not simply to differentiate other above-average achievement as compared with reading achievement.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para32"></a>As part of the national literacy strategy this year, the pilot programme of summer literacy schools helped some 16,000 year six pupils whose reading age level was below level 4. That included a number of dyslexic children.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para33"></a>Our policies for pre-school children and those just beginning their school careers aim also to identify early problems. Children who later go on to develop dyslexia often have very early speech and language difficulties. Good communication skills are a prerequisite for literacy skills. Therefore, the Government have proposed research into effective provision of speech and language therapy for those children and are committed to looking at ways in which to improve the delivery of that service to children. Some of the dyslexic pilot schemes referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Newby, are directed to that end and we shall certainly give a commitment that we shall sustain those projects and, where they are successful, try to generalise best practice from them.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para34"></a>The introduction of a nationwide baseline assessment from September 1998 will also enable pupils and schools to benefit from a clear and consistent assessment <P>


<a name="column_488"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 488</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of children as soon as they first enter school. Baseline assessment will help teachers to identify those pupils who may need, for example, a targeted teaching strategy or further classroom-based assessment. Schemes must link effectively with the more detailed assessment of children with dyslexia and other special educational needs--processes which are suggested by the code of practice. I assure the noble Baroness that we shall be maintaining and, on the basis of the consultation, strengthening the existing code of practice.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para35"></a>In relation to baseline assessments, evidence from those assessments, together with other observations or assessments made by teachers, will help with the early identification of those with reading difficulties. Action is needed in that context also to feed back to children and in particular to parents what that assessment means and what needs to be done.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para36"></a>What is of paramount importance is that we ensure that specialist help is available for those who need it. In the Green Paper which the noble Viscount, Lord Allenby, and the noble Lord, Lord Annaly, have welcomed, we set out a fundamental review of special needs provision. We have proposed ways of moving resources currently spent on bureaucracy into the classroom. As a result of research commissioned by the department, we shall provide primary teachers with effective teaching, assessment and intervention strategies to help children with dyslexia.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para37"></a>Both the British Dyslexia Association and the Dyslexia Institute have done valuable work in these areas. The Dyslexia Institute has produced Units of Sound Multimedia, a CD-rom version of Units of Sound which is a proven multi-sensory learning resource with a 20 year development history. Another example is a joint Association for All Speech Impaired Children with the British Dyslexia Association project in collaboration with the UCL department of human communication sciences which is funded by Glaxo Wellcome plc. The project aims to provide professionals and parents with the means to improve language and literacy skills of pre-school and school age children. In addition, there are now a number of useful developments in information communications technology, which some noble Lords have mentioned, which provide new motivating and reward materials for pupils with dyslexia.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para38"></a>I now turn to the problems faced by adults with dyslexia. As many noble Lords have said, this is the area where frustration is really evident as the education system has failed to deal with such people. That is causing major social and personal problems. Obviously the needs of adults affected by dyslexia will be variable. Some need considerable help in basic skills while others may need relatively little additional support within the programme they are following.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para39"></a>As regards students, at present many further education colleges up and down the country are working hard to deliver the aim of inclusive learning which emanates from last year's Tomlinson Report. I illustrate that with an example of good practice at the East Berkshire College of Further Education. The college has great experience and expertise in dyslexia. It undertakes college-wide screening of new students for dyslexia <P>


<a name="column_489"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 489</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>on entry. At any one time the college uses a team of 150 part-time tutors to provide learning support for approximately 650 of its own students. It also undertakes assessments of dyslexia validated by external educational psychologists. Another institution with an excellent reputation in this area is Blackburn College. There are no doubt others which are familiar to noble Lords.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para40"></a>The Government also recognise the problem that students with learning difficulties can face when entering higher education. That is why the disabled students' allowance exists. This enables students to study with the support they require. Currently students who are eligible for the mandatory award can receive three allowances for specialist equipment and non-medical helpers and a general allowance of up to &#163;1,275 a year. Dyslexic students are eligible for help from those three allowances. Last year around 6,000 such allowances were awarded to students and the majority were for help with dyslexia. The disabled students' allowance provides real help for students. We plan to extend that help next year to even more students. We have accepted the Dearing Committee's recommendation that the means test for the allowance be abolished from next year.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para41"></a>There is also the question of the Employment Service. It is important to note that the Government have introduced the New Deal for the long-term unemployed. Special help will be available within that context for the disabled, including unemployed dyslexic people. People <P>


<a name="column_490"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column 490</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>with disabilities will receive help from the Employment Service in the New Deal project. Noble Lords have asked about amending the legislation of the DDA. Undoubtedly this is a question which my colleague, Mr. Alan Howarth, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, may well address in the recently announced disability task force.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para42"></a>Dyslexia is, of course, now recognised as a disability. Many adults also receive help through local specialist disability services which are part of the Employment Service. Disability employment advisers have specialist disability training and they have close links to provide assessment and employment rehabilitation, if required, through organisations which are able to provide help for people with dyslexia. To address the problem identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Darcy de Knayth, many people will be able to take up a career which is presently closed to them because of the immediate identification of their writing or reading needs.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215-17_para43"></a>Many other points were raised during the debate to which I do not have time to reply. I am sure the whole House will thank the noble Baroness, as I do, for tabling this Question, and other noble Lords for their contributions. We sincerely believe that the Government's proposals and the strategy that I have outlined will improve the quality of life of those afflicted by dyslexia and the many others who have special educational needs.

<P>
<A NAME="71215w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Donoughue: </B>   In November 1997 the Advisory Committee on Fisheries Management of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) advised that fishing mortality for North Sea cod has declined from record levels over the past two years and, if the current level of fishing mortality is maintained, the spawning stock biomass is expected to increase to within safe biological limits. Because of a large year class joining the fishery, maintaining the current level of fishing mortality would have resulted in a total allowable catch (TAC) of 153,000 tonnes in 1998. However, in order to continue the rebuilding of the North Sea cod stock, the Government pressed for the TAC to be set at the lower level of 140,000 tonnes and this figure has since been agreed in the annual consultations between the Community and Norway over the management of this and other North Sea stocks.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="71215w03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Williams of Mostyn: </B>   My right honourable friend the Home Secretary is today laying before Parliament the report submitted to him by the Police Complaints Authority. This has been made under Section 97 (2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the authority to make a report to the Secretary of State on any matters coming to its notice to which it considers that his attention should be drawn by reason of their gravity or other exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215w03_para0"></a>The report sets out the main findings resulting from an investigation carried out by officers from Kent Constabulary, under the supervision of the Police Complaints Authority, into the way in which the Metropolitan Police Service handled the murder of Stephen Lawrence.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215w03_para1"></a>The report concludes that the Metropolitan Police Service has committed substantial resources over several years to the investigation of this appalling crime, and that there is no doubt that a considerable amount of hard work has been undertaken. The report also concludes that the police operation undertaken immediately after the assault was well organised and effective and that there was no evidence of racist conduct by police officers. The report concludes, <P>


<a name="column_WA70"></a>

<B>15 Dec 1997 : Column WA70</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>however, that there were significant weaknesses, omissions and lost opportunities during the murder investigation. Those errors were not identified by the internal review carried out by the Metropolitan Police. As a result, subsequent attempts to solve the crime have been hampered.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215w03_para2"></a>The Metropolitan Police Commissioner has told my right honourable friend that he broadly accepts the findings of this initial report and now awaits the full report from the Kent investigation. He has told my right honourable friend that the Metropolitan Police has moved forward significantly in the investigation of major crime since 1993 but will address all of the shortcomings identified in the supervision and management of this investigation. They will also consider carefully the lessons to be learned.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215w03_para3"></a>This report and its conclusion will now be considered by the inquiry which we have established under the chairmanship of Sir William Macpherson of Cluny to inquire into the matters arising from the death of Stephen Lawrence in order particularly to identify the lessons to be learned for the investigation and prosecution of racially motivated crimes. The inquiry intends to begin public hearings in February.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215w03_para4"></a>The Police Complaints Authority report also identifies several issues which are relevant to the handling of serious crime by the police generally. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Crime Committee of the Association of Chief Police Officers are examining national standards in the investigation of major crime with a view to producing a model for the handling of major inquiries. During 1998, the inspectorate will also be conducting a thematic inspection of major crime investigation across the police service.
<P>

<A NAME = "71215w03_para5"></a>The Police Complaints Authority report also draws attention to the shortcomings in first aid skills possessed by the officers who were first to arrive at the scene of the murder. All chief constables have already been recommended to deal with this issue within their forces, by a report of a thematic inspection on officer safety by Her Majesty's Inspectorate which was published in October.

The period referred to in the question is the minimum recommendation of 20 years made by the trial judge in passing a sentence of life imprisonment. When the Secretary of State sets the tariff, he will consider carefully the trial judge's description of the circumstances of the murder, his and the Lord Chief Justice's recommendations on tariff and any representations submitted by the prisoner. The Secretary of State attaches considerable weight to the judicial recommendations on tariff in mandatory life-sentence cases but is not bound by them and may set tariffs lower or higher than those recommended.
