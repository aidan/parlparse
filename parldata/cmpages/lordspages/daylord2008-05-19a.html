In the 10 years which have passed since then the size of bank deposits held in Jersey alone has more than doubled and the whole question of tax evasion at the international level has become a much more acute issue, as we see with a number of issues in the European Union, in the OECD and elsewhere. Is it not time for the Government to revisit this issue?</p>

The issue is overwhelmingly to do with transparency. Although they are not as strong as we would like in terms of total compliance, there are signs that the Crown dependencies are making progress. We welcome that development.</p>

We look forward to the fact that the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man&#151;the Crown dependencies&#151;recognise the value of complying with the OECD requirements and that the Virgin Islands, the Turks and Caicos and others&#151;the overseas territories&#151;agree with the development of taxation information exchange agreements. Although the agreements are limited, there is some progress and some agreements are being signed, though not all of them with the United Kingdom. The OECD is a powerful assist in these terms and wants to see these tax havens sign international agreements on openness and transparency.</p>

My understanding&#151;he will correct me if I am wrong&#151;is that the OECD entered into an agreement with the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man in about 2001 or 2002 and that that agreement placed certain requirements on the Channel Islands. Has my noble friend been in touch with the OECD to see whether the Channel Islands has been living up to that agreement? It is the combination of the OECD and the international agreements that will bring about change in the Channel Islands on this issue. Although the constitutional issues are quite delicate, that is not to say that we should not be applying pressure through the OECD and others. But the issue is constitutional as well as financial.</p>

However, we are using the international structures to bring as much pressure to bear as we can in order that the Crown dependencies and, as I said, the overseas territories engage with openness on tax issues. Until we get to that stage, the kind of question that my noble friend Lord Barnett has addressed is a long way off in the future. However, we want to see openness and the information made available.</p>

The French are exercised about Monaco, but on the whole Monaco presents a problem that is overwhelmingly to do with individual rather than company and corporate taxation. Although the British Government are concerned about individuals&#146; obligations to meet proper taxation we also have anxieties about companies and corporations so far as some of our Crown dependencies and overseas territories are concerned.</p>

The measure does not involve closures or shifting primary care; it builds on the excellence of primary care that this country has enjoyed for many decades. The purpose of the polyclinics is to provide more integrated and personalised care, and does not mean shifting GPs away from their patients.

We have survey evidence that shows that employers are investing more in training and that they value the role of the further education college in providing high-quality service. For small to medium-sized employers, apprenticeships are a big commitment. As I said on the previous occasion when we discussed this, we are looking at piloting additional support for smaller employers so that they feel they can engage. We are establishing a national apprenticeship service to go out proactively and engage with employers, particularly small employers, so that we can continue our impressive role of doubling the number of people starting apprenticeships in recent years.</p>

We expect the relevant code to be the ACAS code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures in almost all cases, but we had originally drafted more widely to allow flexibility for other codes, present or future, to be taken into account where relevant to dispute resolution.</p>

<a name="80519-0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="0805195000090"></a>Clarifying a point raised by my noble friend Lady Turner in Committee, I should explain that there are currently six codes under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act, three issued by ACAS and three by the Secretary of State. Apart from the ACAS disciplinary and grievance code, only the ACAS code for time off for trade union duties has a small procedural element.</p>

<a name="80519-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="0805195000091"></a>As was said in Committee, ACAS plays an important and valued role in the resolution of workplace disputes. The drafting of this clause to refer to codes issued by either ACAS or the Secretary of State is certainly not intended to belittle the role of ACAS in any way. However, we recognise that concerns have been raised that the current drafting might create uncertainty for the parties as to which codes were relevant.</p>

<a name="80519-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="0805195000092"></a>Neither we nor ACAS would wish to lose the flexibility for ACAS to restructure its codes in the future, nor would we wish to exclude the possibility of a Secretary of State code issued in this area in the future being taken into account in adjusting awards, given that TULRCA allows the Secretary of State as well as ACAS to issue codes in employment relations generally, although I add that there is no such current intention.</p>

I will not go into the detail of the judgment, which was explored thoroughly at Second Reading on 7 January and on the third day of Grand Committee on 13 March. The European Court of Human Rights decided that the existing legislative framework governing the right of trade unions to expel or exclude members or would-be members on the basis of membership of a political party did not strike the right balance between the rights of unions and freedom of association and the rights of individuals based on conscience and belief. Therefore, it became incumbent on the United Kingdom to give effect to the judgment by introducing legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="0805195000101"></a>This debate, like the earlier debates to which I have referred will, in due course, be scrutinised by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which is responsible for supervising the execution of judgments of the European Court. How this House and the other place deal with this will no doubt be looked at by the Committee of Ministers in due course, to ensure that the judgment has been properly executed. I am grateful to Ministers and their officials for meeting with me and the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth, at our request, to discuss this. I am also grateful to have had the benefit of meeting with TUC lawyers, who have discussed their concerns with me in great detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="0805195000102"></a>It is difficult to strike the right balance. Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 the name of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway are about ensuring that a fair balance is struck. The problem is how to respect the vital autonomy of the trade unions on the one hand,  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1253"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1253</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and how to provide effective safeguards for individuals against the misuse of trade union powers on the other. Another problem is how to discourage bodies such as the BNP, which engage in vexatious and mischievous litigation, from harrying in an abusive way in order to further their political cause. Another factor is that to exclude or expel a trade union member or would-be member solely on the basis of their membership of a political party is a strong thing to do, especially if it leads to exceptional hardship.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="0805195000103"></a>The Joint Committee on Human Rights has looked at this question. The noble Lord, Lord Morris, might want to refer to that in speaking to his Amendment No. 36, which is the version of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. There is very little difference between that amendment and Amendment No. 33. Both are designed to introduce safeguards without violating union autonomy. I have always believed, in the course of these debates, that it is not in the interests of trade unions or their members to leave these matters to common law and the Queen&#146;s courts, as used to be the case before there was any statutory framework. When I was rather younger I used to appear before the courts in trade union cases. I was always uneasy about the way in which we obliged judges to intervene and provide remedies in these cases.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="0805195000104"></a>I also think that legislation should do its best not only to spell out the safeguards but also to ensure that as much as possible mischievous and vexatious litigation is avoided. The way in which the Government have approached this historically is, after the judgment, to publish a consultation paper with two options. The first was to do away with all safeguards and, essentially, leave it to the common law. The second was to produce adequate safeguards in the legislation. Our argument was that we should go for the second option and not the first.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="0805195000105"></a>It is fair to say that the TUC and the trade unions which gave their views during the consultation wanted there to be no statutory safeguards. If I were to be frivolous, I would say that power is delightful and that absolute power is absolutely delightful, and that, therefore, it is understandable to say there should be no safeguards at all. But that would not be a fair way of putting it and I fully respect the trade union position on this.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="0805195000106"></a>The way in which the substantive amendments in my name and that of the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth, operate, essentially, is to provide for three safeguards in a case where a trade union wants to exclude or expel on the basis of membership of a political party. These come out of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights rather than out of the air. The first safeguard is that the political party concerned, and membership of that party, should be in conflict with the values and ideals of the trade union itself. Obviously, if that is the case, that is the starting point to justify expelling or excluding.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="0805195000107"></a>Secondly, the decision should be taken in accordance with the rules of the trade union, including fairness, which, in any case, the common law courts would compel. The third safeguard is that the individual would not suffer exceptional hardship by reason of the expulsion, exclusion or related conduct by or on behalf of the union rather than anyone else in relation

Those are the safeguards to which all the amendments in the group seek to give effect. As far as we are concerned, everything depends on how the Minister responds. Perhaps, after we have heard his response, it will be possible to see where we are going. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_63"></a>
<a name="0805195000108"></a><a name="80519-0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80519-0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="0805195000332"></a>Lord Campbell of Alloway:</b> My Lords, I agree with what the noble Lord has just said, but not, of course, with what led up to it. Everything depends now on the response of the Minister. Up to this stage, he has not accepted the case as put forward by the noble Lord. I am not being critical for the sake of it. I am merely stating a fact. Columns 314 to 316 of <I>Hansard</I><I></I>for 13 March 2008&#151;the third day of Committee&#151;show that the Minister does not accept what is proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. In addition, he has had conversations and discussions&#151;about which we do not know now, but about which we shall know eventually, and probably, in the light of what is said in this debate&#151;about what the Minister proposes to do.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="0805195000109"></a>As I understand it from the bush telegraph, the Minister is considering whether he will introduce amendments which relate to safeguard amendments to Clause 18; that is, the amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord Lester, referred. According to my information, he is considering whether to do that and then, when he has done that, what he will do. This argument is somewhat sterile until we know what that is because we could divide on some things today, such as what happens to sailors not getting the right wages. However, we cannot divide on this today as we have no idea what the Government will put down on Third Reading.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="0805195000110"></a>The noble Lord was good enough to refer to my Amendments Nos. 31 and 32, which I know the Government are considering taking over in any event. They have not said that they will or that they will not, yet they acknowledge the intendment of the amendments, so if those are to be redrafted it will be up to the Government to do it. However, those are not safeguard amendments to Clause 18 but purely procedural ones, and there is a distinction&#151;although, as we will see in a moment, the two overlap.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="0805195000111"></a>There is a fundamental issue not just between the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and myself but between the noble Lord and the Government. That is whether Clause 18 is wholly effective in affording conformability of our domestic employment law with the conventions in accordance with the Strasbourg court&#146;s decision on ASLEF. I will not go into technicalities, but it referred to certain provisions of our domestic law as being incompatible. Those provisions have to be got rid of, as there is an obligation on the Government to seek conformity.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="0805195000112"></a>Clause 18, in the opinion of Government&#151;and in my respectful opinion, which really does not matter as much as theirs&#151;is wholly effective, requisite and sufficient for its purpose of seeking conformity. If that is right, then the Government&#146;s view as expressed in the passage that I quoted from day three in Committee is, again, right; there is in fact no need at all for these safeguard amendments, as they are called. If that is so then the fundamental question raised, on which options should  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1255"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1255</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>be implemented, flies out of the window. None of us knows what is really going on until we know what the Government will decide to do. The Government may wish to formulate their own concept of a safeguard amendment&#151;I do not know&#151;but their concept of Amendments Nos. 31 and 32 is fundamentally a question of drafting. As everyone knows, I am not a draftsman and I make that inevitable qualification.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="0805195000113"></a>Amendments Nos. 33 and 36 have to be considered with some care in another context: do they distort, as I suggest they do, the proper balance of the ordained ASLEF procedures in favour of the trade unions? If there is no need for the trade unions to be protected, as was once suggested at some passage&#151;I do not have it in mind but the noble Lord, Lord Lester, will know where he referred to protection of the trade unions&#151;and the Minister assured the Grand Committee that the trade unions were in no need of such protection, that is another matter which has to be taken into account in this context.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="0805195000114"></a>I shall not discuss the nature of the balance because it is related to Amendment No. 31, which is in the last group of amendments and it would be wrong of me to pre-empt it.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_29"></a><a name="0805195000115"></a>Another aspect of these safeguard amendments is the tightening-up of ordained procedures in a way which is wide of the substantial flexibility with which they are to be implemented on the facts and circumstances of each case and on a balance as between the respective convention rights of the trade unions to set their rules and choose their membership, as acknowledged in ASLEF, and the rights of the individual who wishes to join or remain in a trade union. A wide ambit of special, ordained procedures has to be followed. If they are not followed, back you all go to another court in Strasbourg. That is mandatory.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="0805195000116"></a>Professor Wedderburn, who has much more experience than I, gave a warning about tightening up what are supposed to be flexible procedures&#151;I shall not go into the details today&#151;but that warning appears to have been not heeded in the context of membership of a political party. You only have to look at the amendments passing through Grand Committee to see that, with every effort to amend, we are starting to move away from, or tighten up, what is a flexible procedure, and this will inevitably engender more litigation.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="0805195000117"></a>This is no time for a long speech. I have been too long already. I have tried to do justice, without adding my version to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Lester. The truth of the matter is that until we know what the Government are going to do, there is no constructive purpose in saying any more. I would like to mention one problem; I am not being critical of my party but I seek clarification. Those on my Front Bench in Grand Committee said that they strongly favoured the safeguard amendment to Clause 18 tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. I oppose it. I am not saying who is right or wrong again, but the party to which I adhere and I were not in agreement. If you look at the Marshalled List, with Amendments Nos. 34, 35 and 37, my party has actually supported in principle Amendments Nos. 33 and 36. Whether it meant to do so or not is neither here nor there. There is plenty of

In a sense, it is a point against me that my own party does not agree, but on the other hand, one has to argue one&#146;s case, even if there are a few warts on it.</p>

At that stage I drew attention to one of my objections to the original amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. I am afraid, however, that I still have problems with the amendment. I see the noble Lord nods; he realises that I do. The problem that I have is with proposed new paragraph (b) which says,</p>
<ul><a name="0805195000241"></a>&#147;the individual would not suffer exceptional hardship by reason of the expulsion or exclusion or any related conduct by or on behalf of the union in relation to his employment&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805195000219"></a>As I said in Committee, we do not have closed-shop agreements any more so we no longer have the power to take into consideration whether a decision of that kind will result in exceptional hardship. Generally speaking, unions now do not have the power that they once had to inflict exceptional hardship by means of withdrawal of employment and so on. This is made quite clear in the amendment, which says, &#147;is permitted only if&#148;. So the union would have to take account of this before it came to a decision to expel someone under the terms of the Bill. As I said, if I had to choose between the Bill and the amendment, I would choose the Bill as it stands. It is possible, as has been indicated by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, that the Government will be prepared to come up with a compromise, but my objection arises from imposing on the unions in proposed new paragraph (b)&#151;</p>

The notion of exceptional hardship comes out of paragraph 52 of the judgment of the court. If there is no exceptional hardship, the union has no restriction under that heading. I accept that, without the closed shop, the situation where there may be exceptional hardship will be much rarer than otherwise. If exceptional hardship is not inflicted, it does not matter; if it is, it violates the spirit of paragraph 52 of the judgment, which is why it is there.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="0805195000129"></a>As we made clear in Committee, we on these Benches are not exactly happy with the ASLEF judgment. We are not happy that trade unions should be able to expel or exclude people solely on the basis of their membership of a legitimate political party. This sound principle was the reason for the protected status of political party membership in the first place. We all know that some so-called legitimate political parties have deeply unpleasant policies. The party whose member&#146;s exclusion led to this judgment is a fine example of when a trade union might dislike a member signing up to it. However, trade unions already have sufficient powers to expel someone if their behaviour is so incompatible with trade union principles.

<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="0805195000130"></a>As currently drafted, Clause 18 gives the trade unions far more power than is desirable and is more than the judgment necessitates. We would like to see the power drawn more tightly in order to protect against unfair or improper pressure being put on members of political parties other than the one that trade union officials prefer. We have a great deal of sympathy with the concerns behind the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lester. The expulsion of a member should be allowable only if it is undertaken fairly under the trade union&#146;s rules. Due concern should be given to the adverse consequences of such an expulsion. As the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lady Perry highlights, membership of a trade union can bring significant financial support in the form of health insurance, paid positions and so on.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="0805195000131"></a>Our Amendments Nos. 33, 35 and 37 highlight two concerns, the first of which is that only membership of registered political parties is considered excludable. There are many political organisations and pressure groups, membership of which should continue to be exempt. Secondly, we strongly object to the idea that former membership should be held against a trade union member; that smacks of retrospective punishment. Even if the resignation from an objectionable political party was recent, such a resignation shows that the membership of the trade union was more important to the person concerned than membership of the political party. Who is to decide whether a member&#146;s resignation was fair?</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="0805195000135"></a>I will seek not to rehearse the arguments and the history of how we got here, except to say that I do not take lightly, and I fully appreciate, the Government&#146;s difficulties in seeking to strike the right balance between maintaining free democratic trade unions on the one hand and protecting and defending the rights of the individual on the other. Nevertheless, the amendments address some overall deficiencies in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="0805195000136"></a>The proposals in the Bill are far-reaching. The most fundamental sanction that can be taken against a trade unionist&#151;the ultimate sanction&#151;is to deny that individual the right to belong to a trade union. Therefore, such action cannot and should not be taken lightly; it can and should only be taken with due regard for natural justice and, of course, the rights of the individual. Neither Amendment No. 33 nor Amendment No. 36 attacks the fundamental principles and substance of the Bill. As has rightly been said, if we were debating this without the background of what was said in the context of the European Court, we might have started at a different point. The amendments seek to ensure that we have proper procedures and safeguards built on the principles of natural justice. It is ironic that the Bill lays out a course of action that would automatically be in a tribunal if an employee was dismissed and lost his or her employment. Therefore, the amendments seek to argue that we should address the procedures and ensure natural justice, as well as that the rights of the individual must always be protected.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="0805195000137"></a>The Government argue that, because the closed shop no longer applies, a member who is expelled is therefore not subjected or exposed to any significant detriment. I disagree with that; I take a different view. I have here the schedule of benefits from my union, which runs to about 14 primary benefits, up to incapacity benefit for an accident at work. But the most important benefit that some sections of our membership would enjoy would be legal representation. If a lorry driver is charged under the Road Traffic Act and has to appear in court without proper representation, he or she could end up losing his or her licence&#151;and if you lose your licence as a lorry driver, it follows that you lose your job. For me, that would be a significant detriment. I would go a step further by saying that it could represent substantial hardship. That should be taken into consideration. There are many other examples of benefits, such as two weeks&#146; convalescence in a convalescent home after a period of illness, but I will not detain the House further on the range of benefits that could by lost by individuals in my union. I will only say that my judgment is that some of these circumstances could be regarded as exceptional.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="0805195000138"></a>I recognise that, in terms of safeguards for the individual, the Bill is predicated on remedies. I am not against remedies in proven situations but, in circumstances such as these, the Government owe protection and not remedies to the citizen. Remedies are last resorts. It is said that it is open to an aggrieved individual to go to a certification officer or an industrial tribunal, or to go to the civil courts, but that is not the foundation on which we as a nation have historically built our industrial  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1260"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1260</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>relations or the road to accessing justice. I therefore hope the Minister will clearly indicate a pathway for protection rather than a pathway to remedy.</p>

<a name="80519-0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="0805195000139"></a>In every industrial relations case where a worker&#146;s job or livelihood is at risk he is entitled to a very basic and fair procedure. That is why we in your Lordships&#146; House believe it important to state clearly that a person who is to be excluded or, more importantly, expelled should be told the case to be answered. He should also be told the time and place of the hearing. Representation is an important facet of our form of civil justice, but I have read nothing in the Bill about individuals who may feel a deep sense of grievance. How do they put that right? I would like to hear about the appeals procedure. If that does not appear in the Bill, the relevant codes of practice through the certification officer or, preferably, ACAS should make it absolutely clear.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="0805195000140"></a>I believe that the denial of someone&#146;s trade union membership should test those with the power and authority to take that decision. I see no test whatever attached to the trade unions. What test have they got to meet? It is important. My noble friend Lord Lester of Herne Hill referred to the consideration of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. The Joint Committee has considered the matter but has not gone beyond the report that it published. However, there are serious doubts whether there is a breach of the Human Rights Act. There are concerns that Articles 9, 10 and 11 may well be breached. Those articles cover freedom of conscience, expression and assembly. I ask the Minister to have another look at whether the human rights situation is adequately addressed.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="0805195000141"></a>In conclusion, I hope the Minister will say what criteria the decision to exclude or expel will be based on. How can a trade union be accountable for the decision? We must all be accountable for our actions. Finally, what procedures will be put in place to ensure that natural justice and legal redress are available to the individual?</p>

It is on the supplementary list for the simple reason that I thought for a long time that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, covered sufficiently my concerns about this issue. However, the more I thought about the phrase &#147;exceptional hardship&#148;, the more that I thought that it was a rather sterner requirement of proof than I would have wished. My amendment does not take anything from the noble Lord&#146;s words, &#147;exceptional hardship&#148;, but adds the words, &#147;any financial disadvantage&#148;.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="0805195000145"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morris, cited the example of the lorry driver who might lose his licence and, therefore, his livelihood. My examples are from the profession that I know well: teaching. It is little realised that, in the last year for which statistics were published, more than 1,800 teachers were accused of either sexual harassment or physical violence towards children, of which accusations less than 1 per cent were afterwards upheld. That is a huge number of people, whose lives were disrupted terribly. Often their marriages fell apart; they were denied access to their work for long periods while their case ground through the courts; and so on. It is a very serious matter. Now let us imagine the financial hardship of their having to pay for legal representation. As long as they were members of a recognised trades union, as the noble Lord said in his example of the lorry driver, they were entitled to free representation, which was paid for by their union. I remember being told when leaving university that I should join up to the teachers&#146; union fast. In those days we did not think of sexual harassment, but in case I was accused of hitting a child, the union would represent me and it would cost me nothing. These are important financial benefits, quite apart from health insurance and everything else. I quoted the statistics about teachers because that is the world I know. The financial benefit of free representation with the union&#146;s financial help enabled people to survive. Let us remember that 99 per cent of cases proved to be blatantly unjust and only 1 per cent of cases were upheld.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="0805195000146"></a>As has been rightly pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, the union would have to look ahead at the point of excluding someone to see whether such exclusion would cause &#147;exceptional hardship&#148;. I hope that my more modest words, &#147;any financial disadvantage&#148;, would be clearer. We are all at risk of sympathising too much with the trades union and not enough with the individual because the case to which the European Court judgment gave rise was against people with whom we have very little sympathy. They were not very nice people in their political views, but it can happen to others whose views might be less distasteful. The rights of individuals and those of trades unions, as the later amendments of my noble friend Lord Campbell emphasise, must be got right in this legislation. My modest additional amendment, which would point out the financial disadvantage that loss of union membership could bring, might help us in our debate.</p>

Clause 18&#151;formerly Clause 17&#151;has aroused much debate throughout the Bill&#146;s passage to date. The amendments give me a welcome opportunity to explain how the Government intend to reconcile, as far as we can, the differing views that have been expressed. It has been well worth having such a debate at this stage.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="0805195000148"></a>I shall start with Amendment No, 33, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and talk to the others in the group as well. All the amendments relate directly to Clause 18. A similar amendment was moved by the noble Lord in Committee, and this latest version certainly addresses one of the specific points that my noble friend Lord Jones raised in that debate&#151;that the effect of the previous amendment was not restricted to exclusions or expulsions on grounds of political party membership alone, but included any decision to deny membership based on a person&#146;s conduct. Although that was not the noble Lord&#146;s intention, I am grateful to him for drafting a new amendment, which takes note of that point.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="0805195000149"></a>We also made it clear in Committee that we wished to engage further with the noble Lord and his advisers before Report to see whether we could agree the way ahead. I thank him for making himself available. We have had detailed discussions with him at both ministerial and official level. My noble friend Lord Morris of Handsworth has also attended these meetings, which included a meeting with the honourable Pat McFadden MP, the Minister responsible for employment relations, and I think that everyone understands the position better as a result. I believe that significant progress has been achieved. The noble Lord has already said that his Amendment No. 33 is informed by the detailed discussions that he and my officials have held in the weeks and months since Committee.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="0805195000150"></a>In a spirit of compromise&#151;noble Lords have wanted to know the Government&#146;s view on this since the start of the debate&#151;we have offered to introduce an amendment to this Bill that would centre on the second of the two options presented in last year&#146;s consultation document. Noble Lords will recall these two options. We know that this approach, option B, is preferred by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, and by many others who oppose the current version of Clause 18, which is based on what we describe as the deregulatory option A. We intend to present the government amendment at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_49"></a><a name="0805195000151"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Lester, made it known that he wanted three types of safeguard to be clearly reflected in any government amendment. These safeguards are expressed in proposed new paragraph (a) of his present amendment and in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the new subsection 4C that proposed new paragraph (b) of his amendment would insert. Let me assure the House and the noble Lord that the planned government amendment contains these three categories of safeguard. The second of these safeguards concerns the procedures that unions follow when excluding or expelling members on these grounds. I know that procedural fairness has been a concern of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1263"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1263</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Alloway. I am very grateful to him for having met my noble friend Lord Jones, the Minister and myself during these proceedings. I hope that our proposed amendment, when it appears, will satisfy him, too.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_50"></a><a name="0805195000152"></a>The Government need to assure themselves that each safeguard is appropriately expressed in terms that are neither too strong nor too weak. This takes time and is the reason why we could not table our amendment for consideration today. We want to ensure that our amendment is clear and provides the level of union autonomy that the ECHR judgment requires. It should also impose reasonable requirements on trade unions and reflect the principles of better regulation. In particular, we want to minimise the scope for politically inspired litigants to use imprecise wording as a basis for making vexatious complaints to the employment tribunal. I believe that the House shares this view.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_51"></a><a name="0805195000153"></a>I will not go into detail today. If the noble Lord were to press Amendment No. 33, we would be concerned that it does not fully meet these tests, although we think that it goes a long way in the right direction. We continue to work on alternative wording and we will continue to consult the noble Lord during that process. I hope that we will be able to share the amendment with other noble Lords, including the opposition Front Bench, the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway and other noble Lords&#151;I am not discriminating between any of them&#151;perhaps later this week, so that they can see our proposed amendment before it is tabled. If possible, we would like to see a compromise amendment, commanding the broad if not universal consent of this House, going to the other place, where the Bill has yet to be considered.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_52"></a><a name="0805195000154"></a>We have held discussions with the TUC about the same issues and we will continue to talk to it. The TUC has also made it clear that it opposes any move to legislate for option B but, when our compromise appears, we will have to see what attitudes are taken by all parties in this House and outside. I believe that there is every prospect of finding a satisfactory compromise in time for Third Reading. Therefore, when the noble Lord comes to decide what to do with his amendment, I urge him to be good enough to withdraw it so that further consultation can occur.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="0805195000155"></a>The other amendments in this group were spoken to and therefore I need to respond to them, but I shall do so as briefly as I can. Amendment No. 34 would ensure that trade unions could not exclude or expel a person in any circumstances on the basis of his or her former political party membership, the vital word being &#147;former&#148;. I am afraid we believe that this would limit still further a union&#146;s autonomy in setting and applying its rules&#151;the very point that the European Court of Human Rights was trying to uphold. There was no hint in the ECHR judgment that a limitation of union autonomy of this type was necessary or called for.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="0805195000156"></a>Of course, we understand the argument advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Henley, that individuals may change their views and should not be punished for once holding a particular set of political beliefs. I am  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1264"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1264</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sure that unions will be alive to that point and will not wish to deny membership to a person who, from their viewpoint, is a reformed character. However, there will be cases where that has not occurred. As we know, people frequently move into and out of party membership but their political outlook remains unchanged. In fact, their views can harden. Unions should therefore be capable of acting against such individuals, subject to the general safeguards provided by option B.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="0805195000157"></a>Amendment No. 34A was spoken to by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, and I thank her, as I did in Committee, for her part in this. However, we fear that the amendment would widen too far the test in Amendment No. 33 relating to the scale of the detriment which must occur in order to make it unlawful to expel or exclude. Amendment No. 33 refers deliberately to &#147;exceptional hardship&#148;&#151;a term used within the key judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. Amendment No. 34A would widen that to include &#147;any financial disadvantage&#148;. We absolutely understand where the noble Baroness is coming from on that. She echoes a point made by my noble friend Lord Morris: the fact that there is no longer a closed shop does not mean that there is no financial disadvantage in not being a member of a trade union.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="0805195000158"></a>Our problem with the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment is that it would, in effect, prevent a union expelling or excluding on those grounds if even one penny of financial detriment resulted. I am afraid that from a practical point of view that goes too far. It would virtually reduce union autonomy in this area to zero and it might well mean&#151;although I shall not be absolutely decisive about this&#151;that we would fail to comply with the European Court&#146;s judgment. Therefore, I am afraid that we cannot support her amendment.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="0805195000159"></a>Amendment No. 35 seeks to define what type of organisation qualifies as a political party. We have not had a definition of this kind since these provisions were first introduced in 1993. I have not been aware that any problems have arisen as a result, so I want to advance the case that we should be very cautious about adding wording of this kind to the text. We think that the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Henley, contains a specific and serious problem; namely, that political parties are defined as UK ones only. Many members of British trade unions are foreign nationals and their numbers, we are delighted to say, are increasing. Some of those individuals will be members of political parties in their own countries, and of course political extremism can be found in all countries. Trade unions must be free to take action against such individuals, subject, again, to the sort of general safeguards that option B provides. Therefore, we cannot support that amendment either.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="0805195000160"></a>Amendment No. 36 is in the name of my noble friend Lord Morris of Handsworth, and many of the arguments that I addressed in relation to Amendment No. 33, which I know he supports, apply to his amendment. I hope he will be satisfied with what I have said about the Government attempting to come up with a consensual compromise on this.

<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="0805195000161"></a>I shall deal with the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth. The report of the Joint Committee on Human Rights underscores our view that this complex issue requires careful drafting of a legislative solution, to ensure that we comply with the European court&#146;s judgment while avoiding the potential for unwelcome side effects. As I stated in response to the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Lester, we are actively engaging with him to find a suitable compromise, and I hope that approach satisfies not only my noble friend but the House.</p>

I particularly thank the Minister for the detailed and careful way he replied to the various points that have been raised. I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth, who was kind enough to refer to me as his noble friend. I regard myself as his friend.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="0805195000163"></a>This is a matter that transcends parties. It is cross-party, and one of the great virtues of this House is that it is possible, on issues of this kind, to deal with matters beyond political tribalism. I also commend the noble Lord, Lord Henley, and the Official Opposition for the conspicuously fair and moderate way in which they approached this matter during our debates. I am grateful for that.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="0805195000164"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Morris, referred to a pathway for protection. As I understand what was said by the Minister, he has given an assurance to the House that the three general safeguards in my amendment and the amendment tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Morris, will be translated into proper statutory language by parliamentary counsel before Third Reading. I fully appreciate the complexity of that task, and I entirely accept that the Government will give effect to that assurance by producing language before Third Reading that will incorporate those three safeguards. That will be a victory for Parliament, this House and common sense. I am reminded of what Isabella said in &#147;Measure for Measure&#148;&#151;that,</p>
<ul><a name="0805195000242"></a>&#147;it is excellent</ul><ul><a name="0805195000012"></a>To have a giant&#146;s strength! But it is tyrannous</ul><ul><a name="0805195000013"></a>To use it like a giant&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805195000220"></a>There are situations where Governments, trade unions or other bodies may have a giant&#146;s strength, but it is tyrannous to abuse those powers. These safeguards are designed, as the noble Lord, Lord Morris, indicated, to write protection into the Bill as well as remedies. I believe it is entirely probable, and maybe even certain, that we will reach a consensual compromise at Third Reading, having made good use of the procedures of this House in Grand Committee and now. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="0805195000168"></a>Amendments Nos. 3 and 5 ensure that determinations without a hearing in employment tribunals can be made only where there is express consent in writing from all the parties, save for those circumstances in which a default judgment can be issued without a hearing, as happens at present. Over 70 per cent of consultees in our dispute resolution consultation favoured the implementation of such a mechanism. These views are summarised in our response to this consultation, which we are publishing today. I am arranging for copies to be placed in the Libraries.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="0805195000169"></a>Powers have existed since 2002 to enable regulations to provide for determinations without a hearing in employment tribunals. At present, this only happens in circumstances where the respondent does not present a response&#151;or a valid response&#151;in the proceedings, where the case is not contested, or where the claim is withdrawn and the proceedings dismissed. These are known as default judgments.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="0805195000170"></a>Clause 4 seeks to circumscribe further this power to make such regulations, as my noble friend Lord Bach described in Grand Committee. In this context, it is important that the power is clearly described and limited. Clause 4, as originally drafted, would establish in law that determinations without a hearing could take place only where there is consent from the parties, but that consent could be either express or deemed. It would also&#151;and this was not the intention&#151;remove the tribunals&#146; ability to issue default judgments in circumstances where no response is submitted and where the case is uncontested.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="0805195000171"></a>We debated the consent issue in Grand Committee on 4 February and my noble friend Lord Bach undertook to consider further the case for requiring the expression of consent to be made in writing. He also undertook to reconsider the drafting of the second arm of Clause 4, which would permit determinations without a hearing to take place on the basis of deemed consent where parties had been given the opportunity to request a hearing of their cases but had not done so. My noble friend Lord Wedderburn firmly argued that deemed consent was not an appropriate mechanism in this situation. Other noble Lords expressed similar concerns. I subsequently met him and my noble friend Lady Turner to discuss their concerns on this point. The House will join me in wishing him a speedy recovery, as he cannot be here today.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="0805195000172"></a>On reflection, we are persuaded that it is appropriate that the law should limit the order-making power enabling determinations without a hearing to situations where express consent in writing has been secured from all the parties. This will give certainty that such an important decision&#151;to waive the right to a hearing&#151;has been made by all the parties. This amendment therefore removes from the Bill the provision that would have enabled regulations to establish deemed consent as a sufficient basis upon which to proceed with a written determination. It also carves out default judgments from the requirement for consent, since clearly consent could not be obtained from both parties in the circumstances I described earlier where default judgments are issued.</p>

<a name="80519-0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="0805195000173"></a>It is our intention to consult publicly, later this year, on regulations providing a legal framework for enabling determinations without a hearing in five jurisdictions&#151;

Determinations without a hearing, in such cases, will only be possible where all parties consent, and an employment judge, considering the papers, considers that no hearing is required to make an informed determination in that particular case. I beg to move.</p>

We heard some discussion about Clause 4 in Committee. We were concerned at what appeared to be an increase in the number of cases of a judge sitting alone without lay members. We were concerned that this might indicate a desire to phase out the work of lay members on tribunals, but we accept the assurance given to us by the Minister that the Government recognise the valuable role of lay members and are fully committed to the continuation of the existing tripartite structure.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80519-0005.htm"/>


<a name="80519-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="0805195000175"></a>Therefore, we are not pursuing this issue further, but there remains concern about the circumstances in which cases can be determined without a hearing. It is important that vulnerable people understand what is involved and are able to make a decision in their own best interests. They have an entitlement to have their case heard by a tribunal that includes lay members and, if they waive such rights, they must know what they are doing.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="0805195000176"></a>My noble friend Lord Wedderburn has drawn attention to a recent European Court of Human Rights decision&#151;DH v Czech Republic&#151;which deals precisely with the waiver of a right. The judgment is so important that I shall quote it. It says that,</p>
<ul><a name="0805195000243"></a>&#147;under the Court&#146;s case-law, the waiver of a right guaranteed by the Convention&#148;&#151;</ul>
<p><a name="0805195000221"></a>the European Convention on Human Rights&#151;</p>
<ul><a name="0805195000244"></a>&#147;in so far as such a waiver is permissible&#151;must be established in an unequivocal manner, and be given in full knowledge of the facts, that is to say on the basis of informed consent ... and without constraint&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805195000222"></a>That is precisely what our Amendment No. 6 says. We say that,</p>
<ul><a name="0805195000245"></a>&#147;&#145;consent&#146; means agreement which is&#151;</ul>(a) unequivocal,(b) in writing,(c) given without constraint by any person, and(d) given on the basis of informed consent&#148;.<a name="time_10"></a>
<a name="80519-0005.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="0805195000259"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="0805195000177"></a>Furthermore, Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights makes it clear that everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing and that judgment should be pronounced publicly. That is the purpose of another of our amendments in this group. We also believe that the parties concerned should have a right to know about the qualifications, background and career of the person who will be charged with hearing the case individually so that an informed opinion can be made. Again, that is the gist of one of our amendments in this group.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="0805195000178"></a>The government amendment agrees with us that consent should be in writing, as we heard from the Minister. Our amendment goes beyond that and, therefore, I prefer it. I have no objection to government Amendment No. 5, but I am rather puzzled by what the latter half means. Proposed new subsection (3AB) says that,</p>
<ul><a name="0805195000246"></a>&#147;if he presents a response ... in accordance with the ... regulations, it is not accepted&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805195000223"></a>Who does not accept it? Does it mean the claimant? If so, I am quite happy about it. However, I wonder who else might not accept it. Perhaps that could be explained in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="0805195000179"></a>Generally speaking, I commend our amendments to the House. We have attempted to deal with the problems that could face a vulnerable person and we want to make sure that he or she is in a position to make an informed decision. As a former trade union official, I think that it would be simpler if everyone belonged to a union, as that would mean that they were entitled to professional advice and to representation. Unfortunately, that is not the case everywhere, so I believe that we as Members of this House have to take action to try to protect the rights of vulnerable people. For these reasons, I commend our amendments to the Government, who I hope will consider what we have said. We want to add to their amendments, which we do not think go quite far enough.</p>

I am also grateful to the Government for responding to the amendment that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, moved on the first day, I think, in Committee. Let me say how sad we are that the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, cannot be here today. He wrote to me about this problem and the ECHR judgment in the case of DH v Czech Republic. The Government have been correct in responding to the noble Lord&#146;s point in this, so all we can say is that we are grateful for that. I am sorry that we will not be seeing the noble Lord later, as I was hoping to have his support on an amendment of mine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="0805195000182"></a>Amendment No. 4 will be effected through our Amendment No. 5. Amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8 would introduce additional legislative requirements for any written determination procedure. These are unnecessary and would in some cases add extra complication, complexity and cost. Amendment No. 6 proposes a list of criteria for establishing whether consent to a written determination is valid. Our amendment ensures that consent would have to be unequivocal and in writing. That is what is required by the case of DH and Others v the Czech Republic. &#147;Without constraint&#148; implies an assumption that parties could be subject to pressure to choose written determination. We do not believe that that will be an  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1269"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1269</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>issue. Parties will have to consent expressly to the procedure. If they do not, they will proceed to a hearing, as is currently the case. This element of the amendment is not required.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="0805195000183"></a>This brings us to informed consent. We shall ensure that parties receive sufficient information to make an informed decision about whether to consent to a determination without a hearing. We do not agree, however, that &#147;informed consent&#148; should be defined as &#147;subject to receipt of independent advice&#148;. Independent advice is defined in Section 288 of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. That provision relates to a decision by parties to accept a compromise settlement, which would result in the parties forgoing their right to a determination of their case by an employment tribunal. The safeguard is appropriate in those circumstances. Consent to written determination is not analogous, since the case would be determined by an employment judge. Parties will have sufficient time to seek advice on consent&#151;a minimum of three weeks, as we said in Grand Committee. It should be open to parties to decide not to seek advice, which may have time and cost consequences, if they so wish.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="0805195000184"></a>Amendment No. 7 would establish by regulation that the judge&#146;s decision in cases determined without a hearing would be notified to the parties and the public within two days of the decision. That is unnecessary. Currently, when a hearing takes place, a judgment with reasons is usually given orally at the end of the hearing to the parties and any members of the public present in the hearing room. A written copy of the judgment is either sent to the parties after the hearing or given to them on the day. Written reasons are given, if requested by a party, either at the hearing or within 14 days. While the Tribunals Service has internal targets for sending out judgments after a hearing, these are not set out in regulations. I can, however, assure noble Lords that the Tribunals Service acts quickly to notify the parties of the outcome, regularly exceeding internal targets. The Government do not believe that it is necessary to specify a target within regulations. In cases determined without a hearing, the Tribunals Service would routinely send the judgment to parties as soon as it was made. Any further incursion of regulations would, I hope noble Lords will agree, increase, rather than decrease, the red tape that employers suffer.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="0805195000185"></a>Amendment No. 8 would restrict the determination of individual cases to a specific judge by imposing a legal requirement for the parties to be advised of the name of the judge who would determine their case, and for that information to be provided before the parties provide consent. This would create an unprecedented provision, not seen anywhere else across the judicial landscape, for the parties to have a right of approval of the judge who would determine their case. That, surely, cannot be right. We have full confidence in the ability of any judge to operate written determination procedures appropriately. Employment judges are appointed following a robust appointment process which ensures that they have the required experience and judicial capacity to judge in the complex jurisdictions that make up the canon of employment law.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="0805195000186"></a>This amendment would also effectively restrict the designation of single cases to single judges and stifle the Tribunals Service&#146;s ability efficiently to organise and manage cases in the most effective, expeditious and, presumably, cost-effective way. For instance, if the designated judge were unavailable to proceed with the determination, through illness or incapacity, it would not be possible to transfer the case to an alternative judge without beginning the notification and consent process all over again. How is that for causing further delay, further cost, further confusion and further frustration? That could hardly be in the interests of the parties as it would simply introduce delay and unnecessary bureaucracy into the proceedings. The Government believe that their amendment to Clause 4 which we discussed previously provides all the safeguards necessary to ensure access to justice for all parties concerned.</p>

I argued that no allegation would go on the public record without the employer having an equal opportunity for his full and considered response to be made available at the same time. Since Grand Committee, however, the charity which I shall refer to as the whistleblowers&#146; charity&#151;formerly known as Public Concern at Work, of which I am patron&#151;has been in touch with officials of the Minister&#146;s department as well as with the CBI and the Engineering Employers&#146; Federation to see if a way could be found through the disagreements by an amendment conceived perhaps on a different basis.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="0805195000196"></a>I would strongly argue that the present position is extremely unsatisfactory, because it so happens that 70 per cent of claims brought under the Act are shrouded in secrecy owing to the fact that they are settled rather than determined after a tribunal hearing. At present, regulations emanating from my noble friend&#146;s department&#151;or under its old guise as the Department of Trade and Industry&#151;prevent publication of any information about claims for wrongful dismissal based on an employee being dismissed for disclosing wrongdoing in the workplace unless the claim is disposed of after a tribunal hearing. But if it is disposed of in a settlement that has been reached in private, there is no way of getting access to the papers. Unscrupulous employers can therefore buy off a whistleblower rather than address and deal with the malpractice that he has brought to the employer&#146;s attention. Nobody will know about the wrongdoing that has been brought to their attention. It also means that an unscrupulous employee is encouraged to bring spurious Public Interest Disclosure Act claims as a tactic, perhaps to secure a higher settlement than he would otherwise get.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_88"></a><a name="0805195000197"></a>The secrecy surrounding that great majority of 70 per cent of public interest disclosure claims also means that no one&#151;no interested third party, no regulator, not even a Minister of the Crown&#151;can find out from employment tribunal records what claims may have been brought relating to, in recent examples, mismanagement at Northern Rock or the problem of C. difficile at a particular hospital.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="0805195000198"></a>My approach in the present amendment, which is deliberately different from the one that I tabled in Committee, is to transplant the general Civil Procedure Rules of the High Court into the world of employment tribunals. In recent years the Government have sought more and more to emphasise that tribunal proceedings, whether on employment or otherwise, are part of   


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1272"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1272</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the independent judicial system and not of the Administration. It therefore seems appropriate that the Civil Procedure Rules of the High Court should be adapted for Public Interest Disclosure Act claims in an employment tribunal.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="0805195000199"></a>Under those rules, and I speak only of particular relevant ones, the general rule would be that a member of the public could obtain a copy of the employee&#146;s statement of case for wrongful dismissal. But&#151;and this is most important bearing in mind the Minister&#146;s objection in Grand Committee to which I referred&#151;as the statement of case will contain unproven allegations, because it is the employee&#146;s case only, the tribunal may determine that the statement of case should not be made available or should be made available only in an edited version, or only to certain persons or classes or persons, or on such other terms as the tribunal thinks fit. In other words, if there is any unfairness seen in publishing the statement of case but not the other side, then the tribunal will determine whether or not it is right.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="0805195000200"></a>In other words the tribunal can take into account any argument put to it on the lines of the Minister&#146;s concern about unproven allegations being made public, though I might say to my noble friend that every criminal court, every civil court and every tribunal start every day with unproven allegations. Civil court cases and employment tribunal cases are sometimes settled and the other side is not necessarily known. Further, any other document relating to the case&#151;for example, the defence&#151;and any notice of settlement, which is particularly important, will be made public only if the tribunal permits. To put it another way, the secrecy that at present hides 70 per cent of claims under the Public Interest Disclosure Act will be lifted only in cases where neither party has objected to publicity or the tribunal has not upheld any objection made.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="0805195000201"></a>Those who advise me at Public Concern at Work have been in touch again with the Engineering Employers&#146; Federation, which opposes this amendment on the grounds that my proposal to apply the civil procedure open-justice rule to Public Interest Disclosure Act cases is,</p>
<ul><a name="0805195000247"></a>&#147;an abuse of the employment tribunal process&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805195000224"></a>I find it impossible to agree that open justice, an inherent part of our general justice system, can be properly described as an abuse of process.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="0805195000202"></a>In Grand Committee I quoted the High Court decision of Mr Justice Jackson in 2000 which prevailed until the DTI introduced its no publicity regulations. He said that,</p>
<ul><a name="0805195000248"></a>&#147;so far as possible, litigation should be conducted under the public gaze and under the critical scrutiny of all who wish to report legal proceedings&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="0805195000225"></a>He continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="0805195000240"></a>&#147;The principle of open justice applies to employment tribunals with just as much force as it applies to court proceedings&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="0805195000203"></a>As we are at Report stage, I hope my noble friend the Minister will on this occasion see the advantage of adapting the scheme which has operated in the civil courts&#151;the Civil Procedure Rules&#151;to the employment tribunals. They are, after all, specialised courts and, in many cases, a significant part of the judicial system. I beg to move.</p>

He has brought forward a slightly altered amendment to try to meet some of the objections that were raised at that time. Whistleblowing protection is terribly important. We supported the Public Interest Disclosure Act when it was introduced because we felt that it provided a protection for individuals who blew the whistle on unsafe practices. It was important from a health and safety aspect and generally that this should be provided to individuals who were prepared to blow the whistle on incorrect and unacceptable practices.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="0805195000205"></a>As my noble friend indicated, the amendment would discourage unscrupulous employers from trying to buy off whistleblowers as a cheaper option than dealing with the serious concern they may raise. Now that we have this slightly amended wording before the House, I hope the Minister will be prepared to accept the amendment this time round.</p>

I repeat that support today and hope that he has some success in persuading the Government of the seriousness of his concerns since we last discussed whistle-blowing at work. As the noble Lord said, the amendment has been redrafted to address the concerns of organisations such as the CBI. I understand that there have been further meetings with the Government on this issue and I look forward to the Minister&#146;s response. I hope to hear more encouraging news of the Government&#146;s opinion on this matter than we have so far heard. &#147;In the spirit of compromise&#148; has been the Government&#146;s favourite phrase in this Bill. I look forward to hearing it again in regard to the amendment.</p>

Clearly this is a delicate issue, with arguments finely balanced on both sides, and I welcome the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, has watered down the amendment that he originally proposed in Committee to try to meet some of the concerns coming from the CBI and the EEF in particular.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="0805195000208"></a>Two points are persuasive with me. First, as the noble Lord states, in principle it is strange that there should be any difference between the settlement of cases in employment tribunals and the settlement of cases in the High Court. We have reached the stage where, clearly, the employment tribunals provide just as significant a role in our judicial procedure as do the courts. Therefore it would seem odd that there should be any difference in the way these issues are treated.</p>

<a name="80519-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="0805195000209"></a>Secondly, on the figures, as Public Concern at Work has demonstrated, in 2005-06 there were 1,000 PIDA cases, of which at least 600 or 700 were settled. The ones that went to the tribunal went to litigation, effectively; for those, we know the information that the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, is requesting but for the others we do not. That seems strange in the balance of life. I therefore support the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="0805195000211"></a>I recognise the genuine concern which has given rise to the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Borrie and the attempt which has been made to limit the negative effects which I referred to when we discussed his amendment on the same issue in Grand Committee. Although I acknowledge the spirit of compromise to which the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, just referred, I feel that similar difficulties to those that were aired in Grand Committee still arise from this changed amendment. The current amendment proposes&#151;and this is not a provision of the Civil Procedure Rules&#151;that basic details, including names of parties, would be placed on a register and published within 28 days of the claim being received. It also seeks to import Civil Procedure Rule 5.4C, which provides that persons who are not a party to the case may obtain from the court a copy of the statement of case, although the court must consider rejecting or restricting the application if a party named on the statement of case requests it. Rule 5.4C also allows persons who are not parties to apply for permission to obtain copies of other documents from the proceedings. That might include witness statements, financial records or accounts. It would include seriously confidential information.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="0805195000212"></a>I understand the genuine concern that has been expressed by Public Concern at Work, which campaigns on behalf of whistleblowers; that is, that the unlawful, fraudulent or dangerous behaviour that underlies genuine public interest disclosure claims should be tackled. I find that very encouraging, but I remain concerned, as do the Government, about the consequences that would follow if this amendment were implemented. We must look at the possible impact on parties whose details are published but against whom nothing has been proven. We cannot go down a road where material could be released on application which included unsubstantiated allegations. The fact that this material would be released only to non-parties who sought it does not remove the risk of unsubstantiated allegations being reported in the press, with serious consequences for the reputation of the firms concerned. As we know, the impression and perception created by the first publication in the press is always so much more effective than any retraction or statement to the contrary at a later date. That is true even when the party against whom the allegations are made has submitted a defence to the claim under the public interest disclosure legislation, because both the claim and the defence will relate to the alleged detriment to the claimant, not to the alleged underlying behaviour, be it fraud, unsafe working conditions or whatever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="0805195000213"></a>My right honourable friend in another place, Pat McFadden, met representatives of PCaW in February, and officials from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform held a further meeting with them and representatives of the CBI and the EEF in April. All efforts have been made to understand and discuss the issues, but the fundamental objections to releasing unproven allegations into the public domain

Both the CBI and the EEF, while not condoning abusive or fraudulent behaviour by companies, oppose this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="0805195000214"></a>I know my noble friend Lord Borrie was not seeking to be alarmist but he mentioned Northern Rock as one of the examples. We are all blessed with PhDs in hindsight. Given the current financial situation around the world, whether banks survive or not will depend largely on public confidence. One can just imagine some time ago there having been an enormous attack on the confidence of the whole financial system of the United Kingdom and beyond as a result of what this amendment proposes having taken root.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="0805195000215"></a>I am very pleased that my noble friend Lady Turner recited her involvement and that of many trade unions in ensuring that whistleblowers obtained protection in the past. They have to have protection; otherwise, why would they do it? However, I am sure that noble Lords will agree that that protection brings with it a sense of responsibility. Too often, that protection is not used responsibly. If this amendment were implemented, we would find that press allegations often appeared that were detrimental to business and the employer, and which were not substantiated at that point in time&#151;if they have been substantiated, that is an entirely different issue. I suspect that we would enter a bureaucratic and nightmare of time-delay where every application for papers would be opposed on those grounds. It is surely not in the interests of anybody if all that we are going to do is bring in another tier of delay and expense. I trust that my noble friend Lord Borrie will be prepared on that basis alone to withdraw his amendment.</p>

He knows, as I do, that there are published all sorts of allegations about individuals and firms, in terms of their being charged with fraud or accused of something, which are later disposed of in a negative way, with it all seeming in hindsight rather unfair that the allegations were made public. But that is part of the price we pay for open justice. It is astonishing that the noble Lord should say, by the pure chance that wrongful dismissal cases are brought in employment tribunals rather than in the ordinary High Court, that the civil procedure rules that I wanted to transplant into the employment tribunal field should not be allowed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="0805195000218"></a>I remind the Minister that the purpose of the Public Interest Disclosure Act was not just to give a private remedy to a private individual who was wrongfully dismissed for blowing the whistle on some wrongdoing, or alleged wrongdoing, at his place of work; it was designed to support the public interest, to deter

The DTI&#151;it was long before, I accept, my noble friend&#146;s time at the new department&#151;introduced regulations to stop any publicity except in the circumstance of a final tribunal determination. That seemed to go completely against the purpose of the Public Interest Disclosure Act, which was to bring things out, preferably via the employer or a regulator rather than via the press, to ensure that the employer would do something about it.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08051923000001"></a>Unfortunately, if things can be hushed up and a settlement made without any public understanding of what is going on, then the wrongdoing may continue; there is far less of a deterrent against wrongdoing being attacked, criticised and dealt with. Unfortunately the employer may not feel a need, because sometimes it is easier to shoot the messenger&#151;the whistleblower&#151;than to deal with those initiating the wrongdoing in the first place.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1277"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1277</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>lawyers to be involved at an early stage and to escalate a dispute, making it even more difficult to reach a proper resolution of the problems that have arisen. Although this did not really enter into employment tribunal cases historically, I am given to understand that there is now much more of a tendency for employment tribunals to become a battleground where disputes are taken that should have been settled at a much earlier stage and where the parties involved have not had an opportunity of talking through the situation in the way that this new clause stresses is so important.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08051923000008"></a>Amendments Nos. 11, 12 and 13 proceed to refer to conciliation and mediation as well. Both are forms of alternative dispute resolution. I am seeking in these amendments to identify and facilitate ways in which employers and their employees can settle issues between them early on before any battle lines are drawn up and before, as all too often happens, irrevocable decisions and positions are taken.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08051923000009"></a>There is a difference between conciliation and mediation. ACAS, with all its experience, identifies that on its website, where it describes conciliation as where an independent conciliator discusses the issues that have arisen in an employment tribunal claim,</p>
<ul><a name="08051923000032"></a>&#147;with both sides to find common ground on which the claim could be settled&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051923000023"></a>The term conciliation is used when an employee,</p>
<ul><a name="08051923000033"></a>&#147;is making, or could make, a specific complaint against their employer to an employment tribunal&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051923000024"></a>It is therefore different from mediation. Rightly, the ACAS website describes mediation as,</p>
<ul><a name="08051923000034"></a>&#147;the most common form of alternative dispute resolution. It&#146;s completely voluntary and confidential. It involves an independent, impartial person helping two or more individuals or groups reach a solution that&#146;s acceptable to everyone ... Mediators do not make judgements or determine outcomes&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051923000025"></a>They are there to facilitate the parties to reach their own agreement, which as a result is much longer lasting and satisfactory. The whole focus is on going forward to establish a continuing relationship between the parties, rather than on going back and being judgmental about what has or has not gone wrong.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08051923000010"></a>In 80 per cent of mediations a settlement is reached, as is clearly laid out on the ACAS website. Agreements are not legally binding. In fact, as my noble friend Lord Henley, who is also a fully accredited mediator, will testify, often no settlement is reached. The mediation has not failed, however, because often a settlement will result in the weeks following, as the parties suddenly begin to realise its importance. Therefore, the mediator&#146;s job is not to achieve a settlement but merely to enable both parties to try to reach accommodation themselves. Therefore, settlements are not legally binding, although they can be given legal force if an ACAS conciliator becomes involved&#151;but not unless that occurs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08051923000011"></a>The other issue is equally important. With mediation being a private process, can ACAS under the existing legislation involve outside mediators? There is a whole range of expertise in the employment arena, with highly professional people who could assist ACAS. Of course, ACAS will need additional resources to enable it to fulfil all those functions. But if it is to fulfil them,

I personally thank him for giving oxygen and an airing to the whole issue. The more people in all walks of life&#151;people who might come before a tribunal&#151;are aware of the facility available, the more efficient, quick, cheap and understandable the process will be. I am sure that we all agree with the sentiment behind the amendments even if we do not feel that it is appropriate in this case.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08051923000016"></a>The Government firmly believe that more disputes could benefit from early mediation and conciliation because the problems will be resolved at the earliest opportunity. We announced on 6 February that we intend to invest significant additional resources in ACAS&#146;s pre-claim activities to make this service more widely available. We are also investing significantly in improving the ACAS helpline so that more people are able to benefit from advice on the options available for resolving employment disputes. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked whether it is possible for ACAS to draw on outside parties to facilitate and complement that. I will get back to him on that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08051923000017"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Henley, come from a profession where I spent 20 years. When I was an articled clerk, one of my first principals had a sign above his desk saying: &#147;Settle out of court? Where&#146;s the fun in that?&#148;. I hope those days are over.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08051923000018"></a>As I said in Grand Committee, we believe that the parties should choose the ways that make most sense to them in resolving their dispute. We believe that mediation by private providers can play a crucial role  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1279"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1279</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>and intend to promote its benefits effectively and systematically. However, we believe that these amendments are unnecessary in the light of the measures that are already in place or that we are now proposing. Perhaps I may explain that. I shall consider each amendment in turn, starting with Amendment No. 11.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08051923000019"></a>The first two elements of Amendment No. 11 would include mediation within the heading of the section specified of the Employment Tribunals Act 1996, and insert into subsection (2) that a conciliation officer may use mediation or conciliation when endeavouring to promote a settlement, before proceedings are instituted. Mediation and conciliation are both elastic terms with disagreement among practitioners about what each means in practice. ACAS uses a variety of techniques, including telephone discussion and face-to-face discussion, in seeking to resolve disputes at the early stage. I do not believe that including both these terms in the legislation would have any practical impact. The existing legislation already enables ACAS to use a variety of techniques to resolve disputes. The amendment changes nothing.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08051923000020"></a>The third element of Amendment No. 11 seeks to insert a provision that ACAS conciliation officers may engage outside mediators to assist in the settlement of proceedings. Nothing now prevents conciliation officers suggesting to parties that the help of outside mediators could be worth while. That is done in individual cases every day. ACAS would not, however, pay the fees of such mediators; it has to be right that parties themselves should bear their cost if persuaded of the benefits. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment could have the effect of requiring public funding for private mediation.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08051923000021"></a>Clause 5 provides for ACAS&#146;s existing duty to conciliate in cases where no claim has yet been presented to an employment tribunal to become a power. Amendment No. 12 would remove that change. We cannot support this. It may be helpful to explain the context of our proposed change. ACAS currently has a duty to offer conciliation in certain cases which are capable of becoming the subject of an employment tribunal claim where both potential parties request it, or, where one party makes a request, the conciliation officer judges that there is a good prospect of success. That duty has been on the statute books since the 1970s. During the 1980s, ACAS increasingly found employers asking ACAS to assist with cases which were never likely to become the subject of an employment tribunal claim, at the taxpayer&#146;s expense. In response, the ACAS council decided to interpret the duty strictly in the spirit in which it was intended, so that the pre-claim conciliation service could be focused on cases which were otherwise more or less certain to become the subject of a tribunal claim. As a result, the numbers carried out have been small.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08051918000001"></a>Following overwhelming support for more early ACAS conciliation from respondents to the consultation on the Gibbons review, the Government will invest up to &#163;37 million in additional conciliation resource and in improving the ACAS advice service, which, among other things, will be able to explain to people what help is available to resolve disputes and offer the statutory ACAS conciliation service in cases which seem likely to benefit from it and where the parties

There is a risk that demand for ACAS conciliation services will exceed supply once the service is actively made available as we now intend. We therefore wish to ensure that ACAS is able effectively to manage the new case load without having unduly to restrict the use of its services. That is why we wish to change the existing duty to conciliate to a power to enable it to do so without being exposed to legal jeopardy.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08051918000002"></a>Amendment No. 13 would add to Section 18(6) of the Employment Tribunals Act words enabling the encouragement of the use of mediation as a first step in any conciliation process. The subsection already provides for this through a broad requirement that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051918000058"></a>&#147;a conciliation officer shall, where appropriate, have regard to the desirability of encouraging the use of other procedures available for the settlement of grievances&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80519-0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08051918000003"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 10 also seeks to encourage employers to use conciliation and mediation. ACAS plays a key and valued role in the resolution of workplace disputes and the Government are supportive of codes of practice issued by ACAS. As your Lordships will be aware, ACAS is revising its code of practice on disciplinary and grievance procedures to be principles-based and concise, supported by fuller non-statutory guidance. Tribunals will then be able to consider the appropriateness of parties&#146; behaviour in the particular circumstances of a case against the principles set out in the code, in line with the conclusions of the Gibbons review and the public consultation. This is a sensible and balanced way of encouraging employers and employees to follow the principles of good practice in the early resolution of workplace disputes and overcomes the unforeseen and undesirable results experienced when detailed procedures were enshrined in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08051918000004"></a>I circulated an early draft of the code in Committee. The draft has now been issued by ACAS for public consultation. All interested parties can comment on it to ACAS. It clearly says that employers and employees should do all that they can to resolve disciplinary and grievance issues in the workplace, and the foreword to the draft makes specific reference to third-party assistance. ACAS will also be considering including further guidance on obtaining outside help, such as mediation, in its accompanying detailed guidance booklet. That might give even more help and assistance on the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt.</p>

<a name="80519-0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="08051918000005"></a>In conclusion, these amendments are unnecessary as there will be more than adequate measures to encourage conciliation and mediation where it is appropriate, whereas legislating would lead us back into being overly prescriptive and lacking flexibility. Please do not mistake the Government&#146;s opposition to these amendments for a stance of not encouraging mediation and conciliation. That must be the way forward, but we must ensure that we do not remove flexibility or become overregulated and overly prescriptive, and ultimately fall foul of the law of unintended consequences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="08051918000007"></a>I found the Minister&#146;s phrase that there would &#147;effectively and systematically&#148; be promotion of independent mediation remarkably helpful. That is a substantial move forward from our previous debate, although at that time I was erring down the road of compulsion. He and other noble Lords persuaded me that perhaps, as with Michael Gibbons&#146;s findings, compulsion is not necessarily the right way forward.</p>

<a name="80519-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="08051918000008"></a>I was particularly intrigued by the Minister&#146;s comment that demand may exceed supply. I hoped that he might return to the point that I raised specifically, which was that when demand exceeds supply, does ACAS have the power to engage the private sector to bring its resources to assist ACAS in an independent mediation? I can well understand that if parties have decided to go down the mediation route, ACAS should not pay the bill, but it surely fits in with the Government&#146;s attitude to public/private partnerships that there should be a close working relationship between those who provide mediation services and ACAS. When demand exceeds supply, there would then be an opportunity to press a lever marked &#147;private-sector support&#148; that ACAS can call in.</p>

I have written to him suggesting an addition that might be made to it to ensure that conciliation, mediation or independent investigation should be included in the code. I know that some are a little worried that that would add to the expense, but the great advantage of mediation, as my noble friend Lord Henley knows, is that there is comparatively little preparatory cost. All the mediator requires to know is exactly what the parties want to achieve and a brief history of what has happened. The mediator then decides how best to resolve the dispute. It is all pretty easy, quick and simple.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08051918000018"></a>The noble Lord said: I move this amendment, which is in my name and that of my noble friend Lady Wilcox, at the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, who sadly could not be here today. It is similar to one that he moved towards the end of our proceedings on the first day in Committee, as long ago as 4 February. I hoped that he would be here and that we could have the amendment down in both his name and mine. Both of us have been here for some 30 years and it would have been an unusual combination of names on an amendment. I make that point to illustrate that this amendment is not party-political; it merely makes a simple and basic point about mediation, as we discussed on the previous amendment.</p>

<a name="80519-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08051918000019"></a>The simple point is that one should always remember that mediation is not arbitration or conciliation; it is something different. The important thing about mediation is that the mediator makes it clear that everything that is said to him is off the record, without prejudice, and that he will forget all of it after the mediation is closed, whether or not that mediation has been successful. Therefore it is important that the mediator, more than anyone else and even with the consent of the parties, should be precluded from taking part in later proceedings. As both the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, and I understand it, it would be possible under the Industrial Tribunals Act 1996 for a mediator subsequently to be a member of an employment tribunal. As the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, made clear on 4 February&#151;I hope that I, too, made it clear&#151;we think that it would be wrong in principle for a mediator ever to act in a judicial or quasi-judicial role in the same case. Therefore it is important that we amend the Act in the way that is suggested by this amendment, to make it clear that a mediator can never act as a member of a tribunal, even with the agreement of the parties. That is why, in my proposed new subsection (2), we substitute the words,</p>
<ul><a name="08051918000059"></a>&#147;not decide matters in the same case&#148;.</ul>

<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08051918000020"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn, felt very strongly about this. I feel very strongly about it and I cannot see why the Government on that occasion resisted the amendment. I hope that they will not resist this amendment and that, even if they cannot accept the wording, they will say that they will bring forward something suitable at Third Reading. It is important

The present legal position is that the express consent of all parties is required before a mediating judge can determine such a case.</p>

<a name="80519-0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08051918000022"></a>I agree with the noble Lord that in general, and as a matter of course, it is desirable that mediating judges should play no part in the determination of cases. Parties need to have confidence in the impartial judgment of the tribunal. However, if they do, why should it be impossible for the mediating judge to be part of the employment tribunal? It is because the parties need to have confidence in the impartial judgment of the tribunal that, in the recent Tribunals Service trial of judicial mediation in employment tribunals, the rules of the scheme provided that a mediating judge could not take part in the judging of a case. It is right that this should be the general rule.</p>

<a name="80519-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08051918000023"></a>We should be mindful that &#147;mediation&#148; is, as I understand it&#151;there are much greater experts in the House than me&#151;a fairly elastic term that is undefined in law. It is a broad church that can stretch from activity that is close to conciliation, where the mediator seeks to establish common ground between parties but does not take a view on the substantive merits of the case, to a model more like arbitration, where the mediator proposes a solution having heard the arguments of the parties. Where it is more akin to conciliation, we think that there is an argument for using the law to prevent a judge&#146;s involvement. We think that the argument for using the law to prevent a judge&#146;s involvement in the determination of a case is less strong in the mediation model, which has been used in the recent pilot of judicial mediation in employment tribunal cases.</p>

<a name="80519-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08051918000024"></a>We sympathise with the arguments advanced in favour of the amendment, but is it right to prescribe in legislation that no mediating employment judge can ever subsequently be involved in determining a case? There could be circumstances in which such involvement would be in the interests of justice. In a complex case, a mediating judge would become familiar with the facts and, if mediation fails, there might be unnecessary delay if the parties have to set out their respective positions in detail to another judge. In such circumstances, ought we to say&#151;this is the question that I pose to the House&#151;that in law, even if the parties themselves desire it, the original judge cannot continue in any circumstances to determine the case? We are not sure that that is not going too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"></a><a name="08051918000025"></a>Parliament accepted the argument that I have just put forward in relation to other tribunals when it passed the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act last year.

Our view is that the existing legal position, whereby a mediating judge could be involved in subsequent determination, but only with the express consent of the parties, is the appropriate way for statute to deal with this matter. That is why, although sympathetic to much that the noble Lord, Lord Henley, has said, we think that it would be wrong to put this into legislation and I invite him to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08051918000032"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment has been suggested to me by Citizens Advice. Its aim is to deal with the problem of non-payment by rogue employers of employment tribunal awards and the resultant difficulty and hardship caused to the claimants concerned. At present, and even after the implementation from April 2009 of the welcome provisions in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, such claimants are faced with having to take legally complex, time-consuming and costly enforcement action in the civil courts. Many simply do not do so, while others try but then give up. Rogue employers are aware of this and calculate that non-compliance pays. The amendment would enable unpaid awards to be enforced by the state on behalf of the claimant using existing civil court enforcement mechanisms.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1287"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1287</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80519-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08051918000033"></a>Just how widespread a problem is this? A recent survey conducted by Citizens Advice showed that in 2006-07 the 430 citizens advice bureaux in England and Wales dealt with an estimated 1,040 inquiries about enforcement of unpaid tribunal awards. In the first two quarters of this year, these bureaux dealt with an estimated 525 such inquiries. This would suggest that the total number of unpaid awards is in fact in the region of more than 1,000 a year.</p>

<a name="80519-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08051918000034"></a>There is no doubt at all that vulnerable people face real hardship as a result of these failures. As I have already indicated, the Government have sought to remedy the situation by the provisions included in the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007, but Citizens Advice has said that these do not go far enough. It is the common experience of CAB advisers that claimants&#146; registration of unpaid awards in the county court, which under the Act is to become automatic and free of charge, frequently fails to secure a payment of the award, as the consequences for the employer of continued non-compliance are negligible. Citizens Advice has provided details of a number of cases in support of this, but because of the lateness of the hour, I shall not refer to them, although there are a number of sad cases where people are facing real difficulty because of failure to secure money that is rightfully theirs. For an individual who has not received his award, the process of enforcement that must follow registration of the unpaid award is legalistic, time consuming and expensive because of the need to pay court fees and, in some cases, to engage the services of a solicitor. Many people simply give up. Rogue employers are aware of that and calculate that non-compliance pays, hence the amendment providing for unpaid awards to be enforced by the state. It may be argued that that would cost a lot, but if claimants are unable to access money that is rightfully theirs, they become impoverished and then have recourse to the benefit system, which also costs the taxpayer money. Moreover, where such enforcement action is successful, costs could presumably be recovered from the defaulting employer. This amendment is based on a great deal of experience in this area, and I hope that the Government will be prepared to accept it. I beg to move.</p>

I shall not take up the time of the House because I know we are up against it, but there are over 1,000 cases, often involving people who do not understand what they have to do to recover the money and, even if they do, cannot afford to follow it through. We are following the advice given to us by Citizens Advice, and all that is being asked is that the Government take over these cases to ensure that these people obtain justice. I hope that when the Minister replies he is sympathetic to what we are putting forward.</p>

Like the noble Baroness, this side has been arguing for this. We have both taken up the advice and research of Citizens Advice, and I hope that the Government will find a way of taking on board the points that have been made.</p>

We discussed this matter in Grand Committee on an amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Wedderburn. It addressed the same issue, although in different terms. I said then, and I maintain, that the Government recognise the need to address the recovery of awards, but we do not believe that direct enforcement, as proposed in this amendment, is the right way to tackle the issue.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80519-0008.htm"/>


<a name="80519-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_147"></a><a name="08051918000038"></a>As the law currently stands, employment tribunal awards may be enforced, after the statutory 42-day period for payment, in the same way as county court judgments, by means of a court order. Interest is payable after the 42-day period in most cases. We are aware of the need to address the enforcement of employment tribunal awards and, as was said in Committee, we are already taking action to make the enforcement of awards easier&#151;my noble friend Lady Turner was kind enough to mention that.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_148"></a><a name="08051918000039"></a>I shall repeat briefly what we are doing. The Tribunal Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 provides for the enforcement of awards in all tribunals as if they were payable under a county court order, so the claimant does not have to go through the county court but can go straight to the bailiffs for enforcement after the 42 days. The same Act provides that a legally binding agreement brokered by ACAS will be enforceable in the same way and it provides for unpaid awards to be included on the Register of Judgments and Orders. That is likely to make it more difficult for respondents who have defaulted on payment of awards to obtain credit. It is currently intended to implement these measures in April 2009 at the same time as the statutory dispute procedures under the current Bill. We think that is the appropriate way to deal with those respondents who fail to pay awards due to claimants. We should allow time for these measures to bed down, but of course we need to assess their impact. It is a long-held principle of civil justice that the conduct of proceedings should rest largely in the hands of the parties concerned, and we do not believe that the establishment of a state mechanism for the enforcement of employment tribunal awards is justified when a simpler solution is to hand.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="08051918000040"></a>I should declare an interest as a long time ago I was chairman of a local citizens advice bureau for three years, and it follows that I have greatest the respect for Citizens Advice and the work it does in providing free advice to some of the most vulnerable in society. It argues that registration of the award in the county court is not enough and that state-led enforcement on behalf of the claimant is needed. It suggests that this might be undertaken either by directly employed lawyers or by the commercial firm, Sheriffs Lodgment Centre. We believe that we should first assess the impact of the changes due in April 2009, which I understand that Citizens Advice supports, as far as they go, although it does not think they go far enough.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="08051918000041"></a>Late last Thursday, we received the interim report on the research, mentioned by my noble friend Lady Turner, commissioned by Citizens Advice into the scale of the issue. We have not had time to assess it fully, but Ministers have asked officials to meet Citizens Advice when the final report is available to discuss the findings and the implications for enforcement. The Government are also commissioning their own research on the payment and enforcement of awards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_151"></a><a name="08051918000043"></a>As was said in Committee, we are, in addition, providing help to vulnerable claimants in the Bill, by extending tribunals&#146; discretion to make additional awards against respondents to cover the full financial loss arising from money not paid or unlawfully withheld in certain simple monetary claims.</p>

The new notice will require a non-compliant employer to repay arrears of the national minimum wage to the employees specified on the notice as having been underpaid, and to pay a financial penalty to the Secretary of State. The Government are committed to effective national minimum wage enforcement which supports employees and businesses by deterring non-compliant employers from underpaying their employees. We envisage that a penalty will be levied in almost all cases of non-compliance. However, we also realise that there may be circumstances where it would be inappropriate to penalise an employer for failing to pay the minimum wage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08051941000004"></a>Our response to last year&#146;s consultation on national minimum wage enforcement, which was published on the introduction of the Bill to your Lordships&#146; House, stated that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32"></a><a name="08051941000056"></a>&#147;The legislation will not require enforcement officers to issue penalties in all cases, although as a matter of policy they will be expected to do so in all but the most exceptional cases&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80519-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08051941000005"></a>At the time the Bill was introduced we considered that we had achieved this policy, as new Section 19(2) on page 7, at line 13, gives the enforcement officer a discretion whether to issue a notice of underpayment. However, we have considered this matter further and believe that there may be limited circumstances where we would wish to require an employer to repay arrears to employees, but where we would not wish to impose a penalty on that employer. Clause 9 does not allow for this.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08051941000006"></a>Amendment No. 16 seeks to clarify the Government&#146;s policy intention as set out in our response to consultation. It provides that the Secretary of State can make directions to set out circumstances in which a notice of underpayment should be issued, but without a financial penalty. This amendment will allow additional flexibility to respond to future circumstances by means of directions issued by the Secretary of State, rather than needing to make further legislative change. If directions are issued, they will be included in a policy statement to be published by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. This policy statement will be made available to the general public and will deal with how the national minimum wage enforcement regime will operate.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08051941000007"></a>As I have said, the aim of this amendment is to allow the enforcement regime to respond to future circumstances where it would be unjust to issue a penalty and so ensure that our enforcement is effective but fair. We are not able to say at present exactly what all those future circumstances might be. I do not think it would be particularly helpful this afternoon to explore numerous hypothetical scenarios out of context. I am pleased to note that this amendment has the support of the CBI. As noble Lords will know, I was director-general of that organisation for six and a half years. I was in favour of the national minimum wage being implemented, but it all happened before my watch. I am very pleased it was so done.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="08051941000008"></a>However, to give a flavour of why we believe that this amendment is required, it may help to say that one circumstance we are considering is where, previously, another government agency has stated that the employer&#146;s practice was compliant with national minimum wage requirements but that proved not to be the case in practice. I should emphasise at this point that that is a hypothetical example. We are not aware of any of those problems. Nevertheless, we believe that it would be manifestly unjust to issue a penalty for an employer and, in effect, penalise him for a mistake that was not of his making. Amendments Nos. 17 to 28 make necessary consequential changes. Amendment No. 26 provides an additional ground for appeal to cover cases where an enforcement officer has issued a notice of underpayment that includes a penalty in circumstances where the Secretary of State has directed that a penalty should not be issued. Amendments Nos. 27 and 28 provide that an enforcement officer may withdraw and

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08051941000009"></a>It is important that we create an easily understood deterrent which makes clear that underpayment of the national minimum wage is unacceptable, and what the consequences of underpayment will be. That will provide greater support to vulnerable employees and help ensure a level playing field for compliant businesses. That is the aim of Clause 9. This amendment is not a watering-down of the enforcement regime; rather, it will enable us to avoid the situation where a penalty has to be issued in circumstances where it would be unjust so to do. I beg to move.</p>

I have no doubt that it is with the help of the noble Lord, Lord Jones, who as he said was the director-general of the CBI for quite a long time. He has brought this new thinking into a Labour Government. However, I am concerned at how far this amendment will be implemented. In his letter of 13 May, for which I thank him, he said that he would consider waiving the penalty for underpayment only if the employer had been misadvised by another government agency. A government agency gives wrong advice to a small employer doing his best to keep up with the realms of regulation issued by DBERR, yet there is a possibility that the employer will be expected to pay for the mistake. Excuse me. Would my noble friend take over?</p>

The Government said in Committee that their intention behind imposing a penalty on underpayment of wages was to deter wilful underpayers. If this is the case, why are they not immediately providing an exemption for those solutions where the underpayment was clearly a mistake? This refusal on the part of the Government to appreciate the difficulty that even the most careful employers have in becoming fully compliant has led to such burdens being placed on small businesses.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1293"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1293</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>payment of the national minimum wage to seafarers. The amendment that I moved urged that the national minimum wage be paid to seafarers on all UK-registered ships and on all vessels trading in UK territorial waters. Like the union, I was particularly concerned about the exploitation of foreign workers on British ships and the fact that they sometimes receive wages that are very much less than the national minimum wage, even though they work next to British workers who receive the national minimum wage. The union rightly thought that that was wrong in principle and the amendment sought to deal with it.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08051941000018"></a>The Government opposed my amendment on a number of grounds. There were the expected arguments about the possibility that foreign ships would flag out; those arguments are usually made by shipping employers whenever any improvement in terms and conditions of employment are suggested. It was also argued that to try to enforce the national minimum wage on all ships in UK territorial waters would not be compatible with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and customary international law, primarily because it would infringe the right of international passage. Moreover, it was argued that the amendment would mean that the UK Government would have to pursue ships that might only occasionally call at UK ports.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="08051941000019"></a>However, the Minister agreed that there were anomalies that should be considered, notably that, because of the distinction made between UK internal waters and UK territorial waters, the national minimum wage became payable in respect of the sea between Scotland and the Inner and Outer Hebrides but not in respect of the sea between Scotland and Shetland. The Minister agreed that other, similar anomalies existed.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="08051941000020"></a>Following the debate in Committee, my noble friend Lord Wedderburn and I had a meeting with union representatives. The union concerned has had further discussions with its lawyers and the wording now before the House is the result of those discussions. The union believes that the ships that are of primary importance for national minimum wage coverage are ferries and cargo vessels trading regularly from UK ports. We believe that the revised wording deals with the main arguments against our original amendment, while attempting to deal with the anomalies that the Minister agreed existed as far as present practice is concerned.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08051941000021"></a>It may be argued that the wording could still risk encouraging what is known as flagging out by foreign ship owners unwilling to accept the obligation to pay the minimum wage. We believe this to be a form of blackmail, which the Government should not accept. Shipping is an important industry; indeed, I understand that the Government have made certain tax advantages in acknowledgement of its importance. However, there are obligations as well, one of which should be to ensure that basic employment standards are met for seafarers working on these ships. The Government admit that anomalies exist and the Bill presents an opportunity to put at least some of them right. I urge the Government to accept our revised amendment and I beg to move.</p>

We took away the earlier, all-embracing amendment and narrowed it down to ships such as ferries that operate regularly between the United Kingdom and EU ports or to the Isle of Man and Jersey. We think that the measure is capable of being enforced and that it is essential that it should be enforced; it is a matter of justice for the people who work on those ships. Once again, I hope that the Minister will look at the amendment and agree with us on the matter. As the Government admitted in Committee, there are anomalies, such as in relation to Shetland. However, let us go a little further and apply this on a broader scale to the ferries and other ships that operate regularly.</p>

We are grateful to her for the work that she has done on it.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="08051941000024"></a>I am afraid that we still feel that the amendment, even as newly drafted, is unworkable. My noble friend Lord Jones wrote to Members of the Committee on the matter, but it is still useful to remind ourselves to which seafarers the minimum wage applies at present. Under present legislation, all resident and non-resident seafarers are entitled to the minimum wage while they are in the UK&#146;s internal waters. A seafarer on a UK-registered ship anywhere in the world is entitled to the national minimum wage unless his employment is wholly outside the UK or he is not ordinarily resident in the UK. The position is that, at the moment, a wide range of people who work in the seafaring industry are due to receive the national minimum wage.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08051941000025"></a>Our problems with the amendment are as follows. First, it would extend the minimum wage to all seafarers on UK-registered ships, including seafarers who do not ordinarily live in the UK or who work wholly outside it. It was never the intention of the minimum wage legislation to extend rights to workers who have no link with the UK. There is also the real possibility that the amendment might have damaging consequences for our own merchant fleet. Extending the minimum wage to all seafarers on all UK ships wherever in the world they trade carries with it the risk that, as my noble friend herself pointed out, companies could change the flag of their ships to that of another country to avoid paying the minimum wage. The seafarers would be no better off and the UK would suffer a considerable disadvantage in terms of the number of ships carrying the UK flag, which I understand to be a matter of great significance in the maritime world.</p>

<a name="80519-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08051941000026"></a>The amendment would also extend the right to the minimum wage not only to mariners on UK-registered ships but to those on foreign-flagged ships. Attempting to apply the right on foreign-flagged vessels would raise difficulties, of which we also spoke, about the right of foreign vessels to enjoy innocent passage in our territorial waters. Because of the existence of this right, which is indeed enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UK-flagged ships

We argue that it is dangerous to interfere with this diplomatic balance.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08051941000027"></a>Some ships plying trade between two UK ports&#151;for example, between Aberdeen and Lerwick in Shetland&#151;will spend part of their journey outside internal and territorial waters on the high seas. The new amendment would apply the minimum wage to ships of any flag on these services, as well as to services to the Channel Islands. The UK certainly does not have jurisdiction on foreign ships while they are on the high seas, so this would not be possible; there is no way in which we could insist that it were done.</p>

Is that the basis of the Government&#146;s objection to proposed new paragraph (b) in the amendment, or is he arguing that the national minimum wage could not apply on ships operating scheduled services between UK and EU ports and that that would be in breach of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea?</p>

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea says that UK-flagged ships will not be interfered with off the coasts of other states. That is important for UK ships in some parts of the world. In practice, it means that they are not searched, looked at or stopped in the course of their business. That is a kind of mutual diplomatic balance. It is certainly one of the arguments, which is why I use it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08051941000030"></a>I come on, briefly, to the anomalies which, I concede, clearly exist here. I hope that that may satisfy my noble friend Lady Turner. We do not have jurisdiction over foreign ships; there is no point in pretending that we have. We have some sympathy with the reasons for tabling this amendment. We are not setting our face against considering the anomalies; I use the word used by my noble friend. This undoubtedly underlies the concerns. There are issues which concern the union and seafarers. My noble friend Lord Rosser referred to ferry routes in particular in his intervention. I invite the union and other interested parties to write to the Minister, who I am sure would be prepared to see them about this issue, so that it can be considered in detail. We do not think that the way of dealing with this difficulty&#151;and there clearly are difficulties as far as particular ferry routes are concerned&#151;is to pass an amendment such as this, which would also allow other inappropriate matters to occur. Innocent passage only applies on territorial seas. However, I am advised that it is even more difficult for us to affect what happens on the high seas.</p>

I am glad to learn that, as far as the anomalies are concerned, arrangements will be made for a meeting with the Minister to discuss these issues if the union wishes, which I am sure it does. I agree that the issues are quite complex, but there is a case for all seafarers working on British ships to be awarded the minimum wage. It still seems unfair that if two people are working side by side, one should be earning about half of what the other earns for doing exactly the same work.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08051941000033"></a>I am reminded of the Labour Party&#146;s 1993 maritime strategy document <I>Full Steam Ahead</I>, which I believe was written by my right honourable friend John Prescott, then Shadow Secretary of State for Transport. On the issue that I have just been talking about, he said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52"></a><a name="08051941000076"></a>&#147;This discrimination will not be tolerated in the egalitarian society to which the Labour Party aspires. Therefore we are pledged to the principle of pay parity and the harmonisation of working conditions for all seafarers on UK-flagged vessels, in accordance with the European Social Charter, and new employment standards will apply to seafarers, including Labour&#146;s proposed statutory minimum wage&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051941000034"></a>The union, quite rightly, regarded that as some sort of promise. I am sorry that we have got no further towards it than we have this afternoon. Nevertheless, I accept what the Minister has said, and will pass that on to the union. I am sure that the union will take up the possibility of a meeting about anomalies with the Minister. There are still issues about innocent passage, raised by my noble friend Lord Rosser, and the noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, which we are not happy about and need clarification. Although I am withdrawing the amendment, it is with a certain sadness, because I had hoped that there would have been more of a welcome to the union&#146;s attempt to meet the objections that were raised last time. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08051941000037"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, your Lordships will be aware that I first expressed considerable anxiety about the implications of this Bill following the publication for approval within your Lordships&#146; House on 17 December of a statutory instrument. It sought to regulate and define the terms applicable to employment agencies dealing with the recruitment of short-term staff in large numbers and, in particular, staff in the theatrical and modelling industries. I expressed concerns  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1297"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1297</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on the first night of our debate on the grounds that there was, at the time, a major hole in the welfare provisions made for the staff involved, which I sincerely hoped would be amended and addressed in the Bill. Those amendments were not forthcoming. In Grand Committee I introduced amendments that went a little further than the ones before your Lordships today. I have simplified them to be a request for a duty of care to be extended by all parties concerned on behalf of these groups of vulnerable young people.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="08051941000038"></a>Before addressing those, I will deal with the group that I have no longer included in the amendment. These were the clients of what are called the outplacement agencies. I am deeply grateful to the Minister for giving me access to members of his department, who have been very helpful in discussing this with me. I am satisfied by the assurances they have so far given me in that respect&#151;that the law of 1973 is completely adequate to deal with any transgressions of the law by agencies acting in an outplacement function. I have pointed out to them that there has not been a single prosecution, in my understanding, since 1973, whereas I am absolutely certain that I could list a great many transgressions of the law. They have told me that there is therefore to be immediate recruitment of additional inspectors of agencies. They will be employed by the department particularly to address this point. I hope that is so and I welcome it, but I assure the Minister that he can look forward to a steady stream of questions from these Benches in the months to come as to how many transgressions have been found and which prosecutions have been brought. It is a matter of great concern that we should know the law is being enforced.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="08051941000039"></a>I turn to the issues in the amendment. I am concerned with three groups of vulnerable young people. I am talking here about people of either sex. First, I will talk about the actresses and models referred to in that instrument of 17 December, and the staff who are recruited principally on behalf of hospitality-providing services at various sporting events. Here is a real cause for concern that we should be better informed about. I shall deal first with the issue affecting actresses and models. They are pretty well interchangeable and are, in the main, young people desperate for attention and for recognition of the fact that they are available for auditions and catwalk assignments. These are wholly at the behest of the agencies that place them and take commission for securing them.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="08051941000040"></a>We are all aware of previous traditions in the theatrical industry. I have been chairman of a film production company. Though I never had control of a casting couch, I am aware of its function. We should all perhaps recognise that it is something which may sound, in retrospect, okay between consenting adults and can be looked upon with some jocularity. The present reality is much nastier and more sinister. We are no longer dealing with the career aspirations of an actress and a lecherous producer, and leaving them, as consenting adults, to get on with it. We are looking at the bulk recruitment of, say, 40 or 50 young women, all of whom will do a 10 or 15-minute audition, if they are lucky, with a view to getting a part which may be remunerative and an important career stage for them. As part of the process of that recruitment or audition, they will be expected to attend a promoter&#146;s party,  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1298"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1298</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>which, in the main, will be a drinks affair with various opportunities for meeting, mingling and drinking. I hope that no nasty white substances will be circulating, but you cannot be sure in this day and age. At the end of the evening, if these young women are not considered to have been good party girls and to have entered into the spirit of the process, by which you can form your own conclusions, they will not get an invitation to another audition. That is desperately immoral and inappropriate in the circumstances, and completely in contrast to the consenting-adult concept of what went before. A lot of these people may be very young and not know what they are going to when they arrive at these functions. I am asking for a total, absolute, up-front declaration of the nature of the party, what they will be expected to do and a duty of care to ensure that nothing beyond the strict limits on which they are recruited is allowed.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="08051941000041"></a>This leads us into the world of recruitment of large numbers of young people and support staff for the entertainment industry and for corporate hospitality. We are talking principally of horserace meetings, motor-race meetings and golf tournaments, which are big users of short-term employment. Large numbers of young people are very happy to be offered employment at these functions for up to a week in high summer, usually during their college vacations. Recruiting practice has been to recruit the whole of a year from a catering services training college.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="08051941000042"></a>These functions can take place anywhere up to 400 miles from London&#151;for example, at an open golf tournament. Therefore, these youngsters are a long way from their original base, with no direct supervision of their welfare, apart from being given accommodation for the week that they are there. There is no intent on anyone&#146;s part that they should be corrupted or undermined, or that they should be brought together for any ancillary purposes, but the circumstances dictate that this can happen not infrequently.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="08051941000043"></a>Racing&#151;I should state my own past interest in having been responsible for the Grand National meetings at Aintree, the national hunt meetings at Cheltenham, all the racing at Newmarket and the Derby meetings for a number of years&#151;is slightly more fortunate than the other sports because it takes place in the main part of the day. Employees are gathered together by about 8 am when they set up lunch, and then serve lunch and tea. After clearing up, they are finished for the day and are pretty well on their own devices for the rest of the time.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="08051941000044"></a>As I understand it from young people who work in that world, the difficulty arises when one or two out of a dormitory of perhaps 50 young people encourage the trading of drugs. Peer-group pressure becomes hugely difficult for the other young people to contend with and there is no one to whom they can turn for protection or defence in this situation. My noble friend Lady Gardner of Parkes has a wonderful Australian expression for this which goes to the core of the issue and, with such magnificent objectivity and brevity, I am not surprised that Australia keeps winning the ashes. She says that we just need to give them a &#147;go-to&#148; person. It cannot be put more brilliantly  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1299"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1299</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>simple than that. These young people need a &#147;go-to&#148; person in the night to help them when these troubles arise.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="08051941000045"></a>We are not talking about the problems of just the young women. After Royal Ascot four years ago, the body of a kitchen porter was washed to the surface during the subsequent September race meeting. He had been buried in the No. 2 car park because he had had the keys to the liquor store and would not give access to others. They had brought in a van to use in stealing the entire liquor store for the next few days of Royal Ascot. He was killed and then buried in the car park until his body was washed up by the rainstorms in September. The two people who did that are serving a life sentence and the kitchen porter is dead, so three lives have been ruined. We do not know how many ruined lives there have been because of peer pressure among young women on the campsites of race meetings where drugs have been circulated or their use encouraged.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_186"></a><a name="08051941000046"></a>The situation is worse at golf tournaments and motor-race meetings where there are a far higher proportion of young men, which multiplies the problems. There are more field stewards and more security staff at these tournaments and meetings, so there are also large numbers of young men, who are mostly under the age of 18. There is scope for inter-gender contact, which can be a problem and perhaps unwelcome in those circumstances. There is a real need for a &#147;go-to&#148; person to whom one can go when someone is trying to get the keys to the liquor locker, when someone is hawking drugs, or whatever, in the middle or the night. At the moment, there is no one&#151;not even for someone who arrives at a site, finds the circumstances very uncongenial and wishes to go home. They may be 400 miles away without any money, because pay day has not come and they have not earned any wages yet, and they are unable to get home. There is no facility for any of this.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_187"></a><a name="08051941000047"></a>The worst instance of this&#151;I believe it is no longer sub judice so we can talk about it&#151;is the Manchester United Christmas party, which is a strange event indeed. Thirty-four young men, who comprise the first and second team squads, decided that they would contribute each &#163;4,000, a total of &#163;136,000, to fund a party&#151;no definition given. Whether they go to an employment agency or to a party organiser to recruit the company for the evening is unclear. But, if they went to an employment agency, there has been a clear breach of the law. The media have given many accounts, and we have heard that the 34 young men decided that their party would be held in a hotel where they would book 34 bedrooms, in each of which there would be two high-quality bottles of champagne. They also wanted 100 of the &#147;best-looking girls in Manchester&#148; recruited as their company for the evening.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_188"></a><a name="08051941000048"></a>Why did they want only 100 girls when there were 34 men? On an average of three girls per room, two rooms would be short of a girl. Then someone pointed out to me that goalkeepers do not score hat tricks, so they did not need another two girls&#151;two goalkeepers were involved. There is a real lack of definition. You and I might say, &#147;What on earth did these young men have in mind when they organised this party?&#148;, but I think we can have a fair guess. You might also say,  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1300"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1300</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>&#147;The girls are stupid if they did not realise it when they went&#148;. No, they are not stupid. How do we know that they were not told it was not an ordinary party in one big room, as one would imagine a party to be, with the drink flowing, and people circulating and meeting each other? Instead of that, the girls arrived to find a situation where they were effectively being allocated to, or lots were being drawn for, which room they were sent to, and goodness knows what happened then.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_189"></a><a name="08051941000049"></a>Another mystery is the sum of &#163;134,000 for the party. Assuming the rooms cost &#163;600 each, the champagne cost &#163;25 per bottle and the food cost &#163;20 a head would be an outlay of &#163;67,000. What did the other approximately &#163;67,000 go on? Was it a performance-related bonus intended for the young women, in which case it is a total scandal? What was done about that? Why should these young women be deprived of a right of choice by being put in a situation where they are confronted with those circumstances and have no &#147;go-to&#148; person to rescue them and get them out if that is what they want?</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_190"></a><a name="08051941000050"></a>There are issues here which are not addressed in the Bill. It is wrong that we have allowed such slack and slipshod methods of recruitment and control of the agencies to get through in that instrument of 17 December, which I suggest we would not have done four days later when we knew what had happened at the Manchester United party. A &#147;go-to&#148; person should be a mandatory requirement at all gatherings of 30 or more where people are recruited to be sent far from home to somewhere where they will have no opportunity to get parental help or be able to call on someone to collect them. You cannot just phone your dad and ask him to pop 400 miles up the motorway to collect you and bring you home. These young people are stuck there for the duration of the meeting. We have a major welfare issue here; the Bill does not address it, and that is a scandal. This Government have few opportunities to do something that is good and does not involve raising taxes or asking the Treasury to borrow more money, but this is one. I urge your Lordships to follow this course of action, which can only do good. We are, presently, looking at a scandal that needs correcting. The answer is in your Lordships&#146; hands and in this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

I particularly thank my noble friend Lord Henley for taking over with my brief from the middle of nowhere, the Minister, who came outside to make sure that I was still alive, and the noble Baroness, Lady Cohen, who rushed forward with an antihistamine tablet and told me most firmly that it was tree pollen to which I was allergic.

<p><a name="stpa_191"></a><a name="08051941000052"></a>I support what my noble friend Lord James of Blackheath said about the need to ensure that agencies providing cheap, temporary and young staff in large numbers appreciate the youth and inexperience of many of them and take reasonable steps to protect them from undue potential pressure. In Committee, the Minister said that the Government supported the intention behind the amendments that were then tabled;  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1301"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1301</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>he then gave a long list of reasons why none of my noble friend&#146;s suggestions was suitable. The amendment has since been amended and now has only one suggestion in it, so perhaps the Minister will be able to spend a little less time explaining why my noble friend is wrong and, instead, a little more time on what the Government intend to do.</p>

<p><a name="st_122"></a>
<a name="08051946000004"></a><a name="80519-0009.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80519-0009.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08051946000386"></a>Lord Jones of Birmingham:</b> My Lords, this amendment seeks to give employment agencies a statutory duty to protect the welfare of temporary staff where 30 or more temporary workers under the age of 18 are engaged on the same assignment. The Government support the intention behind the amendment; the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, correctly referred to the sentiment coming from us as well as from the noble Lord, Lord James of Blackheath. It is essential to have appropriate protection for vulnerable agency workers, particularly where young workers are engaged on assignments away from home.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08051946000005"></a>However, it is not clear that this amendment would provide significant additional protection in practice. Existing employment agency legislation already covers most of the amendment&#146;s proposals and seeks to provide a proper balance between the interests of agency workers, the companies that hire them and the agencies themselves. Subsection (1) of the proposed new Section 6A states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="08051946000185"></a>&#147;Any person carrying on an employment agency or an employment business that places over 30 temporary staff under the age of 18 in the fulfilment of a single contract shall have a duty to protect the welfare of those staff&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051946000174"></a>However, paragraph 20(1)(b) of the Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003, otherwise known as the conduct regulations, already requires the employment agency to make all reasonable practical enquiries prior to the placement,</p>
<ul><a name="08051946000204"></a>&#147;to ensure that it would not be detrimental to the interests of the work-seeker&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08051946000175"></a>to work in the position offered by the hirer. Indeed, that is the case for all placements&#151;not just those covered by the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="80519-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08051946000006"></a>In addition, under paragraphs 24(7) and 24(8) of the conduct regulations, parental consent is required for individuals under the age of 18 where an assignment requires them to live away from home. I understand that the amendment seeks to address, among other things, situations where assignments take young workers away from home for sporting or other events that involve overnight stays. Subsection (2) of the proposed new section requires that an agency or employment business must arrange for a &#147;responsible person&#148; to be present at the workplace for the duration of the assignment. In practice, any agency or employment business that supplies as many as 30 young people on an assignment would also ensure that appropriate arrangements were in place for their supervision and control. The supervision might be carried out by the agency or employment business, or by the business hiring the people. Those supervising would be responsible for ensuring that the protections for workers under health and safety legislation were in place.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60"></a><a name="08051946000186"></a>&#147;from any risks to their health or safety which are a consequence of their lack of experience, or absence of awareness of existing or potential risks or the fact that young persons have not yet ... matured&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051946000008"></a>That definition is in existing legislation. It does not prevent an employer employing a young person where necessary for his or her training, where the young person will be supervised by a competent person and where any risk will be reduced to the lowest reasonably practicable level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08051946000009"></a>We also need to consider enforcement. It would be relatively easy for unscrupulous agencies to get around the requirement in this amendment by ensuring that, where large groups of young workers were supplied, no more than 29 were under 18, by topping up the group with 18 year-olds, or by including in it at least one worker over the age of 18 to act as the &#147;responsible person&#148;. Those measures would seem to achieve the noble Lord&#146;s intentions but they could, in practice, be swiftly ignored.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08051946000010"></a>I am grateful to the noble Lord for drawing attention to the reference suggested by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, of that Australian phrase, &#147;a go-to person&#148;. The noble Lord referred to it having to be a succinct phrase, which is why the Australians won the Ashes. I remind the noble Lord that they are not as good at rugby. However, a go-to person would be impractical; if they were there and doing the job as best they could and an unfortunate situation arose, would they get sued? Who would get sued and who would get prosecuted? How would the facts arise, when most witnesses would have a vested interest in not co-operating? Who, ultimately, would employ the go-to person and would that mean such a person would actually turn up to do the job? Although this is an excellent idea, I am afraid that it would fail completely in practice and not achieve the successful prosecutions that the noble Lord properly requires.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08051946000011"></a>The Government share the noble Lord&#146;s concern that young people under the age of 18 may, when working away from home, come under all kinds of pressures. He recited those in graphic detail: I am grateful to him for that alarmism. There are pressures of a sexual nature; there are those who use illegal drugs or consume excessive quantities of alcohol. However, such matters go beyond the scope of employment legislation, which is what we are here to discuss. In fact, I believe that what the noble Lord, Lord James, suggested goes beyond the scope of the very amendment that he has put before us. No matter how reprehensible or disgusting we find all the situations to which he quite properly referred, and no matter how much we may read of them in the newspapers and thank heavens that it is not our child who is involved, this Bill is not the place to deal with them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08051946000012"></a>Indeed, it is difficult to see what place there would be in the framework to deal seamlessly with this issue. The line between moral conduct and the implication of the law has always been difficult to draw; this is no different. I understand his frustration regarding the

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08051946000013"></a>I would like the facts of the case to come out before we pass judgment. As I understand it&#151;and I, too, have only read newspaper reports&#151;many of the young women who attended the party were not the employees of anyone involved with the party. They were the employees of shops and other businesses in Manchester who were invited to the party; they were told that there would be champagne and that there would be a room available, and they turned up. I am not for one moment suggesting that what happened after that is in any way acceptable&#151;indeed, it is completely disgusting&#151;but, nevertheless, it would be difficult to frame employment legislation, which is what we are here to do, to cover a situation where totally uninterested third parties turn up at a party. The consequence of their actions is dreadful to contemplate&#151;nevertheless, it is not the basis of this proposed legislation.</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08051946000014"></a>The Government aim to ensure that serious sexual offences are treated as a priority in all local areas and that all local agencies use all the tools available to focus on tackling sexual exploitation, especially sexual exploitation of the young. Very tough penalties are currently in force. If these should be more rigorously implemented, that would be the subject for another debate. I thank the noble Lord, Lord James of Blackheath, for raising this important issue but, in the light of my response, I hope he feels that he can withdraw his amendment. This is not the place to deal with his justifiable observation.</p>

I think he said twice that the Government recognise and support the principle but he said three times that it is too difficult to do anything about it. I used to have a boss at Ford Motor Company who had three files on his desk&#151;&#147;In&#148;, &#147;Out&#148; and &#147;Too Hard&#148;. I wonder what the state of the Minister&#146;s desk is if he thinks this issue is &#147;too hard&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"></a><a name="08051946000016"></a>As the Minister rightly said, the circumstances of this issue are almost too important to ignore. He has reasonable grounds for being concerned as to how he should deal with it but, equally, he said we can start with the law. Why does not the department start with the law as it stands and try to apply that to the principle of the case at Manchester United, about which we have been talking openly? In that situation, they were not professional girls employed by any of the agencies concerned but we do not know whether they were recruited by the personnel executives of the agency or by its younger staff. The story is that a fee of &#163;100 was paid to each girl for attendance, some &#163;50 of which had to be given back to the recruiting agent as a thank you for the ticket, which then became quite a saleable commodity in and around the clubs of Manchester that night. In those circumstances, that would be a clear breach of the law because the agents had accepted a fee from the parties seeking the job. That is outlawed by the law confirmed on 17 December.</p>

I accept that the Government are not going to do anything about it at this stage. But the circumstances are so important that the Minister should undertake to come back and tell us where and when it will be the right place to do something about it.

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08051946000039"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to Amendment No. 130. At the close of our last proceedings on 14 May the Government assured us that the new European Gendarmerie Force would not be used on British soil without the explicit consent of Parliament. The first of these two amendments attempts to make sure that after the EU acquires its own legal personality, and more generally as the EU project proceeds, British citizens will not fall foul of the EU crime of xenophobia for insulting it. We must remember the infamous EU arrest warrant which allows British citizens to be automatically extradited to any EU country purely on the say-so of a local magistrate, to stand trial under an alien system, perhaps after a long time on remand, and to face imprisonment for a list of some 32 crimes, one of which is xenophobia, which is not a crime here.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08051946000040"></a>I fear that the EU&#146;s new acquisition of legal personality confirms that it is well on its way to becoming a state. Indeed, it is hard to think of any attribute of a state which the EU does not already possess, or will not possess if the Lisbon treaty becomes law. It has its own flag and anthem, although they are without legal foundation. It has, or is acquiring, its own president, armed forces, foreign secretary, foreign policy, embassies, supreme court, judicial and criminal systems, police, border and asylum controls, not to mention its currency. If any noble Lord can tell me of an attribute of a state

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08051946000041"></a>Those of us who oppose the project of European integration are already often accused of being xenophobes, even in your Lordships&#146; House by otherwise perfectly civilised noble Lords, such as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, and others whose blushes I will spare. Is it so far-fetched to think of such an accusation being made by our new masters in Brussels? I fear not.</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08051946000042"></a>The second amendment in this group, Amendment No. 130, seeks to prevent the EU from levying or harmonising direct tax in the EU, so it also looks some way into the future, although the French are already saying they want to use their forthcoming EU presidency to harmonise corporation tax. The treaties are silent on direct tax, although they control VAT and indirect tax. That has not stopped the Commission and the court imaginatively invading corporation tax based on other clauses in the treaty, particularly those covering the freedom of establishment of businesses throughout the EU. The court has decided that UK companies, such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Cadbury Schweppes and many others, are free to arrange their losses and tax in other EU countries in ways previously barred by the Treasury, which may mean the Treasury now owes a number of British companies quite a lot of money. It would be helpful if the Minister could bring your Lordships up to date with what the latest position is here. How much money have these decisions of the Luxembourg court cost Her Majesty&#146;s Treasury?</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="08051946000043"></a>There are also in the treaty all the provisions controlling the single market. I find it hard to see why, where the European Union wants to control direct tax, it could not use the single market provisions of the treaty to do so. Of course, if the Luxembourg court were to agree with that, there would not be anything we could do about it. I am advised that in Brussels they are thinking of using the social chapters of the treaty to introduce direct tax. Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that, no doubt denying it strongly.</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08051946000044"></a>The longer-term necessity for the EU to harmonise and control national taxation lies deeper. The EU already has its own currency, as I mentioned, but it has no federal budget to speak of, and no currency zone in history has survived for long without the power to tax and distribute from its richer areas to poorer. One thinks here of the distributions from south to north in the United Kingdom and the federal budget in the United States. One remembers, too, the distributions from north to south in Italy and west to east in Germany, which the single currency with its single interest rate does not facilitate. We are already seeing strains in those and other euro economies. The euro was never an economic project. It was designed as the cement to hold the emerging megastate together but it will probably need a substantial federal budget to do so as time goes on. This amendment seeks to warn your Lordships about this position and to prevent it happening. I beg to move.</p>

I have, of course, been following the progress of the Bill, if that is the correct word, and I feel honoured to be part of the Front Bench for the purposes of this evening. I shall not be expressing any views on Amendment no. 129 on xenophobia. I could not, however, let Amendment no. 130 on taxation pass without a brief comment. I have in the past spoken in your Lordships' House about the role of the EU, in particular the European Court of Justice, in relation to taxation, and that will be the focus of my remarks.</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08051946000046"></a>The founding treaty and all subsequent amendments seem clear: direct taxation is not an EU competence and ought to be the sole responsibility of member states. However, it is a fact that the European Court of Justice has been slowly but surely building a common European tax law under the guise, as the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has explained, of freedom of establishment. This is a relatively recent phenomenon. There was only one direct tax case decided by the ECJ in the 1960s, none in the 1970s, four in the 1980s, 40 in the 1990s, but well over 60 by halfway through this decade. There is also a big tail of cases still to be decided. This is thus a problem that has emerged on this Government&#146;s watch, yet they seem set on ignoring it.</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="08051946000047"></a>I shall not weary the Committee with the cases that have been decided by the ECJ. They do not all involve the UK&#146;s taxation system, but they have involved some of the largest companies within the UK: Cadbury Schweppes, British American Tobacco, Marks &amp; Spencer and ICI. For these companies, it makes sound commercial sense to challenge UK tax law if they perceive advantage in so doing. I do not blame them in any degree, because they must try to do the best for their shareholders. If that involves using an EU weapon to challenge the basis of taxation set by our Parliament, it is obvious that they must do so.</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="08051946000048"></a>These cases have created great uncertainty about the UK&#146;s tax code. That is harmful in the context of a tax code which is the longest in the world and among the most complex. From the perspective of the UK Treasury, these cases, often decided against the Government, have created uncertainty about future tax receipts and involved complex Finance Bill provisions to overcome ECJ objections. Many billions of pounds of tax revenues have been, and probably still are, at stake. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, asked how much decisions have cost. I would add: how much is still at risk?</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08051946000049"></a>I have talked about the cases brought by companies, but the Commission, too, can attack member states&#146; tax regimes. It has expressed a willingness to be &#147;proactive&#148; in this, which is a chilling prospect.</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08051946000050"></a>I cannot begin to understand why the Government have not fought strongly against the concept of the ECJ&#146;s ability to overturn what our Parliament decides on tax. It ought to be in the interests of the Government, as the guardian of the UK&#146;s finances, to do so.</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08051946000051"></a>It ought also to be in the interests of the Government to preserve the competitiveness of the UK and our ability to differentiate ourselves from the rest of the

A part of any country&#146;s competitiveness includes tax competitiveness, which is well accepted by all those organisations which draw up international league tables of competitiveness. I hope that there would be no argument in this Chamber that tax competition is good for society as a whole, since it works with the grain of global free markets and against those who try to erect barriers to trade.</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="08051946000052"></a>Tax competition also provides a healthy check on the Governments&#146; ability to raise taxes too high. We are seeing the salutary effect of tax competition at the moment, as major UK corporates signal loud and clear to the Government that the UK tax system has gone too far and made the UK an uncompetitive environment for companies which hold significant interests overseas. The Government have taken their eye off the ball of tax competitiveness for the UK. My party, when we return to government, will strive to restore our tax competitiveness. We will need maximum freedoms, including freedoms within the EU, to achieve that.</p>

<a name="80519-0010.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="08051946000053"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, will appreciate that the picture I have painted requires a more comprehensive set of statutory defences against the incursions of the EU into the tax affairs of the UK than are provided by his amendment. His Amendment No. 130 is useful in ruling out the harmonisation of rates of direct taxation and the imposition of direct taxes, and I support it to that extent. It does not, however, deal with the most damaging problem of the ECJ&#146;s ability to strike down our tax laws and interfere in the structure of our taxes.

Xenophobia is a feeling, an emotion, like anger, anxiety and fear, to which it has some affiliation. Conversely, it is in the same league as joy, exhilaration and contentment. In other words, it is a thought, not a deed. Democracies have not hitherto had thought crimes on their statute books, nor have authoritarian regimes. Thought crimes are the preserve of totalitarian states. If by any chance some other EU states want, perhaps without realising the full enormity of what they are doing, to copy Stalin, Mao and Hitler in this regard, so be it, but we in this country should not contemplate it for one single moment.</p>

Before I came into the Chamber, I looked up in the <I>Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</I><I></I>the definition of &#147;xenophobia&#148;. Volume 2 defines it as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66"></a><a name="08051946000192"></a>&#147;A deep antipathy to foreigners or to foreign things&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051946000176"></a>That is all. Are we now to be told by the European Union that we must not have an antipathy to something or to some people? Are we not allowed to dislike other people, even if it is in a way that is perhaps a little extreme? This really is going too far.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="08051946000057"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Pearson, showed quite clearly in his opening remarks how such a policy could affect us if it were adopted under the rules of the Lisbon treaty. It could very easily enter our law, which would be against everything that this country has stood for over a long period&#151;although, as a result of some of the legislation which has been enacted during the past couple of decades, people now say to themselves, &#147;Oops, I should not have said that&#148;, after saying something which is perhaps not politically correct. We should not tolerate that in a free society. One can understand why people on the Continent&#151;in Germany, Austria, France and places such as that&#151;might need legislation about holocaust denial and xenophobia: they have to assuage their consciences for the wars and murders that have taken place over a long period. We do not happen to have to assuage our consciences in that way. Therefore, we do not need to put people in this country at risk as a result of a law against xenophobia.</p>

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="08051946000058"></a>As far as taxation is concerned, the Government will of course reply, &#147;We have no intention of imposing or allowing the EU to impose, or have any say in, direct taxation&#148;. Well, ask the European Parliament about that, because it, as I understand it, believes that the institutions of the European Union should have the power to raise direct tax for the financing of the European Union. The matter is on the agenda already. Moreover, many policies now enacted by the European Union have implications for our direct taxation. I do not want to give a great list of them, but the one about which people are very concerned at the moment is the cost of the landfill directive, which directs the Government of this and all other member countries to reduce their amount of landfill by 2016. The result has been impositions by local authorities through bin taxes and so on, which are direct taxes on the people of this country.</p>

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="08051946000059"></a>I do not want to detain the Committee any longer. But I believe that we have to be on our guard that the taxation which is already dictated by the European Union should not extend any further at all. The noble Baroness from the Opposition Benches listed a number of ways in which, perhaps without our realising what is happening, there could be implications for direct tax. I therefore support these two amendments.</p>

I intervene briefly on Amendment No. 129 on xenophobia. I think that I have always been very careful and courteous in my interventions during this long Committee stage, but I am inclined to say that this amendment verges a little on the bizarre. The suggestion here that an offence will be created does not seem to me among the more probable events which may result from the ratification of the treaty of Lisbon. If that is the case, as I believe it is, I think that we should abstain from inserting new clauses. We are in the period of discussion in the Committee where we insert new clauses, some of merit and some of less merit. This clause is certainly among the least probable results of the treaty process.</p>

During that inquiry we discovered that the coalition that had got that on to the EU agenda and into the Amsterdam treaty had been substantially led by British non-governmental organisations. We took evidence from a range of bodies. I remember the CBI saying how strongly it supported this addition to the EU treaty on the grounds that British banks and companies, which increasingly employ bright young Asians, had discovered that in some other financial centres in the European Union, these bright young Asian employees were suffering various forms of discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="08051946000062"></a>Once again we have had a debate in which it has been assumed that it is those people over there who are imposing something on us when actually this was substantially a British initiative. Incidentally, we and the Irish&#151;for solid and painful reasons concerned with a rather different history than the one which the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, suggests&#151;have some of the strongest anti-discrimination laws in the European Union. We have had to develop them because of Protestant discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. It is not true that we have not discriminated at all in this country. The painful implications of the treaty of Amsterdam have been felt in countries such as Austria, Italy and Germany, where the rules against discrimination are much weaker. I just wish to set the record straight on that. This is not an attack by those wicked people in Brussels on pure Englishmen. It is something with which we, as in so many other areas, had a great deal to do.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08051946000063"></a>I was interested in what the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said on taxation. Earlier today we were discussing another dimension of international tax law and the question of tax havens. In answering me the Minister praised the work of the OECD&#151;the OECD, not the EU&#151;on getting at the problem of offshore financial centres and tightening controls against the misuse of offshore financial centre. We are all familiar with the internationalisation of the economy and of companies, with the constant battle between clever accounting companies&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, will be familiar with those&#151;advising companies and banks on how to avoid national taxation and Governments trying to maintain their tax base.</p>

I was making no case for tax evasion at all. It has nothing to do with tax havens. It is question of whether there is an EU ability to change UK tax law. It is a very narrow point but a very powerful point which I think is relevant to the Bill.</p>

Part of the problem is that as companies operate more across the single market, the opportunities for using the national laws of one country to get around the national laws of another become stronger. If one accepts that tax competition allows some Governments to undercut others beyond a certain degree then we will in time have some problems inside the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08051946000066"></a>We must address the tax base. The integration of the European economy has certain implications not for the harmonisation of tax rates but for the agreement of rules of the tax base. I recall that the Leader of the Conservative Party, David Cameron, made a speech the other week in which he talked about formal regular contributions within NATO which would be taxation on member Governments of NATO to contribute to common NATO operations abroad. That is taking us down another road towards shared contributions within international organisations. That is partly because we are now doing more together. The world does not stand still and the idea that somehow problems of tax avoidance and tax evasion can be dealt with entirely at the national level in the global economy is an illusion.</p>

They are clear. I want to speak briefly to Amendment No. 130. The noble Baroness made an interesting speech in which she took us through a series of hypotheses of what might be the position if the powers of the European Court of Justice continue to be used in the way that they are, but those examples are not in any way relevant to the hypothesis put forward in Amendment No. 130, which deals exclusively with direct taxation. There is a real debate to be had about indirect taxation: in particular, as I have said before in your Lordships&#146; House, the indirect taxation that we have through the own-resources decision is increasingly budgetarily irrelevant. It is reducing less and less resource and it is increasingly fraud prone. There needs to be a serious taxation discussion about the role of the own-resources decision and how it needs to be replaced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08051946000068"></a>Amendment No.130 deals with direct taxation. When the Minister replies to this brief debate, I hope that he will confirm that any of the changes suggested in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, are not possible without harmonisation methods to bring them about, and that requires unanimous support in the Council of Ministers. We are all clear&#151;</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08051946000071"></a>As I was saying, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made it very clear that questions of direct taxation are issues on which the British Government will not give their assent.

I am familiar with the line of cases to which she refers, which have impinged on the tax base. However, I think that she does less than justice to the European Court of Justice in failing to observe that the reason for that encroachment is to achieve an important European objective that we share&#151;that is, the freedom of establishment and the freedom of movement of goods, persons and corporations across the European Union. Whether that balance is right or wrong can be argued about, but it is not just a wilful tax grab that is taking place; it has been an attempt to protect an important part of the European single market. Noble Lords may think that it goes too far or not far enough, but that is the motivation behind it, and to fail to refer to that seems to me to verge on the misleading.</p>

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08051946000073"></a>Whether that is right or wrong, the relevant point is not whether that intrusion into the British tax base is sensible or desirable; it is whether the treaty of Lisbon does anything to further that process or could be distorted so to do. Nothing that has been said so far leads me to believe that anything in the treaty that we are currently debating could conceivably have that effect. If that effect arises as a result of the Court decisions, the Court decisions are based on other premises and not this treaty&#151;because the treaty has not come into existence. I see nothing in the treaty that would enable the Court to go further in the direction that my noble friend deplores. For that reason, this proposal is at best otiose and at worst misleading.</p>

I have to mention again the provisions of the single market.

<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08051946000079"></a>Amendment No. 129 would insert a clause stating that neither the Bill nor the treaty will create an offence of xenophobia for which a UK citizen could be prosecuted in the UK or elsewhere. The UK Government deplore racist and xenophobic behaviour and we already have tough national laws in this area. As such, we also support the fact that the prevention and combating of such conduct is one of the aims of the Union, as reflected in the general provisions of the JHA chapter of the treaty. We will continue to work with member states to prosecute those who break our laws in this area.</p>

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08051946000080"></a>I shall give a short history lesson. The first EU measure on combating racism and xenophobia was adopted by the Council in 1996. That measure will be replaced by a new framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia, which, similarly, has been agreed by the Council on the basis of the existing treaties and is expected to be formally adopted this year. This new framework decision requires all member states to have in their laws basic offences and penalties for such conduct. We support this; it is important to make it clear that we will not tolerate such behaviour within Europe. In negotiating that instrument&#151;and this is significant&#151;we ensured that the UK&#146;s domestic threshold for criminal liability in this field would apply. That means that for criminal liability to be triggered, any behaviour must be carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred and must be threatening, abusive or insulting or likely to disturb the peace.</p>

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08051946000081"></a>In terms of UK law, there are various relevant pieces of legislation: the Public Order Act 1986 contains a number of offences covering Acts intended or likely to start racial hatred. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced nine racially or religiously aggravated offences, which make available to courts higher penalties when there is evidence of racist or religious motivation or hostility in connection with an offence. Most recently, the Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006 created an offence of incitement to racial hatred. That piece of legislation came into effect on 1 October 2007.</p>

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08051946000082"></a>As for the extradition and prosecution of UK citizens in other member states under the framework decision on the European arrest warrant, to which the noble Lord referred in slightly disparaging terms, we will extradite to another member state individuals to be prosecuted in that member state for offences committed there. This could include an offence involving racism and xenophobia. Similarly, we would expect to be assisted by other member states in bringing to justice individuals who had committed offences under our rules in the UK&#151;for instance, in this context, offences under the legislation that I mentioned a moment ago. Any new measures on racism and xenophobia proposed under the Lisbon treaty would be subject to the UK&#146;s opt-in, which, as noble Lords are well aware, applies throughout the justice and home affairs chapter. We therefore have clear safeguards in this area, were a measure to be proposed that would not be in the UK&#146;s national interest.</p>

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08051946000083"></a>I did not hear the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, say this, but if he has a concern for himself or for any others who feel as he does that expressing

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08051946000084"></a>I finish by saying that the Lisbon treaty sets out a closed list of areas of crime for which the Union can set minimum offences and penalties. That list does not include racism and xenophobia. Were the Union to decide to legislate further to set minimum offences and penalties on racism and xenophobia, the Council would have to agree, unanimously, to add those two matters to that list. The opt-in would apply to that decision to add to the list, as well as to any measure subsequently proposed on the basis of the inclusion of racism and xenophobia on the list. This is a consequence of the welcome greater clarity in this treaty as to where the Union has competence to legislate in this field.</p>

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08051946000085"></a>Amendment No. 130 relates to direct taxation by EU institutions and harmonisation of direct tax rates across the EU. This amendment is unnecessary. With regard to the first part, there is no suggestion in the Lisbon treaty or elsewhere in the EU treaties that EU institutions should be able to impose a tax directly on EU citizens. So far as concerns the second part of the amendment, government policy on tax harmonisation is crystal clear: harmonisation of direct taxes is unnecessary and undesirable. Since we have ensured that decisions on tax matters must be taken by unanimity, we will be able to prevent any proposals that attempt to bring about such harmonisation.</p>

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08051946000086"></a>In a word, the Government have a clear position on EU tax matters: decisions should be taken by unanimity and open, flexible and competitive national tax systems allied with renewed international co-operation, not tax harmonisation, are the right response to the challenge of a global economy. We have no intention of changing that position. Since unanimity is needed for any taxation measure, we believe that we will be able to maintain the position with our EU partners.</p>

<a name="80519-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08051946000087"></a>I briefly mention the role of the European Court of Justice in taxation matters. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Brittan, whose experience of the matter is so much greater than mine. The ECJ, in very simple terms, is responsible for giving definitive interpretations of the treaties. In the field of indirect tax its ruling clarifies the large body of EU law on VAT and indirect taxation. For direct tax where, as I have just emphasised, policy rests with individual governments, the Court&#146;s role is to ensure that national rules remain within the parameters set by or under the treaty, either in the small number of directives concerning direct tax or in the general principles laid down in the treaty. I repeat: the Government will defend resolutely the UK&#146;s tax laws against challenge before the ECJ. On that basis, I hope the noble Lord will not press his amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08051946000094"></a>I was merely trying to draw these amendments to a close in the happy conclusion that the Government have said that it will not be possible to be prosecuted, extradited or anything for the crime of xenophobia when it entails speaking against or insulting the European Union, especially as the project proceeds. My noble friend Lord Stoddart may well be right. As I said, I think we need to look at <I>Hansard</I> and come back on Report if necessary.</p>

I am reasonably sure that as this project proceeds, using the single-market provisions of the treaty which are under qualified majority voting or the social policy provisions of the treaty, the European Union will get its tentacles round more of our direct taxation than it has already done through the judicial activism of the Court.

<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="08051946000098"></a>Clause 3 [<I>Changes of terminology</I>]:</p>

<p><a name="st_151"></a>
<a name="08051946000099"></a><a name="80519-0012.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80519-0012.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051946000415"></a>Lord Hunt of Wirral</b> moved Amendment No. 131:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67"></a><a name="08051946000193"></a> Clause 3, page 2, line 12, leave out paragraph (c) and insert&#151;</p>
</ul>&#147;(c) may be made only if a draft of the order has been&#151;(i) laid before Parliament; and(ii) approved by a resolution of each House&#148;
<a name="80519-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="08051946000100"></a>The noble Lord said: Clause 3 deals with changes in terminology and the necessary and consequent alterations in both terminology and numbering in UK legislation that the treaty of Lisbon makes necessary. Amendment No. 131 is in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford. It is about parliamentary accountability. How should the procedure be dealt with to ensure that Parliament scrutinises any necessary changes which come forward? Our concerns with Clause 3 centre on the legal confusion and unintended consequences that might result from hasty and unscrutinised amendments to UK laws.</p>

<a name="80519-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="08051946000101"></a>It has become a general principle that if the Government wish to take Henry VIII powers to amend primary legislation by order, then we as a House look at that very seriously indeed and want to scrutinise it very closely. In this case the sensitivity of the legal ramifications of the changes surely make the case that there should at least be affirmative parliamentary approval.</p>

<a name="80519-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08051946000102"></a>The changes are consequent on the collapse of the three pillars into the overarching term &#147;the European Union&#148;, the EU. The European Community will no longer have separate legal status; nor will the common foreign and security policy. Police and criminal justice co-operation will be handled separately. The Government have given various assurances about the efficacy of the CFSP exemption in Clause 2 and of the safeguards around the introduction of further police and judicial co-operation, about which many noble Lords have expressed deep concern. The differences of view expressed in the other place on the potential effects of these changes reinforce those concerns.</p>

<a name="80519-0012.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08051946000103"></a>I do not want to go into all the ramifications of these changes. They were dealt with in extensive debate in the other place. I want to confine the debate about the amendment, if that is possible, to the procedural mechanics of how the changes should be effected.</p>

<a name="80519-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08051946000104"></a>Of course, the amendment in no way prevents necessary drafting changes being made. All it does is give an opportunity for Parliament to reassure itself that they are as innocuous as the Minister will no doubt claim. However, we need a little more than just assurances.</p>

<a name="80519-0012.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08051946000105"></a>The amendment says that, under Clause 3(5), if there is to be an order under subsection (4), it shall be made by statutory instrument. Paragraph (c) says that it shall be subject to annulment&#151;the negative resolution procedure. The amendment would insert a new paragraph (c) containing the words,</p>
<ul><a name="08051946000205"></a>&#147;may be made only if a draft of the order has been&#151;</ul> (i) laid before Parliament; and (ii) approved by a resolution of each House."
<a name="80519-0012.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08051946000106"></a>I followed the debate in the other place very carefully indeed. I saw that this was a major issue, as it is&#151;and should be&#151;in this House. References to the European Community are to be replaced with references to the  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1317"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1317</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>European Union. On the face of it, that seems a simple process, until one looks at the context in which all these changes are to be made. Looking at the speeches of many Members of the other place, one is concerned about how wide-ranging these changes might become and about the wonderful law of unintended consequences. There is therefore a good case for Parliament to be involved in scrutinising the changes.</p>

<a name="80519-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08051946000107"></a>I was impressed by the speech in the other place of Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat Member for East Dunbartonshire, who not only said how strongly she agreed with the spirit of the amendment, but clearly stated that the Liberal Democrat party would support the amendment, because it is,</p>
<ul><a name="08051946000206"></a>&#147;in favour of proper scrutiny in the House&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051946000177"></a>She pointed out that all the amendment did was propose the sensible change of moving from the negative to the affirmative resolution procedure. She expressed herself well when she added that the amendment both proposes that we should keep:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68"></a><a name="08051946000194"></a>&#147;Ministers on their toes more and ensures proper scrutiny&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051946000178"></a>What a wonderful objective, which I wholly endorse. She added how much she welcomed the opportunity to join forces with the Opposition:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69"></a><a name="08051946000195"></a>&#147;I therefore welcome the perhaps rare opportunity to support an amendment tabled by the right hon. Member for Wells, as it would enable us to have greater power to scrutinise various aspects of the Bill&#148;. &#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 3/3/08; col. 1487.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051946000179"></a>I say this because there is a rumour that the Liberal Democrats in this place have decided to support the Government not only on amendments with which they disagree, but on amendments with which they agree, with which their party agrees, and which their party moved in the other place. This is currently no more than a rumour, and we are about to put it to the test. I say, by way of warning to whoever is going to speak from the Liberal Democrat Benches, that such was the persuasive speech of Jo Swinson that it caused her party leader, Mr Clegg, accompanied by Dr Vincent Cable, Mr Edward Davey, Danny Alexander and Chris Huhne&#151;the list is endless&#151;to swarm into the Lobby with the Conservative Party in favour of the amendment. I therefore anticipate with profound optimism that we shall get support on the amendment.</p>

<a name="80519-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08051946000108"></a>It is important for parliamentary democracy that we should have proper scrutiny in this place. I therefore have much pleasure in begging to move.</p>

In the late 1950s, the three were merged into the European Economic Community. I think that he will find that, at the time of the referendum, the people of this country wisely decided to remain members of the European Economic Community.</p>

That is what it was known as and what, in 1975, I thought that we were debating; it was called the Common Market. No doubt he is technically correct, but that is how it started and how it still is in the minds of most people. As I was saying, we have now progressed through all these stages towards the European Union, which is what we have today. Any use of earlier stalking horses has now been banned.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70"></a><a name="08051946000196"></a>&#147;This is a Henry VIII power, but its scope is narrowly confined to two specific kinds of consequential amendment. We consider neither the delegation nor the level of scrutiny to be inappropriate&#148;.</p>

If it is not accepted it will mean that any terminology&#151;terminology is important in my view&#151;that is altered will be put into operation and under the acquis cannot then be repealed before a Motion for annulment can take place. That is why the amendment is so important. It asks that before any terminology that might adversely affect this country is put in place, Parliament should have a say that means something rather than just expressing an opinion. I support the amendment and urge every Member of the Committee to do the same if they want to protect parliamentary power and privilege.</p>

The Bill provides for references in UK domestic legislation to the &#147;Communities&#148; to be treated as references to the &#147;Union&#148;. The schedule sets out other changes in terminology in the European Communities Act 1972 and the Interpretation Act 1978 needed to reflect the change from European Community to European Union.</p>

<a name="80519-0012.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08051946000121"></a>Other consequential changes may be required in other pieces of legislation. That is why the Bill contains a power for the Government to update terminology and numbering in existing legislation by order, subject to annulment by resolution of either House of Parliament. That is a power to make purely technical changes. For example, the article numbers in the treaties will change on entry into force of the Lisbon treaty. The &#147;co-decision procedure&#148; is renamed the &#147;ordinary legislative procedure&#148;. These are not changes of substance, but may need to be updated in UK law to reflect the change of terminology. I repeat that this will not mean any change of substance in terms of existing UK legislation. It is a purely technical updating exercise. Clause 3(4) makes it clear that the power to update references in existing legislation is limited to changes,</p>
<ul><a name="08051946000207"></a>&#147;to reflect changes in terminology or numbering arising out of the Treaty of Lisbon&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80519-0012.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08051946000122"></a>This order-making power is necessary to avoid any legal uncertainty as a result of changes to terminology. The negative resolution procedure is appropriate in this case. Otherwise each House would have to approve every single such consequential change. We believe that we have got it right. Clause 3 avoids that exhaustive&#151;not to say exhausting&#151;exercise. As a safeguard against the unlikely event that this or a future Government would try to exceed the very limited power to make orders set out in the clause, it is clearly provided that any orders are subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.</p>

It is important to me, too. My noble friend Lord Tugendhat reminded us how it all started, and in some ways his words are a caution to us all. When we joined the Common Market, as it was then called, there were three treaties: the European Coal and Steel Community treaty signed in 1951; the European Atomic Energy Community treaty, usually known as EURATOM; and the European Economic Community treaty, usually abbreviated to the EEC, set up by the Treaty of Rome in 1957. Collectively those treaties form what were known as the European Communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08051946000130"></a>I am grateful to the Minister for explaining why he opposed this amendment. He did so because he said that we would be led into an exhausting procedure. He said it in such a tired way that there was a wave of sympathy, mainly because he is such a hard-working Minister. I then asked myself, what am I proposing that will exhaust him? It is merely that instead of

I cannot see that that would cause the Minister a substantial period of exhaustion. Given his good track record in these matters, I do not think that it presents him with any problem at all.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08051946000131"></a>We come back to whether our Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee is right in saying that this will be a strictly technical area. I would not have moved this amendment if I could agree with that 100 per cent and accept it as fact. I think that we are dealing with what could be a highly complicated area. The large number of changes that will be made as we move from one terminology to the other could have unintended consequences, which is why I proposed this amendment&#151;and, presumably, is why the whole of the Liberal Democrat Party voted for an identical amendment in the other place. I am not aware of any Liberal Democrat in the other place who supported the Government. They all voted for this amendment&#151;and I agree with them. However, what I do not agree with is the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, accusing me of playing games. He said that he was not interested in playing games with the Opposition. I tell him that this is not a game: it is a serious issue. It is all about parliamentary accountability. On many occasions, I have supported his noble friends who have proposed identical amendments on moving from the negative to the affirmative resolution procedure, and I will do so again. However, I do not regard it as a game. I regard it as serious parliamentary politics; holding the Government to account.</p>

I am in the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, who owns St Martin&#146;s Theatre, where &#147;The Mousetrap&#148; is the longest running show in town. So far as concerns this amendment, I will tell you whodunit&#151;they done it! The Liberal Democrats did it in another place&#151;they supported it and voted for it. I reckon that they are in danger of becoming the longest running farce in Westminster. We shall now see what they do and judge them accordingly. I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08051946000143"></a>The amendment should gain the support of most liberally minded people, but what I say next, I say more in hope than from experience. I hope that the Liberal Democrat party will support the amendment, as it did with vigour in the other place. In the words of its spokesman, the eloquent Mr Davey:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74"></a><a name="08051946000200"></a>&#147;We intend to support the right hon. Gentleman&#146;s amendment&#148;&#151;</p>

<p><a name="08051946000182"></a>No doubt we will learn later that something has changed, although we do not quite understand what. It seems to be pretty straightforward that parliamentary control is parliamentary control and belief in it is belief in it, but no doubt some contortions will be devised to tell us different. Even so, it is sad that we cannot rely on those of a liberal slant of mind to support what is clearly both liberal and democratic and in favour of the good parliamentarian&#146;s cause.</p>

<a name="80519-0013.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_285"></a><a name="08051946000144"></a>These areas, as Mr Davey describes them&#151;the so-called passerelle or ratchet provisions&#151;are of widespread concern because they provide prominently and precisely for the treaty to be self-amending and therefore obviously, in the case of any such self-amendments, to reduce the powers of member states and national parliaments, perhaps not unilaterally but by methods which do not necessarily embrace parliaments sufficiently. They could do so on a substantial scale.</p>

<a name="80519-0013.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_286"></a><a name="08051946000145"></a>I note in passing that the words here are identical to the words in the rejected constitution treaty, as are almost all the words in this treaty. When they first appeared, they were strongly opposed by Ministers, and it verges on the insulting to be told again and again that they are not the same words when they patently are. The Government have a lot more explaining to do to try to sustain their weak case that all this is somehow different from what went before. Jack Straw,

Mr Denis MacShane MP,  as he passed colourfully through his Foreign and Commonwealth Office ministerial role, added:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75"></a><a name="08051946000201"></a>&#147;We think that a self-amending constitutional treaty does not make a lot of sense&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Standing Committee on the Intergovernmental Conference, 20/10/03; col. 20.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051946000183"></a>Nor does it. Most noble Lords know that. It certainly invalidates the misleading claims by the Prime Minister that the Lisbon treaty marks the end of a period of EU institutional change. On the contrary, if passed, it would mark the beginning of a process of institutional change by the self-amending process and by the clear reading of comments being made throughout Europe that more institutional changes and integration are needed. Indeed, there is even some talk of the next round of treaty-making on top of this treaty, which will have its own internal momentum. Looking ahead, we could be in for a substantial volume of further change rather than a settled period without institutional change. It could change the position quite radically, even on common foreign and security policy, over and above the fact that there are 11 areas where QMV already intrudes in foreign-policy issues as proposed in the treaty, despite Ministers&#146; constant assurances to the contrary.</p>

<a name="80519-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_287"></a><a name="08051946000146"></a>The Government were obviously worried about this and about safeguards. Their worry is reflected in Clause 6, which provides that a motion must be approved by both Houses before Ministers go along with the passerelle self-amending procedure&#151;the new simplified revision process. Our contention behind the amendment is that that is not nearly enough. A treaty change which plainly transfers powers away from our Parliament requires not just a motion in the two Houses but an Act of Parliament. We are not the only ones who say that. The Commons Foreign Affairs Committee&#151;an excellent committee I had some connection with in the past&#151;recommended, in a very thorough review, that all treaty changes under passerelle procedure should be the subject of primary legislation. Is it to be pushed aside as just another committee&#151;&#147;never mind about it&#148;? Incidentally, I notice that our own EU Committee in your Lordships&#146; House seemed rather more content with the proposal that there should be a mere motion in both Houses. But the Foreign Affairs Committee of the other place is a powerful and respected Committee and carries enormous weight. I do not think its very firm, unqualified proposition that primary legislation is needed in this area can just be disregarded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08051946000148"></a>This is just an amendment which seeks to correct that situation. It does not alter the treaty. No one can say this is wrecking the treaty.

The European Union Committee has considered these matters and in the absence of its chairman&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell&#151;has asked me to say that it did report on them in paragraphs 315 and 316. It is rather important to look at the position of your Lordships&#146; House as far as the present situation is concerned alongside the situation at an earlier stage and in the legislation which was prepared to be put forward for the constitutional treaty. On that occasion the powers of the House of Lords were extremely limited. When the Prime Minister returned from the discussions on this treaty, he initially suggested that it would be for only the House of Commons to agree or not agree the use of a passerelle. It was only following questioning within your Lordships&#146; committee that the Minister, Mr Murphy, responded. When the Bill appeared for the first time, the House of Lords was given an equivalent power in this matter. Therefore, I think that the first thing to say is that there is a significant increase in the position of the House of Lords as far as this is concerned, compared with earlier proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08051946000151"></a>The second thing that your Lordships need to consider is that any proposal to use the passerelle procedure to carry a small alteration to the treaty would be by means of a European Union instrument, which would necessarily have to go through the scrutiny process of your Lordships&#146; European Union Committee. I cannot say what the committee would do in those circumstances, but it is not implausible that it would wish to have an inquiry into any attempt to change the provisions of the treaty, and would wish to make a report to this House. The idea that the parliamentary procedure that would occur if the passerelle were to be used would be that of a normal statutory instrument, which under a convention goes through this House without opposition, is something of an exaggeration.</p>

However, I may be doing the committee an injustice, as I have had only a short time to look at the two passages that he cited.</p>

If that is in order, I should like to make a few remarks on it.</p>

<a name="80519-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08051946000156"></a>The purpose of the amendment in my name and the names of my noble friend Lord Pearson and the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, is to put flesh on the bones of the spurious claim that the Lisbon treaty gives more powers to national parliaments. Our amendment would require Ministers, before they cement their negotiating position on any proposed EU law, to get approval from a Joint Committee of both Houses and/or from both Houses of Parliament. Should the Joint Committee wish, it may refer matters to debate in both Houses.</p>

<a name="80519-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="08051946000157"></a>Let me remind the Committee why I say that the claim that the Lisbon treaty gives or returns powers to national parliaments is entirely bogus. Under the terms of the two protocols in the treaty, which I believe that the Minister confirmed the other day are binding, parliaments will have the right to consider whether Commission proposals are compliant with subsidiarity. Parliaments have eight weeks to consider Commission proposals, which is a marginal improvement over the six weeks that were proposed in the constitution. I suppose that you could call it an improvement, but it is not worth arguing about; as Dr Johnson would say, it is like arguing the difference between a louse and a flea. If one-third of the 27 national Parliaments consider that there has been no such compliance, it may be sent back to the Commission, which can simply decide to maintain its proposal if it wishes. How can that possibly be interpreted as strengthening the role of national parliaments? It does not.</p>

<a name="80519-0013.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_294"></a><a name="08051946000158"></a>Under Protocol 2, a simple majority of all national parliaments&#151;14 in this case&#151;may require the Commission to review a proposal. Again, the Commission

Its reasons for doing so would have to be put to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, and a majority of those august bodies may then decide whether to support the parliaments. Those are very high hurdles indeed and, again, simply cannot realistically be described as giving more powers back to national parliaments. You can argue&#151;as I would&#151;that such proposals are actively damaging. They give the appearance of accountability without the substance.</p>

<a name="80519-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_295"></a><a name="08051946000159"></a>The problem is that our own system of scrutinising parliamentary legislation in this country is not satisfactory either. We have the European Union Scrutiny Committee in the other place, or our own EU Select Committee. The only power that either of these committees has is that of scrutiny reserve. In theory this means that they can ask the Government not to approve EU legislation until it has been debated in Parliament. This simply has not worked very well, has it? The problem is not only the amount of legislation or the limited powers of the EU committees, but the propensity of Governments to use the scrutiny override reserve and proceed to legislate without either House of Parliament having had a chance to debate it or, indeed, often to scrutinise it properly.</p>

<a name="80519-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08051946000160"></a>Since 2001 the Government have used the scrutiny override 346 times. In 2005 alone, it was used 52 times in the European Union Scrutiny Committee and 28 times in the Select Committee of your Lordships&#146; House. I asked a question about that last summer and the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, who answered for the Government then, denied that there was any gap in European scrutiny. She said that the Government,</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76"></a><a name="08051946000202"></a>&#147;will continue to account for their actions by writing to the chairman of the House of Lords European Union Committee&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/5/07; col. 124.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051946000161"></a>I am not sure how that answers the question. Merely writing to the chairman is not a particularly strong measure and does not answer the concerns that have been expressed in the Chamber this evening and earlier about the powers of Parliament to monitor, scrutinise and debate European legislation before it comes into force. The reality, I am afraid, is that EU proposals can become law without being properly scrutinised. For example, again in 2005, rather astonishingly, the EU produced 1,691 pieces of legislation, be they regulations, directives or decisions. Those passed into UK law without full scrutiny or, in some cases, any scrutiny at all. That really is quite astonishing.</p>

<a name="80519-0013.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08051946000162"></a>Our amendments would mean that the scrutiny process is much stronger and more accountable than the current system. It would include both Houses of Parliament and require parliamentary approval of ministerial positions. It would be much harder for Ministers to override, and would mean that Parliament would control the position of Ministers in EU negotiations. Going back to my question last summer and today&#146;s debate, I was happy to see that I got a little support from the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, who said:</p>
<ul>

Footbridges are important because they enable you to cross the line. In this Bill, they are important because we are dealing with clauses which have been inserted by the Government that are additional to the simple insertion of the treaty provisions into the European Communities Act; that is, they are important enough to require special clauses. They are also important because they go beyond earlier treaties. The two general amending provisions to simplify revision procedure so that things could be changed without an intergovernmental conference&#151;they are in Article 156 of the treaty&#151;go beyond previous treaties and legislation. It is also extremely important that what the Government have proposed should be adequate to ensure that we do not get an unwanted crossing of a line, which is sometimes described as creep in the provisions of European Union legislation.</p>

<a name="80519-0013.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08051946000164"></a>The Government have at least two forms of blockage on the potential use of these articles. The first is that unanimity, which has not been mentioned but is very important, applies, so that the British position can be protected. Secondly, there is the parliamentary procedure which we are discussing. Whether it is sufficient to have a Motion moved in the House, and each House agreeing to that Motion without amendment, is a matter of judgment. This is an important issue and I believe that the Government have put sufficient belt and braces in the Bill. If we are not satisfied, we are running some risk with these, what I shall continue to call, footbridge provisions, and not classify myself for the moment as a francophone Lord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08051946000166"></a>It seems that there is a real problem for Members of this House and, particularly, for Members of the House of Commons. We consistently move forward with greater European integration against the will of the British people. We can argue about particular opinion polls at particular times, but there is a steady opposition to what we are doing in Parliament, which has been going on, I would say, since the early 1980s, which is a long time for Parliament to be in opposition

<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08051946000167"></a>As this legislation goes through, we need to be very careful. I note that the leader of the Opposition said in a speech the other day that these European questions were sixth or seventh in lists of priorities. That may be true in a straight question to people, but opinion polls often do not gauge the deeper issues. In my view, many people in this country judged that the present Prime Minister had a good instinct on the European question&#151;he demonstrated that over the euro, when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer&#151;but he is in grave danger of losing that. I believe that is an important, deep issue on which people assess both individuals and political parties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08051946000168"></a>We are discussing something here that the noble Lord who just spoke may not fully appreciate, although he was a distinguished civil servant. Yet if I took him back to his early days of membership of the Civil Service, I suspect that he, at least in another place, spent some time in the Box late at night while listening to debates. It is a fact of parliamentary experience that the power of delay&#151;the powers to keep Ministers up into the small hours of the morning, and to use every legitimate purpose to delay legislation&#151;has been, over the centuries, a crucial power of the House of Commons. It also does not require a great constitutional expert to look at the present House of Commons and watch what has happened when its so-called reforms have taken place. Night after night, I pass by and look up instinctively to Big Ben to see whether the light is there and the House is still sitting. Night after night, I notice that it is no longer sitting. I listen to all of those speeches about parliamentary reform and the value of Select Committees, and I ask myself: what is happening in Parliament? I look at the legislation: a factory of it goes through, day after day. Nobody has seen more legislation than the Home Office, it appears, and what is the end result of that process?</p>

<a name="80519-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08051946000169"></a>I sat in Parliament within a large majority. In 1966 to 1970 we had a majority of over 90, and we could get most of the legislation that we wanted through. Even then, however, there were great debates about using the guillotine. When that was introduced, it was considered something that one used rarely&#151;knowing full well that there would be a sustained public row and that the newspapers would almost always be against it. You would hesitate before you did it. Now, we see Bills timetabled from the start, with no need for rows about the guillotine. That factory down the Corridor continues to spout out legislation after legislation, which also contributes to the public mood of disillusion with politics. There are many factors behind that; I do not claim that Europe is No. 1, or even that the legislative factory down the Corridor is No. 2. There are other reasons, with which we are clearly familiar, including those connected with corruption.</p>

<a name="80519-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08051946000170"></a>What that all means is that this Committee has an opportunity tonight to try and restore the normal way of holding a Government to account, which is through primary legislation. It is not as if that is without precedent. I have mentioned this before: I do so again. On the statute book, in the European Assembly Elections  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1330"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column 1330</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Act 1978, which has since been absorbed into other legislation, there is a provision that no increase in the powers of the European Parliament can be made or agreed to in Europe by any Minister at any time without their coming back and having primary legislation in this House. With respect to the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, many Foreign Office officials argued that it was impossible to put that parliamentary brake in process; it was considered impossible to do.</p>

<a name="80519-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08051946000171"></a>The noble Lord may well remember the arguments that took place about that legislation. It was largely due to the spirit of a female lawyer in the Foreign Office, who insisted that we did have the right to do this, that we proposed to do it. It was a crucial element in the letter of the then Prime Minister to the Labour Party aimed at getting people behind the decision of the referendum and to carry through a more positive attitude. I refer to the 1977 Labour Party annual meeting and the letter of Jim Callaghan to the chairman of the party on the eve of the conference. It was an indication that, despite the commitment in the 1972 legislation, we could use parliamentary procedure as a brake if both Houses of Parliament decided to do so.</p>

<a name="80519-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="08051946000172"></a>It is a welcome change that the Prime Minister has suggested that the passerelle clauses should have to go before both Houses of Parliament. I accept the valuable interjection of the noble Lord who explained that initially it was not the intention for them to go through this House. It is certainly right that they should go through both Houses of Parliament but this is not enough. I know the noble Lord very well&#151;he was Chief Whip under my leadership for a while&#151;and he knows the procedures of the other place better than anyone. He knows that one vote held on one occasion in the House of Commons is as nothing compared with a series of votes held on primary legislation.</p>

If all primary legislation in the other place is now timetabled, the value of primary legislation is a great deal less than he is now arguing.</p>

And because it is timetabled it is less onerous to ask the Government to accept that it should be primary legislation. I accept that it is certainly weaker. But it could be argued that they have now controlled the process to some extent and there do not have to be guillotines. Far from weakening my case, I think it strengthens it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08051952000003"></a>I wonder what the Liberal Democrats&#146; position will be on this. As I understand it, when this matter came to a vote in the other place, Liberal MPs voted in favour of it being in primary legislation. The little debate that we had earlier today was one thing&#151;I did not bother to vote; I vote so rarely that I am not going to vote on trivial matters&#151;but this is another. The arguments used in that debate, about questions of judgment, cannot be used in this one. This is a substantive and important debate. I am very pleased to see the leader of the Liberal Democrats in his place, because he played an important part in the drafting of the letter of the Prime Minister in 1977. He will remember the importance that was attached to the power we gave Parliament to curb any increase in powers in the European Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="08051952000004"></a>Having made the case for at least occasionally using the full parliamentary brake of legislation, we must ask whether the passerelle clauses represent something substantial. That is the issue that we have to discuss. There is no question&#151;no one seems to have denied it; indeed it has been used as the Government&#146;s reason for giving a single vote in both Houses on this issue&#151;but that you could in some circumstances, as it would require unanimity, move to a vote for qualified majority voting in foreign policy. Imagine a situation where, seven years on, no one political party has an outright majority in the other place and we have, say, a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition. The issue of moving to a qualified majority vote comes up in the European Council and the Prime Minister of the day&#151;I will not say which political party he comes from&#151;comes back, having made a decision in the middle of the night, to go along with the majority and have qualified majority voting. Do people understand that in that circumstance, the only check is going to be a single vote in the Houses of Parliament? I would argue that it is a fundamentally important decision, the decision above all which would influence whether integration was fully achieved or the rather ambivalent European organisation we have at the moment remained.</p>

The European Union makes decisions by unanimity in the European Council in many diverse ways, quite often not actually in the Chamber. It is usually a case of three or four people who are having difficulty with a particular issue being called into the president&#146;s room where they make the decision on whether they are going to vote unanimously&#151;this is in terms of their own collegiate decision&#151;and whether another person will make a deal. That is the nature of the animal  and I personally understand it. It is a continuous negotiation. Votes are negotiated over and concessions are made in one area quite removed from another. In a situation like this, even seven years on under the complex circumstances in which I am considering the question, most British Prime Ministers would be reluctant to go to qualified majority voting. But the argument will be made: &#147;It doesn&#146;t make very much difference. Only just a little bit further. Not many more. We&#146;ve already made this concession in some areas&#148;. Then a great prize will be offered to them. They will perhaps be told, as we saw only a few months ago, that a new reform will be offered on the common agricultural policy&#151;which you can be sure will be in exactly the same position seven years on. A few more spectacular inducements will be put before them. That is the way that it happens, and they make that decision. It is the only decision that really matters. It is an agreement between individuals that they will do something if the others agree to do likewise.</p>

It  will be argued, &#147;If you don&#146;t do this, there will be  some disadvantage&#148;, because some commitment will perhaps have been given that will bring jobs to some constituency. And so up will get some MP in the debate who, as part of this wider deal, is able to say, &#147;If the vote does not go through, there will be job losses in my constituency&#148;.

When they have made them, they come back. Of course, there was no particular moment when the previous Prime Minister gave assurances to the others that there would be no referendum on the Lisbon treaty, but does anyone believe that he did not make a commitment that there would be no referendum? That was the deal, and he negotiated it. He was not going to give it away unless he got various things and the so-called government red lines. He does not come back and tell everybody, &#147;I&#146;ve made this wider deal&#148;. But we know that that is how decisions are taken inside the European Union.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"></a><a name="08051952000013"></a>I shall not call the noble Baroness the Lord President a word beginning with &#147;n&#148;, because I do not believe that it applies to her. However, I believe that, when we have to consider this, we know&#151;and there is certainly nobody of any other party who comes to this Chamber from the House of Commons who does not&#151;that this one vote in the House of Lords and the House of Commons is a democratic and parliamentary brake that is very much inferior to having full legislative authority. I hope that we will eventually return this Bill to the House of Commons with a clause stating that there has to be primary legislation.</p>

If the Government reject the amendments, I can only believe that they will do so on the grounds that having primary legislation is too arduous a process. It is because it is a more arduous process that many of us believe that it is the proper democratic control of decisions of this importance.</p>

<a name="80519-0014.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="08051952000015"></a>However, there is another point to this. In those political negotiations in the middle of the night which precede the formal legislative Act of the European Council and which the noble Lord, Lord Owen, described, the fact that the British Prime Minister  has a more arduous process to go through may  be to our advantage. The UK may not be comfortable with many of the proposals pushed forward by  the European Union. The noble Lord described compromises being reached in the middle of the night&#151;we know that all kinds of things are agreed as part of a package&#151;but the stronger the barriers to a British Prime Minister being able to say to his colleagues in Europe, &#147;I cannot agree to that because I will not be able to get it through the UK Parliament&#148;, the stronger will be the UK&#146;s position in that negotiation. That is another important reason, on top of the UK democratic reasons&#151;which are the most important&#151;for making the process as arduous as possible on decisions of this importance.</p>

We are actually discussing important procedural changes, from unanimity to qualified voting on a number of specific issues within an EU of 27 which will in time become an EU of 30 or more. Although those are serious issues, we need to return to the amendment that we are discussing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="08051952000017"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Owen, that the public mood of disillusionment with politics is not a particularly British phenomenon. It is, as we saw with the French and Dutch referenda campaigns and as we are seeing now with the Irish referendum campaign, a general problem throughout Western Europe. It has until the recent presidential election campaign in the United States also been a major problem in the United States. The public have been switched off from participation, distrustful of parliaments and of the US Congress. It is one of the real constraints under which we all operate.</p>

<a name="80519-0014.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_313"></a><a name="08051952000018"></a>The contradiction is made more acute for all of us by the increasing necessity of international co- operation and international negotiation not only within the EU but within a range of other regional and global institutions and the necessity of making agreements by negotiation within those international institutions which national parliaments find it hard to catch hold of and which national publics do not wish to understand. That is the contradiction with which we are faced.</p>

<a name="80519-0014.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_314"></a><a name="08051952000019"></a>In terms of parliamentary scrutiny not only of the passerelle but of Community and EU legislation as a whole, if we are going to take an increasing role for national parliaments seriously, the Government will have to help us to play our role more effectively. I take one obvious example: the long Recess between the end of July and the beginning of October. It seems to me self-evident that once the Lisbon treaty is passed, EU committees must meet in early September and if necessary Parliament as a whole must return in early September to do our scrutiny role within the confines of moving necessary collaborative decisions further forward. I hope the Leader of the House will be able to say something about that. Parliamentary scrutiny takes place through the partnership between the two Houses and between the committees and the full Chambers of the two Houses, which is the most effective form of scrutiny.</p>

That is not my understanding of the European Union, in which the British Government and British politicians, when they are effective, have influence.

However, I am rather more confident that the Government have a European policy than that the Conservative Opposition have one. We take part in these negotiations. We often make the proposals that the

The Conservative Front Bench and the noble Lord, Lord Owen, need to be careful not to slip too far towards the UKIP narrative that the United Kingdom will usually find itself in a desperate minority against a continental cabal. That is not usually the case and it ought never to be the case. Effective British negotiators ought to ensure that it is not usually the case.</p>

The clauses that we are discussing, and in particular Clause 6, propose a number of new procedures to deal precisely with changes in EU voting procedures in specific areas without treaty amendment. It argues that Ministers will not be able to agree to these until there has been a Motion carried by each House. I trust that the Minister will assure us that, before such Motions are carried, the relevant committees of each House will have had an opportunity to consider the proposals in detail in the circumstances agreed. Those are the sort of assurances that we on these Benches want from the Government before we decide how to respond.</p>

We are talking about specific decisions in specific and confined areas in which there may be proposals to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting. As we move from an EU of 27 to an EU of 30 and more, there may on occasions be a case for making such decisions. I have heard many people in Brussels argue that the passerelle clause is likely never to be used, so it is possible that we are having an enormous argument about something that will actually never be carried into practice. The question for us to consider is whether the proposals made in Clause 6 are adequate or whether they need to have belt and braces added by the full Act of Parliament on each one, as the Conservative amendment proposes.

The noble Lord should remember, as I occasionally have to, that it is 29 years since he was my boss in the Foreign Office and that in European terms a lot has changed&#151;and changed dramatically&#151;since I was pleased to serve under him in that Labour Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="08051952000026"></a>When we look at today&#146;s proposals, we are dealing with nine different circumstances in which a passerelle is proposed as a possibility. Without going into every one of the safeguards in each of those nine circumstances, let us at least understand that the primary safeguard in every single case is the requirement of unanimity to the process of change that is being proposed. In most cases there are other locks on the process in addition to the requirement of unanimity. That is not the sort of circumstance that I remember the noble Lord, Lord Owen, went through. Take, for example, fisheries policy, where I know&#151;and I had great sympathy for him&#151;there were times when he had to sit through the night in smoke-filled rooms to get an agreement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="08051952000027"></a>However, that is not the process of decision-making that is now the major challenge to the European Union. It is the sheer fact of having a community of far greater membership with the prospect of more to come, and at least having the opportunity for the overwhelming majority to be able to reach a mechanistic sort of agreement to stop any eccentric member state holding the rest to ransom on something they all want.</p>

He overlooked one crucial point. When he talked about the whole mechanism of confessionals and people being taken to one side and deals being done, and all the rest of it, he was referring to a situation in which the outcome is fluid&#151;in which the Ministers, whether they are heads of state in government or Foreign Ministers or whatever, are not bound by a previous decision.

My clear recollection of Council meetings&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, has attended many more than I&#151;is that if a Minister can say that he is under strict instructions from his Parliament, or in the case of the Danes from the Folketing, or in the case of some other countries from a coalition agreement, then the whole business of the confessionals simply does not arise.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Williamson, says that he will not use the term &#147;passerelle&#148;; it is good enough for him to talk about a footbridge or a narrow footbridge. Our discussion this evening would be totally unintelligible in almost any room, pub or meeting. No one would have the faintest idea that there was to be a mechanism for increasing the scope of the treaty by this method&#151;even by unanimity. They would think that Lisbon is a done deal and that that is where we are and, if they took enough trouble, they would find out what was in the treaty. This is a route to an extension of that and, as I have suggested, when it is used it will be very important. It is entirely speculative and one could say that there is no basis for this, but I wonder what role the man or woman in the street would want Parliament in Westminster to have if and when that power is used to cross this bridge. Would they want an approval by a single vote one evening in the Commons and another in the Lords, or, as it is something important, would they prefer that it was dealt with by a more rigorous procedure where the matter could be fully debated? That procedure is by Act of Parliament. To me, the obvious answer would be, &#147;We want the best procedure available&#148;. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, was right to draw attention to the fact that Parliament will have a new role to play&#151;it is an absurdity&#151;for two and a half months. This cannot possibly work if we have issues on subsidiarity, to mention just one example, arising in that time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="08051952000046"></a>If Parliament is going to take a stand and live up to the role that it will be given, why do we not start now? Why do we not insist on a better class of procedure for looking at the invocation of the passerelle? If I have understood correctly the answer of the noble Lord, Lord Roper, to the question that I put earlier, there is nothing on this issue in the report of our impact assessment committee, admirable though it is. I do not think committee members focused&#151;or were asked to focus&#151;on whether this matter of approval in Parliament would be dealt with by an Act of Parliament or by a simple resolution. I do not think that they addressed that; they cannot deal with everything. We are on our own. This Chamber has not had that guidance. We have heard the view of a committee in the House of Commons. I urge noble Lords to adopt the amendment that has been moved.</p>

<a name="80519-0015.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="08051952000048"></a>What is very important is that this is the first time since passerelles&#151;footbridges&#151;came into existence, through the Single European Act of 1986, that Parliament is able to determine whether they should be used. I think that the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, is correct in looking for a better class of procedure. That is what we have acquired here. Through this legislation, we are giving Parliament the power to veto any use of a defined list of treaty-amending provisions&#151;the passerelles or footbridges. That is extremely important. Many of our deliberations have been about what that ought to look like&#151;whether it should be through Act of Parliament or, as we have proposed, through a vote in both Houses of Parliament. I know that noble Lords, particularly on the Liberal Democrat Benches, are looking for what has changed, in terms of how we think about that scrutiny, from when the Bill left the other place and came here. I will seek to address that.</p>

<a name="80519-0015.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_328"></a><a name="08051952000049"></a>I am conscious that, many weeks ago, I promised the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat, that I would make sure that in my discussions on the Lisbon treaty I would be clear about the importance of Europe and the value of the treaty provisions. I think that, in principle, these provisions could be beneficial to the United Kingdom. If we wanted, for example, to make a minor change to the EU&#146;s machinery without recourse to a full-blown intergovernmental conference, this would enable us to do so. We should not see what is proposed in the legislation from an entirely negative viewpoint. I accept that noble Lords are concerned about making sure that we have the right checks and balances. I argue that nowhere is that better done than in your Lordships&#146; House and in another place. As noble Lords have indicated, from their long experience in the European Union, it is unlikely that this option will be used often. Passerelles to move treaty powers from unanimity to QMV have been around since 1986 and used only once. I think it extremely unlikely that we will see great frequency of use, but the option could be of potential benefit.</p>

<a name="80519-0015.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_329"></a><a name="08051952000050"></a>Noble Lords have rightly concerned themselves with the role of the Minister, and at what point the Minister should play his role. I had an interesting exchange about that with the noble Lord, Lord Owen. He said that he wanted to use the N-word about me. I thought it was &#147;naughty&#148;, but actually it is &#147;naive&#148;. I do not pretend that I can emulate his experience from 1976 to 1979. What he should and probably does know is that I sat on the Justice and Home Affairs Council for three years and, as noble Lords have been kind enough to note today, I flew in from Peru this morning, where I was at the European Union Latin American/Caribbean conference until last night. Therefore, I pray in aid some experience of negotiations but perhaps not late into the night&#151;the Justice and Home Affairs Council was quite civilised in its deliberations. I recognise that discussions go on between officials and Ministers outside the formal deliberations at the European Council. As noble Lords would expect, that is part and parcel of the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"></a><a name="08051952000051"></a>The point that I sought to make but clearly  failed to make effectively is a different one. Here,  we are proposing that no Minister can enter those deliberations and make any suggestion, positive or negative, until both Houses of Parliament have made it clear what the position should be. The wording that we have put into the legislation is there to capture not just votes but the kind of discussions and manoeuvres that the noble Lord recognises&#151;and smiles at&#151;where a form of assent is given without a formal vote. It is clear from what is in the legislation that that cannot happen in these instances. Until there has been a discussion&#151;</p>

The noble Baroness&#146;s former Prime Minister was committed to a referendum and he told his colleagues that, if they gave way on certain matters and changed the constitutional treaty, he would commit to there being no referendum on the Lisbon treaty. We know that. That is the negotiation that took place in the middle of the night. Of course, he had to come back and win that, and in a way his commitment has been debated today. The present Prime Minister inherited the commitment made by the then Prime Minister, but it was against a commitment that he had already made to the British people that there would be a referendum.</p>

We are saying that, in the context of what is in the legislation, that has nothing to do with what happened in the middle of the night on the previous occasion. We are talking about what would happen if it were proposed that we should move on these footbridges from unanimity to qualified majority voting. We are saying that there would have to be a decision by both Houses of Parliament to give a mandate to the Minister in question to move on that basis. I argue that that is altogether different: it means a positive, improving and important role for Parliament.</p>

<a name="80519-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="08051952000056"></a>Noble Lords have argued that that should be done by Act of Parliament and not by what is proposed; they have veered between saying that Acts of Parliament are absolutely critical and saying that we do not do them very well anyway, particularly in another place. I argue that what matters is that Parliament has appropriate and proper debate, but I do not believe that that is always possible within an Act of Parliament. Clause 6 gives Parliament the opportunity, if it so wishes, to provide the Minister with some flexibility in negotiations&#151;for example, with regard to the date of commencement of a particular provision and so on. Parliament can determine that it does not wish to give that flexibility, while still mandating the Minister, simply by removing Clause 6(3) from the discussion. That possibility would be available to it. If the Minister were given the mandate and some flexibility by an Act of Parliament, we would have to come back and create a new Act of Parliament every time the negotiation

Alternatively, as noble Lords know&#151;because they sometimes complain about parliamentary discussion of legislation which is too open-ended&#151;there is an argument for saying that what would have to be provided for would be far too open-ended for an Act of Parliament. Therefore, I take the view that what we propose here is much better.</p>

<a name="80519-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="08051952000057"></a>Noble Lords&#151;particularly but not exclusively those on the Liberal Democrat Benches&#151;want to be reassured that what we have proposed and considered since the issue was debated in another place is stronger. I agree completely with the noble Lords, Lord Roper and Lord Wallace, about the value and importance of both committees in terms of scrutiny. That will be essential. I appeared before the EU Select Committee in your Lordships&#146; House last week to talk about another issue, but we also discussed the need to consider how best to achieve greater scrutiny. I accept that.</p>

<a name="80519-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="08051952000058"></a>More importantly, the conventions that would normally apply to secondary legislation, statutory instruments, and the votes and debates with which noble Lords concern themselves in relation to primary legislation&#151;traditions and conventions that we might not vote against something&#151;do not apply in this context. In the words of the parliamentary counsel whom I consulted this morning, this is a new power. It is different. For the benefit of noble Lords on the Liberal Democrat Benches in particular, and for noble Lords in general, I can confirm that that is where we are. Therefore both Houses of Parliament can consider this fully and properly in the kind of debates that they would wish. The length and timings of debates are for the usual channels and are not within the Government&#146;s gift to veto, alter or change. I hope that that will reassure noble Lords who have been concerned that in moving to this, which they would support in principle, the issue that was of greatest concern, both here and in another place, was how that would be different from the issues and concerns that have normally been raised when looking for votes on the debates in question. I hope that that reassures noble Lords.</p>

I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, for grouping on the Floor of the House as opposed to degrouping on the Floor of the House, which is the usual experience of Ministers. I am grateful to him and his colleagues who have done a lot of work on trying to condense some of the issues. I pay tribute to them for that.</p>

In both Houses we have experience of a way of looking at EU legislation that has served us well. I pay particular tribute to this House. The noble Lord was concerned that lots of legislation has been passed without scrutiny. I have checked this, and all proposals for EU legislation passed through the EU scrutiny processes in both Houses. Scrutiny overrides are much rarer than the noble Lord suggested. In 2005, there were 45 overrides. That was an exceptional year because as Parliament was dissolved, there were periods when the committees were not appointed. Parliament was operating, but the committees did not exist. I understand that that played a part in the number of overrides.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="08051952000062"></a>The noble Lord has different statistics. I was going to suggest that I write formally on this point because it is important.

I was trying to demonstrate that scrutiny overrides are quite rare. My experience of them is that they are rare, but they happen. I accept that they happen. It is important, particularly as we look further at the implementation of the treaty, that we are clear about the issues and concerns that noble Lords have raised. The proposal that the Government have put forward is a simpler, better and more efficient process than an Act of Parliament. It makes sure that the Minister is bound by what Parliament says and that the process under which Ministers are bound is a new and rigorous process that involves not only the committees but also the opportunity to deal with issues on the Floor of both Houses. It is a process that noble Lords should welcome because it is the first time such a process has been put in place. It is a process to be used rarely, but it could be used in the UK&#146;s interest. I hope that noble Lords will feel able to support it and that the noble Lord will withdraw his amendment.</p>

I see why Ministers were talking about being exhausted. Most of Peru is 12,000 feet high and there are considerable breathing difficulties when you get there.

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="08051952000066"></a>The tone of the Government&#146;s arguments, and of their supporters and apologists, has been that they cannot really imagine that this passerelle procedure will ever be used in a difficult and awkward way. They say that it has never happened in the past&#151;there have been passerelles in previous treaties, it is perfectly true. In the words of the noble Baroness, it is all extremely unlikely. I want to get this exactly right; I wrote it down. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, said that it may never be used&#151;he used the word &#147;never&#148;; noble Lords can check that in <I>Hansard</I>. That is a tricky word in this sort of context. I advise him and others who go into the &#147;never&#148; mode&#151;</p>

The noble Lord will remember as he was a member of the Government in 1986 who passed the first Act that introduced a similar clause to this. It has not been used very often since then. The Conservative Government had their own very good reasons for including this in the single European Act in the British national interest. It has not been used very often. We are in a different European Union with 27 members than we were then with 12, but it is unlikely to be used very often.</p>

I advise him and others who think in that mode to read this very fashionable book <I>The Black Swan, </I>the theme of which is that surprises always occur&#151;that things that are not predicted, not in trend and not extrapolated and do not fit the averages always happen and shape the future far more significantly than normal processes. If he does not like that&#151;it is a very good read&#151;he might recall the adage of my noble friend Lady Thatcher, the previous Prime Minister, that the unexpected always happens. Either way, we should be foolish as a legislative Chamber and as a Parliament to assume that because these things have not been used very much in the past and because this is similar in name to previous treaty provisions&#151;although it is not similar in its extent and scope; it is much larger&#151;they may never be used in the future.

However, on this matter, I think that he is falling into the same trap. He, too, should read <I>The Black Swan</I>. The assumption that, just because things have not happened, they will not happen is very tricky and produces a lot of surprises.

<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="08051952000071"></a>We come to the heart of the matter. The noble Lord, Lord Roper, who is very wise and informed in these fields, said that more than the normal convention would apply under the proposal in the Bill that there should be a motion before both Houses. The noble Baroness spoke in detail about that. Apparently, this will all be different. She says that there is a new power and that the process will be simpler and better. All that is very interesting, but I think that we need to hear a lot more about it before we are through. It is very interesting that a new power is to be produced to cope with these unfamiliar situations.</p>

<a name="80519-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_338"></a><a name="08051952000072"></a>I was surprised to hear about the detail that has apparently already been gone into and the advice of parliamentary draftsmen that this is a new power. Perhaps I should not have been surprised, but I was. Indeed, it raises a whole series of new questions. Parliamentary procedure both here and in the other place evolves and changes from time to time. It is always debated closely, because if the procedure is too loose all sorts of things can get through. We need to be very clear about all this.</p>

<a name="80519-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="08051952000073"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Owen, spoke with dazzling clarity, as he nearly always does. He reminded us that the &#147;legislative factory&#148;, as he rather dismissively called the great other parliamentary Chamber, is not very popular and is not greatly admired for its sausage-machine activities in churning out legislation. He said that it is even less admired for the fact that a great deal of that legislation appears to be poorly scrutinised and for the fact that its Members appear to go to bed earlier than we did in our day, although he rightly warned me against the dinosaur argument that things were better in the past.</p>

<a name="80519-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="08051952000074"></a>However, there is no doubt that there is no popularity in the other place or your Lordships&#146; House being too cavalier in letting legislation go through by this or that motion and this or that whipped vote. Most people in this country seem to want a referendum, although we shall come to that in our debates both tomorrow and later on. The vast majority&#151;86 per cent, according to the latest ICM poll&#151;want a referendum. We need to be very careful, without subordinating ourselves to public opinion&#151;we need to give leadership and experience where we can&#151;about flying in the face of such a massive majority of people, who for a long time have wanted things to be other than Parliament appears inclined to agree to at present.</p>

<ul><a name="08051952000086"></a>&#147;late at night at an ordinary European Council, a decision on one other country&#146;s milk quotas is traded for a concession on moving from unanimity to QMV ... that is not acceptable&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051952000084"></a>Of course the very fact that he said that indicates that that sort of thing goes on. I recall&#151;I am sure that I am hopelessly out of date&#151;that when I attended Industry and Energy Councils decades ago a great deal went on late at night and a great many pressures were exerted and trades and deals were done. If the Ministers came to a trading situation in the middle of the night, where it was raised that something might be moved from unanimity to QMV, could they act and then come back to the House of Commons, where we would ask for an Act of Parliament to validate it, and the Government would ask for a motion of novel procedures? I am not sure if they could act or would have to say that they could not even enter into the discussion until they had gone home and got a view from the other place. Perhaps we can clear this up at a later stage in our discussions. I am not totally clear on this procedure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="08051952000076"></a>The time is pressing on. We have covered a good deal of ground this evening, largely by leaping swiftly from clause to clause. These are vastly important subjects; we are talking about treaty changes. They may be small, but they are treaty changes. These are things for which the party of the noble Lord, Lord Roper, voted in the name of parliamentary accountability and improved parliamentary control. These are not, as the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, suggested in an earlier debate, games. It is not, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, keeps suggesting, an elephant trap. This party does not believe in trapping elephants. The comparison of elephants to the Liberal Democrats is not a happy one. After all, elephants never forget, whereas the Liberal Democrats seem to forget their policy every 10 minutes. Because of this talk of new powers, we have opened up a whole new area of questioning and issues of vast importance for the future. Something will happen and the more I hear that it will not, or is unlikely, or may never be used, the more certain I am that these matters will occur in the future. Those of us who fail to make provision will have been, as it were, the unwise virgins who failed to prepare for what is certainly going to happen, and will be very much criticised. That is why we need to return to this matter and that is why, for the moment, and clearly on those understandings, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051948000309"></a> Clause 2, page 1, line 10, leave out &#147;objects&#148; and insert &#147;objectives&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000010"></a>The noble Baroness said: This may seem to be a small point, but it may be an important one to make. I should give a name check to Tim Oliver, a researcher in our Whips&#146; Office because it was his point. When he asked the staff of the Public Bill Office why the term &#147;objects&#148; rather than &#147;objectives&#148; is used in Clause 2, they replied that they too were puzzled by it. I believe that the Minister&#146;s office said something to the effect that it was the draftsman&#146;s style. Perhaps there is more than one draftsman on the Bill because the part dealing with the Homes and Communities Agency uses different terminology from that employed for Oftenant. I do not know whether the terms &#147;objects&#148; and &#147;objectives&#148; are regarded as synonyms, but the primary meaning of &#147;object&#148; is that of something which is perceptible and the focus of attention; the secondary meaning is that it is a purpose or aim.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000011"></a>I noticed last Tuesday that nearly every speaker who referred to the objects of the Homes and Communities Agency used the word &#147;objectives&#148;, and the <I>Hansard</I>s for proceedings in the Commons also show that &#147;objectives&#148; was used. What is important here is that a different term is used for the objectives of the regulator, Oftenant. If different terms are used to mean the same thing, there is clearly some scope for confusion because the reader will seek to make a distinction. When I am the reader it does not matter terribly, but when it is the court looking for a distinction, perhaps on a judicial review of the agency&#146;s activities, that might matter. With apologies for appearing to be particularly picky, what would be most helpful would be to achieve consistency. However, if consistency is not intended, I should like to understand the distinction. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Baroness is being picky with a point, although I have some sympathy with her argument. The term &#147;object&#148; is commonly used in legislation for comparable bodies, along with &#147;function&#148; and &#147;purpose&#148;, and I am sure  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC428"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC428</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it will not have escaped the attention of the noble Baroness that these terms tend to be high level in their nature. People understand that the subsections of Clause 2 set out the purposes of the agency in terms of what it is for, its key tasks and its responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000013"></a>We see no great difference in the use of different terminology here, and indeed the term &#147;objectives&#148; is used elsewhere. However, we would like to take the amendment away and give it some further thought. Perhaps we may consult the noble Baroness in the interval between our considerations in Committee and on Report, and if other noble Lords want to join in, I would be happy to facilitate that.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000017"></a>The noble Lord said: This group of amendments, Amendments Nos. 15, 18 and 21, follow on from my Amendment No. 13, where I am critical of what I would call the harshness of the Bill. The way it is written, you would really think, as I have said, that the Homes and Communities Agency was the only body doing such work, when a much wider community is already, always has been, and always will be doing it.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000018"></a>We have already had a debate about this; I do not suppose that I will get any different reply from that to Amendment No. 13, but we will need to return to the subject later.

<h5><a name="08051948000328"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08051948000019"></a><a name="80519-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0001.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08051948000348"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees:</b> If this amendment is agreed to, I cannot call Amendment No. 16.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000021"></a>I shall make my response very short. I understand what the noble Lord is trying to ascertain. By clarifying the language and introducing qualifications, he may be trying to invite the HCA to be more modest in what it can achieve and to make it clearer to everyone how the HCA will work. I should make four main points&#151;I will not labour them, but they apply to the consequential amendments on regeneration and sustainability.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000022"></a>The first argument is that in relation to each of the elements of its work, the HCA should have no fewer powers. That would be damaged by the amendment because English Partnerships&#146;s regeneration powers are extremely important. It is important that the HCA can put land packages together, and so forth.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC429"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC429</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000023"></a>Secondly, it is self-evident that the HCA will not build homes or regenerate communities directly, but it cannot be confined to assisting others. We must give the HCA the necessary competence to deliver its objects. That is crucial, and the language is perfectly appropriate and right for that. As soon as we begin to insert exclusions, exceptions or qualifications, we diminish the agency and dilute its powers. It is not that we are expecting the agency to do everything itself&#151;far from it&#151;but it must be able to do some things itself. It must be able to take the initiative. For example, it must be able to act alone to fund a road to unlock a site that might otherwise not be used for housing; to bring together land ownership in one place; to fund the Decent Homes programme; and to fund housing associations. None of that will be possible if the noble Lord were to press his amendment.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000024"></a>I know that sustainability is very close to the noble Lord&#146;s heart. We have now placed sustainability at the heart of the objects, following a long debate in the other place. It was always there, but we have made it explicit. The HCA must be able to reflect the central importance of our domestic buildings to carbon generation and to take steps. That requires a direct power. While the language of the Bill does not mean that it will do everything itself, and I do not think anyone would realistically interpret it as such, to qualify it would be to hobble and inhibit it, which would be dangerous.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000025"></a>I agree that of course the HCA should be, and is, primarily an enabler or facilitator, and it is a provider of resources as a broker rather than as a direct provider. That means that it will work in partnership, and that is the crucial nature of the relationship. There will be occasions when the HCA has a role in direct provision, and the Bill must allow for that. It needs to be able to retain the option to provide housing directly in the rare instances where there is a need to protect public investment in a project. For example, we would want the agency to step into a development if a developer went bust, rather than losing either investment or benefits. That is an important power, although I am not saying that it would be used very often. Those are the arguments for keeping the language in the Bill, to indicate the scope of the powers, but also to make sure that, while it will work in partnership, there will be opportunities and the necessity to act alone on occasion.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000026"></a><a name="80519-gc0001.htm_spnew8"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0001.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="08051948000350"></a>Viscount Eccles:</b> The Minister used the phrase &#147;no fewer powers&#148; than the previous legislation. Does that encompass no more powers than the previous legislation?</p>

<p><a name="08051948000027"></a><a name="80519-gc0001.htm_spnew10"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0001.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="08051948000351"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> No. There are modest expansions of the powers, because the objectives, or objects, of the HCA are slightly wider. The four objectives in the Bill are new objectives. The only power that I understand to be new is the power to&#151;on very exceptional occasions&#151;take over the plan-making powers of local authorities if necessity should require it. The previous body, English Partnerships, had the power to assume designation powers, but there is a power in the Bill to take over plan-making powers as well.</p>

I may be being unkind&#151;I know that the noble Baroness is a seriously honourable lady&#151;but it struck me that she gave the intimation that the powers were less, then when asked she said that there are fewer but they are broader. I am iffy about that.</p>

I am sorry for the earlier confusion; I should perhaps have checked more closely on the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, which is next. The amendments were in a way consequential on Amendment No. 13. The noble Baroness has very kindly given me some more homework to do before we return to Amendment No. 13, which we will definitely have to do. She has tightened the definitions for us, so that we know where the obstacles are that we have to overcome. All of that is for another day. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000034"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 16 I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 30 and 31, which are grouped with it and address essentially the same issue.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000035"></a>The overt reason for Amendment No. 16 is to probe the meaning of the words &#147;improve the supply&#148;. It is not clear to me what that means. My amendment would change the word &#147;improve&#148; to &#147;increase&#148;. Is an improvement in the supply an increase in the number of houses being built, or does it mean something different? If it means an increase, just how strategic a role do the Government expect the HCA to take in terms of the overall housing supply? I understand what improving the quality of housing is. Perhaps we will talk about that in more detail on a later amendment. So far as supply is concerned, however, I do not understand what the word &#147;improve&#148; means.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000036"></a>More generally, the quantity of supply&#151;the number of houses that are being built&#151;is topical. The document entitled <I>House Building: March Quarter 2008, England</I> from the Department of Communities and Local Government that came out last week shows clearly that the number of houses that are being built, both starts and completions, is suddenly going down. Having been on a gently rising graph since 2002, they  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC431"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC431</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>have taken a nosedive for reasons we are all aware of. The starts in particular look fairly dire in the past quarter. The statistics are all set out in the document. I refer to it to make the general point that the number of housing units being built at any time is something of which the main factors are the state of the economy generally and the state of the housing market. It is not the demand for housing in terms of need but in terms of the economy, how much money people have, how much money the banks and building societies are making available to buy houses, general confidence and so on. It is not clear how much influence the Government expect this new agency to have over the supply of housing except in certain specific areas where it provides the funding, which by and large will be those areas that are affected not by the market conditions directly but by public policy, particularly the amount of funding being put into them by the HCA and&#151;fairly directly, therefore&#151;by government policy.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000037"></a>These issues are worthy of discussion. Specifically, though, what do the Government mean by &#147;improving&#148; the supply? I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000038"></a><a name="80519-gc0001.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0001.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08051948000357"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Those are important questions. I shall say a few words about the state of the housing market. Under present conditions it is not surprising that we have seen a drop in housing starts, but the important thing is that we have had sustained economic growth and a high employment level over the past 10 years. The fundamentals of the economy remain strong. Demand for housing is strong. Affordability is, and will remain, an issue; there will be no ease-up in the pressure or the need for us to be ambitious about our housing supply. The role of the HCA therefore becomes more important because it brings together all the partners and the forms of investment, whether that is in funding affordable homes, putting together public-private partnerships, land investment or skills packages for local authorities to help them identify and meet their local needs or, through the Academy for Sustainable Communities, putting skills into the community itself. The HCA provides a very timely opportunity for us to focus on this issue and drive it forward at a time when things are not as easy as they have been.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000039"></a>I appreciate what the noble Lord said about the probing nature of the amendment and the meaning of &#147;improving&#148;. I did not think that he would simply want to substitute &#147;increasing supply&#148; for &#147;improving supply&#148; because clearly &#147;increasing supply&#148; is about volume and having more homes. We seek to have more and better homes, which is implied by &#147;improving&#148;. The agency also wants to create strong and sustainable communities. &#147;Improving&#148; implies having the right numbers of homes of the right kinds in the right places. That goes beyond increasing the supply and covers all aspects of the delivery chain such as land acquisition, building, selling, renting new housing and working with local authorities and the business sector. Its work also takes into account people&#146;s different needs; for example, the need to ensure that demographics are reflected in our housing market so that the needs of older people and of disabled people are met, as we shall discuss on the next amendment. We could not meet those needs simply by volume building new  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC432"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC432</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>housing. For example, we would not meet those objectives by building luxury executive homes in areas where affordable homes are desperately needed. Obviously, that is not what the intention behind the noble Lord&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000040"></a>The Bill makes clear in Clause 2(2) that,</p>
<ul><a name="08051948000321"></a>&#147;improving the supply of housing&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08051948000300"></a>means providing different types of homes. As I said, that is shorthand for affordable homes, family homes, homes for older people and the needs of localities. It is no good building hundreds of blocks of flats in areas where the crucial need is for family homes of different sizes. I hope the noble Lord will accept that &#147;improving&#148; includes the activity of which he will be aware in the part of the country that he knows well. We need to be able to decrease as well as increase the number of homes. We are reconfiguring some neighbourhoods so that we can build larger homes for larger families. We need to have the flexibility to do that and to change the supply of housing in a way that attracts into those areas people who will invest in them and help the community become more diverse and more prosperous. The noble Lord is familiar with such situations. All that is implied by &#147;improving&#148;, which we used deliberately. It also includes the decent homes programme, which we are transferring from the DCLG to the Homes and Communities Agency. That is a massive programme. As I have said many times in the House, we have 1 million fewer non-decent homes which we have achieved by investing &#163;23 billion in modernising council houses by putting in new bathrooms and kitchens and installing insulation, thus making them warm, safe and comfortable. That was rightly a priority when we came into office.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000041"></a>The noble Lord asked about the strategic nature of the HCA&#146;s decisions. The relationship between the DCLG, which remains the sponsoring body, and the agency, which is the delivery body, will be made clear in protocols but essentially the responsibility for setting and meeting the country&#146;s affordable housing need must rest with government and the DCLG. We will continue to set the high level objectives and the strategic priorities, which will be delivered on our behalf by the HCA. It is right that delivery programmes such as decent homes, for which we have traditionally taken responsibility, are transferred to a body tasked to deliver on behalf of the Government.</p>

She referred to the academy for training planners. What is the advantage of placing the academy in this new agency, and are there plans to increase investment in the academy? I read the Second Reading debate with great interest, and I noticed what my noble friend Lord Mawson said about leadership making so much difference in this area. I have also just come from a meeting on hearing the voice of children in care, and the consensus among all the experts there was that we need to support the workforce if we are to deliver for these children.</p>

The Minister has said on more than one occasion&#151;she said it in the speech that she has just made and she has said it at earlier stages of the Bill&#151;that the economy continues to be strong at a time when the Governor of the Bank of England for the first time acknowledges that although he does not expect a recession there is the possibility of one. If there were a recession, would the Minister still be saying that the economy continues to be strong, and how far would it affect the kind of things that she has been saying in response to the noble Lord, Lord Greaves? As I said, I am not mischief-making, and she can make her answer as short as she wishes.</p>

I may be misunderstanding things, but I thought that the agency was quite a small operator in the total of housebuilding and house-improvement. That is to say, its market share is quite small. It is working in a very important area of the housing market where the market does not answer the questions that those who wish to acquire houses wish to have answered. That is why I support the word &#147;increase&#148;, which the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, used: it is absolutely clear that that area of the market needs an increase in supply. Having said that, would we not do better to confine our considerations to the operations of the agency and of Oftenant, which will be in an area of the housing market which I think is in single figures? Perhaps the Minister will tell us what the market share will be.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000047"></a>was what Harold Macmillan was doing in the 1950s when he said that he would build 300,000 houses a year, which he did. The Government should be doing that as a matter of policy rather than hiving it off to an agency which, as my noble friend says, has only a very small percentage of the market. This is a very bad habit that Governments are getting into. It is not confined to the present Government by any means; the last Government were nearly as bad at it. They think that they can hide behind a statutory body, when increasing the housing supply should be a policy aim of the Ministry and not hived off to a Government.</p>

Realising that only about 150,000 homes are built every year, I think that the agency will contribute and subsidise, one way and another, 30 per cent of those over the next couple of years. The noble Earl asks what will happen to the organisation if it does not meet its targets. I am terribly sorry to have to confess that during the six years of my stewardship of English Partnerships, we exceeded our targets every year. I therefore have no knowledge of what happens when that is not the case. My noble friend Lady Dean will confess to the same track record. We are sorry to disappoint, but we do not have much experience of failing in the last period.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000049"></a>As regards the economy, if we compare the current situation to that when interest rates were in the mid teens and almost 3 million people were unemployed, it is reasonable still to conclude that the economy is in good shape. As we are all aware, the housing market is not in such good shape but, again, during my tenure at English Partnerships, whenever we tried to do innovative things the Treasury said, &#147;Where is the market failure in terms of the housing market?&#148;. Plainly, there is some market failure now, but the different attitudes of the housebuilders in terms of starts and their confidence plainly shows us some people have less confidence in the market than others. In this situation, it is imperative that the new Homes and Communities Agency gets going and helps where it can to address that market failure. I hope that that helps the noble Earl with his issue about hiving off to agencies&#151;</p>

One might logically assume that as the agency is the creation of the Government, if it failed a Minister might resign. However, I make no political points when I say that in recent years the old culture of ministerial responsibility being represented by a resignation was last honourably applied by a Member of this House when he was Foreign Secretary and he missed a point in the southern Atlantic. Unfortunately, since then we have not seen such an honourable tradition repeated.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000053"></a>We will not resolve the issue today and I am sure that it will be the source of future debate on the Bill. Again, I shall listen with interest to what the noble Baroness says and study it with great care, because it will set the tone for future discussion.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000054"></a><a name="80519-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08051948000366"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> Members of the Committee raised some profound questions in that short debate. I start by answering the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, about the Academy for Sustainable Communities. The academy is not just about raising the standards of training for planners: it is about building an awareness and understanding of what is involved in making a sustainable community. That means that it works not just with professionals, including planners, but with people in the community. We need to get communities and activists&#151;not just children in schools&#151;to understand the importance of planning properly for communities and engaging them in that process. I am delighted to be the Minister responsible and to say that the HC has done an outstanding job over the past two years. Its home is now properly in the HCA because it will be at the centre of the responsibility for building communities. Inevitably, its scope will deepen and sharpen.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000055"></a>I turn to the broader point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke. Without repeating myself, for the reasons mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, I say to him simply that we have had sustained economic growth over the past 10 years. We have had historically high employment levels and historically low interest rates. That has not changed. I would not hazard an answer to the noble Lord&#146;s question about recession. We are not in recession, and that is where I would leave the issue.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000056"></a>As regards the question raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, my noble friend Lady Ford answered it far better than I could. I say to him and the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, only that the Housing Corporation was concerned with affordable homes. That now amounts to 70,000 new homes a year, which is not an insignificant number. The point is that the HCA, by virtue of assuming the role of the Housing Corporation, is responsible for securing those 70,000 new homes. However, in all its other work, it will support the delivery of 3 million new homes. Through its regeneration responsibilities and its work on investment in land and communities, through the traditional work of English Partnerships, and through the work it is picking up from us in housing market renewal pathfinders, for example, it will support 3 million homes. Its market share may be directly 30 per cent, but its work goes much broader.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000057"></a>What happens if its objectives are not achieved? That is a good question, and one that is well asked of every piece of legislation that goes through this House. Sometimes, for good reasons, we do not put objectives in a Bill, but it is important, when creating an agency that is tasked with such responsibility, to make its objectives clear. If my noble friend Lady Ford had not said it, I certainly would have done&#151;two of the most successful agencies we have in this country have been the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships. We have no record on which we

They have really been very successful and I am sure that that is how the HCA will go forward.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000058"></a>I think that I have answered all the questions.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000059"></a><a name="80519-gc0002.htm_spmin2"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0002.htm_spmin3"></a><a name="08051948000367"></a>The Earl of Onslow:</b> There is one question unanswered. How does ministerial responsibility come into this? I understand exactly what the noble Baroness is getting at. That is why I ask the question which at the time I did not. At some stage, it is &#147;ministerial&#148; policy to build 300,000 houses a year. Where does ministerial responsibility come into this if, for instance, the housing targets are not met?</p>

<p><a name="08051948000060"></a><a name="80519-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051948000368"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> As always, ministerial responsibility lies with the Ministers responsible, and there is no evasion of that. The housebuilding programme is a long programme&#151;we cannot build houses quickly. The 3 million homes are posited to run to 2020 and beyond, and there is a long-term responsibility for whichever Government and Minister are in charge. We all do the best we can, judging the circumstances as we see them and with the resources we have. Keeping faith in what we have said is important for to the country.</p>

She mentioned housing market renewal pathfinders. I should declare a further interest in that I am still responsible for housing market renewal in my local authority, Pendle. I did not declare that at the start of the Grand Committee, because I thought that I would be summarily removed from that position last Thursday; but the processes of democracy are curious and sometimes they do not go the way that you want or expect them to. I am still lumbered with that responsibility. Never mind; I will do my best.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000064"></a>On the narrow point of the amendment, the Minister said that it was not just a matter of quantity, but making housing better, which is precisely why I worded the amendment with the aim of increasing supply and improving quality. Making housing better is a matter of quality, not the amount. I did not quite understand the Minister&#146;s reply on that.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000065"></a>However, on the wider issues, the Government have announced their target of 3 million new houses by 2020 or whenever, but suddenly, for reasons that  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC437"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC437</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are nothing to do with agencies such as the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships, it is all going the wrong way, because, in the words of Harold Macmillan, &#147;Events, dear boy, events&#148; have got in the way. The wider issues of the global housing market and the economy have got in the way. Suddenly they are going the wrong way. Of course, we have only three months&#146; figures and in a year&#146;s time they may be going up again. But that is my point&#151;it is not within the power of the new Homes and Communities Agency to have more than a marginal effect on the total, because the number of new housing units that will be supplied by the agency will not vary much. The effects of what is happening in the rest of the world could vary enormously.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000066"></a>The Minister said that &#147;improve&#148; includes working towards the Government&#146;s targets to increase quality and quantity. It is all a matter of money. We are told that English Partnerships and the Housing Corporation have met their targets. Of course they have met their targets, because they are determined by the amount of money that has been available to those organisations for investment. If you have &#163;10 million to invest in new housing and you are dealing with certain types of housing, by and large, you get a certain number of housing units. That will continue to be the case. It would be extraordinary if the targets had not been met, because they were largely determined by the resources available. That generalisation is not 100 per cent true, but it is largely true.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000067"></a>One of the unspoken issues behind all of this is not only whether the Homes and Communities Agency will have extra powers to bring the different agencies together with some of the functions of the department, but whether the agency will have more resources. We must assume that it will not have more resources, unless the Government suddenly tell us otherwise and find those resources. When legislation states that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051948000312"></a>&#147;The objects of the HCA are ... to improve the supply and quality of housing in England&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051948000301"></a>that is fine for the parts of housing market and housing stock that those objects relate to. It may relate to 30 per cent of new investment. That would be ludicrously ambitious in relation to the total amount of housing in England. The HCA would not be able to achieve that, because it will target areas of the housing market aimed at people in need and areas in need of regeneration. That is the point that the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, was making; that legislation sets these things out, but that there is no way of knowing whether something has been achieved in a way that could be challenged in the courts. On improving the supply, no one can get the judicial review in 10 years&#146; time on whether the supply has been improved, because the whole terminology is so vague. That was the purpose of the amendment. I do not think that legislation should be as vague as this.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000068"></a>However, it has been an interesting debate, and the Minister has said some interesting things about the way in which the HCA will work. I will be interested to read it in <I>Hansard</I> and consider it further. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

She slightly surprised me by saying that she has to go into hospital to have her tonsils out. She will subsequently&#151;fortunately for us this will be over the Recess&#151;be confined to barracks, as it were, for at least a week. Fortunately, we can expect her back and in fine fettle after the Recess. She is very sorry not to be here.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000072"></a>This group of amendments has been sponsored by RADAR. We are coming from the general subject that we have been discussing to a specific area; this is a bit of special pleading. The amendment is aimed at getting the Homes and Communities Agency to be more specific in relation to providing facilities, particularly homes, for the disabled. I suppose one should say nowadays that we want homes that are more easily adaptable and suitable for disabled people. It goes into the question of the lifetime home standards; in effect, it is another aspect of that discussion. We all like to think that we are all perfectly fit and can continue to live in our homes; unfortunately as you get older we increasingly realise that we might suddenly find ourselves in difficulties. That is in common with the totality of the community. We need to think about those people.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000073"></a>RADAR gave me the statistic that there is a nationwide shortfall of 330,000 wheelchair-standard homes. That is a huge number. If you are in a wheelchair, and you do not have a home that is adaptable for a wheelchair, that deficit is 100 per cent to that person, which is very serious indeed. In relation to the totality of the housing deficit&#151;we have a housing deficit in this country&#151;this is a relatively small problem; but it is something that the Homes and Communities Agency should be aware of and should be taking into account, but it is not written in to its remit. I am sure that the noble Baroness will say, &#147;Yes, but ...&#148;. We have the opportunity to ensure that it is written in, unless the noble Baroness is going to be very kind and say that the Government will think about writing it in for us.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000074"></a>There are people in society who need special consideration. Like all of us, they are members of the community. We are talking about the community. We need to be aware of the people in this sector, who are among the most vulnerable and in some ways are the most needy. They may not be a huge, vociferous and demonstrating group, but they are no less worthy of attention just because we do not always see them. I have often thought that it would be a good thing if we all had to spend a week in a wheelchair. I was pleased to hear that in medical training doctors are made to do so, I think for a day or two. It is a very different world if you are in a wheelchair. You cannot, for instance, go up to a hotel desk to check in. The desks are invariably far too high. There are a host of problems when you begin to think in that sort of

<p><a name="08051948000075"></a>We need to think seriously about this. I thought that it was worth bringing it to the attention of the Committee so that we have the Minister&#146;s reaction. It would be better if this were written into the remit of the Homes and Communities Agency. I know that it already has a very wide remit and that it is impossible to write everything into it, but this sector is sufficiently significant. I would not say that it is sufficiently unable to argue its case, because clearly it has argued it sufficiently to get it to me so that I can present it here, but it is probably the least able in the community to help itself. It really does need special consideration. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000076"></a><a name="80519-gc0002.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0002.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08051948000373"></a>Lord Best:</b> I have to rise to my feet whenever lifetime homes are mentioned. I declare my past interest as a godfather to the lifetime home standards. They were devised by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and led to the building of a number of prototypes and finally to the lifetime home standards that we all talk about today.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000077"></a>There are groups of amendments that relate to the role of the Homes and Communities Agency, later to Oftenant, the regulator, and finally to the building regulations at the end of the Bill. We have a choice as to the best way of raising the profile of accessibility in the Bill. I add to the words of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, when I say that we are talking not only about people with disabilities who suffer from direct problems but about everyone. The great thing about a lifetime home is that it suits you through your lifetime. Everyone&#146;s lifetime includes moments when they suddenly realise that their house has not been designed with the problems of mobility in mind. We all have sons who break their legs playing football; they are in a wheelchair for three months and we have to carry them up and down stairs inside and steps outside and all kinds of terrible things. We have a granny or grandfather who comes to stay, or we are the granny or grandfather.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000078"></a>Lifetimes require homes to be more accessible, which they can be if accessibility is taken into account at the design stage. This is therefore a really important universal issue. The question is where best to fit it into the Bill. I will not be happy with the thought of Oftenant, as a regulator, requiring a particular kind of design. That would not be a very good place for this to go to. I will speak in favour of the building regulations being tweaked again, because it is through the building regulations that half the first lifetime home standards have already been established. They now apply to the building of every home by Barratt or by Wimpey. They have nothing to do with social housing; they are a universal in building regulations. There are no more of those steps that freeze over in winter and that you go skidding off when as an elderly person you come out of the front door. We do not put big front-door steps in the way of people any more. Building regulations now already take on board half of the lifetime home standards. The next step is to add the other half so that the standards apply to all homes everywhere that are built from here on. That is the target to go for.</p>

Giving the Homes and Communities Agency a special role in this regard is a good idea, but if we were to add accessibility to supply we would also have to add affordability, social and environmental sustainability and quite a few other ingredients in the list. So while I absolutely support the extension of the lifetime home principles to cover all homes across the country, I suspect that this is not the absolutely best place in which to amend current legislation.</p>

They can cover insulation and all sorts of other things such as wider doorways so that people can get their wheelchairs through them. Regulations could be put in place without the need for this Bill stating that any house built more than six months after they come into force will have to conform to them. The problem would then go away.</p>

I shall speak about this subject when I move Amendment No. 33 later, but the points are similar. My amendment seeks to extend the definition of &#147;quality&#148; to include,</p>
<ul><a name="08051948000323"></a>&#147;ensuring the suitability of housing for people with physical disabilities and sensory impairments&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051948000302"></a>When I drafted it, I had in mind temporary problems as well as the permanent ones to which the noble Lord has referred.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000084"></a>The noble Lord talked about the problems of creating a list, and indeed the Minister in the Commons rejected similar amendments on that basis. I disagree with that analysis of what this or a similar amendment would do. They do not seek to introduce another type of housing, but to ensure that all housing is built or, if necessary, remodelled to allow for people who are growing older and whose physical and sensory abilities are somewhat reduced. I do not have to go through the arguments about the needs. However, this is not qualitatively the same as a &#147;type&#148; of housing because it is an overarching provision. It should apply to all housing.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000085"></a>I should like to make a separate point. I acknowledge absolutely the Government&#146;s aim to ensure that housing is built to lifetime home standards by 2013. That raises an issue not only about the timeframe but also about the existing housing stock and what might be done about it. I hope that the Minister can give us an assurance that budget allocations for renewal and regeneration will not be diverted in order to fulfil numerical targets for lifetime homes by the creation of new housing to the detriment of remodelling and adapting existing housing. For an individual, that is often the most attractive and desirable option, and probably the least expensive.</p>

Coming into this debate and genuinely wanting to learn, I call to mind a time when some friends who live in York invited me to their home and showed me an arrangement in the kitchen to allow someone who is less able-bodied to use the sink. The equipment helped them to lift themselves up and down. My noble friend Lady Dean came to visit the house in her capacity as chair of the Housing Corporation after I drew her attention to it. It was fantastic for able-bodied people to see how far the provision of aids had advanced for those who need them. It was a Quaker development, and it was very much appreciated.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000087"></a>The other instance that I draw to the Committee&#146;s attention is that my wife and two boys had a condition called myotonic dystrophy. Dystrophy, as the Committee knows, is a disease of the muscles that weakens the body. We had never thought that we would need a stairlift and an aid to use the bath. Cost did not come into it when it was a question of our family&#146;s needs but, on making inquiries, we found that under the existing provisions these kinds of aids are available subject to examination and scrutiny through the council&#146;s social services. While I do not disagree with anything that has been said about desirability and the needs of people who are in search of easement, we have to recognise that there are finite resources. The Minister and her colleagues, in a macro way, will have had to decide on the thrust and the imperative of the legislation and what kind of burdens are to be placed upon it. Not that they are not desirable; they are. However, it is a question of attainment. We are talking not necessarily about the greatest good for the greatest number but about trying to ensure that the legislation is sufficiently robust that it will stand up in a court of law or withstand public scrutiny, and about going as far as one can in laying down in the Bill responsibilities that have to be carried out by an industry, councils and the voluntary sector. To what extent should resources be devoted down one path, bringing much needed easement? By doing that, how far do we inhibit the overall strategy?</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000088"></a>I have no knowledge about this, but I imagine that almost any aspect of improving the Bill in the way that the amendment suggests will have been thought of inside the department by the Minister and her colleagues. The fact that it does not appear in the Bill indicates that it has been thought of and been found unable to be acceded to. To accede to all these things in the Bill may well improve the Bill to the satisfaction of those pressing the amendments, but if at the end of the day&#151;that is, not very far down the road&#151;we are in difficulty because of the industry or the Exchequer, or the public will is such that it fails to make progress, we will not be providing a very good service.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000089"></a>Like the rest of the Committee, I await what the Minister has to say, not about whether she thinks the objectives of the amendments are laudable but about whether they are attainable and strategically desirable in the context of the overall strategy of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000090"></a><a name="80519-gc0003.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0003.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051948000379"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> My question here will be just as simple as the one I asked on the previous occasion. One of the bonuses and benefits that one gets when one works on a Bill like this is the amount of briefing one receives from relevant bodies, and one learns a whole series of things one previously did not know. I never know whether the organisations concerned&#151;I am thinking particularly of RADAR&#151;have sent the Government exactly the same briefing as have they sent the rest of us so the Government are in a position to know whether what they have said is accurate. I am delighted to see, from the smiles on the faces not only of those on the Front Bench but of their advisers behind them, that they do. It is therefore possible that my question is unnecessary.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000091"></a>In the briefing that RADAR sent us, in addition to telling us how many million disabled people were in need of accessible accommodation and how many of them were living in unsuitable housing today, it made a forecast that there will be an increase of between 57 per cent and 67 per cent in the numbers of disabled older people over the next 20 years. Do the Government think that that is broadly the right figure?</p>

<p><a name="08051948000092"></a><a name="80519-gc0003.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0003.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051948000380"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> We have had a good debate on a very important subject that is dear to my heart for reasons that will become clear. Having said that, I am afraid that the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, predicted how I would respond, but I hope that I shall put forward some good arguments. I hope that in doing so I can reassure him.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000093"></a>I say to the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, that we tend to see the briefing from various lobbies and we are grateful for it. We are living in an ageing society, which brings with it a higher proportion of people with disabilities. I do not know whether the RADAR figures are completely accurate because we are all in the business of trying to make intelligent predictions, but certainly the number of people living longer and with disability will increase, which is why the amendment is important and why we must be serious about what we are trying to do, as, indeed, we are.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000094"></a>Perhaps I may track back to the amendment itself. The HCA already has the object to improve the supply and quality of housing in England with a view to meeting the needs of people living in England. Clause 2(1) lists the four objects of the HCA. Clause 2(2) refers to people&#146;s &#147;future needs&#148; and,</p>
<ul><a name="08051948000324"></a>&#147;improving the supply of particular kinds of housing&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08051948000303"></a>This means that the HCA is charged with ensuring that the different needs of the community are catered for by providing housing of different tenures and types. That includes the provision of accessible housing. For example, if the local assessment of needs shows that you have a local population with a disproportionate number of elderly people and, by implication, of disabled people, there will be a need for accessible homes over and above market or affordable homes. The agency is duty bound to enable the provision of that type of home. That could include needs which are specific to particular communities and localities. That is picked up by the notion of the &#147;continued well-being&#148; of  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC443"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC443</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>communities. The HCA must work in partnership with local authorities, which negotiate the money they have available for disabled facilities grants to provide major adaptations such as having a ground floor bathroom put in for children or adults who can no longer use the stairs. The understanding of the needs of their local communities will shape the assessment of the type of housing to be provided. This will feed into the regional tier where the broad allocations of funding are decided and where the new National Housing and Planning Advice Unit will engage with the development of the regional spatial strategy. All that helps us not only to get a clear picture of what is needed locally but how it fits into the wider picture.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000095"></a>That is one aspect of what we are doing to meet the need for accessible homes but it goes much wider than that, as was picked up by the Committee. Recently we published a policy on housing and ageing, which is the first of its kind in the world. For the first time we have mapped our housing needs on to our demography. This picks up the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, and the noble Lord, Lord Best. In the future, we shall seek not to build niche homes for older people but to build the sort of homes that we will all grow into as we grow older. That is the critical difference and is what future-proofs&#151;to use a clich&#233;&#151;our ambitions and expectations. We have to do that because with an ageing population we simply cannot build for obsolescence. We have to have the sort of homes that will survive. The most benign of godfathers, Godfather Best, if I may call him that, made this perfectly clear when the Joseph Rowntree trust did its important work establishing 16 very simple standards for lifetime homes, which range from widening doors to having flat access into the hallway. Those standards are not difficult to achieve.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000096"></a>The Housing Corporation and English Partnerships powerfully took forward a commitment to build lifetime homes. They have led the way. We, in our policy, have stated that by 2011 all public-sector-funded homes will be developed as lifetime homes, and that we will work with industry to ensure that all homes will be built to that standard by 2013. That is a deliberate, balanced policy. It would be unfair of us to say to industry, &#147;In the next six months, you have to build everything as lifetime homes&#148;. It would not be practical or, indeed, fair. However, by setting a timescale within which they can work, by pledging, as we have, to work&#151;</p>

It does not strike me that we should have to wait 12 years for that.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000100"></a><a name="80519-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051948000384"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I appreciate what the noble Earl says and point him to the many conversations we have had with the housebuilding industry. They make it quite clear that we do this best if we do it in partnership. We do it through regulation only if it is not making the kind of progress that we want to see. We left the industry in no doubt that we will regulate if it does not do as we wish.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000101"></a>The point is that we are looking at significant amounts of housebuilding, much of which is already in plan. It is a big challenge to the industry when we are also asking for sustainable homes, sustainable building and so on and so forth. However, the noble Earl is right that it is important and something that we must and will do. I look forward to later debates on this on those parts of the Bill where we can go into even more detail. Apropos RADAR, we work uniquely closely with the disabled and ageing organisations lobbying on this. The policy has had a warm welcome because they know the realities with which we are dealing.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000102"></a>The argument about putting the requirement at this point of the Bill and in this way has been picked up by the noble Lord, Lord Best. We resist the notion of a list principle for very good reasons: we get ourselves into far greater problems creating exclusions and anomalies once we start adding things. I do  not agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, because I believe that accessible homes are not necessarily different from, for example, affordable, sustainable homes or those with any other generic name. Once you have that on the face of the Bill, you are looking at other sorts of descriptions that could cause greater problems. I have absolutely no doubt that accessible housing is important, but even I do not think they should be at the expense of other forms of housing that a community may need. However, we are clear in our commitment and we have a specific timetable that we will make work.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000103"></a>I refer briefly to Amendment No. 19 on inclusivity. Although I agree with the intention behind it, we are not able to accept it because by building communities that work and attending to their well-being, we are building inclusive and fair communities in which you cannot tell the type of homes that they are&#151;that is, rented, social or owned. We also want to be fair in our housing policy and to have mixed communities. All that is contained within the notion of well-being and the sort of thriving communities we want to see. I therefore believe that the proposal is already served by the Bill.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000104"></a>Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, talked about the renewal and regeneration of the existing stock. We have said in the paper on housing and ageing that we must make it absolutely clear that the homes of today must be safe and accessible. We do not want people who are at risk falling over for want of a grab rail that costs &#163;50 and going into hospital for a hip operation that costs &#163;6,000. Of equal priority is a major new investment in rapid repair services, which exist throughout the country but which are patchy, albeit often brilliantly delivered through the voluntary sector in partnership with local authorities. We want to see more and better rapid

Indeed, we have put more than &#163;30 million in additional funding into it.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000105"></a>I am sure the noble Baroness knows that the regional allocation pot is &#163;10 billion over the next three years. Our intention is that investment is targeted and that decisions are taken at the regional level according to regional needs. We continue to look for the right balance between new builds and improving the existing stock in different ways. I hope the noble Lord will feel that he can withdraw his amendment.</p>

It has been an extremely useful and focused debate, and has given rise to a number of points that I shall try to pick up on.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000107"></a>I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord Best, for accidentally trumping his ace. That was inadvertent. I may have less expertise than he has in this field. I was not necessarily looking for the best place in the Bill to put this; I was looking for the best place to have a useful discussion. If he will forgive me, I do think that we will probably have a better focused and more understanding debate as a result of this debate when we finally get to his amendments because we will have gone around some of the issues beforehand. I therefore apologise for what one might call an accident. I accept that building regulations could provide a universal solution.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000108"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, hit the nail on the head fairly accurately with her hammer when she mentioned the 2013 target and asked about the existing houses. I can never remember whether there are 22 million or 25 million houses already in the country, but not all of them are built to lifetime home standards, whether they are stately piles or humble cottages built in the 15th century. These were not necessarily considerations in people&#146;s minds when the homes were put up.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000109"></a>The special improvement grants available through the social services were also mentioned. I have seen elderly relatives helped in this way, but special improvements are not always easy to make. They can be made in some homes but not in others. It can be quite difficult in a really awkward old home. I am happy to knowledge that forms of assistance are there, but the reality is that the sooner we can ensure that new homes meet an available and required standard, the better it will be. I only marginally accept the Minister&#146;s statement that 2013 may be the earliest practicable time when it could be applied, although I accept that a certain amount of notice of this sort of change is absolutely required.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000110"></a>I was fascinated by the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Graham. They really got me going. I had this awkward thought; I wished that I could get into Dr Who&#146;s Tardis and take his remarks back to when he was the Opposition Chief Whip in this House and would have understood exactly where we were coming from. Apparently, this afternoon, he pretends that he does not, but of course he does.</p>

This is the nature of politics and we all need to remember what goes on. One of the things that I found fascinating in relation to the 1997 election, having arrived here with the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, on the same day, was that we all changed where we were sitting in the House, but the speeches stayed where they were. It was ever thus, and I have no doubt that it will not be too long before we are performing that charade again. </p>

<p><a name="08051948000113"></a>I am grateful to my noble friends for their contributions, which were helpful. This has been a useful discussion, which will lead to more focused debate when we discuss this field again later in the Bill. For now, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment. </p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051948000314"></a> Clause 2, page 1, line 15, after &#147;well-being,&#148; insert&#151;</p>
</ul>&#147;( ) to support local authorities in the development of sufficient, suitable housing for care leavers,&#148;
<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000117"></a>The noble Earl said: The amendment places a duty on the new agency to promote good practice in terms of provision of appropriate accommodation for care leavers. The purpose of the amendment is to discover what steps Her Majesty's Government are taking to resolve the unacceptable patchiness of provision for care leavers, one of our most vulnerable groups of young people for whom we have the greatest responsibility.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000118"></a>At Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08051948000315"></a>&#147;For the poorest, the future of social housing needs to be addressed in a more strategic and rather different way from the residual role that it has played in recent years&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/4/08; col. 105.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08051948000304"></a>One can apply the same principle to that of young people in care. We simply have not had a strategy to meet their complex needs and they have suffered as a consequence. I pay tribute to this Government for seeking to produce a strategy in terms of education by giving young people in care first admission to schools and by giving local authorities targets to meet on the welfare of children in their care. We increasingly recognise that we&#151;specifically, local authorities&#151;have a corporate parenting responsibility. These children did not choose to be taken into care. The state decided that they must be taken in. We have very special responsibilities for these children.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000119"></a>At this point, I am not asking for the agency to have responsibility, I am simply probing the Government to find out what their strategy is with regard to accommodation for young people leaving care. I wish to be reassured that there is a strategy going across health, education, local authorities and housing to meet the needs of these young people. Many of them need supported housing. How are we going to ensure that there is sufficient supported housing? Will the role of the independent reviewing officer be extended for him to monitor these young people for at least the first two years after they leave care? Perhaps the Minister can write to me on that. Are the Government looking  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC447"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC447</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>at the regulations on supported accommodation and lodging for these young people? My experience is that there are many dedicated people who work to support these young people as they leave care, but who are often not sufficiently well qualified to do such a difficult job and are not adequately supported.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000120"></a>There need to be sufficient foyers, hostels and supported lodgings. The lack of suitable supported accommodation is serious. A council leader conceded to me last week that although he could point to excellent new provision in his area, many other areas were lacking. Care leavers can still end up in bed and breakfast accommodation. The National Leaving Care Advisory service, based at the charity Rainer, has highlighted this as an issue of great concern. A National Voice, the care leavers&#146; charity has produced a report on accommodation, <I>No Place Like Home</I>, which highlights the many areas that need to be addressed. At a recent meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children and Young People in Care, care leavers talked about their experiences. Two of them spoke of being placed in unsuitable accommodation and finding themselves with new friends who were using their homes to deal drugs. Speaking to foster carers last week, I heard about their anxiety about the accommodation that their young people were being obliged to move into.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000121"></a>According to the Department for Children, Schools and Families, 25 per cent of young people leave care at just 16 years of age, while the average age for leaving home is 24. Many of these care leavers will need supported accommodation. Children are normally taken into care only when they are being harmed or are at serious risk of harm. Sixty per cent of those in care have had experience of abuse. While Her Majesty&#146;s Government have taken commendable steps to improve the care experience, including significant additional financial investment and legislation, living in care can still often be unsatisfactory, and these young people are at their most vulnerable as they leave that care. For instance, a number of surveys have shown that upwards of 30 per cent of care leavers experience homelessness in the first year after leaving care. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, may recall from his experience in terms of housing and homelessness in London that 12 per cent of homeless adults have experience of care. I am sure, therefore, that noble Lords agree that the figure of 30 per cent in the first year is unacceptable.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000122"></a>It was very welcome to see the children&#146;s Minister, Beverley Hughes, place such emphasis on improving the transition from care in the White Paper entitled <I>Care Matters</I>, which informed the Children and Young Persons Bill. However, failing to fill the current gaps in provision creates a lacuna in the Government&#146;s plans for better outcomes for looked-after children. Policy needs to hang together, and partnership is needed. As I have said, I look forward to an assurance from the Minister that the necessary steps are being taken.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000123"></a>We are soon to receive a Bill that will raise the school leaving age to 18. In principle, I welcome that, particularly from the point of view of these children. If correctly implemented, it may help some of them to stay away from the temptations of drugs, alcohol, crime and early pregnancy because they will be  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC448"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC448</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sufficiently occupied in their learning, but surely it is a nonsense to insist that a 17 year-old care leaver should remain in education or training but not provide him with appropriate accommodation. That sets the young person up to fail. I hope that the Minister can provide some comfort in this regard. I know that from her past experience and the charity she founded and directed, she will be sympathetic to the intentions behind this amendment, if not to the specifics. I look forward to her response and I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000124"></a><a name="80519-gc0003.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0003.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08051948000389"></a>Baroness Meacher:</b> I had not planned to speak in this debate, but I want to express my strong support for the amendment moved by my noble friend Lord Listowel. We spent a lot of time debating the incredible issues for young people leaving care during our consideration of the Children and Young Persons Bill. As my noble friend said, these children leave care when they are very young; it is perfectly normal for them to go when they are 16 to 18 years old. The average age for children leaving home is, of course, 24, and speaking from personal experience, I would suggest that even at that age they are still pretty vulnerable and in need of their parents&#146; support from time to time.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000125"></a>This amendment focuses on the needs of these young people. They require personal assistance, advice and support&#151;and, I would suggest, monitoring. That could save the state vast sums of money in the years ahead and spare the community a great deal of discomfort through the crimes that these young people would otherwise commit in their attempt to get a roof over their head. If necessary, they will go to prison. That is the reality of what happens: if young people leaving care do not get any support, how can we expect them to lead normal lives, get through their education, find a job and so on? They will simply continue to fail.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000126"></a>The Minister will not be surprised if I mention mental health. I would suggest that virtually all young people leaving care are vulnerable to mental health problems. We know that the proportion of them who have active mental health problems is extremely high. We discussed all those figures during the passage of the Children and Young Persons Bill, and I will not repeat them today. We are talking about extremely vulnerable young people, young people who are no doubt heading for drug addiction and criminality if they do not get the support they need.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000127"></a>I know that the noble Baroness will be very sympathetic to these issues; I do not know to what extent she can provide us with assurance; but there is no doubt that this would be one of the better investments of public money that one can think of.</p>

I happen to be a patron of a charity in which the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, also plays a prominent part. It is called Charis. It operates in the Mile End Road on property given to it by Charrington&#146;s Brewery years back. When it came to my attention, I went to visit it. Its raison d&#146;être is almost exactly ambition or aspiration.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC449"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC449</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000129"></a>It set out to turn around the lives of people, primarily youngish men, who have become addicted either to drugs or alcohol. As it was explained to me, there is no shortage of authorities or organisations which are willing, for short-term aid and assistance, to give such young men two months, three months or even longer, but then pat them on the back when they have dried out and send them out into the community. The raison d&#146;être for Charis is to say that that will not work. They need at least 12 months. Charis has a fine record of approaching authorities which address that kind of need and persuading them not to invest in six people for two months but in one person for 12 months.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000130"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, said, we need collaboration with the local authority for housing and local employers for work, so that when those people have finished their 12 month course, they are sent out into the community with a place to live and a job to go to. We have the difficult job of trying to decide how best to spend finite resources, which way will pay the greatest dividend&#151;not the quickest dividend, but the greatest. That is not easy. Great appeals are made by Charis. At one time, it raised more than &#163;2 million for extensions. It is undergoing that process again. It does good work and has good friends. I was much taken by the raison d'être&#151;it is all very well dealing with the symptoms, but we need to deal with the causes as well.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000131"></a>I wish the amendment well. I do not know what the Minister will say, but that problem is a syndrome, a canker eating away at the fabric of our society and it ought to be tackled more strongly than it is, bearing in mind the calls on resources.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000132"></a><a name="80519-gc0004.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0004.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051948000391"></a>Lord Best:</b> I support my noble friend Lord Listowel and thank him for and congratulate him on years of hard work for care leavers. He has been absolutely tireless.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000133"></a>First, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation produced some research in 2005 entitled <I>Life After Care</I>. The figure mentioned by my noble friend was about a third. In that survey, in the year following their leaving care, 35 per cent found themselves actually homeless&#151;street homeless. It seems an incredibly high proportion, but that is what the survey showed. Perhaps it is not surprising, if you are a 16, 17 or 18 year-old and you do not have a family to look after you. That very high figure came out of that study.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000134"></a>My second point is that 8,000 young people leave care every year, which means that in the great scheme of things, with something like 240,000 new households being formed every year, they are a very small minority group that can easily be overlooked. The value of the amendment, and possibly of the things that the noble Baroness will say in her reply, is that we must not forget this vital but very small group. If my sums are right, it is 3 per cent of the total number of new households being created. You can easily forget a little group of 3 per cent, but they are so vital that mentioning them in the Bill sounds like a very good idea.</p>

It is fairly obvious that if you come from a broken home, you might go into care. For those of us who had happy, contented and privileged childhoods, like I did, it is an enormous contrast. One must be permanently conscious of these things. I would have thought that one of the essential things to do is to find these people some sort of housing, which I hope would help to keep them out of trouble. The more that we can keep people out of trouble, the better it is. It is a never-ending struggle, but it is something that we ought to do.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000136"></a><a name="80519-gc0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051948000393"></a>Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville:</b> I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and I will confess my ignorance and say that I am not sure how to pronounce his name; I am sure that he is used to answering to both. He made a kind reference to my former constituency. Because of the nature of the people to whom he is referring, very few of them would have turned up in a surgery of mine, because they would not have known enough to do so. I have no difficulty at all in recognising what he is saying, because one had a great deal to do with the various charities, in a generic way, that were coping with these things, notably in the West End.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000137"></a>I remember&#151;I freely acknowledge that for obvious reasons this is not directly within the terms of the amendment&#151;one of the last constituency cases that I took on before I retired from the House of Commons in 2001. It was someone who had just come out of prison, where he had been for drugs offences, who appeared genuinely penitent that he had ever been seduced into the drugs industry. He laid out the circumstances in which he found himself in terms of what was available to people who came out of prison. I could see that recidivism was likely to occur pretty rapidly unless someone provided some help. I took down the case in considerable detail and sent it to Sir David Ramsbotham, as he was then. I asked, &#147;Dear David, is this typical?&#148;. He replied, &#147;I fear it is very typical indeed&#148;. The issue is obviously not germane to the amendment, but the generic case is a major problem for all of us.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000138"></a><a name="80519-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0004.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08051948000394"></a>Lord Dixon-Smith:</b> It is very easy to follow my noble friend Lord Brooke. The figure that I have is that 27 per cent of all prisoners begin their lives in care, and once they have left care, sadly, for various reasons, they have drifted into crime, which is difficult to get out of once you are in it. It was easy for me to add my name to the amendment, because my dear wife has spent quite an amount of time working with the YMCA, particularly in her home county and also for a time in London, where she was overseeing a hostel for people in just this situation. They were 17 and 18 year-olds who had nothing and who had nowhere to go.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000139"></a>This is a very small and special demand. As the noble Lord, Lord Best, said, it is probably some 8,000 a year in a much wider spectrum of housing demand. These are people who on the whole, at least initially, do not need housing. What they need is a room where they have an element of supervision, guidance and

We are talking about specialist facilities. Yes, this is special pleading on another of those small problems that to the individuals involved is vital and essential, even if we are inclined from time to time to overlook it. None of us intends to do that.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000140"></a>There is no easy answer, because we are dealing with a community ill. The noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, picked up that point again. Once you get into the wrong sector of society in early life, it is very difficult to get out of it. That leads rather more than simply to the provision of appropriate hostel accommodation where these young people can be made safe. You must also provide them with occupations. I recently met a young person who got into difficulty; the YMCA had got hold of him in time and, thank heavens, he was all right subsequently&#151;but it could easily have gone the other way.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000141"></a>I have nothing to add to what has been said, except to say that I am sure that the noble Baroness will be as sympathetic as everyone else has been to this issue. I repeat the dreadful mantra that this is a specialist demand that we lose sight of at our peril. If we cannot sort the problem of these young people&#151;I do not mean that only they are a problem, but that it is a problem for us&#151;the difficulties of an ever-increasing prison population and so on are what follow from our inability. None of us wants that to happen.</p>

It has often seemed to me that the term &#147;looked-after children&#148;, which is in more common use, points up the problems. They are children and they are looked after or, as is often the case, not looked after. The noble Earl referred in his amendment and his remarks to something much wider than the physical environment. I wonder whether this is just a question of housing supply coupled with other support, rather than the supply of a particular type of housing for children who have this need, to avoid a situation whereby groups of young people come out of care and find themselves in unsuitable private rented accommodation, with all the difficulties that there may be of dealing with not particularly helpful or responsible landlords. The issue certainly includes supply and the type of housing, but it is a good deal wider than that, as the noble Earl said.</p>

Like other noble Lords, I pay tribute to the work of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, over the years. I do not think that there has been a Bill in which the noble Earl has not brought our attention to what we can do to improve the lives of these young people. The whole House is grateful to him for that. He was right to move the amendment in the way that he did at this point.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000144"></a>The question for me is: how do we make the lives of those young people better? I have to say, as the noble Lord anticipated, that I do not think it is served by including this in the Bill, not least because once we  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC452"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC452</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>identify these particular young people, we have to think of other young people with other problems and whether they should be named in the Bill as well. The broader point is that the HCA would not be fulfilling its objectives if it were not meeting the needs of people, as it states in Clause 2, which is about meeting the needs of the people and the well-being of the community.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000145"></a>For all the reasons that noble Lords have given in the many ways that they have brought it to our attention&#151;not least my noble friend Lord Graham, the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, and the noble Earl, Lord Onslow&#151;we see all the implications of a life spent in care, not by choice, written in our criminal justice system, in the people on our streets, in people with mental health conditions who are very difficult to help. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, pointed out, it is not a question of a single solution. It is a question of finding the right housing for the young person involved. It is about providing support through agencies in programmes such as Supporting People, for which my department is responsible, which literally supports people in their home environment. It is a question of dealing with the small but hugely significant group of people, this 8,000 population, who have so much to contend with not just when they are in care but especially in transitional states. They need a place that they can call home, but we have not been very good at providing that and we are living with the consequences.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000146"></a>However, thanks not least to the efforts of the noble Earl, children in care have never been so much in the forefront of our minds in what we are trying to do through the work of the education department and our emphasis in the care pathway on providing support at critical times.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000147"></a>I turn to what we can do through the HCA and in the DCLG. Traditionally, we have had responsibility for social exclusion, which has now passed to the Cabinet Office. We are working for the first time on a cross-government PSA, PSA 16, which is about social exclusion. How do we help four particular groups of very vulnerable people access services that they need, including accommodation? One of those groups is care leavers. We will be working very closely with the Homes and Communities Agency and with local authorities as they put in their bids for supported accommodation, and so on, to plan for the needs of those young people more intensively than we have been able to do before.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000148"></a>Beyond that is the responsibility of the local authority to know what is going on in its community and to address housing needs. There are not many people more vulnerable than those young people, who have a higher call on the concern not simply of housing officers in local authorities but all those dealing with the Children&#146;s Plan, with transitional arrangements and with what happens to those young people as they leave school.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000149"></a>That is the work that the Housing and Communities Agency will take forward, informed by the work of local authorities in its partnership identifying local needs within the regional context. That is a key aspect of the agency knowing where to invest&#151;which housing

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000150"></a>As the noble Earl will know, that is happening much more positively following the passage of the Children (Leaving Care) Act. That has led to regulations that require the responsible authority to take steps to ensure that 16 and 17 year-old care leavers are maintained in suitable accommodation. That is one of the things that the HCA would also have a care to. Eighteen year-old care leavers should have the same entitlement to accommodation as other young people, but they should also be able to depend on continuing support and planning by the responsible authorities, not least the mental health services. Investment is going into the county services too.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000151"></a>The <I>Care Matters</I> White Paper that we published last June includes a range of commitments to improve the quality of care provided to looked-after children. Crucially, leaving care is seen not as a single event but as a transition into a new life with greater adult responsibilities. That means we need to know how to bring the services together. We are taking forward 11 &#147;right to be cared for&#148; pilots that give young people a greater say over when they leave care. Young people are going to be more involved in managing their own transition to adulthood. Through the Children and Young Persons Bill&#151;and there are veterans of that Bill in this Committee, not least the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher&#151;we are introducing a requirement that children in foster placements or children&#146;s homes who move to independent living do so only as a consequence of a review of their care plan, so that they move on to their final care placement only when it is recognised by all the people responsible that they are ready to take that step. That will help as well.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000152"></a>We are also legislating to extend the personal adviser role for care leavers up to the age of 25 for young people who wish to resume courses of educational training. As part of our <I>Care Matters</I> programme, we have allotted funding to contribute to the costs of building additional units of supported accommodation for care leavers. We hope that discussions about that commitment will take place among the Housing Corporation and the other stakeholders later this year. That work will be taken forward by the HCA. There is a great deal of thought, care and action going on. In that context, I can mention the good practice guidance on housing and children&#146;s services co-operation, in relation to homelessness for young people. We have new pilots&#151;Staying Put, 18 Plus family care&#151;to enable young people to remain with foster carers.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000153"></a>I will not go into endless detail, but I hope I am giving the impression that not only are we serious about co-ordinating services and identifying those 8,000 young individuals in different circumstances with different backgrounds but we are also piloting some new ways of doing things.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000154"></a>The noble Earl asked me some specific questions. I have some very long answers, but if he does not mind I suggest that he and I meet officials and someone from the DCSF to go through them. We will also discuss how much more we may be able to do within

I also thank noble Lords who took part and showed understanding, sympathy and support for the general direction of the amendments. I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, and the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, for putting their names to my amendment. I recognise what the noble Lord, Lord Graham of Edmonton, said: we need to put long-term investment into vulnerable adults and young people. The Government are to be commended on striving to achieve that end. We still have a long way to go.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000156"></a>A foster carer told me last week that she had been fostering for 13 years but had now decided to give up because she felt that she did not get enough support in what she was doing. We have a shortage of 10,000 foster carers in England alone. I was told at the meeting of the Fostering Network that 10 per cent of foster carers drop out each year. The Government are putting tremendous effort into improving the situation, but the stability for young people while they are in care is often still not adequate, although it is improving. We need to ensure that when they leave care they get the support and long-term engagement that the Minister has described is being attempted. I will read carefully what she has said, and I look forward to the meeting that she kindly offered.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000157"></a>I just want to check whether there are any further questions to put to the Minister at this point. I warmly welcome what the Government are doing to allow children the choice of whether to stay in foster care to the age of 18 or 21. I recently heard Kevin Brennan, the Minister in the other place, speak about this, and I welcome the commitment. It is so important that these children can choose to stay with their carer until the age of 21. It should certainly be at least that. Again, I thank your Lordships for a very helpful debate, and I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

However, the interesting thing is whether an agency such as this, which is about the provision of housing and regeneration, is overtly expected to contribute to these aims. That is all I want to say. I am interested to hear what the Government have to say about this. I beg to move.</p>

It is a probing amendment, which recognises that the creation of the Homes and Communities Agency presents us with a real opportunity to move away from public housing monocultures of the past and to invest in the creation of new towns and areas that have both a physical and a social identity.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000164"></a>Having spent many years working at the centre of a large housing estate, I know how damaging these monocultures can be to local communities and how important it is that the new agency is empowered to respond to the social, economic and cultural contexts in which it invests and to encourage real diversity across the country. The public sector and housing associations are not the only ones guilty of creating monocultures. Private developers also have quite a track record in this regard, and have on many occasions missed the opportunity to create truly sustainable developments that have a real sense of identity.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000165"></a>Place-making is not just about having the right public sector structure or a clear leader, bringing people together or having a clear quality design concept. It is also about having a clear and rooted purpose and vision for the place. The desolate estates on the outskirts of many of our major cities are good examples of rootless places with no clear vision in their conception.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000166"></a>Over the past decade or so, we have talked a great deal about joined-up thinking and joined-up action. This is correct, but in many of our poorest communities these fine words are often not being turned into practical reality on the ground. I was in Bradford recently on an outer estate&#151;here I declare an interest&#151;and discovered a range of buildings sitting very close to each other at the centre of the estate. In reality, however, they had little relationship to each other and there was no real sense of place. It just felt empty and desolate. There was a community facility, which was run by a charitable body, a healthy living centre, a row of shops, a school and a church, and very soon there will be a new small supermarket. Yet the amazing thing was that none of the buildings bore any relationship whatever to another, and there was little of the joined-up activity necessary to create a sense of place and build a sustainable community. However, a number of the buildings had been built and extended in the past decade. All the government structures were there, but the words were not being translated into reality on the ground. There was no heart to the community, and apparently little relationship between the different services in a community which desperately needed a focus.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000167"></a>My experience suggests that place-making will not happen by chance, and it will not automatically occur through the various public sector structures and   


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC456"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC456</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>bodies created by the Government. Something else has to happen, and it has everything to do with people and relationships on the ground. Two years ago I was asked by the then chief executive of Tower Hamlets council to take a look at St Paul&#146;s Way, a group of rundown estates some 500 yards from Canary Wharf. Again, I must declare an interest. Violent clashes had been taking place outside the school and the lead officer wanted a clearer picture of what was happening on the ground. I discovered that there were two large housing estates divided by a main road. On one side of the road were the homes of members of the Bengali community, and on the other housing for traditional white East End families. I was assured that a helpful social reality had developed over many years as loyal local authority officers followed public sector rules and processes which sought to create more equitable and integrated communities, yet the unintended consequences of their actions had not been foreseen. One local resident described the road as the Berlin Wall. Although the public sector structures had been set up to encourage neighbourhood renewal, in reality it was not happening on the ground.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000168"></a>I also discovered that plans were being developed to build a new school, health centre and 500 homes, but little real and meaningful communication was actually taking place between the local education authority, the primary care trust and the housing company. All the structures were in place and the boxes were being ticked, but the opportunity to create a new sense of place was being completely missed. I reported my findings to the chief executive and was then asked whether I would play a lead role in directing what has now become known as the St Paul&#146;s Way Transformation Project. My first task was to take 16 of the key players from each of the public bodies away for two days and build relationships. We began our meeting not with a conference or committee session, but with a meal. Initially there were many suspicions to be overcome, but by the end of our two days together, relationships were starting to be built and a unanimous consensus reached among those present. We all agreed that St Paul&#146;s Way presented us with a great opportunity to build not only a new place with a real identity, but also to develop a new culture, and more entrepreneurial ways of working by which together we could explore new joined-up activity.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000169"></a>The aim was not only to transform the physical environment along St Paul&#146;s Way and to co-ordinate the various planned developments, but also in the process to transform relationships between the various service providers along the street for the fragmented local communities. Partners agreed to encourage a change in mindset and to promote a creative and entrepreneurial culture in which local communities, the public and private sectors would find new ways of working together, following the experience of similar social enterprise projects in Tower Hamlets.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>

<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC457"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC457</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>centre, and we are about to sign contracts for 500 homes. We are also working on plans to redevelop two churches that sit at either end of the street and on plans for a new primary school, and are now running a &#147;culture change&#148; programme with residents, local head teachers and staff. We have further to go in the transformation process, which will take at least 10 years, but relationships have moved on.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000171"></a>We are grappling with public sector commissioning processes that still militate against all we are seeking to achieve. It is very difficult to make this happen in practice on the ground and to make it real. If the new agency is to break through some of the blockages that we have been experiencing and to be able truly to create real places with real identity and meaning, then it will need to be given the powers to break through the political and structural inertia that still exists in many places, particularly in some of our most challenging estates and in some of the cultures of parts of the public sector. Using the right words and ticking the right boxes is one thing. Turning the words into reality in real places on the ground is quite another. This amendment seeks to draw the Minister&#146;s attention to these concerns.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000172"></a>The point of sharing this experience with the Committee is that this change did not happen by chance. Public sector structures on their own were not turning the aspirations of politicians into the new realities on the ground that they rightly desired. Indeed, many of the processes of government were themselves, often unwittingly, undermining the opportunities for real change. For the new agency to have real teeth and to cut through this kind of inertia, I would suggest that when it begins its work it needs to look very carefully at examples on the ground where people are attempting to bring real change and create a new sense of &#147;place&#148;, to understand what works in detail and to be given the powers to build on this knowledge.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000173"></a>Secondly, the Minister might like also to consider in her deliberations that in order to create a real &#147;place&#148; serious investment in terms of time and resources have to be invested by the new agency, not just in new structures but in providing appropriate training for agency staff which enables them to build the kinds of open and honest human relationships with partners and local people on the ground that can truly bring change. Only then will the agency be truly equipped with the tools necessary to navigate the complex partnerships that are part of the modern world in which we all live. The success of the new agency in this area will be directly related to the human energy, time and resources that it puts into building deep and workable relationships. Navigating the modern world is all about investing in people and relationships; structures and processes will never be enough.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000174"></a>Thirdly, all agencies tend to work to a regulatory structure. Rather than a tick-box, best-practice model, the agency might consider ways of evaluating whether real innovation is taking place, whether a real sense of place is being created and whether real partnership working is happening on the ground. This can be contrasted with a committee approach with all the appropriate structures represented, but little real  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC458"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC458</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>change. A minimum baseline is clearly needed to ensure that public funds are being used appropriately. However, you can sense whether partnership is real and whether innovation is happening, not through lengthy reports, but by spending time on the ground. You can sense it and actually smell it.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000175"></a>Has the Minister considered requiring the agency to seek out places which are delivering on innovation and genuine partnership and funding them to play a role in regulation? Rather than an academic-led approach to evaluation with lengthy reports after the facts, why not get highly successful practitioners involved early to examine new schemes? They will soon be able to tell where the successful schemes are and where intervention might make a real difference. You might call it peer review by the best. Perhaps the Minister might require the agency to list each year in its annual report the innovative programmes that it has supported&#151;what worked and what did not. If the agency is genuinely innovating, there will be failures as well as successes, and that should be expected. You could look at the excellent Phoenix Development Fund run by the then DTI until recently as a good example of government-funded innovation. Perhaps there should be a presumption not to regulate.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000176"></a>Finally, has the Minister considered the value of involving faith communities&#151;here, I must declare an interest&#151;in creating a new sense of place. As well as important in and of themselves, they can often act as neutral parties that bring people and agencies together, and are often overlooked when developing a new sense of place. Indeed, sometimes they can be considered a catalyst that can bring a new heart to the community. I hope that those thoughts are helpful to this debate.</p>

It is born out of having represented a constituency which the European Union, due to what in my view is its statistical errancy, thinks is part of the richest area in the whole of the Union. I do not think that that is absolutely correct, but I shall not go into the argument. While it has that background, it also has a characteristic which I suspect makes it unique among Conservative seats, in that it appears among the 100 poorest constituencies in the country when a calculation is made according to what proportion of households meets standard poverty indices. I have made the case before, but I shall make it again, because it responds to both the amendments in this group. I am not extrapolating from it to the larger scale, but using it as a single instance of where these amendments could make a difference.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000180"></a>This relates to my longstanding campaign that postal workers should be regarded as key workers for housing purposes. I shall give a brief example. In the constituency comprising the two cities in the centre of London, there are at least a dozen or up to 16 postal districts, if  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC459"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC459</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>NW3 and W1 are each counted as a postal district. Much the two largest are W1 and SW1. To the surprise of some, SW1 has plenty of affordable housing and consequently the quality of postmen delivering letters in the district&#151;a fairly key area in the context of the national economy&#151;is high. They can walk to work and deliver the correspondence entrusted to them extremely efficiently and expeditiously. In W1 there is very little affordable housing, so people come in from outlying suburbs. The quality of people employed by the Post Office in W1 is not remotely of the same standard as that of those working in SW1. Some 96 per cent of the mail goes to businesses in W1, and there can be no doubt about the deleterious effect on the economy in the centre of the city of the fact that the postal work is done less efficiently. I do not mean this in any way as a criticism of the Post Office, since members of Post Office management have made these comments to me over the years. However, I know from the complaints that I received over a period of 25 years from constituents who were on the receiving end that there was a significant difference.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000181"></a>I am certainly not criticising Westminster City Council, but the term &#147;monoculture&#148; was used earlier, and I am saying that the concentration of a particular type of housing and the absence of certain other kinds can have severe consequences in terms of how a great city works.</p>

We all know what a community is when we see it, but we are talking about trying to create one. We cannot create an integrated group of people from all walks of life by regulation, direction or even by the best of intentions on the part of an outside institution. A community is something that has to evolve.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000183"></a>In Essex, where we had two new towns, trying to persuade those towns to develop into new communities was something else indeed. After a sufficient period, they eventually did develop into communities, but it took a very long time. It took even longer for them to become what I would call part of the county. We moved massive numbers of people into this alien landscape; it was not a Martian landscape, but it was alien to almost all of those who had left London. They were moving into modern housing, whereas they had been living in difficult housing in east London. They had survived the war and they were wonderful people, but trying to turn them into a community and then absorb them into the community was very difficult.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000184"></a>Having worked through local government all my life, one of the things that I have become conscious of is that the more you try to force things in a particular direction, the more difficult you make it. People have their own ways and their own motivations. Most people, in my experience, want to get on with their lives in spite of everything that the Government and local government are doing to them and for them, and not because of it. Somehow we have to try to cross that divide, which is extremely difficult. The Homes and Communities Agency will have a strong influence on the social housing sector across the whole country.

It is extremely difficult to do that in a way that does not involve the rest of community; but once you say that, you are in difficulties, because you cannot force it. The intentions are invariably benign, but sometimes the effects, as the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, showed in his remarks, can be perverse.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000185"></a>I know all too well that on the official side it is too easy for people to push their own interests or departmental purpose. They can be jealous of other people working in the same field and will not co-operate with them. It is difficult, if you stand above that, to try to make them do it. The problem is that wretched word &#147;make&#148;. In a great democracy, you cannot make people do anything. I think even members of the party opposite, like me, at heart are anarchists. We have to accommodate all this, and it is very difficult. The Homes and Communities Agency will have things to do on this, and the noble Baroness will say that they are going to do all this and it will be absolutely perfect. The trouble is that we know that it is not absolutely perfect. If you look at what is happening on the ground, much as we want all those things to happen, they are happening in bits and pieces, and some bits work here and there. We are not going to achieve it. Somehow, we have to have give that ambition to the agencies in the Bill. If we try to prescribe it too tightly, we will get it wrong. I know that the noble Baroness is going to say something like that; I am not exactly arguing her case for her.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000186"></a>This is something that we have to find a way of doing. As the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, said, we cannot do it through the regulator; it has to come from within. We can perhaps help it to some degree with design. We had a wonderful debate on architecture a while ago. We can help it by mixing housing, and so on. In the end, it is an impossible task, and I do not see an easy resolution to it.</p>

In response to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, there always had to be a clear rationale about the location for investment; there were always choices to be made. In English Partnerships, our guidance from the department was always that certain areas&#151;and the noble Lord&#146;s former constituency was certainly one&#151;fell under the criteria where investment was appropriate. Guidance will have to be given about which are the priority areas for investment. I am not sure that including the provision about inequality in the Bill will change or necessarily help that, but I fully expect the new agency to carry on in the way that the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships do, in addressing itself to those areas of greatest need, which are generally very explicitly set out for the organisation.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000188"></a>I listened with great interest to the contribution by the noble Lord, Lord Mawson; I know the development of which he speaks. It is very important that the new agency can do two things. Plainly, one of the key rationales for creating it was to bring together all those disparate funding streams that drive people  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC461"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC461</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>mad when they are trying to make sense of all these things. There may be 15 different sets of people that you have to satisfy before you can try to get your project off the ground. We are bringing all those funding streams from within the department and those other agencies together, so at least there is a one-stop shop and a fighting chance for energetic communities to engage properly.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000189"></a>I hope that some of the structures and apparatus of funding being brought together here will address some of the points that the noble Lord made so eloquently. I could not agree with him more when he says that that is all very well, but what will make the difference is people who live in the areas, who care about the areas and who are prepared to engage with the Homes and Communities Agency and drive its funding in a way that makes more sense for those communities.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000190"></a>I had a great affinity with what the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, said. It is very important that the Academy for Sustainable Communities comes into the new agency, because its role is precisely to try to change the rules of engagement, so that new developments are less bureaucratic and much more in tune with what local people are attempting to do. The noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, is absolutely right: some of the places that we love most in the United Kingdom have never seen a planner&#146;s blueprint, thank goodness. They have grown organically, in a higgledy-piggledy way, and we have come to love them.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000191"></a>The agency must do two different things: it is responsible for creating some new places and for assisting existing communities to regenerate and rejuvenate those places. However much we may wish that things would grow organically, the agency must engage in master planning. Let us hope that when it does, it follows the admirable example shown by the noble Lord, Lord Mawson.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000192"></a><a name="80519-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0005.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="08051948000404"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> I have discovered the problem with the Bill: it is too interesting. Our debates are too interesting. I anxiously watch the time, but I forget that I do not need to watch the time. This debate has been profound. It touches on so much of what we want for our country and our communities and what will be possible under the HCA and the new ways in which it will work.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000193"></a>First, I shall deal with the problem of poverty. I do not want to labour this point but, as a Government, we have made a very explicit and ambitious commitment to reduce poverty. We will be judged on what we have achieved, not least in taking 600,000 children out of poverty, and much else besides. There is no doubt that there is a very clear connection between poor quality, overcrowded, unhealthy homes and poverty. Poor people live in the worst accommodation. When you live in awful accommodation, you are likely to be least prepared and supported into work and training. You have less support for your family. There is an awful and toxic mixture of poverty and disadvantage. One ambition of my department is that no one should be disadvantaged by the place in which they live. The two problems go together.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000194"></a>Inevitably, we are emphasising this great increase in social housing&#151;&#163;8 billion to go into affordable homes over the next three years&#151;because we want to reduce, and, indeed, wipe out, poverty. Decent homes are the first step to reducing and ending poverty, but within that we have to know what we are doing. I refer to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, and my noble friend in this regard. The Homes and Communities Agency has a raft of regeneration policies. As he well knows, this is not simply about regarding housing as a social necessity but about providing decent homes, building mixed communities and regenerating areas. That means economic regeneration.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000195"></a>On estates where our New Deal for Communities is in operation, one sees refurbished homes&#151;these estates feel like and are better places&#151;new community centres, brand new primary schools, new health centres with a much greater emphasis on outreach, new transport, new opportunities for training and new sports centres. That is all about lifting the spirit, creating opportunities for people to get into training and work and keep and develop their skills. It is about enabling us to bring an end to poverty through regeneration and better housing. We have particular regard for BME communities, which suffer multiple disadvantages and which need particular forms of support, not least to enable them to get out of substandard homes.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000196"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, made a very important point about postal workers. We are expanding the eligibility criteria for the new build homebuy and the open market homebuy products, which are a mixture of renting and ownership. Although it is important to continue to give priority to key workers and tenants in the social rented sector, from today new build homebuy and open market homebuy products will be open to all first-time buyers with a household income below &#163;60,000. Therefore, postal workers will be in a strong position to access those new products. I am happy to write to him with more details on that.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000197"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, spoke powerfully about building communities, drawing on his extraordinary and impressive experience. I am grateful to my noble friend Lady Ford for talking about the way in which we have traditionally prioritised investment so that it really makes a difference to the places that are most vulnerable and disadvantaged but which also show promise. The tasking framework of the HCA will reflect that, because it will reflect the Government&#146;s priority of putting investment where it can work best. The noble Lord is right, communities are diverse; we do not need to specify this in the Bill. Bow is very different from Braunstone in Leicester, which is very different from Aston in Birmingham. These communities have particular strengths and particular needs. The Bill specifies that the HCA will work to meet the needs of communities, and that is what it must do.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000198"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Mawson, and the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, asked how you make communities. You do so by enabling the people who live, or who will live, in those communities to have a prior say about what they want from them. In some of   


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC463"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC463</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the new greenfield communities that will be built, for example Northstowe, we must start by building the community infrastructure and the social infrastructure, but in a way that responds to and reflects what  people say they want. Master planning does not  mean anything unless you have the widest possible democratic input.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000199"></a>I listened carefully to what the noble Lord said about how you create a new sense of place. It is difficult to do that in a new community. We should not kid ourselves that these places will spring up overnight with a strong sense of community. They will be diverse, mixed and fair. At the very worst, you can design out things; it is not always easy to design them in, but you can if you work with the community. We have a lot to learn from the way in which the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, has led the partnership in east London. He is right that we need investment in time, resources and training. The Academy for Sustainable Communities is there to do just that: to build up capacity. He is also right that we should not be hung up on structures. The Bill simplifies structures, brings in funding streams and creates the one-stop shop&#151;the single conversation&#151;of which we have spoken.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000200"></a>Regulation must be appropriate, but partnership is key. That is where the relationships that the noble Lord talked about come into play, and the reason why we must hear all the people who speak for the community. Some people at the outer edges are never heard. I am thinking of LINks and the health model, which are designed to bring in people from the margins of the community to voice their anxieties and give them a sense of contribution.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000201"></a>This is about people and relationships. I hope that we can learn enormously from the community engagement work that English Partnerships has done in the past, which dealt with some of the pockets of resistance to change in communities. Some communities do not want to change, and why should they in many instances? We must give people credit for being happy, even if we think that their homes are not quite what they might be. We have learnt much from that over the past few years in what we have tried to do and how we have tried to do it. I am entirely sympathetic to that. As the noble Lord said, we must work with the faith communities and get under the radar. The faith communities are better placed than many to reach into communities that are frightened and that do not come forward to make their voices heard. All the faith communities have a big responsibility there.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000202"></a>So, no, this does not happen by accident. You can plan it, and we will be intent on planning it. What we can do will be explicit in the tasking framework. We have a lot to learn, and I am absolutely confident, given the things that have been said in Committee this afternoon, that people will watch the HCA as much for its style and the way in which it conducts itself as for its content. The conversations that we have had with Sir Bob Kerslake make me optimistic that we have a leader who knows very well what it is to listen to people and to take hold of sound practice on the ground.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000203"></a>I was particularly interested in the idea of the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, that we should ask people who have been successful to advise us on what might and might not work. We do not do that often enough, and it is a very interesting suggestion.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000204"></a><a name="80519-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08051948000405"></a>Lord Greaves:</b> Again, I am astonished by the debate that I set off quite a long time ago now, given our break for a Division. I thank the Minister for her comments about my amendment on poverty and inequality. It is useful to have them on the record. Even if they are not to be written into the Bill, these are some of the things by which the new agency will be judged.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000205"></a>When new Members come to this House, everyone looks at them and asks why they have come. Sometimes the answer is, &#147;Don&#146;t ask&#148;, but in most cases we find out in due course that it is because of the expertise and knowledge that they have to contribute to this House. We have heard this afternoon why the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, came to this House, and he has a great deal more to contribute to debates on how to make things happen at a very local level in communities, or even in the non-communities where it really matters. The noble Lord said that this is all about people and relationships on the ground. That is absolutely right. For some of us who do not hide our scepticism about the value and ability of large national quangos to do what is necessary at a local level, the comments this afternoon of the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, are extremely valuable.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000206"></a>None of us denies that there has to be national allocation of resources and that there have to be national priorities and strategies. If implementing those priorities and strategies happens through quango-type organisations, that is all right. Some of us are still sceptical, but that is clearly the way it is going to be done, so it has to be done in the best way possible. However, people and relationships on the ground are what really matter. We understand that we are to have a Bill, probably in the next Session, called something like the &#147;community engagement Bill&#148;. Again, some of us are sceptical about whether national legislation can create community engagement, but those who take part in the debates will no doubt benefit from the expertise and perspectives of the noble Lord, Lord Mawson.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000207"></a>I do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, when he says that you cannot create communities. Perhaps that is true in a superficial way, but there are things that organisations at all levels can do to help communities to create themselves, and there are things that can actually hinder that process. The Minister said that the process of learning what works and what does not is very important. I agree that learning is more important that having a national ideological perspective on these matters.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000208"></a>I listened carefully to the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, and I agree with almost everything she said, except when she talked about the agency being engaged in &#147;master planning&#148;. I hope that the HCA will not do that, but that it will limit itself to  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC465"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC465</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>providing the resources necessary to allow people on the ground to do the planning. If this is going to succeed, that is where it has to happen. Planning has to involve disparate organisations, agencies and so on, and it has got to be done on the ground. No one can sit in an office in the regional capital or London and lay down the rules. Whether in the county hall or the city hall, master planning has to be done locally among the people who are involved. Some will be professionals, some will be residents and some will be local politicians. If they are all brought together, there is a chance that it will work, although there are by no means any guarantees. That is the way we have to go.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000209"></a>Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, referred to rootless estates with no great vision in conception. We know that there are far too many of those, and yet the original big estates on the edge of towns were built with great vision. It was a vision to take people out of the slums, to give them decent homes in a good environment with gardens and local facilities. The best of them have worked well. One of the first examples was Wythenshawe in Manchester. It came about through the huge vision of Lord Simon of Wythenshawe and others who have been involved more recently. By and large, Wythenshawe has been a success. Nobody would claim that there are no problems, of course, but a lot of them are caused by the fact that it was too large to be a single, council-owned estate and community. Part of the problem is the monocultural aspect because it was not properly understood. Wythenshawe would have worked better if it had been broken up into a series of smaller units interspersed with private development. Let us not pretend that all the big projects have been a disaster, because they have not. But the huge vision went wrong somewhere, not just in the suburbs but also in the high-rise inner city estates, and we have to understand why. Was it bad design or monolithic bureaucracies taking over and doing things without thinking? Was it lack of funding for community resources? Unless we understand why things went wrong from the original vision, we will not succeed in future. We will have to keep coming back to this: we must do our very best to create&#151;again, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Mawson&#151;the relationships on the ground. That inevitably means making things as local as possible because it is the immediate locality that people can relate to.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000210"></a>No doubt we will discuss all this at great length when we get that Bill, and I hope we will have a great time doing it. It is so important that people in big organisations at national level do not think they can just do things that they cannot do. They can provide resources, ideas, inspiration and professional expertise that allow the people on the ground to do it. Having said that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000211"></a>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000214"></a>The noble Lord said: I was going to begin by saying that my words follow on fairly easily and naturally from those of the Minister, but she is not present to hear me. They follow on because we are talking about the Homes and Communities Agency, and during the previous debate I had the thought that on the whole I feel rather sorry for the chief executive elect, Sir Bob Kerslake, whom I met for the first time last week. If he is reading the <I>Hansard</I>s of this Committee&#151;I have no doubt that he is, as the job he is taking on at the HCA will absorb him fully for a number of years&#151;he will see this amendment, as he saw the previous one and probably one or two more by the time we have finished, and he will say, &#147;Oh my God, how ever am I going to fulfil all these ambitions?&#148;. Whether the Government accept the amendments is neither here nor there; the Government, through their Ministers, are accepting the implicit pledges behind those amendments. That is a wonderful thing.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000215"></a>Amendment No. 23 is directed at the issue of social homebuy, which is part-purchase or whatever. The Homes and Communities Agency will be without question the prime mover as the provider of social housing across the broad spectrum of housing provision and new housing. Not the least of the problems one faces in a mobile community is that as people fall back into social housing, and the present housing crisis is unfortunately going to increase that demand, equally, other people want to get out of social housing if they can. Social homebuy helps to provide that route. We have discussed the impossibility of the HCA fulfilling every aspiration, but the fact is that we are dealing with a society with a considerable degree of mobility. There will always be some people who unfortunately are moving down, and we hope there will always be some people seeking to move up. Social homebuy is one of the ways that that can be achieved.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000216"></a>Social homebuy is also important for the Homes and Communities Agency because, where it is providing social homes, it will also provide a revenue stream and a return of capital that can then be reinvested in more housing. It can create a virtuous circle. We heard in the last debate about the criteria for key worker provision and the access that they might have to social homebuy. That is an important aspect of the work of the Homes and Communities Agency.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000217"></a>I have no doubt that we shall have the same argument about what to put in the Bill as its function, but there is always in the background&#151;which has not yet been mentioned in this debate so I will mention it for the first time&#151;the fact that what a Minister says in reply to a point raised is relevant, if things come to a court case, as an indication of what the Government&#146;s intentions behind a Bill were when it was passed. I look forward to the Minister&#146;s reply because I am sure that he is going to say something positive. Whether he likes it or not, it will be on the record as the Government&#146;s intention. If it is there, and it is the Government&#146;s intention, that may be useful at some point in the future if someone wishes to come to a judgment. I beg to move.</p>

To suggest that there should be a proportion of social homebuy in each development promoted by the agency would limit the ability and flexibility of the agency to work with the appropriate local authority in looking at the need for specific types of housing in an area and planning a development in accordance with those needs.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000219"></a>In developments where there has been more prescription about the sum of affordable housing or specific subsets of affordable or other specialist housing, it has not always been the right answer. This amendment would be too much of a constraint if it were in the Bill. For that reason, although I support absolutely the sentiment behind it, the Minister should probably resist putting it in the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000220"></a><a name="80519-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051948000408"></a>Lord Graham of Edmonton:</b> I take very much what has just been said about the decisions to operate the current provisions on social homebuy needing to be monitored carefully by those with responsibility nearer to the action; but I am hostile to the concept. Whether you like it or not, there are millions of people in inadequate housing who are desperate to get a tenancy for a council house or a housing association property, and they are denied it. The people we are talking about who would be affected by the amendment are already very lucky people because, after waiting for a period or living in bad conditions, they have got to the top of the list; they have been preferred and they obtain a tenancy. My experience is that council tenants are among the most privileged in the land by comparison to those renting from private landlords.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000221"></a>My time in local government and responsibilities both in the other place and here stretch back to the period in the late 1970s and early 1980s when, whether the council wanted to or not, or whether there was a desperate need in that community to maintain a stock of community-owned houses that had been paid for by the taxpayer and the ratepayer, they did not have a choice; the legislation simply took that choice away. We will hear, perhaps in this debate but certainly in others, about desperate need in rural areas where affordable housing no longer exists. Of course it does not; the people who were about then&#151;perhaps they are in this Room at the moment&#151;were happy to see the affordable housing in their community disappear, because they believed, as I do, in home ownership.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000222"></a>The sad fact was that once a home left the purview of the local council, people in the community&#151;with a wave of people always coming forward desperately in need of better housing&#151;found that the home their parents had been glad to get 20 or 30 years before was no longer there. People would fall for the line that if they have lived in the house for a certain period, and if they had paid enough in rent for the house, they deserved to buy it. It was not a question of buying the house; it was a question of getting mobility. In my experience in Edmonton, many of the people who bought their homes sold them again, and they were then sold again. Over time, a home that was well built and well maintained, which had been bought for &#163;7,000  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC468"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC468</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or &#163;8,000 was sold, sold and sold again; and a three-bedroom, semi-detached house in Edmonton now fetches nearly &#163;200,000. You would not believe it; although you would, because that is the situation. Any attempts to militate against the public provision of housing for those in need&#151;council tenants or housing by any other means&#151;ought not to be looked at lightly.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000223"></a>The Minister may well say, &#147;We are trying to provide a range of provision&#148;. I applaud the genesis of the Bill, and I applaud what we are trying to do with the measures to provide access to ownership. Frankly, I cannot see the sense in the public, through the public purse both local and national, providing a home for someone who desperately needs it, only to have a mechanism one way or the other for that person to capitalise on it. Good luck to the council tenant who wishes to become an owner-occupier. But I say&#151;not of this house. If they want to own another house, they should by all means aspire to that, and there is a range of opportunities to do so.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000224"></a>I remember that the most poignant and heart-destroying periods of my life as a local councillor and as a Member of Parliament were listening to, believing and seeing the abject misery of inadequate housing: badly built housing, badly maintained housing, or no housing at all. I will listen to what the Minister has to say, but if it is put in the Bill that it is the responsibility of the authority to provide &#147;a proportion&#148;, that begs the question, &#147;What is the proportion?&#148;. If the proportion is movable or negotiable, I fear the worst. I have lived through the past 25 to 30 years hoping that more sanity would be brought into the provision of housing.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000225"></a>I have ranged over history&#151;although I have strayed during the past five minutes, I cannot help it; I have been so close to it. I am one of the unlucky ones in life; I have never been a council tenant. Others who have been and have then become owner-occupiers will be forever grateful to the mechanism and to the Government and Prime Minister who drove through the provision that meant that a working man or woman with nothing behind them found manna from heaven, access to money that they had never dreamt of, which they then used. But the community has been deprived and access is now difficult. So I take with a pinch of salt those who say that it is the right of a person in public housing to buy it. It is our right to prevent that happening as long as there are long queues of people who deserve the housing. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

When I was chairman of the Housing Corporation, towards the latter part of my period of office, the then Deputy Prime Minister asked me to chair a task force on better access to affordable home ownership. My noble friend Lord Graham of Edmonton referred to the loss of publicly owned housing to the private sector.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000227"></a>One of the first things that we did was to conduct a survey to ask people whether they wanted to own their own homes, because it was just assumed that that they did. About 70 per cent of people in Britain  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC469"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC469</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are either buying or own their own homes. Ninety per cent said that they did, but they did not interpret it in the way that we traditionally have: they wanted a stake in their own home. Shared ownership is one way to deliver that for them, so I support that idea.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000228"></a>I find it personally objectionable that people who can afford their own home, and I am one of them, can have a choice but people who cannot have no choice at all. I think that they should have. One choice that they should have is the opportunity to have a shared ownership home.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000229"></a>Where the report helps in the argument advanced by my noble friend Lord Graham is that we recommended very strongly that there should be different kinds of shared home ownership and different ways of raising the money, but that if the home was bought from a local authority or housing association, when the tenant wished to sell it, they had first to offer it back at market price to either the housing association or the local authority. That was a way to recycle a property to go back out to rent.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000230"></a>However, to put that in the Bill would, as with many other things, restrict the new agency to such a degree that we would almost not allow it to be innovative. We want it to be creative and innovative. The leader of the HCA will have to consider the Government's national strategy all the time. I cannot see any Government of whatever colour in future withdrawing from the idea of providing shared ownership. The former Mayor of London was talking about 50 per cent affordable or, I should say, social housing. That has meant that many developers have left London. They will not develop in London because the numbers do not stack up. I would not want that happen in this area, which is a creative, dynamic area and one that I very much welcome. I welcome the principle and the idea behind the amendment, but I think that it would be a retrograde step to insist that it goes in the Bill.</p>

Having debated many times opposite the noble Lord, Lord Graham, I know where his heart is and whence he comes. My point seeks to pick up on the whole question of having different approaches to provision. It is not a question of saying, &#147;That is how it was done in the past and therefore that is the way it must continue to be done&#148;. I hope that a range of schemes with restrictions placed upon them will come through. In many areas there are what I would describe as &#147;old people&#146;s bungalows&#148; with restrictions upon them. A person seeking to buy such a  property has to qualify within a particular range of restrictions. I know of other housing schemes that are linked to affordability in that when an owner wants to move on, they cannot sell above a certain price. The authority calculates the average increase for housing overall in the area over the period, and the owner cannot sell on above that price. Moreover, as the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, rightly suggested, those running such housing groups should have the first chance to buy the properties.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000232"></a>I accept the worry of the noble Lord, Lord Graham, all those years ago&#151;a worry I well understand because he has acknowledged that it brought joy to some but took housing away from others. Let us hope that we see a greater diversity of provision, again with restrictions attached so that people living in the area are not driven out of the market, whether for purchase or to rent. I seek clarification from the Minister who is going to respond because this is not a question of either/or, but of the range of options we can work with both in inner cities and rural areas. This is not something that is confined to one area or the other. I am grateful, but I will not give way early to the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, again, because she brings such authority to her words through her experience with the Housing Corporation.</p>

I say that for good reasons, and I shall go through them. However, the noble Lord was right when he reflected at the outset on the task of facing a new chief executive and the many ambitions that have to be satisfied. I have made a list of the topics that have been covered by our debates today on which noble Lords have expressed their aspirations. We have not yet gone through them all and we are unlikely to do so, but they range  from the promotion of rural housing, securing an  anti-poverty impact, ensuring that the concerns of  the disabled are properly taken into account, the encouragement of community building, through to the intelligent use of social stock for those coming out of care. Those are just a few on the list. Within that context, I well understand why the noble Lord has put forward an amendment to promote social homebuy. He and others have argued that more needs to be done to promote home ownership. My noble friend Lord Graham of Edmonton made a trenchant plea for a more reflective attitude towards the sale of council houses, and I certainly understand why he might make that argument. Perhaps in some respects we have now begun to inherit the problems that became evident at the more enthusiastic end of the home ownership push using the sale of council houses. As a consequence, the system is now much more refined, and rightly so.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000234"></a>However, we would argue that we need to take a balanced approach and to bring into home ownership people who have genuine and quite proper aspirations to that end, which I am sure we can all share. We need to consider how to address the problems inherent in the take-up of social home buying. It makes no sense to single out one form of tenure for particular priority. Indeed, my noble friend Lady Ford made the point that we need flexibility. She is absolutely right, and my noble friend Lady Dean, in the light of all her experience with the Housing Corporation, underlined that. But my noble friend also made the point that surveys have shown that people see home ownership as ensuring that they have a secure stake, not just in their own homes, but in their local communities. That is a valuable aspiration in terms of community building that we would be foolish to ignore.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC471"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC471</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000235"></a>The effect of the amendment would essentially be to elevate the status of social homebuy above other schemes for delivering home ownership. That would divert the focus of the Homes and Communities Agency away from its other objects&#151;in particular its object to improve the supply quality of housing, which has been mentioned in this afternoon&#146;s debate. We as a Government have set challenging targets for the agency and we will expect it to deliver those. My noble friend Lady Andrews has said that the expectation is that the Homes and Communities Agency will deliver 70,000 more affordable homes by 2010-11 and 3 million new homes by 2020; but it would be wrong of the Government to hamper the HCA&#146;s ability to deliver those targets by making it focus on one form of home ownership.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000236"></a>We need a wide range of options for home ownership. Owning one&#146;s home is an aspiration for many people. All too often, for many, that never becomes a reality, despite their best efforts to work hard and save money for a deposit. We have heard of the many key workers living in our capital&#151;nurses, teachers, emergency service personnel and postal workers, as the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, said&#151;who struggle to get their own homes and that can cause disconjunctions in the labour market. We have to respond to that by helping people get onto the housing ladder in different ways. We want to offer as many people as possible the opportunity to own their homes and to build a stake in the community. For that reason, we aim to provide 25,000 shared-ownership and shared-equity homes a year, funded mainly through the Housing Corporation and the successor body, from 2008-09. We need to be careful about being overly prescriptive as to where those homes are located. The amendment takes us dangerously near to having a fixed percentage in each area; that would be wrong and would constrain innovation.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000237"></a>We seek to build on innovative financing to help more people into partial ownership on a shared-equity basis. As noble Lords will have noticed, the Chancellor announced in the Budget that from April this year, two new equity loans will be available through the Government&#146;s shared-equity scheme. In December last year, we announced that social homebuy would continue as a voluntary scheme after the pilot period. That is aimed at increasing opportunities for social housing tenants to access home ownership. We are encouraging landlords to improve affordability and are allowing them flexibility to set low rents and share maintenance. In that context, the HCA must ensure that housing of all tenures and types is appropriate to meet the needs of the community it is provided for. The HCA will have the incentive and expertise to do that.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000238"></a>For those reasons, we cannot agree to the amendment, although its aspiration to deliver more shared-ownership and shared-equity homes through social homebuy and other equity-type products is common across the Benches in your Lordships&#146; House.</p>

There are the aspirations of occupiers, which I will talk about in a minute, but also the aspirations of owners. Then there are the aspirations of public sector owners, whether that is councils owning properties or arm&#146;s length or social ownership through registered social landlords, and so on.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC473"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC473</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000248"></a>It is right that the decent homes programme has set out to bring all socially owned property up to a proper standard. That is right. It would be wrong if the public sector in its widest sense, including all social landlords, were to tolerate conditions that were not up to modern standards and to allow houses to fall back from modern standards because things like central heating had not been replaced and renovated. Nevertheless, that skews priorities in terms of occupiers, because it puts the resources into housing that is occupied by people who already have a reasonable standard of housing&#151;not necessarily at the expense of people who often are living in the worst conditions, but it does not give them priority. That is in some of the private sector tenanted properties&#151;that is, private landlords&#146; properties.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000249"></a>In a sense, all the while in our discussions on the Bill, the elephant in the room&#151;to use a modern phrase that is fairly unpleasant but one that people seem to understand&#151;is the private tenanted sector. Some of that sector provides extremely high-quality housing such as luxury apartments, but in the areas in which English Partnerships has interested itself and in which the new agency will also interest itself&#151;what one might call regeneration areas&#151;the worst conditions are very often in the low-quality private rented sector. If we are talking about needs and aspirations, there is a huge great hole in the Bill. We will find ways of talking about the private rented sector later on, so I shall not talk about it in great detail now, but it must be put on the record.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000250"></a>There is no doubt that the Decent Homes programme is to be welcomed and is being welcomed hugely whenever the investment is made. Houses that were built as council houses were built to the high standards of the day, and had more space than any social housing that is built nowadays. My daughter lives in a ground-floor former council flat in Fulham. That is a disgrace really; she is a young, athletic lass and lives in a house that was designed for old people&#151;but there we are. She rents it from a private landlord. Everyone who visits her says, &#147;Look at this kitchen. It&#146;s a wonderful great eat-in kitchen. Look at the size of these bedrooms&#148;. She has learnt from me to say, &#147;Ah, Parker Morris standards&#148;. I am not sure whether she understands what they are, but it is true.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000251"></a>When people decry council housing&#151;quite wrongly in my view&#151;they should remember that those houses were built to the high standards of their time. They did not, however, have modern heating systems or modern insulation, and the doors, windows, roofs, chimney stacks and outside rendering needed to be replaced in time. A massive programme of investment was therefore needed to replace the heating systems, to re-render, to re-roof and to do whatever else was needed&#151;new doors, new windows. Am I talking about the Decent Homes programme? No, I am not; I am talking about the massive programme to refurbish council housing that took place in this country from the end of the 1960s and throughout the 1970s. It was a huge and hugely successful programme.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000252"></a>Thirty years later, the Decent Homes programme is bringing the houses that were brought up to scratch then up to scratch now. In some cases, the standards  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC474"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC474</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>are better; the insulation is better and the heating system is more efficient. In some cases, it is simply a replacement programme, because every so often you have to replace. One of the problems in the public sector is that the replacement programme tends to take place through great splurges of investment rather than more organically over the years. Nevertheless, Decent Homes is the second huge programme of investment in the council houses that were built in this country before the war and in the 1940s, 1950s and into the 1960s. We should recognise that. This programme is not new; it is simply the second phase.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000253"></a>In many ways, the tenants in those houses quite rightly aspire to live in modern conditions&#151;the same conditions in which their neighbours who bought their council houses live or in which the people across the street live who are in owner-occupied properties. It is also the aspiration of the public sector landlords and social landlords to be owners of top-quality properties, so tenants are not the only ones who have aspirations. What do tenants want? They often want better housing, better locations and better types of occupation. Lodgers might want to become tenants and private sector tenants might want to become housing association tenants. They might want to buy their properties or to move into other properties and become owner-occupiers. This is a natural process. When people talk about housing needs, it is not just a simple matter of looking at how many homeless people there are or how many young couples cannot find a decent property. It is a much more complex process of evolution throughout the housing market as broadly defined.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000254"></a>At the very heart of all this is the private sector. In areas where housing conditions are difficult, the private landlord sector is at the heart of the problem. Not long ago we discussed a previous housing Bill which introduced a series of measures ranging from empty dwelling management orders to selective licensing to enable local authorities to tackle some of the more problematic landlord-owned properties. Looking at it from the perspective of an area in Lancashire that has many such problems associated with private sector landlords, I can say that so far that legislation has done nothing at all for us. It has been a flop. This is not the Bill to put it right, but if the Government and the new Homes and Communities Agency are going to take a new look at these regeneration areas&#151;no doubt the HCA will because it is a new body taking over responsibilities from a number of others&#151;the private sector really has to be looked at again. The current legislation may be okay and it may just need more push and more impetus and less blockage from above when councils want to do something, or it may be defective and we may need more legislation&#151;God help us&#151;but this matter will not go away; it is the elephant in the room. I beg to move.</p>

He asked who determines needs and how we know that they are being met. This process is well worked out. Local housing authorities deliver on aspirations as well as

When they set out the needs for their communities, they are setting out their aspirations whether they are looking to provide more social rented housing, more shared equity or more new homes. The aspirations of many people can be met only if we look at the provision of housing as a whole. That is why it is so important that the HCA will support and help to secure the delivery of 3 million homes. That will meet people&#146;s aspirations as the whole housing chain is freed up in different ways so that we can get movement as people move out of rented accommodation and perhaps into shared or full ownership. We need to look at this picture as a whole. That is certainly true as regards looking at aspirations.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000256"></a>The noble Lord focused on decent homes. This matter has an interesting history. The Decent Homes programme is the most recent attempt to keep our housing stock in good condition. People&#146;s aspiration to live in warm insulated homes with a modern bathroom and kitchen is very modest indeed and we are absolutely right to prioritise and meet it. However, different needs have to be met as situations change. The noble Lord is also right to say that the private rented sector presents a particular challenge. This is not mentioned in the Bill but he will know that we established an inquiry under Julie Rugg to look into the range of issues thrown up by the private rented sector. They are very complex. It is a very complex market. It will be very interesting to see what emerges from that.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000257"></a>The Bill places a clear responsibility on the HCA to provide decent affordable homes and the regeneration of communities with a view to meeting the needs of all people. I stress that that means all people. It means their changing needs as well, because aspirations change. People may aspire to a family home rather than to a small flat. They may, as they grow older, aspire to downsize to a more manageable, safer home. We have to meet the aspirations of different generations, underpinned by the evidence that drives our intelligence up through local authorities and through the regions. That is the business of planning.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000258"></a>With the best will in the world, we cannot meet everyone&#146;s aspirations. Personally, I aspire to a small stately home with a stable block, but I do not expect that any one, let alone the Homes and Communities Agency, will enable me to achieve that. It is probably beyond my reach at this point. Now that I think about it, I would also like a Capability Brown landscaped garden to go with it. If we put the provision into the Bill, we are underwriting something rather cynical.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000259"></a>Our aim is that people should have their modest aspirations of a decent home met, whatever their stage and whatever that constitutes in terms of how they are fixed. Therefore, as much as I appreciate  the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Greaves&#151; I thought he made an excellent speech&#151;the amendment is not appropriate for the Bill, but I assure him that it would be very difficult for the HCA to meet needs without meeting aspirations at the  same time.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000264"></a>Perhaps it is because of just having gone through an election in which, sadly, a BNP member was elected, in my mind are some of the things said about immigration and the need to provide for the indigenous or existing population only and not to look ahead. I know that that is not a view shared by the Government or anyone in this Room, but I thought it was worth putting down the marker that we need to plan for an expanding indigenous population and for immigration, which I would simply say I regard, by and large, as a good thing. I hope that the Government can confirm that the definition is not to be read narrowly as applying to future needs only but also to future people. I beg to move.</p>

The real difficulty is: projected to be living when? We have all sorts of population projections. We may be able to project with a moderate degree of certainty the next five years and possibly the next decade or just over that&#151;we know that the Government have a projection of a certain number of houses by 2020. That far is reasonably predictable and reasonably capable of being planned for. Once you go beyond that, as we have been obliged to do in legislation over matters such as climate change, and try to make population projections, we are in an entirely different ball game.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000266"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, will forgive me, but this is perhaps what I would call an amendment too far.</p>

We must do that, as everyone in the Committee will understand. That commitment is necessarily reflected in the way in which we forecast and plan for population growth and change. Part of the problem is that our estimates lag behind real world time.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000268"></a>It is worth putting on the record that the population is growing and changing in different ways. The most recent ONS household projections for England, which came out last October and were revised at sub-national level in February, project that the number of households will grow by 223,000 on average per year to 2026. Within that, there are some

Two-thirds will be single-person households, which reflects what is happening to family formation and lifestyle choices. By 2026, older people will account for almost half the increase in the total number of households: that is, 2.4 million more older households. We have to reflect that in what we do.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000269"></a>All that and other elements are being fed into the National Housing and Planning Advice Unit, local authorities and regional spatial strategies, and we are looking at those strategies in the light of that information. There will be an opportunity to update that in due course to come to terms with those figures. Those are the figures that we will work with; and we will work with local authorities, because they know the pressures that they have in their neighbourhoods. We have to work in partnership with them, and we have to bring in the private sector and plan a co-ordinated and integrated strategy.</p>

First, when we met last week, the Minister said that there would be regional organisations for the new agency,  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC478"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC478</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>just as there are for English Partnerships and for the Housing Corporation. Can she explain in a little more detail how it will work and how it will be organised at the regional level? In particular, to what extent will policy-making be devolved, and how will the Government and the Housing and Communities Agency come to a strategic view on the allocation of resources to the different regions? Once those resources have been allocated, how will the policies of the regions be allowed to evolve diversely? If it is a two-way process of discussion and negotiation, to what extent will the devolution of policy and diversity be accepted?</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000278"></a>Within each region, will the new agency have a system of accountability to local people, or will it be accountable upwards to the national organisation  of the HCA and through to the Government? In particular, what will the agency&#146;s relationship be to the Government Offices for the Regions and the relevant regional development agencies? Will there be any form of accountability to whatever regional systems may follow the regional assemblies once they have been closed down?</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000279"></a>My final question concerns the balance of the new agency. It is an interesting organisation because on the one hand it will provide accommodation for people who need it, and inevitably the larger balance of the funding will be expected to go to those areas experiencing the most homelessness, which are the growth regions, particularly in the south-east and perhaps also in the West Midlands. On the other hand, the regeneration aspects of the agency will come from English Partnerships. Attention has been focused on areas that have not been growing and need to be regenerated, partly in order to stimulate economic and social growth. However, that brings us back to the old discussions about regional policy, a topic that Governments of whatever party do not much like to talk about nowadays. Nevertheless, it is clear that there has to be a balance in the relationship between meeting the needs of people in growth areas who need accommodation and responding to the needs of those in areas of manufacturing decline that need to be regenerated. Here I mention east Lancashire, which the noble Baroness visited and where the housing stock desperately needs to be improved as part of an overall economic, social and community regeneration package.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0007.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000280"></a>That is the clear regional dimension, and it would be interesting to know the Government&#146;s thinking on how the inevitable conflict of priorities is to be resolved.</p>

When we undertook the consultation to think about the creation of the new agency, in all the regions of England those two issues were the ones that occupied the most time and generated the most anxiety on the part of those who attended. I am sure that my noble friend will provide much more detail, but the way we were anticipating the agency taking shape six to nine months ago was that the national organisation would quite rightly have its direction set by Ministers and would have overarching targets to meet on all the issues we  have been talking about today. Underneath that,  each regional office of the Homes and Communities  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC479"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column GC479</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Agency would work with all the regional bodies to determine the priorities for investment in the locality over whatever period seemed reasonable, be it three years, five years or, in the case of infrastructure projects, perhaps 10 years. Regional development agency and local authority colleagues who came to those meetings understood that those regions which got their act together early and were able to articulate their priority areas for investment would do best in terms of their engagement with the new agency.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000282"></a>That point was made powerfully at the session in Leeds, when a number of local authority colleagues and RSL colleagues said, &#147;We don&#146;t want to be hidebound by national targets and policies that don&#146;t have relevance for our region&#148;. The desperate need in that region was for family homes and not one-bed or two-bed apartments. The plea from each of the regions was that, while Ministers would rightly want to set national targets, the agency should have sufficient flexibility to could come to a clearly agreed view with each region and then feed that through the organisation back up to Ministers. Ministers then have the unenviable task&#151;and we are delighted that they do it and we do not have to&#151;of acting as judge and jury on the allocation of resources. The process by which that happens was meant to be within a national framework with clearly articulated regional priorities that were then brought back for Ministers to finally decide the allocation. I hope that helps.</p>

When everyone understands the Government&#146;s aspiration and ambition, clearly there will be some areas of decision-making at a local level that will not be happy with the direction the Government are trying to drive them in, but that is par for the course. The ambition of the Government and their negotiators is to use their best endeavours to persuade people at every level that what the Government are seeking to do is not only good for the nation but good for their region or locality. Members around this Table who have served with me on comparable Committees know that there is antipathy in some areas and hostility in others towards direction from anyone. They believe that they are sovereign in their area, and the Government or someone else ought to be quick in paying the fee&#151;that is, the subvention&#151;and let them get on with it. It is not going to be like that. The time that the Minister and her colleagues will spend in persuasion and advocacy will be well spent.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000284"></a>I have heard in this debate that, while we are coming to this process now, discussions about how it can operate have been going on for two or three years, if not longer. We are at the beginning of what I hope will be a successful venture. However, the Government have to be prepared to accept the fact that some areas, councils or individuals will object strongly to the strategy the Government are promoting. They are entitled to do so, but ultimately the Government must be responsible to the nation and Parliament, and I wish them well.</p>

The HCA is limited by Clause 26, which says its borrowings must not exceed &#163;2.3 billion. Will that money be divided equally among the regions or will it go where the need is greatest?</p>

<p><a name="08051948000286"></a><a name="80519-gc0008.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80519-gc0008.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08051948000431"></a>Baroness Andrews:</b> This debate followed seamlessly from the previous one on community needs. I said at Second Reading that we had never seen our housing challenge as susceptible to a national solution. It is not about one-size-fits-all but about what regions and localities need. Therefore, as the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, pointed out, we have had different housing policies to meet different needs. We have had the Housing Market Renewal Pathfinders in the north and the west, and we have had our growth regions in the Greater South East, which are tasked with the greatly different challenge not of correcting a failing housing market but of creating and supplying another one. Another programme was the National Coalfields Programme, which focused on regenerating sites in former coalfield areas. We have never conceived of a uniform, monochrome national housing policy.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0008.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000287"></a>The noble Lord asked how this is actually delivered. The answer was brilliantly provided by the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, who went through the history and continuity of negotiations that are driven by needs, appreciation and perceptions, which are then reflected in the pattern that emerges in the requirements for investment, which, to answer the noble Baroness, Lady Byford, is tailored. The decisions are eventually taken by government on the basis of information that is well evidenced by local and regional need and that comes up through the regional tripartite arrangement. The Homes and Communities Agency will therefore tailor its approach according to the specific needs of different parts of England. It will, for example, reflect the fact that we have new growth points in the north for the first time. Previously, our growth points were very much based in the south, which was the cause of some grief.</p>

<a name="80519-gc0008.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08051948000288"></a>Clause 26 is about the maximum amount that the agency may borrow. It is not its total budget; it is a controlling mechanism. On the process, the Homes and Communities Agency will not decide alone where to invest but will work in partnership with the regional development agencies and the local authorities, which have already fed into the regional spatial strategies and the regional economic strategies. Coming down the track is the single regional economic strategy, which will bring all this together in due course and give us a coherent strategy that will replace the regional spatial strategies and the regional economic strategies and include information on appropriate levels of housing provision. Each regional investment plan is therefore drawn up in partnership with local authorities and is developed in a way that will require investment for different purposes. There may be a greater need for refurbishment than for new build. We expect further investment in affordable housing in some regions, and will see local patterns emerging in the process itself.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000289"></a>The noble Lord talked about balance in the HCA and how it apportions its resources, as well as about the emphasis that is reflected in how investment decisions are managed on the ground. If I have not answered his point, I am happy, if this helps the Committee, to put on paper how we think this process will actually work. It is not an easy process, and I am happy to follow through on where we are on the basis of how the HCA will operate and how we will go into the regional strategies.</p>

If it is anything to do with housing finance, it will not be very short. What will be the relationship between the funding through the HCA and the regional housing pot?</p>

The HCA funding brings together different funding streams. It is complementary in some respects. I will have to write to the noble Lord to explain that relationship. I do not want to busk it, because it is very complicated. There are different emphases in the regional housing pot.</p>

<p><a name="08051948000306"></a>Then I found that Clause 322 states that the extent of the Bill is England and Wales. Unless the Minister is absolutely on top of this, I am happy to accept a written answer to the question of what happens to the Welsh under Clause 2. Clause 322 covers the whole of the Bill; it has a couple of exceptions, but not these, as far as I can see.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_0"></a>
<a name="08051914000012"></a><a name="80519-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80519-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08051914000067"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Bob Ainsworth) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="08051914000013"></a>I wish to acknowledge the publication today of the report of the independent inquiry into the national recognition of the Armed Forces carried out by my honourable friend the Member for Grantham.   My honourable friend was invited by the Government last December to examine ways of improving the nation&#146;s understanding and appreciation of the Armed Forces. </p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="08051914000014"></a>The Government warmly welcome this report which is comprehensive in its coverage, and is based on extensive consultation including with Members of the Royal Family and both Houses of Parliament, devolved assemblies, civic leaders, serving and retired military personnel, Armed Forces support organisations and charities, religious leaders, business and the media. </p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="08051914000015"></a>The report makes many recommendations. Many of these will require detailed consideration or further work. But I am pleased to announce that the Government immediately accept a number of them and these will be implemented as soon as possible. They include greater encouragement on the wider use of uniforms in public, the creation a British Armed Forces and veterans&#146; day, more systematic arrangements for homecoming parades and ceremonies for the award of campaign medals and veterans&#146; badges, and an examination of the options to strengthen cadet forces and on other education-related measures.  The Government will engage with other organisations on those recommendations that are beyond the sole responsibility of Government, for example, on the proposals to improve relations with Parliament, local government, the business community and the media.  We will be responding fully to all the recommendations as soon as possible.  </p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="08051914000016"></a>I am very grateful to my honourable friend and his team&#151;Mr Bill Clark and Air Commodore Martin Sharpe from the Ministry of Defence&#151;for producing this report. It provides firm foundations to ensure that the work of our service personnel is better understood and recognised by the nation they serve</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="08051914000027"></a><a name="80519-wms0001.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80519-wms0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08051914000071"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> My right honourable friend the Minister for Culture, Creative Industries and Tourism (Margaret Hodge) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="08051914000028"></a>The Education, Youth and Culture Council will be held on 21 and 22 May in Brussels. Rhodri Glyn Thomas, Minister for Heritage for Wales, will be representing the UK on 21 May when culture and audio-visual issues will be taken. Education and youth issues will be taken on 22 May.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="08051914000029"></a>The first item on the agenda concerns the council conclusions on a European approach to media literacy in the digital environment. The new audio-visual media services directive calls for the development of media literacy in all sections of society and for close inspection of progress in media literacy. It sets out a reporting obligation for the Commission to measure levels of media literacy in all the member states. In January this year the Commission adopted a communication on  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS73"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column WS73</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the development and promotion of media literacy. The UK&#146;s main proposals on the text have been incorporated into the conclusions which reflect the UK view that it will be appropriate to assess recent developments in this area and monitor the extent of media literacy in member states&#151;as required under the new AVMS directive&#151;before coming forward with proposals for a recommendation. The council is expected to adopt the conclusions and the Government intend to endorse this course of action.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="08051914000030"></a>The presidency will then seek to reach a general approach on the proposal establishing a multi-annual community programme on protecting children using the internet and other communication technologies. This proposal is a renewal of the existing Safer Internet Plus Programme and will run from 2009-13. The programme promotes the safer use, particularly by children, of the internet and other online technologies, fighting illegal and harmful internet content ranging from child pornography to incitement to racial hatred.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08051914000031"></a>It carries out this aim by a combination of funding for various programmes and by fostering co-operation between a wide range of organisations from business to child welfare NGO s. The Government intend to support this proposal.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08051914000032"></a>There will then be an exchange of views on the communication on creative content online in the single market which was adopted by the Commission in January this year after consultation with stakeholders in government and industry. The communication establishes a content online platform that would bring together experts from across Europe in a forum for discussion. It also outlines the Commission&#146;s plan for a recommendation of the council and Parliament on this area, due in the autumn. The scope of this recommendation is currently not defined, but it is likely to cover digital rights management systems, multi-territory rights licensing and legal offers and piracy. The UK&#146;s response to the communication stated that we are not convinced that regulatory action at the European level at such an early stage in the development of this sector is the correct approach; work on digital rights management (DRM) is already being undertaken in several member states; the Commission&#146;s evaluation of this issue would benefit from greater use of a more rigorous evidence base; engaging with stakeholders is the right approach but the Commission needs to ensure that their views are incorporated into any future proposals. The presidency is now asking two questions of Ministers at the council: what are the challenges facing creative content online and where would an EU-level initiative add value? Our contribution to the exchange of views will be similar to our original response.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08051914000033"></a>The council will then be invited to adopt conclusions on intercultural competences.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08051914000034"></a>The conclusions recognise, in this, the European year of intercultural dialogue,<I></I>the importance of such dialogue as a key tool in addressing some of the challenges Europe currently faces.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="08051914000035"></a>Intercultural competences are defined as communication in foreign languages, social and civic skills and cultural awareness and expression. Member states and the Commission are invited to promote intercultural competences through existing initiatives  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS74"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column WS74</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the fields of culture, education and youth and audio-visual policy. The conclusions on intercultural competences have been discussed and finalised at official level and the council is now expected to adopt the conclusions at this meeting. The Government intend to support the adoption of these conclusions.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="08051914000036"></a>The presidency will seek the adoption of council conclusions on the Work Plan for Culture 2008-10. In February this year the presidency drafted a discussion paper for member states on the Work Plan for Culture 2008-10 based on the five priority areas for action set out in the resolution on a European agenda for culture adopted by the council in November 2007. Working groups set up under each priority and chaired by member states will be consulted on the preparation of the studies relevant to their field of competence. These conclusions, which have been negotiated and agreed at official level, outline the objectives for each priority area. The UK has interests in all these areas, in particular the groups on the creative economy and on improving the mobility of collections. The Government intend to support the adoption of these conclusions.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="08051914000037"></a>Under any other business, the presidency and Commission will provide information on the state of play of proposals on the review of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services. The Commission will present the communication on the protection of consumers, in particular minors, in respect of the use of video games. Belgium will raise concerns about satellite television channels from outside the EU which broadcast anti-Semitic material and incitement to hatred and terrorism and which can be received within the EU. The council may invite the Commission and the presidency to consider what measures can be taken to deal with such channels. Also under any other business will be an information item from the Swedish delegation raising concerns on the definition of the concept of books with regard to reduced VAT. The Government do not foresee any need to intervene on any of these items.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_21"></a><a name="08051914000039"></a>I have today laid before Parliament the 2007-08 departmental annual report for the Ministry of Justice (CM 7397).</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_22"></a><a name="08051914000040"></a>The Ministry of Justice was established on 9 May 2007.  It brought together the former responsibilities of the Department for Constitutional Affairs with the National Offender Management Service from the Home Office and the trilateral Office of Criminal Justice Reform.  The new department has a wide-ranging remit with major responsibilities for prisons and probation, the courts and tribunals, legal aid and more, as well as important policy responsibilities ranging from constitutional reform and devolution, democracy and human rights to the justice system. When the department  


<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS75"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column WS75</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>was set up, the then Permanent Secretary commissioned a review to develop proposals for a new structure and ways of working to equip the department better to deliver on its aims and objectives. </p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08051914000041"></a>Two other pieces of work have further improved the department's focus on its aims and objectives. Lord Carter&#146;s report on prisons and the partnership between the Lord Chief Justice and I in the operation of the courts.   The new top structure of the department came into place on 1 April with more detailed changes being implemented over the next few months to provide a coherent structure for managing the department's key challenges on public protection and reducing reoffending, constitutional reform and access to justice.  This streamlined top structure and new ways of working will help the department to implement Lord Carter&#146;s recommendations on offender management services, to ensure the successful operation of new arrangements for the courts and to focus more clearly on its key policy and delivery challenges. </p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_24"></a><a name="08051914000042"></a>The new structure will allow the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) to build on its success and take forward Lord Carter&#146;s proposals for nationalising management structures and reducing overhead costs.  It will also bring NOMS and the Prison Service together and streamline its headquarters so as to improve the focus on frontline delivery of prisons and the probation and improve efficiency.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_25"></a><a name="08051914000043"></a>This report highlights the achievements made by the Ministry of Justice and looks to the future at how the new structure aims to provide the department with a sharper focus on its key priorities.  This includes public protection and reoffending and improving relations with the judiciary while streamlining leadership across the whole of the department&#146;s agenda.  It will ensure a much more joined-up approach to issues of justice and constitutional reform, with a clearer focus on efficiency through the removal of duplication and overlapping responsibilities. </p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_26"></a><a name="08051914000044"></a>The report is also available on the Ministry of Justice website at <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/annual-report-2008.htm">www.justice.gov.uk/publications/annual-report-2008.htm</a>.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="08051914000051"></a>On behalf of the Government, I would like to thank all those who took the time to contribute to this extremely important debate on the future of tribunal&#146;s delivery. Their insight and knowledge has proved invaluable in writing this response. The Government would also like to thank their Ministers and officials in other government departments for engagement and support in the implementation of the Act. In addition the Government are grateful to the Tribunal&#146;s Service senior judiciary for their contribution and guidance throughout the consultation period.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="08051914000052"></a>Part 1 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 is a continuation of the reforms set into motion by Sir Andrew Leggatt in his paper <I>Tribunals for U</I><I>sers: One System, One Service</I><sup>1</sup>. The 2007 Act creates a two-tier tribunal structure, the first-tier tribunal and upper tribunal, which will bring together existing Ministry of Justice tribunals and tribunals in other government departments. The first-tier tribunal will be the natural starting place for most jurisdictions, with onward appeal to the upper tribunal, which will also have the power to deal with judicial review work delegated from the High Court.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="08051914000053"></a>The response paper confirms that there will be social entitlement; general regulatory; health, education and social care; taxation and land, property and housing chambers in the first-tier tribunal and administrative appeals; finance and tax and lands chambers in the upper tribunal. Each of the chambers will be lead by chamber presidents under the supervision of the Tribunal Service senior president, Lord Justice Carnwath. All

The Act allows for judges and members to sit in additional jurisdictions within their own or another chamber, if they satisfy the eligibility criteria for that chamber, and subject to training.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="08051914000054"></a>The Act also creates a Tribunals Procedure Committee that will be responsible for making tribunal procedure rules, and will bring greater consistency and simplicity to rules across jurisdictions. Appointments have been made to the committee and it will shortly begin consultation on procedure rules for the new tribunals.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="08051914000055"></a>The Government are committed to ongoing transformation of the tribunal environment, placing the user at the very heart of the service. In addition to the statutory changes introduced by the Act, the Tribunals Service is also undertaking a programme of work creating a network of multi-jurisdictional hearing centres, re-engineering administrative processes to improve case management, and exploring alternatives to standard hearings such as mediation, conciliation, and support and advice services. The implementation of the Act works alongside this transformation and is a vital part of it.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="08051914000057"></a>Last summer, we set out the Government&#146;s priorities for women. These included increasing the number of black and Asian and minority ethnic women on local councils.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="08051914000058"></a>A report produced by Simon Woolley, Head of Operation Black Vote, has today been published on the Government Equalities Office website, highlighting the scale of under-representation in our democracy.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_38"></a><a name="08051914000059"></a>Black, Asian and minority ethnic women account for less than 1 per cent of England&#146;s 20,000 councillors. To be more representative of society as a whole, the number of black, Asian and ethnic minority women councillors needs to be increased more than fivefold&#151;from 168 of all councillors in England to nearer 1,000.</p>




<notus-date day="19" month="5" year="2008" textMonth="May"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS78"></a><b>19 May 2008 : Column WS78</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80519-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_39"></a><a name="08051914000060"></a>At Westminster, the under-representation is even more marked. Only 19.5 per cent of Members of the House of Commons are women and of these only two come from minority ethnic communities. There has never been an Asian woman MP.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_40"></a><a name="08051914000061"></a>To make local councils more representative, we are today setting up a task force that will be chaired by Baroness Uddin of Bethnal Green. The task force will last for 12 months, with an option to review and extend this.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_41"></a><a name="08051914000062"></a>The task force members will include black and Asian and minority ethnic women councillors and former councillors from every region in England and from Scotland and Wales. The task force will identify and take practical action to increase awareness and build confidence and skills; reach out into communities to encourage women to step forward to become local councillors; identify and tackle barriers within political parties; and reduce disadvantage and stereotyping from within and outside the communities.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_42"></a><a name="08051914000063"></a>The task force will be supported in its work by the Ministers for Women and Equalities and secretariat will be provided by the Government Equalities Office. Full details of the task force, its membership and terms of reference are available on the Government Equalities Office website.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_43"></a><a name="08051914000064"></a>The Prime Minister has proposed to the Speaker that he call a Speaker's conference to consider, against the backdrop of a decline in turnout, a number of important issues including the representation of women and ethnic minorities in the House of Commons. The Speaker&#146;s conference and the task force we are announcing today will play a vital role in ensuring that we take steps to make progress.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_44"></a><a name="08051914000065"></a>The task force will be working closely with the Department of Communities and Local Government, which will soon be responding to the Councillors Commission report <I>Representing the Future</I> which made recommendations aimed at reducing barriers and increasing the incentives for people to stand and serve as councillors. The report looked at the wider issues of widening the pool of local councillors to increase representation from all under-represented groups&#151;women, people from black and minority ethnic communities, people of working age, young people and disabled people.</p>

<a name="80519-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_45"></a><a name="08051914000066"></a>The Government do not consider that the time is right to take legislative measures to permit all-BAME election shortlists.</p>

Although there are other pollinators, many flowers have evolved completely dependent on pollination by bees. There are also complex interactions between managed honey bees and wild pollinators; there have been concerns about removing managed bees from nature reserves because of their impact on wild pollinators. A European Union 6th Framework Project, &#147;Alarm&#148;, which includes several UK participants, has been running since 2004 and is due to complete in 2009. It focuses on ecosystem services and the relationship between society, economy and biodiversity; it will include an assessment of risks associated with loss of pollinators.</p>

Each trust makes an informed choice regarding the appropriate percentage of single room provision based on practical considerations such as site restrictions and affordability as well as clinical and operational limitations.</p>

the Healthcare Commission monitors two relevant national standards via the annual health check assessments. The standards are: healthcare organisations have systems in place to ensure that staff treat patients, their relatives and carers with dignity and respect; and healthcare services are provided in environments which promote effective care and optimise health outcomes by being supportive of patient privacy and confidentiality;

However, we are aware that a spokesman for the Government of Iraq has stated that, as at 3 February this year, none of the city's three sewage plants was operating at capacity. These problems were directly attributed to the neglect with which Saddam Hussein's regime treated the maintenance of Iraq's infrastructure.</p>

Work is also continuing on extending the capacity of these systems. The US Army Corps of Engineers reports that a $2.3 million upgrade to sewer lines and water pumping stations in one of Baghdad's suburbs, which will help prevent health hazards to more than 115,000 area residents, is due to be completed in June, and that it is undertaking many other projects to improve Baghdad's infrastructure.</p>
