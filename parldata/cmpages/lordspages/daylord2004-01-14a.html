<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Blaker </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What further steps they propose to take in connection with the situation in Zimbabwe.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean): </B>  My Lords, our aim remains a return to democratic governance, prosperity and the rule of law in Zimbabwe. We are working closely with the international community to sustain pressure on Mugabe's regime by maintaining dialogue with countries in southern Africa, the Commonwealth in general, our EU partners and the United States. The immediate priority is to ensure that 5.5 million economically vulnerable Zimbabweans do not starve between now and the next harvest in April. The Department for International Development will provide almost £20 million for emergency feeding programmes this year.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Blaker: </B>   My Lords, while I agree with the objectives stated by the noble Baroness, would it not be helpful if more pressure were applied to the Mugabe regime? At the European Council on 26 January, will the Government propose that sanctions should be extended to the spouses and families of Mr Mugabe's cronies and to the business people who bankroll him? As a separate matter, will they also propose that Mr Mugabe be stripped of his knighthood, as was the case with President Ceaucescu?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord says that we should exert more pressure. I can tell him that we will be exerting a great deal of pressure at the EU Foreign Ministers' meeting later this month. We will do our best to persuade them to apply the maximum sanctions that we can negotiate within the EU. The noble Lord will remember that that matter did not exactly have a smooth passage last year, but we shall certainly return to the fray this year.
<P>

<a name="40114-01_para0"></a>As for Mr Mugabe's knighthood, I have a great deal of sympathy with the noble Lord's point. However, we have done our best to avoid making the argument a personal one between Mr Mugabe and the United Kingdom. Mr Mugabe never misses an opportunity to point to the actions of the United Kingdom as being those of a colonial power directed against him. We <P>


<a name="column_554"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 554</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>want to avoid that, although I am bound to tell the noble Lord that, I too, find it difficult to take that Mr Mugabe continues to hold a knighthood.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord St John of Bletso: </B>   My Lords, can the Minister give an update on the pledges given by President Thabo Mbeki to our Prime Minister last year that there would be a government of national unity in place by June this year? Furthermore, given the appalling state of businesses and banks in Zimbabwe, surely now is the time for international businesses with interests in that country to take a more assertive political stance against President Mugabe.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, on the position announced by Mr Mbeki last year, he was in Harare shortly before Christmas discussing the position with both Mr Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai and said that he hoped that the discussions between the two parties in Zimbabwe would continue. To that, I would say, "We shall see". So far, the augurs have not been good.
<P>

<a name="40114-01_para1"></a>As for further pressure from international bodies, again, I agree that if we are able to exert more pressure, it is best done through such international organisations and banks. It is our business to do everything that we can to persuade the movers in the international community, whether political or commercial, closely to consider what is happening in Zimbabwe and to take some good decisions about investment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Massey of Darwen: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend comment on the HIV/AIDS situation in Zimbabwe? There have been terrible problems with the regime's attitude towards the disease. Has that attitude changed and what are the British Government doing to enable people to get help with HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the HIV/AIDS situation is indeed grave. Almost one-quarter of all Zimbabweans aged between 15 and 49 are infected with HIV/AIDS. That is a truly devastating figure. We cannot give any accurate information about the availability of drugs to deal with the problem. The fact that 3,200 people are dying every single week from HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe is a truly appalling statistic.
<P>

<a name="40114-01_para2"></a>We know that some forms of aid have been used by the Mugabe regime to exert pressure for political purposes. We will continue to monitor the situation as best we can in the current circumstances, but if there is any evidence of the anti-viral drugs used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS being withheld from certain  parts of the Zimbabwean community, the Government&#151;in particular, my colleagues in the DfID&#151;would be grateful to hear it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, is the noble Baroness aware that despite the egregious violations of human rights in Zimbabwe over many years, the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights has <P>


<a name="column_555"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 555</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been unable to send a single special representative to monitor the situation there? Does she not think that measures should be taken to collect all the information available&#151;perhaps by the Commonwealth Human Rights Unit&#151;and lay the facts before the commission when it meets in Geneva in April?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, I agree that we should do everything that we can to get together information on the true position in Zimbabwe and to bring it to the attention of countries around the world. The noble Lord will know that it is not straightforward to get information on Zimbabwe. Not to put too fine a point upon it, it has not been terribly easy to persuade some of our partners in the United Nations that the appropriate measures should be taken against Zimbabwe in the form of condemnatory resolutions. As I said in my previous answers, I agree that we should consider very closely anything that can be done to internationalise the position so that we are not put in the position that Mr Mugabe desperately wants us to be in&#151;that of being the lead nation, making this a black-versus-white argument, which it emphatically is not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Howell of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, mentioned the financial crisis that has overtaken Zimbabwe. Now that inflation is between 600 and 1,000 per cent, interest rates are 450 per cent, a number of banks cannot even honour cheques issued, and the World Food Programme has announced that it will have to halve its supply of food aid because Zimbabwe gave it misleading information at the start, what are the next steps that we will take, not merely against Zimbabwe, but to rescue the people of Zimbabwe? As Colin Powell said last summer, we could do with vigorous international action. Could that include a constructive UN resolution now, proposed by the countries that really want to see Zimbabweans saved from the murderous regime under which they live?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is quite right; the economic situation in Zimbabwe is absolutely desperate. I asked for the inflation figure; I understand that the most recent figure is some 620 per cent. Unemployment stands at between 70 and 80 per cent&#151;in the country that was the breadbasket of southern Africa. Mr Mugabe has inflicted on his country a truly appalling position.
<P>

<a name="40114-01_para3"></a>As regards what can be done, I said in my Answer that the United Kingdom is providing more money for emergency feeding programmes this year. In the past three years we have provided more than £60 million. The noble Lord asks what can be done next. We look to the international community in the way that I indicated; we look to pressure to be brought through Commonwealth countries that possibly have more influence than we do on the Zimbabweans. I look, for example, to the remarks of Archbishop Tutu of South Africa and to the United States. We look to exert pressure however we can through the EU, for which <P>


<a name="column_556"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 556</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>there will be another opportunity at the end of this month. We also look to individuals in taking their decisions about how they deal with the regime; but we say to them: please make sure that the action taken hurts the regime and not the individual Zimbabwean.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spopq1"></A><B> Lord Waddington </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they will review their policy on cannabis in the light of new evidence suggesting that the use of cannabis increases the likelihood of the onset of psychosis.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My Lords, the Government's decision to seek to reclassify cannabis as a class C drug was taken following advice received from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD). The evidence to which the noble Lord refers was collated by Professor Robin Murray of the Institute of Psychiatry, who does not oppose reclassification. Much of it was considered by the ACMD when it drew up its report. That evidence does not constitute grounds for review of our policy on cannabis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Waddington: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for her reply, but does she not agree that a good Secretary of State should be prepared to review a policy, not persist with it pig-headedly, when it becomes apparent that the advice on which he has relied is fundamentally flawed? Is it not madness to press ahead with downgrading cannabis to a class C drug, putting it in the same category as tranquillisers and sending out a message that it is relatively harmless, when in recent years the evidence has steadily mounted that there is a link between cannabis use and mental illness? As the Minister has said, we now have Professor Murray saying that cannabis use is the leading problem faced by the country's mental health services; that inner-city psychiatric services are nearly at crisis point, with up to 80 per cent of all psychotic cases reporting a history of cannabis use; and that there is now proof that people who use cannabis in their teens are up to seven times more likely to develop psychosis, delusional episodes or manic depression. I beg the Government to think again.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I agree absolutely that a good Secretary of State would take the action that the noble Lord has highlighted when it becomes clear that advice is absolutely fundamentally flawed. However, that is not the case. The advice that was given by the advisory council took into account research similar to that to which the noble Lord referred.
<P>

<a name="40114-02_para0"></a>We have considered the issue. On the previous occasion, I said that the Government would continue to keep the issue under review, as would the advisory <P>


<a name="column_557"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 557</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>council. Professor Murray's report is consistent with the indications that had already been considered by the advisory council when it came to its view on classifications. As I said in my Answer, Professor Murray does not disagree with the reclassification of cannabis.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the House's Select Committee on Science and Technology examined in detail the evidence for cannabis causing harm and has continued to keep that matter under surveillance? The evidence that cannabis causes psychosis or mental illness is very far from clear. The Royal College of Psychiatrists has said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there is little evidence that cannabis use can precipitate schizophrenia or other mental illness in those not already predisposed to it".

<P>
<P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40114-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is absolutely correct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, has the Minister seen three headlines from last week's press? One said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>" 'Epidemic' of mental illness warning".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-02_para1"></a>
Another said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Why I'd rather be stoned than drunk".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-02_para2"></a>
A third said, "Cannabis laws in shambles". Does the Minister agree that some clear messages must be sent with reclassification? There must now be a real emphasis on prosecuting and bringing to justice the peddlers of hard drugs. Will the police be given the resources to do that?
<P>

<a name="40114-02_para3"></a>Is the Minister sure that the Government have the kind of rolling advice that is needed, as all of us move on to thin ice in drugs law? Is the advisory council the right body to carry on the work, or should a statutory standing commission be set up to take account of new developments and new advice?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord has asked several questions. In accordance with practice, I shall answer two. We agree about the need to have clear messages. We are spending over £1 million on a campaign to make sure that people understand the new law and that schoolchildren and others who may be directly affected get the information that they need to make a proper, informed decision. I also agree with the noble Lord that the concentration should be on those who purvey such pernicious drugs, to the detriment of us all.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister recall our debate on 12 November, in which several of us raised a concern that Professor Murray and others had sought a meeting with the Home Secretary and that that meeting had been declined? Will she confirm that, of the 34 members of the advisory council, not one comes from an organisation opposed to the changes that she outlined to the House that night? On that same council, there are 13 representatives of groups that are in favour of change.
<P>


<a name="column_558"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord will know that the advisory council is made up of 20 members, chosen because of their expertise and independence of view. I know that the noble Lord will appreciate the high quality of the membership. That membership is clearly set out.
<P>

<a name="40114-02_para4"></a>We do not accept that there has, in any way, been a lack of balance. Proper consideration has been given to Professor Murray's work. It has been taken into account, in order to make sure that what the Government do is properly balanced and right.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew7"></A><B> Viscount Bridgeman: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that the reclassification of cannabis will result in increased use of cannabis, as happened recently in Lambeth, where it has already been effectively declassified? That may lead to growing health problems in the future.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, we do not believe that it will lead to an increase in the use of cannabis. The European Monitoring Centre report does not show that cannabis use in the United Kingdom is increasing.
<P>

<a name="40114-02_para5"></a>Of course, we will we keep the issues under careful scrutiny. We need to monitor the issue to make sure that the assumptions that we make now are correct.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Carlisle of Bucklow: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that choosing to reclassify cannabis at this time will inevitably send out a message that its use is harmless? Does she accept, as a former practising barrister, that many of the people addicted to hard drugs who are involved in serious cases started by using cannabis before moving to harder drugs?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, we must base our judgments on the data that we have. As a good forensic lawyer, the noble Lord will know that that is the best way to approach things. The evidence does not, at the moment, demonstrate that to be so. The link between using cannabis and moving on to class A drugs has not been established with the clarity that the noble Lord suggests.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   My Lords, once cannabis is reclassified at the end of the month, will the Government consider again the possibility of permitting the private cultivation of cannabis for personal use? That would cut out the middleman and reduce the volume of illegal trade.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, no.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </B>   My Lords, whatever the rights and wrongs of the psychiatric evidence, are the Government satisfied that police officers who catch people&#151;particularly young people&#151;using cannabis have the equipment to ensure that they obtain the right health advice about the possible psychiatric and psychotropic effects of cannabis misuse?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Scotland of Asthal: </B>   My Lords, I am confident that the guidance given to police is robust. Noble Lords will also know that we are developing some very responsive procedures and protocols for dealing with young people who are or may become addicted. So far, I am glad to say, those policies appear to be bearing fruit, and we are doing better than, perhaps, many thought we would be. But there is a long way to go.

<A NAME="40114-02_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Berkeley </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Who is responsible for the provision and funding of transport policing and security.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the British Transport Police, funded by the rail industry, is responsible for policing the national railways and London Underground. With some exceptions, police authorities are funded centrally and by council tax precepts and are responsible for policing generally.
<P>

<a name="40114-02_para6"></a>The Department for Transport is responsible for aviation, maritime, Channel Tunnel and rail security. Industry must implement our requirements. It bears the operating costs, passing them on to its customers as it sees fit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for that interesting Answer. In response to a Question last week, he said that the new sky marshals would be funded by government. He has just said that the British Transport Police is funded by the industry. Does he not see it as inequitable that the rail industry must pay for its own policing&#151;I declare an interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group&#151;although rail freight does not get much policing, whereas, for all other forms of transport, it is effectively mostly paid for by central government? Would not the £132 million a year that the rail industry pays be useful in these times of financial difficulty for the railways?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-02_spnew17"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I shall correct my noble friend, preparatory to accepting a correction from him. First, other modes of transport pay their security costs. Ports and airports, if designated, must meet the costs of security; it is not just the rail industry.
<P>

<a name="40114-02_para7"></a>My mistake, which my noble friend highlighted, was that, in trying to stress the extent to which sky marshals would be trained police officers introduced by government at the insistence of the airlines, I emphasised that the training of such officers was a national impost. I omitted to say that the seats that they will occupy will be provided by the airlines, so, in that respect as well, the industry is paying some proportion of the costs.

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 560</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Eddington, revealed that on a recent British Airways flight one passenger remarked to his neighbour, "We have been planning this for six months, let's do it"? That exchange was overheard by a rather nervous, fellow passenger in the next seat, who alerted the crew. As a result, two Tornado fighter jets were scrambled to Heathrow Airport. It was a false alarm. The conversation was between a father and son discussing an imminent family reunion with a great aunt. If armed sky marshals had been aboard the flight, would a response using force have been justified? Would the newly agreed protocols, if they had been agreed, allow such a use of force?

<A NAME="40114-03_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful for the anecdote, but I hope that we always err on the side of excessive security rather than take risks with the lives of passengers. Of course, the noble Lord has highlighted how extremely difficult security is with regard to aircraft. Judgments have to be employed, and have to be employed at very short notice. I hope that what the noble Lord has just illustrated is the most extreme case in which a misjudgment was made.

<P>
<UL>Whether background marine pollution poses a threat to United Kingdom fish farming in general, and to Scottish salmon farming in particular.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  My Lords, we have no reason to believe that the background levels of pollution pose a threat to the future of salmon farming or fish farming generally. In response to media coverage on contaminant levels in farmed salmon, the Food Standards Agency has advised that these levels are acceptable and pose no threat to human health when fish are eaten as part of a balanced diet.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for his Answer. Does he agree that this is not a new problem? Three to four years ago, Miriam Jacobs of the toxicology unit at Surrey University pointed out to MAFF the levels of organo-chlorides, dioxins and a range of other chemicals that were to be found in farmed fish. In the intervening years, what work has been done by Defra to identify whether the levels have been caused by general pollution in the water around our seas caused by, for example, run-off from the land, whether the levels have been caused by pollutants in the feed that salmon are being fed&#151;in other words, in other wild fish that perhaps come from more polluted waters&#151;or whether they have been caused by the treatment of the cages in which the fish are kept?
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I do not think that there has been definitive research on the levels since the studies to which the noble Baroness referred. But measurement in the fish is continuously being carried out. Clearly, farmed fish, almost by definition, are likely to have a higher level of pollutants than those at sea, particularly in the further oceans. Effectively, that is what the US study covered by the media found. As I say, that is not surprising.
<P>

<a name="40114-03_para0"></a>The issue is whether that level is, in any sense, a threat to human health in normal circumstances, to which the FSA has given the very clear answer, "no". In terms of whether it comes in the ground water running off, in the water that is used, in the sediment or in the food, a good deal of it probably did come in run-off water. Some of the pesticides found a few years ago have subsequently been banned. Therefore, if anything, there should be a lower level arising from man-made problems on inland and coastal farms.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Hogg of Cumbernauld: </B>   My Lords, is my noble friend aware that this matter has caused grave concern in Scotland where many people are employed in fish farming? Has he noticed that the science on which the challenge was based this weekend has been answered by the Food Standards Agency? It is the Food Standards Agency to which we should address ourselves when faced with food scares. But the fact remains that Scotland produces quality food in every sector.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, at the risk of alienating English farmers, certainly I accept that Scottish food is of high quality and that it is safe. In relation to salmon farming, clearly the FSA's judgment is that the level comes nowhere near any threat to human health. But it is not just the FSA standard; it is also the EU standard, the WHO standard and, indeed, given that it was American research, it is also the FDA standard in the United States, which is well above any levels detected by this latest research. Indeed, the information is not new; it is the same information that has been available to those authorities over some time.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Renton of Mount Harry: </B>   My Lords, is not the matter a little more serious than the noble Lord on the Front Bench opposite is giving the appearance of accepting? Is he aware that attempts to farm cod are being started now on the Shetland Islands? If that works, it could be a very important development for Scottish fishing, but even more for producing cod at a time when the shortage of North Sea cod becomes more serious, with the likelihood that North Sea fishing for cod might have to be stopped altogether. Against that, the growth of farmed cod is very important. The fear that there is something wrong with farmed fish is very prevalent. Can the Minister therefore make absolutely certain that the stories about Scottish farmed cod are put to rest so that other parts of the Scottish fishing industry can prosper?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I certainly think that the way in which some of the media treated these reports <P>


<a name="column_562"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 562</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>was erroneous and of great detriment to the Scottish farmed fish industry. Fish farming of all sorts, including, potentially, for cod, is an important part of the future. That is why we, and the EU, have a positive approach to the development of aquaculture in Europe, in part to offset the problem of declining stocks in the ocean. However, it is not possible to say that there is an equivalent level of pollutants in farmed fish as against wild sea fish. As I say, that is not surprising. Nevertheless, it is at a level which nowhere near threatens human health.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Winston: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister agree that the paper published on 9 January in Science, on which this evidence is based, has some very curious findings? For example, the next highest area of contamination is the Faroe Islands, where the levels are very similar to those in farmed fish in Scotland but where the pollution position is obviously quite different. Further investigation is therefore needed before we jump to too many conclusions about the unsafeness of Scottish salmon.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, that is right. It indicates that there is some pollution at sea as well, particularly off the coasts of Europe. It is important that we continue to monitor the situation, but there is no reason why we, or the other authorities internationally, should draw attention to salmon as being a threat to human health. It is not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew9"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, is it not the case that the Scottish salmon industry has conducted a big clean-up of what it was doing? It used to use nasty organophosphates, which noble Lords know I do not like very much. I gather that at one stage it was using the avermectin group to kill sea lice on salmon. It was found that there were problems with flora and fauna on the sea bottom. Has the industry now stopped using those chemicals? Has there been any recovery of the sea bottom around fish farms?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, I confirm that a number of chemicals are no longer used, both in terms of general use that affected the organophosphates and in terms of damaging chemicals that were previously used in fish farming, such as malachite green and certain other chemicals that have been banned. I need to check whether we have a complete block on the chemicals to which she referred. Certainly, there has been a substantial clean-up. I shall write to the noble Countess on the particulars.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord agree that fish farming can develop and spread pollution, particularly if the fish are confined in too small a space? For example, parasites, such as sea lice, can appear and multiply.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, yes. That is why the development of aquaculture needs to observe very effective standards of control, of checking and of what we bring into the farmed area. But it is also true that <P>


<a name="column_563"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 563</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sea lice has been a particular problem and, on occasion, has spread into the wild fish population. That is something that the industry itself is addressing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew13"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the Scottish fish farming industry maintains that the fishmeal it uses comes from the same sources as that used in North America and Chile? Should the Government be looking at testing fishmeal to ensure that those chemicals are not accumulating through that source? Considering that the study conducted by the US universities found that six picogrammes of dioxin per gramme of salmon were found in the samples that they had, how much salmon would an average person have to eat in one sitting before the Food Standards Agency would consider that a dangerous level had been reached?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the answer to the second question must be, "A lot, and far more than the noble Duke's appetite!". On the first part of his question, I shall check on the tests on feed but it seems unlikely that feed is the source of this pollution. However, we have to look at all possibilities.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-03_spnew15"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, in answering the Question, the Minister said he did not think that this was a threat to the industry. Does he remember the egg situation where egg farmers nearly went bankrupt when that scare led to eggs not being sold? Has he not read in newspapers how salmon cannot even be given away at the moment in some supermarkets? Is he not afraid that this might be a similar situation?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-04_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   My Lords, the unhappy episode of eggs and salmonella, which had far more basis in fact than this scare, was given extra legs by the way in which the then government handled the situation. The FSA and this Government are making it clear that this is not a valid food scare and that we are keeping the situation under constant monitoring. Nothing that has been found in this study should raise the kind of anxieties that have been blazoned across some of the less responsible media in recent days. I recognise that if this scare did get out of hand there would be a serious problem. However, all the authorities acting together to indicate that this is not a serious health threat will help to damp down that scare.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-04_spmin1"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees   (Lord Brabazon of Tara): </B>  My Lords, I beg to move the Motion standing in my name on the Order Paper.
<P>

<a name="40114-04_para2"></a>It may be helpful if I start with a word on procedure. Once I have sat down, the noble Lord, Lord Moran, will move his amendment. The debate on the report and on both the amendments will then take place as usual. It may be for the convenience of your Lordships' House if the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, speaks early in the debate. At the end of the debate, the noble Lord, Lord Moran, will decide what to do with his amendment. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, will then have the opportunity to move her amendment if she so wishes and to do so without further debate. The report as a whole, whether amended or not, will then be decided upon.
<P>

<a name="40114-04_para3"></a>The report is short and, I hope, clear. It relates to two matters: the appointment of an ad hoc Select Committee and the question of additional resources for the Economic Affairs Committee to enable it to scrutinise the Finance Bill again this year.
<P>

<a name="40114-04_para4"></a>I turn first to the appointment of an ad hoc Select Committee. Three requests for the establishments of new committees were considered. In each case the proponents attended the meeting and addressed the Liaison Committee briefly on the merits of their proposals. It was the view of the committee, by an overwhelming majority, that a Select Committee be appointed to consider the Private Member's Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, reintroduced this Session as the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill. The committee did not recommend the appointment of committees on the implications of withdrawal from the European Union or on communications. The reasons for making this choice are set out in the report.
<P>

<a name="40114-04_para5"></a>In view of the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Moran, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, it might be helpful if I were to say a few words as to why I hope the advice of the Liaison Committee will be accepted. First, the House has delegated to the Liaison Committee the function of allocating resources for Select Committee work and for considering requests for ad hoc Select Committees. As some noble Lords will recall, the Liaison Committee was established on the recommendation of the Select Committee on the Committee Work of the House chaired by the noble Earl, Lord Jellicoe, in 1992. The intention was to bring rationality to a process which until then had been somewhat haphazard.
<P>

<a name="40114-04_para6"></a>The composition of the committee is broadly based and includes six Back-Bench Members as well as the party leaders and the Convenor. The House normally accept the committee's advice and I hope that it will do so on this occasion. I suggest that such advice should be set aside only where circumstances have changed or if there is some overriding political imperative, not simply because the advice has proved unwelcome to some.
<P>


<a name="column_565"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 565</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-04_para7"></a>Secondly, we have long operated on the presumption that the House should provide resources for one ad hoc Select Committee at any one time. This was certainly the presumption of the Jellicoe committee. If the House were to decide to the contrary to our advice that more than one ad hoc Select Committee be set up, the Liaison Committee would have to consider the resource implications. The resource implications of a committee on the costs and benefits of the United Kingdom's continued membership of the EU, for example, would be immense if the work were to be done properly. If two ad hoc Select Committees were to be agreed to, it is likely that one of those committees would be delayed until the necessary resources could be found.
<P>

<a name="40114-04_para8"></a>Thirdly, I should point out to your Lordships that the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Moran, was for a committee on the implications of withdrawal from the EU, rather than on the implications of membership as proposed in his amendment today. The two are by no means the same and in the circumstances perhaps the noble Lord may feel that he should not press it now, but return to the Liaison Committee in due course.
<P>

<a name="40114-04_para9"></a>Lastly, I invite your Lordships to consider the implications for Members of the House, and for their time, if more committees are appointed. I have a clear impression, as Chairman of the Committee of Selection, that the demands on Members' time are already very heavy. Currently, 126 Members sit on our sessional investigative Select Committees. A further nine sit on the Joint Committee on the gambling Bill. More pre-legislative committees are promised. I do not include here the membership of our three Select Committees on delegated legislation. Peer resource is an important factor which the Liaison Committee bears in mind during its deliberations.
<P>

<a name="40114-04_para10"></a>I turn now to our recommendation that a Clerk and other resources be provided to enable the Economic Affairs Committee to set up a sub-committee on the Finance Bill again this year. No such additional resources were provided when the sub-committee was first established in the previous Session. I am sure that the House would agree that when we agree to establish the new committees, we must also will the means.
<P>

<a name="40114-04_para11"></a>Moved, That the 3rd Report from the Select Committee, Session 2002&#150;03, be agreed to. (HL Paper 183, Session 2002&#150;03).&#151;(The Chairman of Committees.)

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para16"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>1. The committee has considered a proposal put forward by Lord Joffe that his Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill [HL] be committed to a Select Committee. A paper from Lord Joffe was considered by the committee and is printed at Appendix 1. The committee also heard Lord Joffe and Baroness Jay of Paddington in support of his proposal.

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 566</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>2. The purpose of Lord Joffe's Bill is to allow competent terminally ill patients to request assistance to die. It was the subject of a major debate in the House at Second Reading in June of this year. Almost 10 years have elapsed since the subject was considered by the Select Committee on Medical Ethics which reported in 1994. Since then other countries have introduced such legislation and public opinion in the United Kingdom has become more engaged in the issue. We consider that a Select Committee of this House would be well placed to consider major ethical issues of this kind and accordingly we recommend the appointment of an ad hoc Select Committee upon the Bill. The Bill will have to be reintroduced in the next Session, read a second time and committed to a Select Committee. Accordingly, we recommend that the committee begin its work after the Easter Recess.

<P>

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>3. The committee has considered a proposal put forward by Lord Moran that a Select Committee be established to consider the implications for the United Kingdom of withdrawal from the European Union. A paper from Lord Moran was considered by the committee and is printed at Appendix 2. The committee also heard Lord Moran, Lord Weatherill and Viscount Falkland in support of this proposal.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para20"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>4. The purpose of such a committee would be to assess the constitutional and legal position, financial, trade and investment implications, effects on foreign relations and defence, and on agriculture and fisheries. The likely positive and negative effects of partial or total withdrawal would then be assessed. We consider that such a committee would not be timely in view of the current Inter-Governmental Conference on the draft Constitution for Europe. The establishment of such a committee is likely to be regarded as a negative intervention in the process by this House and we doubt whether it would be possible to isolate the committee's deliberations from wider political considerations. The resources required to conduct such an exercise would be disproportionate. We do not therefore recommend the establishment of a Select Committee on the implications of withdrawal from the European Union.

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>5. The committee has further considered a proposal put forward by Baroness Howe of Idlicote for a Select Committee on Communications. A memorandum from Lady Howe was considered once again by the committee and is printed at Appendix 3. The committee also heard Lady Howe in support of her proposal.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para23"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>6. When the committee first considered this proposal in February 2002 it then reported:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para24"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The proposed Select Committee would examine a subject on which the House has a great deal of expertise, and which cuts across government departmental boundaries. We believe that it would be a good subject for a House of Lords committee.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para25"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Baroness Howe's proposal is for a sessional rather than an ad hoc committee, to be appointed after the passage of the proposed Communications Bill, probably in late 2003. We would prefer the appointment of an ad hoc committee in the first instance, with a view to making it permanent if it were a success. We will return to the matter with a firm recommendation nearer the time."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para26"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>We do not consider this to have been a firm commitment and we have reviewed the proposal afresh.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para27"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>7. The remit proposed for such a committee, it was put to us, might include all broadcasting media, all aspects of the internet and telecommunications, newspaper and periodical publishing, film and video, advertising, and the ownership licensing control and management thereof. In addition to the reasons for setting up such a committee set out in Appendix 3, the forthcoming renewal of the BBC Charter, the consequences of the Hutton inquiry, and questions of foreign ownership were also cited in support.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para28"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>8. We do not consider that communications has a particular claim to become the subject of a dedicated Lords Select Committee. Furthermore, many aspects of the subject matter have been debated at length recently in the context of the House's consideration of the Communications Bill and in the pre-legislative scrutiny that preceded it. The remit envisaged is also <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_567"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 567</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>very wide and is more suited to a sessional Select Committee. Upon further reflection we doubt whether the consideration in isolation of a single communications-related subject by an ad hoc Select Committee would be useful; and we are reluctant to recommend to the House that a sessional Select Committee be set up. Accordingly, we do not recommend the establishment of a Select Committee on communications, whether on an ad hoc or on a sessional basis.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para30"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>9. The committee has considered a request from Lord Peston for resources to enable the Sub-Committee of the Economic Affairs Committee on the Finance Bill to be set-up at the beginning of the new Session. A letter to the Chairman of Committees from Lord Peston is printed at Appendix 4.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para31"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>10. The Committee considers that Lord Peston's proposal represents a major departure from the original recommendation of the group on the working practices of the House chaired by the late Lord Williams of Mostyn and which was subsequently endorsed by the Procedure Committee and agreed to by the House itself. This recommendation was:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para32"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"When the Finance Bill is introduced into the Commons and published, the committee should begin its work. The committee should report when the Finance Bill finishes its Commons Committee stage, but before Commons remaining stages. The timetable of the committee's work would therefore have to be arranged to fit the legislative timetable in the Commons." (Report from the Leader's group, 2001&#150;02, HL Paper 111).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para33"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>11. While we appreciate the excellent work of the Sub-Committee on the Finance Bill earlier this session, we do not think that the arrangements agreed to by the House in 2002 should be departed from so soon, particularly in view of the sensitivities surrounding this initiative. The original proposal is due to be reviewed after two Sessions and we take the view that any case for a change in the current arrangement should be considered then. It follows that we do not agree to the first limb of Lord Peston's request.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para34"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>12. We recognise however that from March to late June or thereabout the Finance Bill Sub-Committee should be able to meet in parallel with the main Select Committee which will no doubt be engaged in an inquiry of its own. We therefore recommend that a Clerk and other resources be provided to allow this to happen.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para40"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>1. BACKGROUND TO THE REQUEST
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para41"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) The issue of assisted dying is of intense public interest upon which there are passionately opposing views within the House, amongst the public, health and legal professions and religious groupings.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para42"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) The purpose of these briefing notes is not to rehearse the arguments for and against the Bill but rather to outline why I suggest that the House can only make an informed decision on the Bill if it has the benefit of the findings of a Select Committee.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para43"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) The purpose of the Bill (as amended by the amendments of which I have given notice) is to prevent unbearable and unnecessary suffering by allowing competent terminally ill patients to request assistance to die. The Bill is accordingly very limited in its application. It does not apply to patients who are mentally incompetent nor to any patients who are terminally ill.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para44"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(d) Opponents of the Bill, many of whom are concerned that assisted dying is contrary to their religious beliefs, mainly base their opposition upon concern that if assisted dying is decriminalised, the vulnerable members of society will be put at risk and trust between doctors and patients will be destroyed.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para45"></a><P>


<a name="column_568"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 568</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(e) In drafting the Bill, it was recognised that there could be risks to vulnerable members of society and to prevent these risks, a range of safeguards was introduced. However, the Bill's opponents argue that these safeguards are inadequate.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para46"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(f) Inevitably the views of the Bill's opponents on vulnerability and trust break-down have to be based on conjecture rather that upon fact.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para47"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(g) As there is no available experience of assisted dying in the UK, it is natural to turn to the experience of other countries with similar health provision and similar standards of living which have actually implemented similar legislation. The Netherlands and Oregon qualify under all these headings with experience of patient assisted dying going back to the 1980s in the case of the Netherlands and 1997 in the case of Oregon.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para48"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>However, the supporters and opponents of the Bill have interpreted the experience of the Dutch and of Oregon very differently. The supporters are convinced that the Dutch and the Oregon experience provides positive support for the view that assisted dying does not place vulnerable people at risk and that there is no evidence of a break down in trust between doctors and patients. The Bill's opponents however argue that the Dutch and the Oregon experience illustrates the dangers to the vulnerable and to doctor/patient relationships.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para49"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>2. BASIS OF THE REQUEST
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para50"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The House would be immeasurably assisted in making an informed decision on the Bill if a Select Committee had taken evidence and considered the issues set out below:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para51"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) The current experience of assisted dying in the Netherlands and Oregon and in particular, whether the vulnerable members of society have been put at risk and whether doctor/patient relationships have been adversely affected.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para52"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) Whether palliative care can in all cases provide the care which will enable terminally ill patients to die with dignity and free of unnecessary suffering.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para53"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) Whether recent polls that show 80 per cent percent of the public supporting assisted dying accurately reflect public opinion.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>3. CHANGES SINCE THE 1994 SELECT COMMITTEE
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para59"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics which reported in 1994 recommended that the existing laws which make assisted dying illegal, should remain in force. That was ten years ago and much has changed since then including the following:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para60"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(a) At the time there was no legislation similar to the Bill in any other country. Since then such legislation has been introduced in the Netherlands, Oregon and Belgium.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para61"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(b) The views of the Select Committee were significantly influenced by what they were told about the Dutch system. In the light of developments in the Netherlands since then, I believe that a new Select Committee may form a different view particularly having regard to the facts that:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para62"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> the Royal Dutch Medical Association (of which the great majority of Dutch doctors are members), the Dutch Government and the overwhelming majority of the Dutch population strongly support the existing system
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para63"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2> the most recent Remmelink Report (an in depth series of reports commissioned by the Dutch Government) published earlier this year found no evidence of vulnerable people being put at risk nor any increases in voluntary euthanasia in the last five years.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(c) Three of the surviving members of the previous Select Committee, Baroness Jay, Baroness Warnock and Baroness Flather now support this Bill. This is particularly significant as it demonstrates that a new Select Committee might well come to a different conclusion from the previous one.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para65"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(d) The UK is now faced with the sorry spectacle of terminally ill patients dragging themselves in desperation to Zurich to be assisted to die.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para66"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(e) Surveys in the UK amongst doctors have shown that a considerable number of doctors have felt compelled on grounds of compassion to agree to requests by their patients to assist them to die even though this is against the law. This sits uncomfortably in a democratic society where the rule of law should prevail.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para67"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(f) Likewise wives who have openly broken the law on assisted suicide in order to assist their husbands to die in Switzerland, have understandably not been prosecuted and hopefully never will be.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para68"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>(g) The issue of assistance to die is now being looked at afresh by the Council of Europe which had previously expressed opposition to voluntary euthanasia and the French National Assembly has just agreed to set up a Parliamentary Commission to investigate issues relating to the end of life and formulate proposals for addressing these issues.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para69"></a><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Proposal for a Select Committee to consider what might be the consequences of a withdrawal from the European Union
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para76"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>The Head of Research Services in the House of Lords Library has confirmed that there appears to be no "authoritative and impartial report on what detachment from the European Union, in whole or in part, would mean for the United Kingdom". (Dr Victory's letter of 28 July 2003, attached.) It is the view of all those who have subscribed to this paper that a report on this is overdue and that a Select Committee of the House of Lords would be the most appropriate body to produce such a report.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para77"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Members of the Liaison Committee will be aware that there is no provision for withdrawal in the existing EC Treaties. The draft treaty establishing a European Constitution does, however, include, in Article 1-59, a procedure for withdrawal from the Union. The text of this article is attached. A House of Commons research paper points out that Baroness Scotland, when a Foreign Office Minister, was asked why there was no provision in the EC Treaties for the free and unilateral withdrawal of member states, as there is for the treaties governing NATO and the WTO, and that she replied: "We see no need for the treaties governing membership of the Union to include a specific provision on unilateral withdrawal. It remains open to Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act 1972, the logical consequences of which would be to withdraw from the EU The terms of such a withdrawal would be for the Government to negotiate with the other Member States." (HL Deb, 11 January 2000, WA 96&#150;7). This paper also records that Peter Hain told the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee in November 2002: "We saw it for the first time as we did other ideas in the skeleton draft constitution which he put forward and we are having a look at it. It may be a good idea that Member States which are so fed up with the European Union are able to remove themselves from it. We need to look at the detail, we need to know exactly what it means."

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Against this background our House on 27 June 2003 gave a Second Reading to the European Union (Implications of Withdrawal) Bill (HL), introduced by Lord Pearson of Rannoch, which would require the Government to set up an independent inquiry into the implications of withdrawal and to publish the result.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para79"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>During the debate Lord Moran, a Cross-Bencher, suggested that instead of seeking to get the Government to set up such an inquiry it might be better for this House to do so. He said:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para80"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It is of the greatest importance that we should have a thorough, impartial and well-informed study of what detachment from the Union, in whole or in part, would mean for this country. I do not suppose that this Government or any other that is in sight will do this, although of course they should. I believe that in those circumstances the best way forward might be for us to set up a Select Committee of this House to consider thoroughly and to report on the implications of acting in accordance with Part I, Article 59 of the draft constitution. Such a committee must command confidence and be as balanced and impartial as possible.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para81"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"A good precedent was the Select Committee on the 1996 Inter-Governmental Conference . . .  three Eurosceptics were co-opted to this committee to balance the Europhiles&#151;that is, the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, and myself as a Cross-Bencher. It worked well and we all signed the report which was, I think, a useful one.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para82"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Such a committee established now could hear evidence from experts in all the relevant fields. A report on these lines, calm, dispassionate and authoritative&#151;would be an enormous help to all those considering our future relationship with Europe and would enable all of us to judge whether withdrawal would be a catastrophe or bring benefits to this country. I commend the idea to the House."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para83"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>This approach is welcomed by Lord Pearson (who has agreed that if such a Select Committee is set up it would not be necessary to proceed with the further stages of his Bill) and is supported by at least 51 Peers from different parts of the House whose names are attached. These include a former Prime Minister, a former Speaker of the House of Commons, several former senior Ministers and a number of Peers who are distinguished members of the business community.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para84"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>We think it essential that the Select Committee should command general confidence. It should not be overbalanced by known Europhiles or known Eurosceptics. It should be as dispassionate and authoritative as possible, and this would apply most of all to the Chairman. Its aim should be to shed light on the question, not to generate heat.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para85"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>In our view it should seek oral and written evidence from the most eminent available experts on all aspects of the question&#151;the constitutional and legal position, financial, trade and investment implications, effects on our foreign relations and defence arrangements and on agriculture and fisheries. It should then set out the likely consequences of partial or total withdrawal, detailing the likely positive and negative effects.

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>PROPOSAL FOR THE HOUSE OF LORDS TO SET UP A COMMUNICATIONS SELECT COMMITTEE
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para105"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>As you suggested when we spoke last week, I am enclosing details of a proposal, which I'd be most grateful if you could put before the members of the Liaison Committee, that the House of Lords should establish a Communications Select Committee. The idea has arisen in light of the Communication industry's ever widening remit, rapidly growing economic and cultural importance to the United Kingdom, and not least because of the considerable expertise and experience of the industry that exists in this House.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para106"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>As I explained, I wanted to test the amount of support that might exist amongst the 100 or so peers within that particular group before putting the suggestion formally to your Committee and, hopefully, for the idea to receive wider circulation and debate. So far I have had replies from over half of those to whom I wrote on 14th January, with the vast majority supporting both the proposal and its outlined remit. (I have, of course, been warned that resources for Select Committees are scarce, and that there may well be a queue of equally deserving suggestions ahead of this one!)
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para107"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Enclosed is both a copy of the letter I wrote to each Peer [not printed], and the paper setting out a reasoned case for the establishment of a Communications' Select Committee. Perhaps, however, I might mention that although the proposal is made <P>
</UL><FONT SIZE=3>

<a name="column_572"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 572</B></P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>now, I see the ideal time to set up such a Committee, if the idea should eventually be approved, might well be when the proposed Communications Bill (due to be debated in the Spring of this year) is finally on the statute book. Up to that point their Lordships' expertise will no doubt be fully occupied with that Bill's Pre-legislative Scrutiny Committee, and with the process of the legislation itself.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para108"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>I obviously hope the suggestion will gain your committee's approval, and if so, I should be most grateful for advice as to what further steps need to be taken.

<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>REASONS FOR ESTABLISHMENT
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para112"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>1. Due to almost continuous technological innovation and change in the last 20 years, the whole business of communications is of increasing importance in all our lives, whether as citizens or consumers. Quite apart from its economic importance, we rely on it for information, entertainment and education. It helps mould our culture, our attitude and reaction to events, and we have a vital interest in its accuracy and impartiality&#151;and thus in its ownership, management and control.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para113"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>2. Moreover, the industry's contribution to the UK economy is considerable and growing at a faster rate than any other part of the economy. The Government White Paper on "A New Future for Communications" reported that UK creative industries generate revenue approaching £60 billion a year, contributing 4 per cent to GDP, whilst the telecommunications industry generates revenues of £3 I billion and contributes 2 per cent to GDP.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para114"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>3. As another example of the industry's importance, the power of the media to destroy reputation&#151;where inaccurate or biased information is used&#151;is arguably far greater than that of the courts to protect them. Human rights issues for individuals or organisations have, quite rightly, a higher profile since the European Convention of Human Rights became part of UK domestic law. A reformed House of Lords, with an even greater complement of independent peers, could play an increasingly important part in assessing and advising upon the impact of such changes. Moreover, even during the last five years, communication matters have been debated in the House on no less than 21 occasions&#151;not including the time devoted to the current OFCOM paving Bill.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para115"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>4. These issues become all the more challenging with the spread of international and multimedia ownership. So too because of the overlap between UK controls&#151;statutory, self-regulatory and common law&#151;and those of the European Union; and in other countries from which communications to UK citizens and consumers may increasingly originate.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para116"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>5. The House of Lords already contains Peers with considerable experience of, and expertise in, the communications industry. (96 have had either career involvement in the sector or have listed communications as a 'special interest'.) A tacit acknowledgement of this expertise is the fact that at least the last two broadcasting Acts have been introduced in the Lords.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para117"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>6. The creation of a Communications Select Committee, able to require attendance of appropriate witnesses, could have particular value in informing policy development in this area. As an example of this, with the OFCOM Act (and its sister Act, expected later this year), a Lords Select Committee could be especially useful&#151;not least in the assessment, pre and post the BBC's Charter review&#151;of whether the BBC's particular relationship with OFCOM is working in the public interest.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-04_para118"></a><P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>7. The Government's emphasis (in The House of Lords, Completing the Reform) is on using the reinforced independence, expertise and experience of a reformed second Chamber more effectively, but without duplicating or undermining the House of Commons' primacy. Whilst rejecting the setting up of a ". . . nexus of departmental select committees like those in the Commons . . .", the Government sees ". . . the second chamber (as) better placed to examine cross-cutting issues." (P. 11 para 13 in Supporting Documents.) A Lords Select Committee of the kind here <P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>I am writing to you about the resource requirements of the Economic Affairs Committee's subcommittee to which their Lordships gave the task of scrutinising the Finance Bill. When its first report was debated, I indicated to the House that on the basis of this year's experience in future we would do the job in a more systematic and less pressurised way. The subcommittee would be set up immediately after the gracious speech, meeting in parallel to the main committee as it did last time. It would take a first tranche of evidence from witnesses in the period from then up to the budget itself. The witnesses themselves told us that would add to the usefulness of their contributions. This met with general approval from those present at the debate and from others of their Lordships who take an interest in financial and economic matters.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Moran </B>   rose to move, as an amendment to the above Motion, at end to insert "but with the omission of paragraph 4 and that an ad hoc Select Committee should be appointed without delay to make a brief assessment of the constitutional, financial and social implications of the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union and its effect on foreign and domestic policies, including the costs and benefits of continued membership".
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the Liaison Committee is a distinguished body at the heart of the establishment. The three main political parties are represented on it by their leaders. However, its latest report is, I am afraid, far from being distinguished. Indeed, the committee&#151;or at any rate those members of it who approved its recommendation&#151;should be rather ashamed of what they have put forward.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para1"></a>When I learned from the head of our research services that there was no authoritative and impartial report on what detachment from the European Union&#151;in whole or in part&#151;would mean for the United Kingdom, I and some colleagues decided that this gap must be filled. After consulting interested noble Lords, we asked in the names of 51 of them for a Select Committee to do this. When the Liaison Committee's report reached me, I was disconcerted to read that the proposal had been,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"put forward by Lord Moran",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-05_para2"></a>
and that the Paper outlining the proposal was also "from Lord Moran", with the other Peers subscribing to the proposal simply tucked away obscurely in a list at the end of Appendix 2. This included a mysterious mention of "fen" which must be intended for the distinguished noble Lord, Lord Biffen.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para3"></a>All 50 noble Lords informed me&#151;nearly all in writing&#151;that they supported the proposal. It went forward to the committee, not in the name of a lone Cross-Bencher, but in the names of 51 noble Lords including a former Prime Minister, a former Speaker of the House of Commons, former senior Ministers and leading men of business. Throughout it refers to "we" and "ours". I am not accustomed to using the royal "we" in any memorandum I write. The way in which it was presented glossed over the fact that it came from 51 noble Lords. It gave a distinctly misleading impression to any casual reader.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para4"></a>It is, I understand, rare for a request for a Select Committee to have this degree of support. I asked if there were precedents but have heard of none. I believe therefore that such a strongly supported request, on a matter of great public importance, can be regarded as unprecedented. It seems extraordinary that it should have been brushed aside as it was by the Liaison Committee.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para5"></a>I turn now to the reasons given by the Liaison Committee for its rejection of the proposals. Its first and principal point was that a Select Committee would not be timely in view of the current Inter-Governmental Conference on the draft constitution for Europe. I suggest that that argument was irrelevant because whatever the IGC decided, it would still have been important to consider what detachment from the <P>


<a name="column_575"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 575</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Union would mean for us. But the negotiations on the constitution collapsed, so that argument collapses as well. I believe, therefore, that we could have reapplied to the committee, but since it had already decided to recommend an ad hoc Select Committee on my noble friend Lord Joffe's Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill, an important proposal but one that affects far fewer people, the prospect of an early Select Committee on our proposal being arranged by the Liaison Committee seemed to me remote.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para6"></a>The next argument was that the establishment of our committee,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is likely to be regarded as a negative intervention in the process by this House".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-05_para7"></a>
I do not think that the Liaison Committee can have much experience of negotiation with foreign governments. I spent most of my working life in the Foreign Service. Anyone in that service knows that it is a great help in negotiations to have one's own legislature seen to be interesting itself in an issue. Officials in the State Department are past masters at this. They tell their opposite numbers that they sympathise with their point of view, but that their hands are tied by the line being taken by Senator So-and-so. A study on the lines we propose would help, not hinder, our negotiators in Europe.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para8"></a>Then the Liaison Committee said that it doubted,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"whether it would be possible to isolate the Committee's deliberations from wider political considerations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-05_para9"></a>
I cannot think what that means. I was hoping that the Chairman of Committees might be able to enlighten us. Perhaps it means that Tony Blair would not welcome such a committee.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para10"></a>Lastly, the Liaison Committee said that the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"resources required to conduct such an exercise would be disproportionate".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-05_para11"></a>
That might be true if the Select Committee were to undertake an enormous, comprehensive study of the pros and cons of detachment from the Union. Such a study, which the Government ought to have carried out long ago, would no doubt require the efforts of the whole of Whitehall and its report might be comparable in size with the Phillips report on BSE. It could be undertaken only by the Government. But the Select Committee need not undertake a comprehensive study of this kind. It would be more sensible to plan a short, sharp inquiry, bringing together in a readable form the details already in the public domain and getting expert witnesses to help to assess the various costs and benefits. In sum, I find none of the Liaison Committee's arguments convincing.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para12"></a>Why do 51 Peers think it important and urgent that this study should be undertaken? The reason is that they and I believe that people in our democracy should be given clear, unbiased information about issues that will affect all of them and their children after them. No irrevocable decisions ought to be taken without public assent. I told the Liaison Committee that I believed that it would be irresponsible for the House to decline to undertake such a study. That is still my view.
<P>


<a name="column_576"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 576</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para13"></a>The Government require regulatory impact assessments for very obscure regulations and for all EU directives. Why should they oppose a much more necessary assessment of the costs and benefits of our membership of the EU? Before long we may face serious decisions. The draft constitution may have hit a roadblock in December, but it will soon be resurrected, as Bertie Ahern told us today. Two Members of the other place, David Heathcoat-Amory and Gisela Stuart, have published accounts which explain all too clearly what Giscard's convention is about&#151;a part of the inexorable pressure being put forward towards a federal or unitary European state. We have to face a choice between commitment to that or stepping back at least to a degree of disengagement, perhaps a looser attachment.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para14"></a>Other countries such as Sweden, for example, make sure that their peoples give consent to major policies. I believe that we have a duty to help all sections of the public to understand the choices facing this country by giving them the unvarnished facts and setting out the issues impartially. That is what my amendment seeks to achieve.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para15"></a>It does not ask for a committee to recommend what we should do, but for one which would set out clearly the facts on which any future decisions should be based. I have not asked that the plan for a committee to consider Lord Joffe's proposal should be dropped. If resources permit, by all means let us have two committees. But I do think it essential that consideration of our proposal should begin, as requested in my amendment, "without delay". It should be given priority.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para16"></a>I cannot understand why the Government and many Europhiles appear to take the line that there should be no discussion of our relationship with the EU. If we in this House cannot consider that kind of issue then we might as well pack up and be replaced by a line of pot plants.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para17"></a>The Government apparently consider that it should be left to them to make the decisions behind closed doors. They remind me of the clerics who for so long resisted the printing of the Bible in English. They burned any copies they could find and, where possible, those who had made the translations.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para18"></a>The Government have no reason to fear the conclusions of this committee. They have said that withdrawal from the EU would be a disaster. With their great resources, they can put the case underlying that to the committee better than anyone else. No doubt the committee would take their views very seriously. I suggest that it is not sensible to refuse to allow reasonable discussion and analysis of these issues. If the Government persist in doing that, they may later face much more extreme opposition.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para19"></a>Our proposal has nothing to do with party politics. I ask my colleagues on the party Benches to look at this issue not as party men and women, but as parliamentarians. Let us all think of the people where we live. Is it right to withhold from them a dispassionate analysis of the costs and benefits of our EU membership and of the drive towards European <P>


<a name="column_577"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 577</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>integration? Should not they be told whether we can be wholly confident of the survival of an institution when its own auditors have refused to sign off its accounts for nine years in succession, something that would sink any business?
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para20"></a>If you think it is right to keep them in the dark, then of course vote against my amendment. But if you believe that they should be told clearly and honestly what is involved and that this should not be suppressed and concealed, then I hope that you will vote for it. Public confidence in Parliament is diminishing because people think that we do not pay enough attention to their concerns. Many of them have concerns about the EU. They are bombarded with regulations. As taxpayers they pay huge amounts to the EU. They see remote and inaccessible bureaucrats interfering in every aspect of their lives. Some, like the fishermen, have their livelihoods destroyed.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para21"></a>To carry out this study would help to show that we in Parliament, who have the necessary resources, admirable Clerks and Members of the House who really know about economics, business, agriculture, defence and much else, can help to meet some of those concerns. We can do this job better than anyone else.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para22"></a>During my 20 years in this House, the worst mistake I saw the House make was to reject Lord Blake's proposal for a public referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. I hope that this time we shall put the interests of the British people first and help to put the facts fairly and squarely to them with the minimum delay. This is what my amendment seeks to achieve. I respectfully commend it to the House and I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para23"></a>Moved that, as an amendment to the above Motion, at end to insert "but with the omission of paragraph 4 and that an ad hoc Select Committee should be appointed without delay to make a brief assessment of the constitutional, financial and social implications of the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union and its effect on foreign and domestic policies, including the costs and benefits of continued membership".&#151;(Lord Moran.)

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote: </B>   My Lords, I wish to speak to the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper. I do so because of my respectful belief that the Liaison Committee's decision not to set up a communications Select Committee is one that does need to be reconsidered. And I hold that belief, I should say, at least as passionately as my noble friend Lord Moran holds his. Indeed, I dare to believe that it is founded upon, if not a more practical, at least a stronger argument. Obviously I do not expect a miracle today, but I hope for an undertaking that I can return with this topic to the next meeting of the committee and that the members will be ready to reconsider it with an open mind.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para24"></a>I raise this matter again because of the many noble Lords on all sides of the House who felt, like me, that given the considerable communications expertise in this House, an independent Lords Select Committee would be of considerable value in the fast-moving <P>


<a name="column_578"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 578</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>times that lie ahead for the whole of the communications industry, not least during the next few years of the BBC's Royal Charter review and, of course, other issues such as the future of ITV and the general uncertainty in the print media.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para25"></a>Let me start by registering my real puzzlement, both about the latest decision and about the way it was arrived at by the Liaison Committee. When the Committee first met to consider my proposal, I could not attend in person, but I had written a letter setting out the case for a communications Select Committee in some detail. Those detailed reasons, contributed to by the many Members of this House with communications expertise, are again set out in the Third Report of the Liaison Committee, which is before your Lordships today.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para26"></a>We argued that communications were of such critical economic and cultural importance to us all that the real need was for an ongoing sessional Select Committee rather than the odd ad hoc one. As the Communications Bill was going through Parliament at that time, my proposal was, I thought sensibly, for the committee to be set up once the Bill was on the statute book.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para27"></a>As your Lordships can imagine, we were delighted when the Liaison Committee appeared to express its clear agreement in principle to our proposal. The first report of the 2002&#150;03 Session states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We believe it would be a good subject for a House of Lords Committee".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-05_para28"></a>
The report continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We would prefer the appointment of an adhoc committee in the first instance, with a view to making it permanent if it were a success. We will return to the matter with a firm recommendation nearer the time".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-05_para29"></a><P>

<a name="40114-05_para30"></a>So far, so good. We thought we could look forward to a firm recommendation for the establishment of a Select Committee of one kind or another. The only question that I had to address&#151;or so it appeared to most people&#151;when I was invited to the Liaison Committee's meeting on 10 November was whether there was to be a sessional or an ad hoc communications Select Committee, on the basis of the stated premise at the first meeting that
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it would be a good subject for a House of Lords Committee".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-05_para31"></a><P>

<a name="40114-05_para32"></a>As one of the newer Members of your Lordships' House, I was&#151;and probably remain&#151;a procedural babe in arms. So, alas, I had no idea that I might take others with me to make the case more forcefully, as did the proposers of the other Select Committees under consideration that day. That option was not suggested in the letter of invitation.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para33"></a>There is, incidentally, no guidance on the correct procedure to be followed for those suggesting Select Committees in the various House booklets. Perhaps that could be remedied in the next reprint. Obviously, had I had the support of such powerful players as, for example, the noble Lords, Lord Puttnam, Lord McNally and Lord Fowler, a much more convincing case would have been made. I can, therefore, only apologise to those who supported the idea so wholeheartedly for making, on my own, a clearly inadequate presentation.
<P>


<a name="column_579"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 579</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para34"></a>Of course, it is possible that we read too much into the words in the Liaison Committee's first report. But, along with many others, I do not think so. We still believe that we need to proceed on the basis of that initial opinion. So I very much hope that it may be possible for the proposal to be re-examined by the Liaison Committee, and that, on such an occasion, the real experts can be present to press the case for a more positive conclusion. I hope that the Chairman of Committees will feel able to give the House an assurance to that effect.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-05_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Joffe: </B>   My Lords, as the introducer of the Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill, I naturally welcome and support the Liaison Committee's report. I particularly support the recommendation in Clause 2 for the appointment of an ad hoc Select Committee on the Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill, which should begin its work after the Easter Recess.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para35"></a>I am grateful to the Liaison Committee for that recommendation, and also appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Moran, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, have not challenged that recommendation in their amendments. As the Liaison Committee has made it clear that there is only sufficient resource available to support one Select Committee, it follows that I must oppose both amendments.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para36"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moran, in his address, felt that his amendment and the Select Committee on the European Union should have priority over the Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill, but I heard no persuasive reasons to support that view.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para37"></a>The importance of moving ahead with the Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill is that there is already a Bill before the House. Public opinion surveys show consistently that at least 80 per cent of the population would support it. In addition, somewhere between 150 and 200 Peers have indicated their support. I could perhaps have rustled up 150 signatures to my Bill, but I thought that applications for a Select Committee were normally made by one individual Peer.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para38"></a>I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, that, for a beginner coming to this House, it is rather difficult to understand the precise rules, and it would be helpful if those could be set down in writing. The one thing on which proponents and opponents of the Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill agree is that it is essential that there should be informed deliberation on the Bill and the issues, and that a Select Committee is the ideal place for such deliberations, particularly as ethical issues are involved.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para39"></a>The urgency is that such a Bill could eventually&#151;I emphasise that word&#151;prevent great and unnecessary suffering. The sooner that day comes, the sooner the suffering will be prevented. Many patients who suffer unbearably desperately hope that a favourable Select Committee recommendation will open up the <P>


<a name="column_580"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 580</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>opportunity for the Government to adopt the Bill, even though the patients realise that it will almost certainly be too late for them.
<P>

<a name="40114-05_para40"></a>If there are to be two Select Committees, there is no case for priority to be given to the European Union Select Committee. The Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill should receive such priority.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-06_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Alloway: </B>   My Lords, I shall make a brief intervention in support of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Moran. It is surely in the national interest, and there is an urgent need for an objective assessment now&#151;a clear, unbiased source of information, as the noble Lord put it in his own words&#151;devoid of party political motivation and stamped with the hallmark of authority, which only a Select Committee of this House can confer.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para0"></a>I have had a word with my noble friend, and the Jellicoe convention was assuredly not devised to inhibit setting up ad hoc committees in exceptional circumstances such as these. Your Lordships may think that there is a matter of priority, but that is for the House, not for the Liaison Committee, if challenged, as it is.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para1"></a>I take the point made by the Chairman of Committees. I declare my interest as a signatory&#151;one of the 51 on Appendix 2 to the original application. I accept that the original application was far more extensive and far reaching than the assessment sought on the Motion today. But, why was it rejected? Three reasons were given in paragraph 4, suggesting that such a committee would be regarded as a negative institution, that it would not be possible to isolate party political considerations and that it was disproportionate in its regard and need for resources. No reasoning is given for any of those conclusions, which we simply have to accept on the nod. Why should we?
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para2"></a>Those considerations and objections do not apply to the form in which this assessment is sought today. I shall sit down in a moment, but if noble Lords look at the form and wording of the Motion, it is an assessment. In those circumstances, surely this must now be a matter for the House. It is no good, having taken time challenging the report, to send it back again to the same committee. The questions of priorities, exceptional circumstances and national need are questions for the House. I believe it is so, but what does that matter? This is a question for the House. I support the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Borrie: </B>   My Lords, I should like to speak briefly in support of the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote. I do so because I think the original claims she made on behalf of not only herself but a number of us in this regard, set out in the appropriate appendix, are still very valid today. As the noble Baroness explained, the Liaison Committee at first seemed to support the proposal for a communications Select Committee. So naturally, one looks at the Liaison Committee's reasons for going back upon that proposition.
<P>


<a name="column_581"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 581</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para3"></a>I am not at all impressed by the reasons given in paragraph 8 of the report. For example, the committee emphasises that many aspects of the subject of communications have recently been discussed at length in the debates on the Communications Bill in the last Session and the pre-legislative scrutiny that that Bill received. To my mind, that only shows the tremendous range of interests and ramifications of the subject of communications, which deserve the attention of a Select Committee.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para4"></a>Also in paragraph 8, the Liaison Committee says that the remit envisaged,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is also very wide and is more suited to a sessional Select Committee".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-06_para5"></a>
It then proceeds to damn the idea of a sessional committee without giving any reasons. In other words, the Liaison Committee declined to recommend either a committee ad hoc or on a sessional basis. With the best will in the world, I cannot follow the reasoning for that, and I therefore support the amendment in the name of the noble Baroness.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-06_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Scott of Needham Market: </B>   My Lords, as a member of the Liaison Committee, I would like to add a few words in support of the report produced by the Lord Chairman. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Moran, that I am certainly not ashamed of the report that has been produced, and I would like to explain why.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para6"></a>I have been here for some three and a half years which, admittedly, makes me a relatively new Member of your Lordships' House. However, like many people, I have always looked with enormous respect at the work of the Select Committees produced by the House. I feel a very keen sense of responsibility to uphold the very high standards for which this House has become justifiably known. In reaching my decision on that day, I bore in mind the criteria that any subjects chosen for Select Committee consideration should be finite in both scope and time and that they should be salient. These considerations are, I believe, essential, if we are to continue to produce high-quality reports and to use the limited resources of your Lordships' House to best effect.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para7"></a>Although I am a member of the Liaison Committee, I will not be swayed in my decisions either by the bringing along of heavyweight companions to add grist to the debate, nor by large numbers of people signing up. Making these decisions a sort of beauty contest would be a very dangerous path.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para8"></a>The proposals of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, for a communications Select Committee failed my first test. They were very broad in scope. Had they been more finite and focused, I would have been more happy to support them, but I felt that such a subject was, as the report said, more suited to a Standing Committee process. However, I think we can look again at how this might be achieved.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para9"></a>The proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Moran, comprehensively failed my second and third tests. Our membership of the European Union has implications for almost every area of our economic, political and social life. I think we all agree on that; Eurosceptics are <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>always saying how Brussels interferes with every facet of our life. It follows that any authoritative piece of work to assess the implications of withdrawal or the costs of benefit cannot be produced quickly, as the noble Lord said, but would need to address a wide range of subjects, from the economy to fisheries, from security to agriculture. It would need to draw on evidence from such a large number of sources that the resource implications would be mind-boggling. I say respectfully to the noble Lord that perhaps the reason no such piece of work has ever been undertaken or attempted is precisely because it would be so difficult to do. I also question the salience of such a committee, given that none of the political parties represented at Westminster has openly advocated withdrawal from the European Union.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para10"></a>I am very content to support the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Joffe. A Select Committee on the very difficult and emotive issue of assisted dying certainly meets all the criteria which I consider important, and I think will produce the sort of report for which your Lordships' House is notably well known.

<P>
<A NAME="40114-06_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Richardson of Calow: </B>   My Lords, the case for overturning the recommendations of the Liaison Committee seems to rest on two issues&#151;first, that there is an enormous amount of support for appointing a Select Committee to look at European conventions and, secondly, that delay in looking at those matters would be injurious to the country.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para11"></a>I respectfully remind your Lordships that when we debated the Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill in June, more than 50 of your Lordships took the trouble to attend and speak. There was a huge postbag for many of us&#151;I had 74 letters in advance of the debate and many more after it. There is enormous concern around the country that this should happen.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para12"></a>With regard to delay, again I respectfully remind your Lordships that a delay in considering assisted dying is literally a matter of life and death for not just a few people but for many. As the Select Committee would be charged to consider not only assisted dying but the nature of palliative care, it may be much nearer to the heart of many of us in this House than we can presently see.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-06_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Vinson: </B>   My Lords, as one of the signatories to the request to the Liaison Committee, I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Moran.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para13"></a>I realise that ever-closer union with Europe is, to some Members of this House, the fulfilment of their vision of a supranational European state, bringing eternal peace in our time. I used to think that way too, but the idealistic fervour that drove me to think so has been tempered by time and, not least, by reality. Now I think differently.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para14"></a>I have changed my mind, believing it better to be inconsistently right than consistently wrong. I think I am not alone, as every poll on this subject throughout the United Kingdom shows. The British public are <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>becoming doubtful about the whole exercise and sceptical about its benefits. Even the Government's representative on the Giscard committee, Gisela Stuart, also changed her mind after first-hand experience of the realities of the EU&#151;an honest and very brave thing to do.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para15"></a>Over the next six months, this country will continue to negotiate terms for a European constitution which, as all objective observers agree, will result in a massive transfer of sovereignty. Except for limited issues, we will barely be self-governing any more.
<P>

<a name="40114-06_para16"></a>The undeniable change makes it imperative to give the British public some positive facts against which they can weigh the benefits and disbenefits of deeper and wider European integration. As has been said, those who believe that deeper integration, in both economic and political terms, will be beneficial to United Kingdom citizens should welcome, to justify their claim, a cost-benefit analysis of our membership of the EU to date.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Vinson: </B>   My Lords, I am just rehearsing the background to why this subject is immensely important. I have virtually dealt with it and if the House will give me a couple of minutes more I should like to finish.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para0"></a>Currently we have a £3 billion monthly deficit in our trade with the EC. It would be sensible to see precisely what membership is costing this nation&#151;a point already well made. Hence the need for a fully authorised standing committee to report, and to report quickly, on this matter. We should all know if a different sort of Union is feasible, possibly under the variable geometry concept.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para1"></a>I can appreciate that the Liaison Committee felt there was wide support for a report on voluntary euthanasia; indeed, I subscribe to such a report myself. However, that matter has a much longer timetable than the few months before we sign up to the EU Convention and all the constitutional changes that go with it. For that reason the Jellicoe convention limiting the number of standing committees should be regarded as precisely what it is: an indicative convention which in times of need should be ignored and the appropriate resources found and found quickly. There is, over this matter, a political imperative.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para2"></a>It has been pointed out that precedentially it is highly unusual for 51 Peers, including a former Prime Minister and former Speaker of the House of Commons, to put their names to a resolution of this sort. That fact alone should have justified the Liaison Committee authorising a committee on the lines suggested on the Order Paper. That has been worded more impartially and will attract even wider support from Members of your Lordships' House.

<a name="40114-07_para3"></a>Our constitution has been developed over 1,000 years and given us political and economic stability second to none, but one which we all too easily take for granted. It is exceptional. It must not be bartered away unless and until the British public know what they are getting in exchange.

<A NAME="40114-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Lea of Crondall: </B>   My Lords, with great respect, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way, but are we debating a resolution of 51 Members of this House? I suspect we are not. We are debating a report of the Liaison Committee and the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Moran. We are not debating the substance of the matter at the moment, as other noble Lords have said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Vinson: </B>   My Lords, with respect, we are debating an amendment which I am trying to recommend.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-07_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Pearson of Rannoch: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I can point out to the noble Lord, Lord Lea, and to the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, that the Companion states that speeches in this kind of debate can run for 15 minutes, though I am not saying they have to. The noble Lord, Lord Moran, spoke for only 10 minutes. But the other side attempting to gag this side of the debate is unhelpful and time consuming.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Vinson: </B>   My Lords, I am speaking to the amendment and I have nearly finished.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para5"></a>To repeat, there is a fundamental democratic inadequacy manifest in EU affairs, better known as the democratic deficit. We must not repeat that error in our own democracy. The British people must be allowed to decide on the facts. If an EU constitution is imposed without a real effort to explain its desirability&#151;and then a referendum&#151;the whole EU experiment will be doomed because it will lack the endorsement of democratic legitimacy.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para6"></a>It would be odd if, on looking back at the history of this House in years to come, we saw that resources could be found to discuss the voluntary termination of human life but comparable resources could not be found to highlight the facts that could prevent the political euthanasia of our own self-governing country. I urge the Liaison Committee to think again and find the resources to do both. The British people deserve to know the facts.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-07_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Amos: </B>   My Lords, I had not intended to intervene in this afternoon's debate. Clearly this is a matter for the House. The Liaison Committee is a House committee. I am speaking now as the Leader of the House and as a member of the Liaison Committee.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para7"></a>We had a long and interesting debate on Monday about this House and the fact that we treasure self-regulation above all else. A responsibility rests on us all if we treasure that self-regulation. However, the <P>


<a name="column_585"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 585</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>discussion into which we are now drifting is moving away from the relevance of the Motion on the Order Paper; we are drifting into discussing issues with respect to the three proposals put before the Liaison Committee.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para8"></a>While I am on my feet&#151;as I said, I had not intended to intervene&#151;and speaking as a member of the Liaison Committee (I underline, not as a government Minister), as the Chairman of Committees said to the House, the House has delegated to the Liaison Committee the function of considering requests for ad hoc Select Committees. We had three proposals before us and we considered them extremely carefully. We came to a clear recommendation. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Brabazon, that the whole point of the Liaison Committee is called into question if the House is going to re-run that discussion and second guess the committee's judgment without good reason.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Peston: </B>   My Lords, I should like to say a word in support of my noble friend and add two matters to the debate. One is that I first started to do cost benefit work 40 years ago and have had a great deal of experience in that regard. I can say therefore that the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Moran, is absurd. The notion that a cost benefit study of the magnitude implied can be done briefly shows that there is no understanding of the subject whatsoever. I say that in terms because it is important that your Lordships understand what is being represented to us. It is possible that, with a lot of resources and perhaps three years, we might get somewhere. But the notion of "brief" is of no help to your Lordships or to the country at large.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para9"></a>Secondly, I have the privilege of being the chairman of one of your Lordships' major committees. I regard it as a miracle that every year we come up with an agreed report. Without boasting, that requires a great deal of talent. It is inconceivable that we could set up a committee to do this job that would get within a million miles of agreement. It would simply create trouble.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para10"></a>I hate to add a political point to the debate, but for some years I watched the Europhobes totally disrupt the last Tory government and come very close to destroying the Tory Party, which I did not like. The notion that we should give them any encouragement to disrupt your Lordships' House and damage it is appalling. The sooner we stop this, the better. I was rather disappointed that the Chairman of Committees almost implied that we might go back to the proposal. We must say no now, once and for all. We ought to support the Liaison Committee, as my noble friend the Leader of the House says, and get on with the business. There are more important matters confronting your Lordships at this time.

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 586</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para11"></a>It is worth reminding the House that the purpose of the Liaison Committee is to allocate resources between Select Committees; to consider requests for ad hoc committees; to ensure effective co-ordination between the two Houses and to consider the availability of noble Lords to serve on committees.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para12"></a>This afternoon&#151;it may become this evening before too long&#151;we have heard a re-run of much that was debated in the Liaison Committee. The House not only delegated but asked the Liaison Committee to do the sifting work and report to the House. The Liaison Committee acts as a servant of the House, though it is undoubtedly true that the final decision lies with the House.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para13"></a>The noble Baroness the Leader of the House said that we were faced with three decisions. We were also faced with a proposal put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Peston. It was rather good. It related to whether or not his economic sub-committee should have more and better resources. He put a powerful case.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para14"></a>I opposed the suggestion put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, not just because I found the issue deeply distasteful, but also because neither the Labour Government nor a future Conservative government would hold out any prospect whatsoever of ever bringing forward legislation to deal with that subject. Therefore I consider it to be a waste of time for the House to debate it. However, that was not the majority view of the Liaison Committee. As a member of that committee, and as I subscribe to the rules of the House, I therefore support the conclusion to which the Liaison Committee came.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para15"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moran, has made a powerful case on the interesting subject of the European Union, but I wonder whether&#151;I say this in the presence of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, the chairman of the European Union Committee, of which we have many sub-committees in the House&#151;this kind of issue should be a subject for the EU sub-committees rather than for ad hoc Select Committees. Given what has happened in recent months&#151;the failed constitution and the other kinds of chaos coming from the European Union&#151;their time may be very well spent on this subject.
<P>

<a name="40114-07_para16"></a>I echo what the noble Lord, Lord Moran, said: this is not a party political matter&#151;there will be a free vote&#151;but I hope that the House will feel that the Lord Chairman of Committees deserves support in this matter.

<a name="40114-08_para0"></a>My reason for saying so is simply this: we have a very full programme of scrutiny to conduct in the European Union Select Committee and we depend upon the seven sub-committees to do their work to enable us to complete the process. We would not be serving this House or the country if, at a time when scrutiny of European affairs is so important, we pre-empted all the work that we are doing now to take on a study which, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord Peston, probably would not reach a conclusion and for which we would not have the resources anyway.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-08_spnew3"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, I was a member of the Joint Select Committee on the Communications Bill chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, which is referred to in the report. There was no doubt in our minds that the Communications Bill and the work carried out on it was only half-time in a parliamentary process to determine the shape of our broadcasting industry in the 21st century. That is why I believe that the committee misdirected itself. There is no doubt, as the minutes quoted by the noble Baroness in 2002 show, that the committee had accepted the logic of this House retaining some kind of monitoring and assessment of the decisions made in communications after the passing of the Communications Act.
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, who unfortunately has had to leave to attend another appointment, called me aside and&#151;

<A NAME="40114-08_spnew5"></A><B> Lord McNally: </B>   My Lords, then perhaps he will nod and reaffirm the assurances and discussions we had at the time the pre-legislative scrutiny committee was in process.
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para2"></a>I do not want to debate the totality of the committee's decisions. I say to my noble friend Lady Scott that where she is absolutely wrong is that there is a finite and salient issue here. The decisions that will be made about broadcasting and communications in the next 18 months will shape the industry for well into the 21st century. I say to noble Lords that the House will discover the mistake that the committee has made&#151;and that the House has made&#151;when, down the Corridor, Mr Gerald Kaufman and his committee regularly, week by week, scrutinise what is happening in the industry and we at this end of the Corridor are impotent and without the resource and ability to follow these important developments. These are immediate issues; they are happening now. The reason that the committee made the right decision in 2002 and misdirected itself in 2003 is because of the saliency and urgency of the matters to be discussed.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para3"></a>I do not intend&#151;I cannot anyway&#151;to respond to every point made by noble Lords, particularly those who went into what might be described as a Second Reading debate on the merits or otherwise of membership of the European Union. All I will say is that the arguments were considered carefully by the Liaison Committee, as our report indicates.
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para4"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moran, made much of the fact that 51 Peers had signed their support for his proposal. The Liaison Committee also had letters of support for the other two proposals. I am certain that had the other two proposers gone around the House attempting to collect support for their proposals, they, too, would have attracted a large number of signatures. As the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, a member of the Liaison Committee, said, do we want to make our decisions based on the number of signatures that can be collected in support of any one or more proposal? Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Vinson, said that he supported the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, as well. If that is to be the case, we might as well scrap the Liaison Committee altogether and merely send a questionnaire to noble Lords to decide what we should do.
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para5"></a>I took slight exception to the remark of the noble Lord, Lord Moran, that the reason the Liaison Committee did not like his proposal was because it might upset the Prime Minister. I would point out that only three members of the Liaison Committee are members of the government party. The others are independents and Conservatives. Looking at the list of members, I do not believe that they would be influenced by whether or not the Prime Minister happened to like that particular decision.
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para6"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, felt that she was at a disadvantage because she did not bring supporters. She did not realise that she could bring supporters to the meeting. It has been a practice recently&#151;but only recently, I agree&#151;to bring one or two supporters along to address the Liaison Committee. Indeed, the practice where the proposers themselves attend is fairly new. However, it is the quality of the case made and the suitability of the subject matter that counts, not the number of supporters present at the meeting. In fact an examination of the report will show that to be the case because the noble Lord, Lord Moran, brought two supporters and his bid was not successful.
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para7"></a>It is true that in February 2002 the Liaison Committee reported to the House that communications would be a good subject to be considered by a committee, as the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord McNally, said. But the Liaison Committee makes clear in its report that it did not consider this to have been a firm commitment. It reviewed the proposal afresh and concluded that the remit was very wide and more suited to a sessional Select Committee than an ad hoc committee. It further concluded that the topic had no particular claim to be the subject of a dedicated Select Committee. In other words, quite simply, the Liaison Committee changed its mind.
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para8"></a>I would remind your Lordships once again that the House makes provision for only one ad hoc Select Committee at any one time and the Liaison Committee <P>


<a name="column_589"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 589</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>has made a clear recommendation in favour of a committee on the Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Joffe. That is not to say that the noble Lord, Lord Moran, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, cannot bring their proposals back to the Liaison Committee in the future if they wish. I know that that may disappoint the noble Lord, Lord Peston, but I cannot stop them bringing their proposals back and nor can he. Indeed, given that the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Moran, differs from his original proposal, that course would seem desirable in that particular case.
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para9"></a>In view of the usual practice of the House to follow the recommendations of the Liaison Committee, I hope that your Lordships will support its report and that the amendments will not be moved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-08_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Alton of Liverpool: </B>   My Lords, before the Chairman of Committees sits down, he will recall that I wrote to him last week setting out a number of concerns. I wonder whether he will answer two questions to help the House.
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para10"></a>First, when the Liaison Committee considered the Patient (Assisted Dying) Bill, did it weigh up the fact that there had already been a Select Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, which had looked at exactly these issues and decided, by a majority decision, to oppose any change in the law? Will he say what medical, ethical or legal issues have changed since then and whether he and the Select Committee took into account that, in the debate that took place in June of last year on this Bill, the majority of your Lordships opposed it, along with the Royal Colleges and the BMA?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-08_spmin1"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, I do not want to go into the merits of patient assisted dying. That is not my role. I have a view on it, but it is not for me to disclose what that view might be. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred to the fact that the matter was looked at, but it was looked at 10 years ago. If he looks at the evidence given to the Select Committee, he will see that a number of factors have changed since then.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-08_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Moran: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord finally sits down, he took exception to my reference to the Prime Minister, but in my speech I asked what was the meaning of the committee's decision that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We doubt whether it would be possible to isolate the Committee's deliberations from wider political considerations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-08_para11"></a>
I said that I could not understand that. The noble Lord has not yet explained what it means. Could he very briefly tell us?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-08_spmin2"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, I do not think that at this stage I can add anything further to what is in the report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-08_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Moran: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to those who have supported my amendment. I am afraid that this has been a rather mixed and muddled debate. I had hoped, and asked, that we should debate the two parts separately so that those who wished to speak about Europe and those who wished to speak about communications could do so. I thought that that would be much clearer and less confusing. <P>


<a name="column_590"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 590</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Unfortunately, I was told that the procedure was the other way, and so we have had a rather confusing debate.
<P>

<a name="40114-08_para12"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Peston, is an eminent economist and knows much more about these things than I do. In answer to the points that he made, I believe that if we were to adopt his point of view, we would never be able to discuss these matters. As the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, has explained, the EU Select Committee and its sub-committees discuss legislation, which is right and proper. They do not discuss&#151;and the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, has explained that they do not wish to discuss&#151;our fundamental relationship with the Union. That is what I have asked that they should do. It may be that in the technical terms of cost benefit analysis, it would be impossible to do it in under three years; in that case, I hope it will be taken as a guideline and not as a strict rule. I believe that a short, sharp report, which would initiate public discussion of this matter, which has been kept under wraps, would be valuable.

<A NAME="40114-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, I am much obliged to the noble Lord. There are many other Members of this House who wished to support his amendment, but they did not do so because the Chairman of Committees rose to close the debate. Out of courtesy to him and the procedures of the House, we did not proceed to put our points of view. I, for one, feel that I have been robbed of that opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-09_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Moran: </B>   My Lords, I have a very great respect for the noble Baroness the Leader of the House and I paid very careful attention to what she said. I think that this is a matter of great importance and a matter for the House. Although we have been able to debate it today only in a very summary way, I think it is right that we should have an opportunity to express our view. Therefore, I would like to test the opinion of the House.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-09_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote </B>   had given notice of her intention to move, as an amendment to the Motion standing in the name of the Chairman of Committees, at end to insert "but with the omission of paragraphs 5 to 8; and that the report be remitted back to the Liaison Committee in respect of those paragraphs with an instruction that the committee should reconsider the proposal for a Select Committee on Communications".
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para2"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I would like to thank noble Lords who spoke in support of my amendment. I am indeed grateful to them and to the many noble Lords around the House who have said how warmly they support my proposition. However, having listened to what the Chairman of Committees said, I note that he warmly invited us to return to the committee with the same or even a better proposal. I assure him that we will take up his offer at the earliest possible moment, so I will not move the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para3"></a>[Amendment not moved.]

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-09_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Brightman: </B>   My Lords, may I raise one very short point on the report of the Liaison Committee? Appendix 5 tells us that nine or more Bills will be <P>


<a name="column_593"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 593</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>available in draft form before First Reading. I have made inquiries at the Printed Paper Office and the Minute Room and, apparently, notice that a draft Bill has become available for collection is published nowhere. I suggest that there might be a note in the Minute Paper of the availability of a Bill in draft form. For example, there could be a brief note of it just before the statement of Bills in progress.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-09_spmin0"></A><B>The Chairman of Committees:</B>  My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and learned Lord for having given me notice of his question. I am sure that we can deal with that request sympathetically and find some way of meeting it.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para4"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.


<a name="40114-09_head0"></a><H3><center>Direct Marketing to Children</center></H3>
<P>

<a name="40114-09_time2"></a><H5>4.29 p.m.</H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-09_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Howe of Idlicote </B>   rose to call attention to the extent of marketing aimed directly at children and the case for limiting its effects on society, children and families; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para5"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I start with a nostalgic reflection. The more one looks at the pressures on today's children to become adults well before it makes any kind of sense, the more I realise just how much easier was the task of bringing up children for my own generation of parents. In those days of black and white TV, there were limited channels as well as limited viewing hours. But, even then, I can remember huge tussles about viewing favourite TV programmes when homework had not been finished. In those days TV advertising was in its infancy. Today, incidentally, we are told that most children keep the TV on while doing homework. That is something that would have horrified my old English teacher.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para6"></a>So it should be no surprise that today marketing to children is very big business indeed. The UK pre-school market alone is worth no less than £4.3 billion a year. Given that 76 per cent of pre-school children watch two hours or more television each day, and children between the ages of four and 15 watch rather more than that, it is hardly surprising that the food industry, marketeers and advertisers regard children as such a good target audience.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para7"></a>During my time at the Broadcasting Standards Commission, we researched various aspects of children's broadcasting&#151;both its quantity and quality. In those days, only 15 years ago, there was near invisibility of pre-school material. Overall, we found that the quantity was certainly up and the quality down, with far too many cartoons and a paucity of good drama. Since then the number of children's programmes has grown significantly&#151;from over 10,000 hours in 1996 to over 32,000 in 2001. That is largely due to the increase in dedicated children's channels such as Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para8"></a>It is hardly surprising that that greatly increases the volume of advertising to which children are exposed. Our newspapers, too, have grown considerably in size, <P>


<a name="column_594"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 594</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>as have the number of adverts and promotions that they contain. But it is advertising on TV&#151;that additional member of the family in every household&#151;where the effects are perceived as greatest. That, along with the growing emphasis on successfully promoting brand loyalty, the use of celebrity endorsement and what are called "tie-ins"&#151;the "must have" Muppet or Lord of the Rings model and the like. That is not the only form of expansion that affects the situation. More than three out of four of those between five and 16 now have their own television.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para9"></a>Computers, too, are increasingly seen&#151;rightly, we must concede&#151;as a "must have", if children are to cope with today's technological taken-over world. It is more and more possible, with the rollout of broadband, for them to receive "broadcast" material on computers&#151;including adverts. Finally, three out of four youngsters own a mobile phone on which again it is increasingly possible to receive, among other forms of communication, broadcast material, desirable and otherwise. Only a few days ago, our attention was drawn to the increased availability of child pornography online.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para10"></a>This background, I hope, sets the scene. What about the problems posed by all that in today's universal global market economy? There are a number of reasons why we should be concerned; first and foremost, by the inevitably high pressure all that puts on parents to buy the goods advertised. Parents are already undervalued for the role they play in bringing up tomorrow's citizens. Yet in so many ways the state fails to support them in that vital task. It is hardly surprising that no less than 84 per cent of parents feel that companies marketing their products target children too much; and at an increasingly young age.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para11"></a>Parents have, as the National Family and Parenting Institute reports,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a sense of family life and parental control struggling under a tidal wave of marketing they cannot fight . . .  They would like not to have their children seen as fair game by aggressive, smart marketing they cannot fight . . .  with billions spent targeting children as consumers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-09_para12"></a>
It is not just the targeting of children as immediate consumers, but they are used by marketeers to pressure their parents to buy a wider range of goods, such as cars and holidays. If that kind of pester power, as well as peer pressure from other children, is a problem, as it clearly is for all parents, it becomes impossibly tough for poorer families.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para13"></a>In face of that anxiety, what, if anything, happens elsewhere? Do any controls or regulations exist in other countries? Sweden and Greece ban advertising to children under 12. Australia and Ireland and other countries ban advertising during pre-school children's programmes. By contrast, apparently, Britain has the highest rates in Europe of advertising to children.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para14"></a>Some form of guidance does already exist in this country. For example, each advert for TV has to be pre-vetted by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre, with any complaints made to the Independent Television Commission. Restrictions cover adverts which might cause harm to children&#151;physically, <P>


<a name="column_595"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 595</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>mentally or morally&#151;or take advantage of the natural credulity of children. Adverts are also not permitted that
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"exhort children to purchase or to ask their parents to make enquiries or purchase".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-09_para15"></a>
However, there have been complaints that the system has not proved effective. Regarding the print media the non-statutory Advertising Standards Authority, through its CAP Code is the industry's watchdog. It lays down strict provisions about what may or may not be marketed to children. A recent ASA report says that there is not a general problem with non-broadcast material targeted at children.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para16"></a>Ofcom, the new communication industry's regulator, with the ITC's responsibility for TV adverts since the beginning of the year, is currently engaged in public consultation on how TV and radio adverts should in future be regulated. Ofcom's overall policy is for lighter, not stronger, regulation and they hope to co-regulate the advertising aspects of their responsibilities with the ASA. Both bodies will have important powers if they choose to use them.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para17"></a>So is that existing statutory regulation and self-regulation enough? To illustrate the way in which we might respond to that question, I shall give an example. One of the most worrying developments over recent years is the increase in obesity. One can see there all too clearly one possible result of increased marketing. In recent years obesity among six year-olds in this country has doubled to 8.5 per cent and for 15 year olds has trebled to 15 per cent. Girls are the worst affected. A further concern is that with so much time spent on computers and watching TV the young are not taking anything like enough exercise.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para18"></a>It is hard to believe that those figures have nothing to do with the fact that the global spend on marketing food is an incredible £40 billion. An interesting figure to put that in perspective is that for every dollar spent by the World Health Organisation on preventing obesity and related illnesses, the global food industry spends 500 dollars promoting fatty foods. Diabetes UK is but one of the many health organisations which are concerned about that.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para19"></a>In the UK, food advertising accounts for some 50 per cent of all advertising in children's programmes. Of that, three-quarters was for fast or convenience food. It is small wonder that a Guardian poll in October last year showed that 57 per cent of adults wanted food advertising banned during children's TV programmes. With the growing concern about the increase in child obesity and with other countries sharing our concerns about direct marketing, is it time for further action in the UK? That is a difficult question. There is an inevitable unease, which I share, about living in what is seen as an increasingly nanny state.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para20"></a>Moreover, we are calling almost daily, and equally rightly, for young people to be fully involved in decisions that effect them&#151;not least if we are to re-engage them as our future citizens in democratic processes. So why should not the young, it might be <P>


<a name="column_596"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 596</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>asked, be exposed to and learn to cope early with modern market forces? So is voluntary action, self-regulation, likely to be a sufficient response to this kind of anxiety? We might consider whether the new children's commissioner should have responsibility in that respect. Do we need more than that?
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para21"></a>Most companies today are well aware, through Mori polls and the like, that customer loyalty, and therefore a successful bottom line, depends on them behaving as corporate responsible citizens. Where more important than in the food marketing industry? To move further down that road may be sufficient to change some of the most unscrupulous marketing techniques.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para22"></a>Voluntary actions such as those increasingly being agreed between manufacturers and school authorities&#151;to remove brand logos from vending machines in schools and to introduce and promote water, fruit and healthier foods alongside the unhealthy favourites&#151;are surely steps in the right direction. Certainly, that kind of behaviour can usefully be encouraged throughout the country.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para23"></a>Happily, with a number of government pilot schemes, there are signs that this is beginning to happen. In recent months, too, the increased media coverage about the dangers to us all from unhealthy foods has raised general awareness of the problem as well as an increase in MPs' questions calling for more action by the Government.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para24"></a>So if restraint could be agreed voluntarily for all advertisements used on TV before the watershed, or at the very least during actual children's programmes, and if Ofcom plays the important media education role it has been given and sees to it that children as well as adults become more sceptical viewers, that may be all that is needed.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para25"></a>But if, as I suspect to be the case, that proves ineffective, it may be time to begin applying&#151;especially to the marketing of unhealthy food to children&#151;the well rehearsed "precautionary principle"; that is, it is time to take further action when threats of harm to human health or the environment are seen even though the cause and effect relationship has not been fully established.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para26"></a>Both the Food Standards Agency&#151;I am sure that we will hear more about its views from my noble friend Lady Howarth&#151;and the Consumers' Association would appear to support further action along those lines. So does the scale of parental concern shown in a number of recent surveys. The National Family and Parenting Institute states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Expecting parents to continue to bear the main burden of gate-keeping&#151;in an environment where the full creative and economic might of the marketing world is put to persuading children to buy&#151;seems unfair, unworkable and detrimental to both the children's and parents' best interests".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-09_para27"></a>
And as one parent put it:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"It's tough sometimes . . .  and I need to ask if the advertising industry are comfortable spending millions of pounds targeting children direct and then saying it's down to mum and dad to stand up to them".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-09_para28"></a><P>

<a name="40114-09_para29"></a>Perhaps the best example so far of the development of the "precautionary principle" has been with the tobacco industry. The natural desire in a democratic <P>


<a name="column_597"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 597</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>society to allow adult citizens to choose whether or not to smoke has given way over time, as scientific knowledge of damage to health has grown, to a total ban on tobacco advertising of any kind. And soon, if exhortation fails, we are likely to see a ban on smoking in public places.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para30"></a>In closing, I should like to remind your Lordships once again of the blatant brand marketing to pre-school children to the value of £4.3 billion a year. Should that be allowed to continue during children's programmes? A Private Member's Bill was recently introduced in the other place by Debra Shipley MP which would go some way to banning advertising during pre-school children's TV. I would support that step along the legislative road. The question is&#151;and I hope that it will be addressed by your Lordships&#151;how much further should we go in that legislative direction?
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para31"></a>I am particularly looking forward to hearing the views, priorities and suggestions for action that your Lordships will put forward in your speeches. And of course, above all, I am looking forward to hearing from the Minister what the Government's reaction is to this area of concern and their plans to deal with it. I beg to move for Papers.

<A NAME="40114-09_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, although I am interested in the subject of the debate, I wondered whether I had sufficient knowledge to make a worthwhile speech, but when I received a piece of briefing I was convinced that I should speak. It arrived via my Whips Office from the Advertising Association. The first page outlines the advertising industry's view on advertising to children. Paragraph 4 states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Advertising provides information to make choices"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-09_para32"></a>
okay, that is not too bad remembering that we are talking about children&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"and in many of the mature UK food markets, advertising merely drives brand share and endorses loyalty".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-09_para33"></a>
Anyone who took an interest in the Bill banning tobacco advertising heard that argument a great deal. I thought it was spurious when we were talking about adults and in this situation I think that it is patently absurd. I also think that it is insulting to the intelligence of your Lordships that such advertising should be brought out.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para34"></a>I hope that the Advertising Association takes this kick in the pants and feels it as hard as I am aiming it. It has succeeded in raising another voice against it. I hope that if the association is paying someone to produce this stuff, it demotes him or gets rid of him. It is vaguely insulting.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para35"></a>Having been inspired, I started to look a little further. It became clear that behind that attitude lay the fear that there would be a ban or restriction on the advertising of confectionery, fizzy drinks and so forth. That has undoubtedly been inspired by the fact that a huge industry was built up around the claiming of compensation for damage resulting from the use of tobacco and in relation to tobacco advertising. The great advertising industry, having won on tobacco, is now turning to new targets. It may by cynical <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>opportunism by some or it may be seen as a campaign by others. The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, rightly asked how far we should go down the legislative road. What are we trying to do here? Where are we going?
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para36"></a>Due to the shortness of time, I referred only to the executive summary of the FSA report, but when I began to read it I suddenly said, "This isn't rocket science". Home static entertainment has reached saturation level. When I was growing up, a long time ago now, only two channels provided children's programmes. They were shown only for a short time and to a mass market. As the noble Baroness said, today there are channels dedicated totally to the younger market.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para37"></a>I have a daughter who at 16 months is beginning to recognise television programmes&#151;or probably I have noticed that she is beginning to do so. That means she is a ready-made target for advertising. The BBC markets spin-off toys for children&#151;I have bought them for nephews who recognised the TV programme and wanted the toy&#151;and that is a form of advertising.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para38"></a>However, we must look strongly at dietary advertising shown at certain times. The fact of the matter is that we like to eat fat, salt and sugar and we always have done. Our traditional fast food is fish and chips&#151;not the slimmers' paradise, we can safely say. The fast-food format of the big hit of fat, salt and sugar has become much more readily available.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para39"></a>The FSA executive summary talks about the big four. I will not go into it, but it relates to the consumption of food purchased in supermarkets. People sit around snacking a lot of foods without a good nutritional balance and which are very high in calories and so forth. We have an audience which sits down and watches television as opposed to going out and doing things. As I said before, the fact that one had about two hours of children's programmes only meant that they had to find some other way of entertaining themselves, whether by kicking a football or something else. That meant that they could not just sit down. When sitting in front of a television set, which we all tend to do, we usually have something to eat or drink at the same time, whether a cup of tea or a sugary drink.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para40"></a>If we are to look at one area of advertising, I would suggest very highly sugared and caffeinated drinks. These drinks are sold in schools and action is going to be taken. I have just received information that Canada has banned the sale of fizzy drinks and in Scotland action has been taken to restrict their impact and to remove advertising. That should be a way forward to remove one link.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para41"></a>I discovered by accident through a radio programme that the consumption of cola drinks leads to consuming more calories more quickly. It is also very sugary. In the school environment one is going to be pumped up slightly more. We all know that because we all experience it. How often on a boring committee day have we had strong coffee and a couple of spoons of sugar to keep us awake? We all do and there is nothing new about it. The only thing that is new is the intensity of what is now taking place.

<a name="40114-09_para42"></a>If we wish to tackle obesity and improve behaviour in schools, we should think long and hard about exactly what we are going to do in this area because it involves all the other aspects of the matter under discussion. If we wish people to have immediate sugar hits while watching television, then why should they go out? They are having a sugar "rush"; they have a picture before them and they do not have to think or move. They have the wonderful comforting feeling that they are doing something which is slightly wrong. Why should they move? We must think long and hard about what we are doing.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para43"></a>I occasionally find myself dragooned into doing a part of the family shopping with a small child. I have to make sure that she does not go too close to the brightly coloured items. I see families with perhaps three children going round the store. A child recognises a brightly-coloured packet and grabs it. I do not know what I would do in that situation with just one child. One can visualise three children grabbing their favourite sweets in association, for example, with a soft drink which is drunk by a sports star who is exhibiting a certain pair of trainers. I have recent experience of a particular brand of rugby boots provided to me and a few parliamentary friends. It was sports kit designed by arts students and worn by nobody. I will return to that and give names later on. It is incredibly difficult to resist products which are endorsed at that level.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para44"></a>I go back to the original inspirational advertisement. Anyone who says that it is merely to ensure brand share is talking rubbish. Apart from everything else, the market is constantly changing and becoming a more established spending market. I hope that we shall look long and hard at this matter. We will not overreact because we have always had a degree of fast food in our culture such as fish and chips, although it is hamburger bars now. But let us try to keep a balance.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para45"></a>We should look to see if there are certain big offenders in this market. I suggest that the first area we should look at is that of highly sugared and highly caffeinated drinks.

<A NAME="40114-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, has chosen a very hot topic and developed the theme very skilfully. My consideration will focus mainly on food advertising and promotion. The nation has woken up at last to the extent and dangers of a developing epidemic of obesity. As the noble Baroness has said, some of the same considerations apply to the promotion of designer or branded toys, sports kit and computer games. These drain parents' bank balances and contribute to our massive private national debt. They encourage a sedentary lifestyle, which we do not want.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para46"></a>I declare an interest in the problem of food advertising since I am chairman of the All-Party Food and Health Forum and honorary secretary of the National Heart Forum, which has just made a detailed submission to the Department of Health on policy options on food marketing to children, the very topic <P>


<a name="column_600"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 600</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of this debate. A little later I shall outline some of its content, but first I would like to consider the role of exercise in the obesity epidemic.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para47"></a>The food industry correctly points out that both children and adults have become much less physically active over the past two decades for a variety of reasons. That contributes to the imbalance between energy intake and energy output, which underlies the problem of overweight and obesity. I readily agree that this is the case and that to make a serious impact on the problem both sides of the equation need to be tackled.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para48"></a>But when advocating physical activity as the solution, it is worth remembering that it takes a surprisingly large amount of activity to burn off surplus calories. As regards a standard-size energy dense product such as a Snickers or Mars bar, which weighs about 50 grams and contains about 300 calories&#151;I am not speaking about the jumbo-size, which is twice as big and provides calories at a cheaper rate per calorie&#151;one should look at ways in which one might dissipate the 300 calories in the bar.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para49"></a>One way would be not to take the lift to the top of the Canary Wharf tower, but to climb the stairs at a fast rate of, say, 92 steps per minute, which would equate to 50 feet per minute. That is for an average-size adult. That exercise would metabolise about nine kilocalories each minute, according to Department of Health figures. To dissipate the energy in the Mars bar in that way would require 33 minutes of climbing. That would achieve a 1650 foot vertical ascent, the equivalent of walking to the top of the tower more than twice over. An overweight person would have more trouble in doing it because they would expend more energy each step. Only a trained athlete could do that without frequent stops for breath. I found the calculation very hard to believe. I have double checked the figures and they are correct.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para50"></a>The point of the exercise is to emphasise how extremely difficult it would be to increase physical activity on a population-wide basis to the extent necessary to overcome our current obesity problem. To be fair, regular, moderate exercise does seem to increase the resting metabolic rate, which helps to use up further calories. Exercise must play a part in the fight against fat, but control of the food intake is far easier to achieve in the short term and in my view it is far more important.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para51"></a>The noble Baroness has outlined the extent of the problem of advertising to children. I have some information to supplement hers coming from a monograph called "TV Dinners: What's being served up by the advertisers?", which is the result of careful research by Charlie Powell for Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming, which closely observed 40 hours of commercial television programmes. To summarise the results, food advertising is two to three times more frequent during children's hours of viewing than during adult viewing periods. Up to 10 food adverts per hour may appear during children's viewing of commercial television. More than half of the adverts for food during children's viewing times are for confectionery, cake or <P>


<a name="column_601"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 601</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>biscuits. Between 90 and 95 per cent of products shown are high in fat, sugar or salt. Fruit and vegetables are not advertised at all.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para52"></a>A further thorough review and research into the effect of food advertising was carried out last year by Professor Gerard Hastings and his team from Strathclyde, City and Oxford universities&#151;a review commissioned by the Food Standards Agency. I previously described that carefully conducted study in your Lordships' House during an Unstarred Question on obesity tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, last October. Its findings confirm and amplify Sustain's work, but its main impact was to establish clearly good research evidence that advertising influences children's food preferences and what they consume&#151;research that, until recently, the food industry could, erroneously, say was lacking.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para53"></a>That finding was scarcely surprising, as it is presumably to change children's habits that manufacturers and fast-food caterers promote their wares. They would not do it if it did not work. They know that it works. Unfortunately, the diet that they advertise, to cite the report to the Food Standards Agency,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"varies greatly from the recommended one, and themes of fun and fantasy and taste, rather than health and nutrition are used to promote this to children".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-09_para54"></a>
There is general agreement among the health professions, consumer organisations and the majority of parents that there is too much promotion of the wrong kind of food to children. We have already heard about that from both previous speakers.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para55"></a>The question of whether to tighten the voluntary agreements entered into by the food and drink and advertising industries, which are now clearly insufficient, or to legislate, to introduce statutory legislation, now faces the Food Standards Agency, the Department of Health and, currently, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Ofcom. Judging by her more recent informal statements, the Secretary of State, Tessa Jowell, although clearly recognising that there is a problem, would first like the food industry to put its own house in order.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para56"></a>Most of those who work in public health in the widest sense feel that that is unlikely to be effective. The Minister herself, having battled with the tobacco industry, probably knows that too but, at present, tactics dictate that she wears kid gloves. In her words, she prefers,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"not to pick a fight with the industry".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-09_para57"></a><P>

<a name="40114-09_para58"></a>Under such a voluntary agreement, the content or quality of advertisements under such a system might improve, but it is unlikely that the industry will ever agree to restrict the total or cumulative volume of advertising without a statutory requirement to do so. However, if a strengthened voluntary code is to be tried first, it is important that the Department of Health, the Food Standards Agency and consumer organisations have an input into drawing up the code: it should not be left to the food and advertising industries and Ofcom alone.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para59"></a>The effectiveness of any voluntary agreement should be closely monitored for a limited period, with the clear understanding that regulation will follow as night after day it is not fully effective. The Department of Health has received the full report of the National Heart Forum, drawn up by Jane Landon, on policy options for food marketing to children, which I mentioned earlier. That report followed the forum's "young@heart" initiative, which was a life course approach to preventing coronary heart disease. The report explores in much greater detail all the issues over which I have skated and includes international comparisons.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para60"></a>I hope that my noble friend will recommend that that thorough analysis reaches not only the Department of Health but all relevant government departments before any decisions are made. The report would also be useful to the House of Commons Health Select Committee, which is now approaching the end of its inquiry into obesity.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para61"></a>The noble Baroness has raised a topic of great importance and urgency for the nation's future health. I very much hope that the Government will take heed of the warnings and useful suggestions that have already been made in the debate.

<A NAME="40114-09_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Howarth of Breckland: </B>   My Lords, I add my congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, on instigating this important debate. She is a consistent supporter of the rights of children and this debate is more than anything else about our adult responsibility to ensure that children have every opportunity to grow up with good health, able to enjoy long, disease-free life without the stigma of obesity.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para62"></a>I remind the House that obesity is not only a health problem. The charity Childline has listened to hundreds of children who are suffering from bullying simply because they are seen by their peers as fat. We know the implications of bullying for emotional growth.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para63"></a>It is a shocking fact that the 2002 health survey for England found that 16 per cent of children between the ages of two and 15 are obese and 30 per cent are either overweight or obese. As we have heard, diet and nutrition are key factors in increasing the risk of cancer, stroke and coronary heart disease, as well as a number of other serious diseases. It is also known that obesity is associated with increased risk of mortality. In 2002, cases of mature onset diabetes in obese children were reported for the first time. The National Audit Office has projected that by 2010, one in four adults will be obese and the total cost to the National Health Service and economy will be about £3.6 billion.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para64"></a>I declare an interest as a member of the board of the Food Standards Agency, which is currently considering ways to encourage children to eat a more healthy and balanced diet. In that context, the agency is also considering the role played by marketing and promotional activities in influencing what children eat.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para65"></a>Previous stakeholder discussions on the issue have revealed polarised views. Many consumer groups oppose the concentration of advertising on foods high <P>


<a name="column_603"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 603</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>in fat, salt and sugars, and some support action to redress that balance. Among those are parents, who feel powerless in the face of large corporations. They cannot be expected to deal with that challenge alone. The National Family and Parenting Institute found that 84 per cent of parents felt that companies targeted their children too much and in that response there was a remarkable consistency across gender, social class, size of family and age of children. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Northbourne will say more about the work of that excellent organisation and its findings.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para66"></a>Industry, meanwhile, doubts the ability of advertising to influence the balance of children's diets, and considers the decrease in children's physical activity to be the major contributing factor to obesity. There certainly needs to be action on both diet, or calories in, and activity, or energy out, although if I went up the tower at the pace suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Rea, I think I might have a heart attack.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para67"></a>However, in the interests of children and the future health of the nation, to do nothing is simply not an option. In September, the Food Standards Agency published the results of a systematic review of the available evidence on the issue, the Hastings review, which has been described by the noble Lord, Lord Rea, so I shall not repeat him. It concludes that advertising to children affects their preferences, purchase behaviour and consumption. Those effects are apparent not just for different brands but for different types of food.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para68"></a>To follow the review through, the agency has held a meeting of academics to debate it, together with another research review produced by the industry on 31 October. The seminar, the peer review, supported the conclusions reached in the Hastings review. I assume that the debate will continue.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para69"></a>The agency then published a paper that sets out a range of policy options to address all aspects of the marketing and promotion of food for children. The purpose of the paper is to provoke a wide-ranging discussion on the appropriate way forward. Although I admire the real passion of the noble Lord, Lord Addington, we must have research and reason if we are to win the debate.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para70"></a>A stakeholder meeting was held in December to begin to consider how the issue might be taken forward. It identified four main strands for further work: composition and labelling of retail foods&#151;people still do not know what is in the food that they have in their hand; broadcast advertising; consumer information; and provision of healthier options in food services. A large public meeting will be held in January to be attended by a wide-ranging audience to take those issues further. There will also be discussions at open meetings in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para71"></a>As the Minister knows, the agency board is due to discuss the issue in March 2004. It is anticipated that it will consider a wide range of policy options, which may be regulatory or voluntary, after which advice will be given to Ministers.
<P>


<a name="column_604"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 604</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para72"></a>In December, Tessa Jowell publicly called on the newly established Ofcom to review the rules covering food advertising on television. Ofcom's chief executive, Stephen Carter, responded with an open letter on Ofcom's website. Ofcom has committed itself to further research to help decide what action it considers necessary. That work will comprise further research into the impact of food advertising on children's diets; an examination of the context of both the FSA's report and the factors that have led to the issue being on the public agenda; and an independent assessment of the Hastings review. But does Ofcom really need to repeat all that work already carried out by the FSA and others?
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para73"></a>However, the industry is right in one area: this is not a one-issue problem; it is complex. There was a time when to be sent to your room was punishment; now, parents have told the National Family and Parenting Institute, it is hard to get them out. A 2002 survey by the Independent Television Commission revealed that, on average, each household has three television sets and that, on average, children aged four to 15 spend two hours 23 minutes watching television. Sustain estimates that 95 per cent of advertising during children's television programmes is for fatty, salty or sugary foods. Will the Minister think about what research might be carried out jointly by general government departments to take that work forward? Research on the influence of advertising is contested, but my question is: if it is not effective, why, in 2001, did food advertisers spend £161 million on selling chocolate and sweets in the UK, much of it directed at children?
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para74"></a>There is no doubt that the issue will need action on many fronts, and that departments and agencies, both statutory and non-governmental, must work together. The Food Standards Agency, the Department of Health and organisations such as the National Family and Parenting Institute need to work together with&#151;dare I say it&#151;industry in tackling the difficult problem. What are the Government doing to ensure that the many departments involved in this complex problem work together to a good solution?
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para75"></a>The Food Standards Agency is working on ways to encourage children to eat a healthier diet, including the promotion of novel ways to increase children's fruit and vegetable intake; for example, using the Bash Street Kids comic-strip characters and a "how to" guide on fruit tuck shops, an alternative to buns and biscuits. The agency is looking at the promotion of a healthy diet and activity through, for example, an interactive CD-ROM called "Dish it Up!" for 11 to 12 year-olds and a school lunch-time based nutrition and physical activity programme for seven to nine year-olds. It is also looking at the improved promotion of diet through peer education, because we know that children have much more influence on each other than we adults have on them.
<P>

<a name="40114-09_para76"></a>Many factors influence what children eat, or calories in, and the measure of exercise that they take, or energy out. It is also a result of changing behaviour. But we cannot condemn the next generation to poor health, if some of what we know can make a difference. It is the responsibility of us all to remember that to do nothing is <P>


<a name="column_605"></a>

<P>
<A NAME="40114-10_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of St Albans: </B>   My Lords, like other noble Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, for initiating this debate. Again like other noble Lords, I have read articles in preparation for the debate, most of which seem to concern children and food. So I, too, can throw statistics around like confetti; for example, that 60 per cent of children regularly eat crisps after school; 40 per cent eat biscuits; 30 per cent eat chocolate; and sales are predicted to rise by 20 per cent in the next four years. Or this: spending on advertising aimed at children rose sixfold in the years up to 1998. It was stated in the other place that on children's television a child is likely to see between six and 11 adverts every hour for food high in sugar, salt and fat. The more I read the statistics, the more my heart sank.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para0"></a>I then read the ASA's own document, its code of practice&#151;still more statistics. A snapshot survey carried out in July 2003 showed that the compliance rates for non-broadcasting adverts directed at children was 98 per cent. My heart lifted a little as I read the standards with which advertisers are required to comply; for example:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"An advertisement should contain nothing that is likely to result in physical, mental or moral harm to children".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-10_para1"></a>
I was reassured to know that compliance rates in the non-broadcasting world are so high. I have done all my background homework.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para2"></a>However, I began to be troubled again, because none of the lobbying groups seemed to be getting to the core of the matter. Not one of them was challenging the assumption implicit in all this: that children, even the very young, are branded and defined simply and only as consumers. Not one of them asked whether that was an adequate definition of childhood. Not one asked whether that was what childhood was for.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para3"></a>It would be fascinating to discover when the word "consumer" began to fashion the very ways in which we think, and when it entered our national vocabulary. My guess is that it came into prominence in the 1950s and 1960s. Gradually the stranglehold that that word now has on all aspects of society has tightened, and now even the smallest of children are defined by it.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para4"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howe, brought to our attention a quotation that I also discovered. It states:

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-10_para5"></a>
I do not know how one could begin to create such a statistic, but the use of the word "market" is the giveaway. The youngest child is no longer a miracle, a gift or a source of wonder but is simply regarded as a consumer. I find that morally degrading, because it assumes that the child is nothing more than a manipulatable and voracious computerised dustbin.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para6"></a>The problem that the debate has highlighted relates not simply to the physical, mental or emotional well-being of children, important though all those are. It actually relates to what we as a society think that childhood is for. I am much taken with the Swedish experience, which refers to the need for children to have safe zones in which they are protected from commercial influences. At least, that assumes that childhood has a kind of moral integrity as a stage in our human development that we, as adults, should have a duty to safeguard. I would go further and argue that childhood is also a place in which things of the spirit must be given room to grow. Of course, I would claim that all of us&#151;children included&#151;are made in the image of God.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para7"></a>I am not defined by what I consume. I am defined&#151;in my terms, at any rate&#151;by my relationship with God and with my neighbour and by my destiny in God. Why are we, as adults in Britain today, so lacking in moral courage that we do not wish to protect children from exploitative and commercial pressure? Why are we so spiritually bereft as a nation that one third of parents provide a television set in the bedroom for the under-3s? I find that hauntingly sad.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para8"></a>I warmly welcome the debate. At heart, it is about whether, as a nation, we are prepared to submit to a definition of childhood that sees children simply as consumers or whether we have the courage to say that childhood needs protection from exploitation because only in that way can the spiritual needs and rights of children be given a place to grow and flourish. We are in serious danger of producing a nation of fat and greedy children with thin and starving souls. Is that really the best that we, as adults, can do?

<A NAME="40114-10_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Chan: </B>   My Lords, I also congratulate my noble friend Lady Howe of Idlicote on securing this debate, which is of importance not only to children but to their families and communities. Noble Lords who have spoken have identified the main focus of direct marketing to children&#151;food and drink. My concerns are focused on people who live in economically poor communities, in which marketing to children leads not only to bad health but to debt, further poverty and increasing crime.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para9"></a>Marketing aimed directly at children has become more widespread and unavoidable with television being in all our homes and the computer becoming an essential tool for school homework. In many homes, the computer is part of the bedroom fixtures for <P>


<a name="column_607"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 607</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>children. We know that, through the Internet, children can be reached by people and organisations for good or ill.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para10"></a>Television advertisements aimed at pre-school children are probably the most effective influence, as other noble Lords have said, on their choice of food and drink, as well as of clothes, toys and entertainment. In single-parent homes, television is used as a childcare tool because mother is too busy to give all her time to childcare. As a consequence, children watch advertisements repeatedly, remember the jingles and ask mother for the products promoted. At Christmas, parents, including single parents, feel obliged to spend hundreds of pounds that they do not have and can hardly afford to borrow to buy the latest computer games, scooters, shoes and other presents. Under such pressure, poorer families accumulate debt and suffer more stress.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para11"></a>In economically poor areas of England, fast food outlets sell the cheapest meals. That is welcomed by families, but it restricts their choice of healthy food and leads to poor health. In addition, fast food outlets promise to give free toys with children's portions, and that too is welcomed. Parents with limited money go to the nearest supermarket to buy special food offers of two for the price of one. Such offers tend to be on less healthy products than we would otherwise buy. The adverse effects of unhealthy food on children are well known and have been rehearsed by other noble Lords. Among ethnic minorities, the ill effects include dental caries and gum disease, particularly in children from Chinese, Vietnamese, Bangladeshi and Pakistani families.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para12"></a>Parents in our poorer housing estates also directly influence their children by smoking at home. Some break the law by asking children to buy cigarettes from corner shops. Sadly, such practices lead children to start smoking at an early age. Older children and teenagers can be influenced directly by pop music programmes and soap operas on television, and they assume that all popular and attractive young people wear designer clothes and shoes and use the latest mobile telephones, which receive computer and TV images. All such products are costly and add to the burden of financial debt for the family. In some poor housing estates where money is not available even through borrowing, children resort to bullying other children who are better off, theft from shops, breaking into cars and other crime.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para13"></a>The most dangerous form of direct marketing to children in such deprived estates include adults and older children who peddle drugs outside schools and around their homes. Such activity is illegal, and police officers are assigned to tackle it using their crime prevention powers.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para14"></a>In order to overcome the effects of harmful marketing to children, the Government must promote the marketing of healthy food and habits. That needs the co-operation of schools and would involve another look at how we use television, advertisements and public billboards. Public health leaflets that have attractive covers featuring popular actors and singers could be put through front doors by the local primary <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>care trust. That was done by the PCT of which I am a non-executive director in Birkenhead and Wallasey. We used Catherine Zeta Jones on the front cover, and not only did everybody read the eight-page document but they asked for further copies. Instead of just banning food that leads to poor health, the advertising media should promote healthy alternatives, such as fruit and low fat, low sugar and low salt foods.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para15"></a>In the communities to which I have alluded, neighbourhood regeneration needs to undergird all our attempts to overcome the difficulties of direct advertising to children. There should be playgrounds that are safe for children. They should not only have safe apparatus but also be places where children will be safe from adult predators. We need to have adult mentors who are prepared to organise and teach good quality skills, such as football. In Toxteth, Liverpool, former professional footballers, particularly from the local community, give their time to organise children and to teach football skills to children from poor housing estates. That has led to a number of children being recommended to join famous professional football clubs and, in turn, for them to promote healthy living.

<P>
<A NAME="40114-10_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, on securing this debate. I also share many of the concerns about the plight of young people and, indeed, their parents in modern society. Where I think that I differ from previous speakers is in the assumption that the problems can be solved or even considerably reduced by further restrictions on advertising.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para16"></a>We have always been a bit ambivalent about advertising in this country; for example, whether it is as to its cost effectiveness&#151;I refer to the celebrated quotation made by Lord Leverhulme: "I think that half my money spent on advertising is wasted. The trouble is I don't know which half."; whether it is as to its importance when we find businesses in a recession cutting their advertising budget at precisely the time that one would think that they should be increasing it to stimulate demand; or whether it is as to its value. There is something ingrained in the British character&#151;particularly, perhaps I may say, in the Scottish character&#151;that there is a duty to create the perfect product, and the world would then beat a path to our door and purchase it. That was reinforced when we had an Empire and a captive market, which is why most of British manufacturing industry has now gone down the Swanee since we no longer have an Empire, but did not learn how to compete with others.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para17"></a>Now, a question has been raised about almost the morality of advertising. My remarks are not designed to defend the advertising industry, although it is important to recognise that it is an important creative industry in this country, which is of international repute. We have very few industries that can claim that. Nor do I rise simply as someone involved in broadcasting to express concern about the loss of potential advertising revenue, particularly from children's programmes. It is worth pointing out that in <P>


<a name="column_609"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 609</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Sweden, for example, where no advertising is permitted to children under 12 years old, the number of children's programmes produced is only five hours a week by the commercial sector, of which only two-and-a-half hours originate in Sweden. That contrasts with slightly more than 11 hours of children's programmes produced each week by ITV and 25 hours produced by Channel 5 in this country. Those are issues that need to be weighed in the balance.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para18"></a>My reason for saying, "Think again before you assume that advertising or restrictions on advertising present a solution" is that it is a distraction from the main problem. Perhaps we may look at some of the problems afflicting young people today. Undoubtedly, the biggest problem is drugs. Do we have any advertising for drugs? We do not. Yet drugs are a huge problem among young people. Yesterday in the Scottish Parliament, figures were quoted as regards smoking: 27 per cent of girls aged 16 and 16 per cent of boys were already regular smokers. At that age, they cannot have seen an advert for smoking that does not immediately warn them that smoking kills or seriously injures their health. Yet the figures are still high.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para19"></a>I turn now to sweets. My part of the world has a notorious sweet tooth. If UK consumption is 100 units, we are well up into the 120s/130s when it comes to consumption of chocolate, and so forth. But which country in Europe has the highest level of consumption of chocolate and sweets? It is Sweden, where no advertising whatever is allowed to children under 12 years old.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para20"></a>I turn now to another example; that of the world of pop music. What produced the big upsurge in pop music in the late 1950s and early 1960s? It was not plugging on the BBC. The BBC still had the old Home and Light programmes. Indeed, it was so long before the BBC introduced Radio 1&#151;I think it was not until about 1967&#151;that it lost the market to pirate commercial radio, which eventually led to the introduction of official, regulated commercial radio in this country.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para21"></a>My problem is that I do not think that restrictions on advertising present the solution. I was very much taken with the recognition of my noble friend Lord Rea of the number of times that we would all have to go to Canary Wharf to work off the effects of a Mars bar, but it is a fact that calorific intake in this country has gone down in the past decade. I appreciate that the problem is that we are not burning it off. It might be very nice, as the noble Lord, Lord Addington, said, if we went back to two television channels. I would certainly settle for one radio channel, providing that it is mine. The problem is that we have got more than that and, regrettably, no one will ever say, "No. Let us get back to two or three". We are faced with problems, but we must do something to encourage children to take more exercise.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para22"></a>I gather that it is a fact that the number of children between the ages of 5 and 10 undertaking any form of walking is down by 17 per cent since 1986. As regards 11 to 15 year-olds, the figure is down by 29 per cent. Only one-third of the children in this country takes the recommended two hours of exercise each week. It is all <P>


<a name="column_610"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 610</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>very well being nostalgic. I certainly took more than two hours exercise each week. We did not have a television, and the streets were safer to play in than they are now. There are huge problems, but do not let us imagine that advertising has caused them.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para23"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, was open enough to acknowledge the fast food of fish and chips. That antedates the arrival of advertising in this country. We all went for a fish supper. It was relatively cheap, fairly quick, saved parents time, cost a little money, and we all went for it. It had nothing to do with advertising.
<P>

<a name="40114-10_para24"></a>My concern is that we should not assume that this problem can be solved by blaming other people or the advertising industry. It must be solved by personal responsibility, which includes parents and schools. Otherwise, the problem will not be solved at all.

<A NAME="40114-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Rea: </B>   My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, does he realise that the figures he quoted as regards the calorie intake in this country going down are disputed? Many people believe that the official statistics which show that are incomplete and have not adequately taken into account food that is eaten outside the home.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Gordon of Strathblane: </B>   My Lords, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Rea, knows a great deal more about this subject than I do. I obviously accept what he says. But the very fact that no one is saying that the figure has gone up dramatically, and yet the problem of obesity has increased, indicates that it is not advertising that is causing the problem.

<P>
<A NAME="40114-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Baroness on introducing this important subject for debate, and on the excellence of the speakers. Perhaps I may point out to the noble Lord, Lord Gordon, that the Motion is targeted not against advertising but against marketing. Turning to the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Rea, which I admired very much, I was impressed by the statistics that he gave, as we all were. I wondered whether he would be able to work out what I should have to do to work off one of those wonderful cream cakes that I am always tempted by.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para0"></a>I am always put at the end of the list. I think that is because I nearly always attempt to say something slightly different. On this occasion I plan to talk on this issue from the point of view of parents although I am not saying that previous speakers have not. I believe that when the Minister replies he will say, because it is government policy, that it is the responsibility of parents to say no to their children and to control their children's exposure to television and commercial pressures. I have no argument with that. However, it raises the issue of what the responsibilities of parents are in our society. Where is it written down and who decides? Is it just what the Government choose to say is the responsibility of parents? Are children taught in school of their responsibilities when they become parents? If not how can parents know what they must <P>


<a name="column_611"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 611</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>do? What responsibility does the state leave to them and more importantly how do they prepare to perform those duties?
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para1"></a>It is high time that this Government or some other one introduced a much clearer contract between parents, the state and other groups such as the extended family and community. Parents do not have a voice. The Government say that it is the responsibility of parents to address these issues. If there were a trade union for parents&#151;I believe there ought to be&#151;and if I were its general secretary, I should be saying to the Government:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"All right. My members will take responsibility for looking after children in this way, but we want your help as follows".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-11_para2"></a>
I would then list some of the things which the Government need to do to work with and support parents in fighting the battle against obesity in children and damaging marketing.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para3"></a>The recent National Family and Parenting Institute MORI survey, to which many of your Lordships have referred, shows that a large majority of parents want to be good parents. We should remember that at all times. The vast majority of parents want to be good parents. They want to be responsible for their children's welfare and behaviour. Why do the Government not do more to support them in this task and to work in partnership with them to achieve the results we all want? The same MORI poll showed that a huge majority&#151;some 84 per cent of parents surveyed&#151;thought that commercial companies are targeting children too much.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para4"></a>The skills of persuasion and marketing today have been refined and developed to such a degree as never before. Technology places very powerful tools in the hands of these persuaders. Those include the Internet and television. They invade the home like a kind of fairy godmother, sometimes beneficent, sometimes evil.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para5"></a>The Government and some adults tend to say that parents should just say no. Parents do say no. They say no all the time. They have to say no much too often. Experts tell us that if we are to be good parents we should adopt positive parenting. We should say three good things for every time we say no to our children. That is all very well but with the advertising pressures of today, one has to say no about 27 times for every time one can say something good. It is not satisfactory. It is a conflict which in my view could and should be looked at very seriously.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para6"></a>Parenting has never been so difficult as it is today. Traditional parenting patterns do not always work. A recent Mothercare survey showed that around 70 per cent of parents still rely for their parenting skills on instinct or on what they learnt from their mothers. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health issued a report about a year ago in which it was made absolutely clear that parenting skills applicable to our parents are not necessarily applicable to parenting today. Parents need education and support. That is working well where it is available but Parenting Forum, in which I declare an interest having been chairman for eight years, tells me that only about 25 per cent of potential demand is currently met.
<P>


<a name="column_612"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 612</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para7"></a>I ask noble Lords to listen to the voice of one parent. He or she was the subject of a parenting order. Having gone through the parenting course, that parent said this, "Why did they wait for my son to commit a crime before I was able to get the parenting advice and support I have been trying to get for years?" When will the Government adequately fund the delivery of affordable parenting education and support where and when it is needed by young parents?
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para8"></a>Having talked generally about parenting support, I should like to look at one or two areas in the context of marketing. There is the whole issue of education and advice for parents and the question of labelling on goods and control over children's use of television and the Internet. I should like, briefly, to say a word about each of those.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para9"></a>Affordable education for parenthood should be available to every parent and prospective parent&#151;within reason&#151;where and when they want it. Where it is already available, it works. It is very popular. But no one should be excluded. I am sure the Minister will not know the answer to this question off the cuff, but how much are the Government currently spending on parenting education and support?
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para10"></a>I turn to the subject of advice. Goods in the food industry today are complex and the dietetic problems involved are not always simple. We have talked a great deal this afternoon about fats, salt and sugar. There are all sorts of other things that are not good for children's health. There may be foods that are good for another reason&#151;perhaps because they introduce a balance of vitamins. It would be simple to have a voluntary registration scheme which would enable food manufacturers marketing goods to children to say they would like to have a particular food assessed. There would then be a kite mark&#151;perhaps a figure of a child&#151;in different colours. The simplest would be: green, jolly good; yellow, maybe and red, not on your life. It might be that one could not put the negative one for legal reasons but one could allow manufacturers to apply to a national body for a kite mark for their food if they believed it was reasonably healthy and wanted to sell it on that ticket.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para11"></a>I turn now to the question of control of technology. There has been in existence a technology associated with what is called the Z chip or the J chip. This enables television sets to turn off at a certain hour, to accept only certain stations or to pick up signals which make them black out on material as it is broadcast. It is one thing to say to parents that it is their responsibility to see that children watch appropriate programmes for a reasonable period. It is much more difficult for a parent to do this. There is a statistic that the average household has three television sets. More than 60 per cent of children under 12 have a television set in their bedroom.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para12"></a>One may say that it is foolish of parents to allow that, but if all your child's friends have one, it is extremely difficult not to do so. However, it is much better to say, "Yes, you may have a television, but when you reach the age of 10, you shall have one of these". That may or may not bring about a terrific row, <P>


<a name="column_613"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 613</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>but at least it will happen only the once. If it is a question of going into a child's room and turning off the television every evening&#151;pulling out the plug and returning to find that the child has simply plugged it in again&#151;that is the kind of thing which makes parenting difficult. The Government should put their shoulder to the research which will perfect the available technology so that this problem can be solved.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para13"></a>I do not know whether comparable solutions are available for the Internet, but I strongly suspect that there are. Indeed, computers used in schools have modems which vet the sites to which the user may set up links.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para14"></a>Finally, I want to say this. One of the reasons why many parents today have difficulty in setting boundaries for their children is that they lack the self-confidence to do so. They feel under attack. The Government, employers, marketers, restaurateurs and the general public often resent their children in public places. Parenting has never been so difficult.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para15"></a>My noble friend Lady Howe remarked that the Government do not want to be seen as creating a nanny state. However, there is all the difference in the world between giving parents the help they want and behaving like a nanny. Parents need encouragement and support and, indeed, the vast majority of parents want that, provided that it is presented in the right way. The vast majority of parents love their children&#151;most of the time&#151;and want nothing more than to give them a good start in life.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para16"></a>I believe that the Government should be working in partnership with parents rather than constantly patronising them. They should listen to parents. There is no formula in this country for listening to them, no organisation through which parents can speak to the Government except, possibly, the National Family and Parenting Institute. That organisation may be moving into the role with the establishment of Parentline; I hope that it does. We need a way in which the Government can consult parents and so that parents can have a voice. If parents feel that they are being treated as grown-ups, they are much more likely to behave like them. The Government have done that in the Sure Start programme, which is a rip-roaring success because they have worked with parents.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para17"></a>I am running out of time so I end with a practical proposal. As a token of their real intent to work with parents, I suggest that instead of setting aside the frankly derisory sum of £25 million over three years for the parenting fund, the Government should make available 10 times that sum&#151;£250 million&#151;over the period. That would be a real gesture of confidence in the nation's parents.

<A NAME="40114-11_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Sharp of Guildford: </B>   My Lords, I join with other noble Lords in congratulating the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, on introducing a debate on a topic which, as the noble Lord, Lord Rea, remarked, is of great importance and urgency to the nation.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para18"></a>As we know, we are all back in the House: Christmas is over and the new year sales are on. Consumer debt in this country has reached its highest level ever, while <P>


<a name="column_614"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 614</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>savings as a proportion of GDP are at their lowest ever level. Yet we congratulate ourselves on the rate of economic growth we have achieved as a result of the consumer boom over the past few months. We lord it over France and Germany because we are spending money which perhaps we do not have. The newspapers, television and even the Government encourage us to go on spending money. Saving is perhaps no longer seen to be a virtue. In any case, you could be cynical about saving if you have put your money into Equitable Life.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para19"></a>Perhaps this is the age of instant gratification. Among the cuttings I have received, one mentioned the interesting speech broadcast last October on Channel 4 by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury. It caused something of stir because he said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"What makes me wince, I suppose"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-11_para20"></a>
about the consumerism that is gripping society&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"is the conscious targeting of young people&#151;who don't actually have purchasing power themselves, but can use what advertisers call 'pester power' with parents&#151;in a way which trains children into certain assumptions about what ought to make . . .  their lives satisfactory".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-11_para21"></a>
Too often these days, "I want" means "I get".
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para22"></a>Today we have questioned whether limitations should be put on the advertising of, in particular, food products to children. I shall return to that in a moment. However, a number of noble Lords have considered the problems surrounding the degree to which the state should regulate in this area. It took a long time to reach the decision not only to control but to eliminate tobacco advertising because ultimately we recognised that tobacco is addictive. I am not sure whether fast food is addictive. The legal suit being pursued against McDonald's in the United States is fascinating because it implies that fast food is addictive.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para23"></a>We need to look at the situation we have now, where advertising is aimed at children. The advertisers tell us that a child of three years of age can distinguish between brand images. For example, it knows the difference between adverts for Coco Pops and McDonald's on television. Further, there are enormous peer group pressures on children. How many grandparents were asked this Christmas to provide a Playstation 2? How much does it cost? Over £200, which is an enormous sum.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para24"></a>The Advertising Standards Authority tells us firmly that there is a clear code of practice in relation to children's advertising; that on the whole it is adhered to; and that where it is not, in those cases the appropriate people have been brought to book. Nevertheless, the issue of how people are being brought up in a consumer society is very real.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para25"></a>I shall not repeat all the statistics already cited in our debate, but I wish to bring two sets to the attention of noble Lords. First, 24 million Britons are either overweight or obese. We have heard the statistics for children, which are terrifying, but it is worrying that 24 million people are overweight. Sir John Krebs reckons that, if we do nothing about obesity, within a few <P>


<a name="column_615"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>years it will cost the National Health Service £3.6 billion to deal with the health effects. I should have thought it would already be costing the NHS as much as that.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para26"></a>In addition, we must face it that many families do not sit down together at mealtimes any longer. I was amused to learn that they graze from the fridge. Too often children help themselves to fast foods from the fridge. Food that needs to be heated is put in the microwave for three minutes. By then it is done and you do not have to worry about it. Thus the socialising effect referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is missing. Parents do not talk to their children.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para27"></a>The Sure Start programme has emphasised how important it is that parents talk to their child. Some parents do not know naturally how to do that, just as some parents do not know naturally how to feed their children well.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para28"></a>As well as the advertising aimed at young children on television, we have all the advertising that comes through schools&#151;the sponsorship deals for computers and books in schools. We are told to "Shop at Tesco" or "Shop at Sainsbury's" and acquire a coupon. Without those promotions, many schools would be very short of computers, so I am quite pleased about such sponsorship deals. Whether it is right that Cadbury's should be sponsoring sports kit, or whether it is all so cynical, or whether Coca-Cola and Pepsi should install drink machines in schools, it is nevertheless vital that such sponsorship is regulated&#151;perhaps we should have water rather than Coke and Pepsi machines.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para29"></a>One can become cynical about why companies do such things, but would a ban work? We expect adults to discriminate, but if we banned advertising during children's TV programmes, advertisers could just switch to the adult programmes that children watch. We know that about 80 per cent of the audience of "Coronation Street", "Neighbours" and so on, are children. Advertisers would switch from one programme to another, and there may be a switch to other forms of advertising. We have not talked about the main form of advertising that children receive today, which is text messaging. It is more important to ban unsolicited advertising and e-mails to children through computers and text messages than carrying a ban on television too far.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para30"></a>We also need to think more logically about the issue and put it into context, as suggested by the noble Lords, Lord Gordon and Lord Northbourne. I very much support the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in his call for parenting initiatives. Parents should be encouraged to teach their children about dietary principles, for example. In Question Time today, we talked about salmon and the suggestion from America that the salmon we eat is contaminated. People react quickly to such issues. If we were to put more effort into informing people about what is a balanced diet, and the need to balance diet with exercise, perhaps that would help.

<a name="40114-11_para31"></a>I come back to the £3.6 billion that it costs the National Health Service annually. It would clearly be worth our while to spend 1 per cent of that each year&#151;£36 million a year&#151;on positive advertising. I think that it would be worth spending 10 per cent&#151;£360 million a year&#151;on positive advertising from the other side. By spending £360 million, we could save perhaps not the whole of the £3.6 billion, but quite a lot of it in time. It is important to make the Government recognise that. We know from the drink-driving campaign that such campaigns must be long term and that the message must be repeated again and again to get it through.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para32"></a>What other suggestions can I make from the positive side? I am impressed that what I used to call a cookery class became home economics and is now called food technology. In classes on food technology, I understand that a great deal is taught on nutrition and dietetics to our 13 and 14-year-olds, most of whom regard it as being incredibly boring. The right time to get to people is when they are pregnant or have young children because that is when they want to know what to do. That is when we should be running classes about what is good or bad for us.
<P>

<a name="40114-11_para33"></a>What do the kids cook in class? I was rather shocked to discover from a friend that her daughter who was having cookery classes at school cooked baked beans on toast.

<P>

<a name="40114-12_para0"></a>My friend's daughter also learnt how to cook popcorn. She was reprimanded for bringing in real apples to bake an apple pie instead of a tin of pureed apples. We could do rather more in cookery classes and teach how to cook from scratch, as the Americans say.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para1"></a>We in Britain watch more television than people in most other countries of the world. The weather has something to do with that. But many kids are bored by adult TV. We need to provide alternative activities for some of our bored children. Youth clubs, and groups of scouts and guides are all old-fashioned and have gone down the spout. When such facilities are provided, they are attended. Our schools should be open every day until 10.30 in the evening. The kids should be able to use the computers because many of them do not have computers at home. There should be sporting activities so that they can get the exercise that they need. That would be a relatively small step. The facilities are there, but keeping them open requires the will to do so. Kids clubs and organisations such as Kidscape are emerging, but we need far more of them.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para2"></a>We should not rush into being a nanny state. This is a cultural question. I do not want our society to go down the American route of blame and litigation. However, positive steps can be taken to counter the culture that has emerged to try to push it in a different direction. I want the Government to take the lead in such positive steps.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-12_spnew2"></A><B> Earl Attlee: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, for introducing this important debate today. The Motion calls attention to the case for limiting the effects of marketing aimed directly at children. We all agree that children require a degree of protection, but views differ as to the extent to which they should be shielded from advertising, marketing and promotional offers.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para3"></a>I fear that I may be a little on my own in this debate, with the notable exceptions of the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane, and, possibly, the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. However, it will be interesting to hear the Minister.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para4"></a>Advertising and marketing are a feature of a free market economy where the consumer is king and where products and services compete to inform the consumer of their existence, and their benefits in contrast to other brands. In today's free market democracy, children and adults are surrounded by commercial messages. The codes governing advertising and marketing in both the broadcast media and the press have specific rules to take account of children's inexperience and credulity. Those codes are essential, and are supported by the public and industry. They are regularly reviewed to ensure that they are kept up to date with technological developments and changes in advertising and marketing practices.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para5"></a>As we have heard, some countries, such as Sweden, do not allow advertising on television to children under 12. However, it is impossible to cocoon children from the commercial world in which we live. Shielding them from a part of those commercial messages will not work. We must also not forget that advertising helps to fund the free press, TV and radio broadcasting, and it can also provide funding and resources when they would otherwise not be available&#151;for sporting events or for schools, for example.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para6"></a>A much better solution is to teach children about the role of advertising and marketing practices, so that they learn about the intent and purposes of commercial messages and how to use them effectively. Educating children to understand the role of marketing is essential to the development of their ability to make critical comparisons and informed decisions, especially later in life. When they become adults, managing far greater financial resources, they will come under even greater pressure. The consequences of believing the contents of every advert offering a financial product could be devastating.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para7"></a>Advertising slots around children's television programmes is currently an issue of some debate. Some argue that advertising should not be allowed around children's TV programmes because children are particularly vulnerable and open to influence. However, there is research which suggests that children understand the difference between advertising and programmes from a very early age and that they grasp the commercial intent of advertising from around five years old. Personally, I am not entirely convinced, and neither are many of your Lordships.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para8"></a>The Food Standards Agency has recently published an analysis by Strathclyde University which concludes that advertising has a significant effect on what children want to eat or drink. But other research concludes that other factors, such as parents and siblings, have a much stronger influence on children than advertising.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para9"></a>Many noble Lords have referred to the problem of carbonated sugar-laden drinks. It is a problem not easily solved by regulation, but I think there is a lot to be said for all schools providing a cold water drinks machine next to a fizzy drinks machine, if the school must have a fizzy drinks machine at all.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para10"></a>The noble Lords, Lord Rea and Lord Gordon of Strathblane, talked about the requirement for exercise. For a variety of reasons, our children do not walk very far. They do not even spend much time outside in fresh air. Not only does this cause overweight and obesity, it may also explain why we are seeing more respiratory illnesses in children. They simply spend too much time indoors, so are exposed to the perils so ably identified by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe&#151;a double whammy if ever there were one.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para11"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, talked about the work of the Food Standards Agency. We are lucky indeed to have the benefit of her experience in your Lordships' House. I think there is a problem of educating parents, but the parents most needing it may be the most difficult to contact, let alone influence. How depressing it is for me to see a mother going for a takeaway to feed her family. The noble Lord, Lord Chan, covered this point in detail.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para12"></a>No doubt flexible working in order to support the 24-hour economy is having its impact on family feeding arrangements. This was a point well made by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para13"></a>The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans gave us a very strong moral perspective. He talked about the provision of TV sets to very young children. The noble Lord, Lord Chan, talked about access to TV and computers. He rightly said that both were seen as childcare tools.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para14"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, followed the moral line of the right reverend Prelate. He first asked: what are the responsibilities of parents? He then covered the need for parenting support. The noble Lord made a suggestion about what he called a Kitemark, the symbol of the BSI. But I rather think that parents and children also need to understand the merits of fruit compared with chocolate. This goes right back to the noble Lord's original point.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para15"></a>New primary legislation has been touched on by some noble Lords, notably a Private Member's Bill in another place proposed by Debra Shipley MP. I usually have an allergic reaction to any suggestion of further regulation.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para16"></a>We on these Benches are opposed to the outright banning of advertising and marketing to children. There are strict rules in place to regulate marketing specific to children. We will look at the result of Ofcom's investigation into the current codes, but we suspect that there may not be much room to make them any tougher.
<P>


<a name="column_619"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 619</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para17"></a>We oppose a ban on advertising for the following reasons. We believe that obesity in children is caused by a number of factors, including an increasingly sedentary lifestyle, parental influence and diet choices. We do not believe that a ban would have the effect that many campaigners claim. However, I am certain that obesity is a major problem. The Chief Medical Officer is rightly extremely concerned about the future impact on the cost to the NHS, a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth. When I put my defence and security hat on, I am worried about the size of the pool of youngsters who will be fit enough to join the Armed Forces, even after extensive training.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para18"></a>Countries such as Sweden have introduced such a ban and, as pointed out by noble Lords, have not seen any significant change in child obesity levels. Without complex regulations, a ban would prevent anyone advertising healthy food, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Chan. I think it is unfortunate that the quality of fresh fruit in the UK leaves a lot to be desired.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para19"></a>It is impossible effectively to define children's television and adult television. For example, "The Simpsons", "Hollyoaks" and "EastEnders"&#151;I am not quite sure what these programmes are&#151;would all be outside a ban on advertising in children's TV time, which is between 3.30 and 5.30 p.m., but all have a very significant children's audience. A ban would have a significant impact on the ability of broadcasters that rely on advertising revenue to offer children's programmes, a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Gordon of Strathblane. Unlike cigarettes, which are harmful even in moderation, we do not believe that food can be so easily classified.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para20"></a>I look forward to the Minister's response to this fascinating debate.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-12_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the whole House is grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, for introducing a debate that has been wide-ranging and most thought-provoking. It has covered some very interesting ground, from the narrowest of concerns about consumer behaviour to the real morality of the nature of society that we participate in and whether such consuming activity meets all the needs of our citizens. I hope I am able to join those who brought a perspective to our debate which looks at this issue from a moral standpoint.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para21"></a>I pay due respect to the strong arguments that we need to recognise the nature of the problems which are provided by a young population&#151;youngsters, in particular&#151;who take too little exercise and are subject overmuch to the influence of television and other media through the computer. At the same time, I am afraid that I also agree with a great deal of what my noble friend Lord Gordon said; namely, that we should not look upon advertising as the all-powerful mechanism by which all tastes and consumption patterns are determined in our society, and that a <P>


<a name="column_620"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 620</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>simple ban&#151;not, I hasten to add, that any ban would be simple&#151;would not be readily effective in changing such patterns.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para22"></a>I also want to develop the point that the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, was keen to emphasise. It is not a question of our young people being subject to these influences, but the fact that they are there, static, and responsive to these influences. It may be necessary to pay due regard to their future health problems by seeking to ensure that we have the requisite sport and exercise opportunities, which impact upon a number of departments.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para23"></a>One point to which I am particularly responsive is that raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, when she asked whether I would give some indication of co-ordinated activity on these issues between departments. I hope that in the deployment of my arguments in my short contribution, I will give evidence of the fact that we recognise that these issues go across government departments. We need a perspective which recognises the contributions of a range of government agencies. I hope that I am able to convince the House that the Government are acting in crucial areas in this respect.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para24"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, indicated, this country is deservedly regarded as a centre of advertising excellence in terms of quality and observance of high standards and integrity. That is entirely due to the effectiveness of the UK regime for regulating advertising and ensuring compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of regulations and codes of practice.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para25"></a>Apart from statutory controls to protect consumers from misleading advertising, further independent controls are operated to ensure that advertisements are truthful, decent and honest and prepared with a due sense of responsibility to consumers and society. Both UK statutory and non-statutory controls are highly flexible and responsive. A single complaint will trigger action and there is no burden of proof on complainants.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para26"></a>The UK advertising community demonstrates its commitments to high standards by operating its own pre-clearance service&#151;a point the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, referred to in her opening remarks.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para27"></a>We should recognise that the advertising industry is regulated. Reference was made to the efforts of my honourable friend in another place who introduced a 10-minute rule Bill&#151;a Bill more for propaganda purposes than one likely to engage this House in a great deal of activity in the near future. But that Bill was extremely limited. It received considerable support, a recognition that our colleagues in the other place are also aware of the problems that have been rightly and accurately identified in our debate today. That Bill sought to ban the advertising of foods high in sugar, salt and fat during pre-school children's TV programmes. That is how limited its perspective was; that it was aimed at the most impressionable of young children.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para28"></a>I had some sympathy with that Bill. But part of the solution must surely be to give our young people the skills and abilities to identify the hard and the soft sell. That may come through greater support from parents <P>


<a name="column_621"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 621</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and the wisdom that they can impart through long years of wrestling with these issues. We must also bear in mind the aspects identified by the right reverend Prelate; that is, that we need to look at our children in a wider perspective than simply as consumers.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para29"></a>Schools are concerned to give breadth to young people from the perspective of the broader educational objectives in which this crucial issue of media literacy exists. They want to give children the ability to understand the nature of the messages being sent out through the extremely powerful media which television and computers represent. They want them to have a rounded perspective which will give them the potential to respond to these issues with judgment and an ability to handle the various messages thrown at them.
<P>

<a name="40114-12_para30"></a>The only comment I would make to the noble Lord, Lord Addington, who made a powerful speech on the dangers of the present pattern of consumption and the lack of exercise&#151;I appreciate he identified certain food substances as having rather more powerful impact than others&#151;is that there is a wide difference between foodstuffs and tobacco. We all know of the detrimental effects of tobacco.
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-13_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, the reason I mentioned tobacco was to emphasise the incompetent degree of lobbying that I received. I understand it is a different process. I simply say that there is an industry waiting to get in on the act. If we are not going to feed the lawyers, we must be ready for it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-13_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, I hear what the noble Lord says. I was commenting on the obvious fact that however damaging certain foods may be if taken in abundance&#151;we all know the detrimental health effects on people who have a poor diet&#151;they are in a different world to that of tobacco. Therefore the arguments which obtain with regard to the necessity and success of withdrawing tobacco advertising from the media do not obtain to foodstuffs which at times people seem to suggest.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para0"></a>On the more general issues, the question is how to encourage people to recognise that no one substance is detrimental; that the problem is achieving a balanced dietary approach. It is the educative aspects of our society that are important and ensuring that young people recognise that the over-consumption of certain foods is detrimental to their health. The Government can play a more significant role than simply placing restrictions on advertisements, as I indicated earlier, by improving media literacy; by being concerned that we educate our young people so that they have the perspective to make judgments about advertisements and the nature of selling that takes place in the media; but much more importantly, by addressing our minds to the fact that levels of participation in sport and exercise among young people are too low at the present time. They have been declining for a considerable time.
<P>


<a name="column_622"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-13_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Northbourne: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord for giving way and apologise for intervening. However, will he please draw his remarks to the attention of his colleague in the education department?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-13_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Davies of Oldham: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord pre-empts me a little. I was coming on to exactly that point. As a result of a representation of joined-up thinking we currently have an initiative in place which involves the Secretary of State for Education&#151;this must be a matter of great solace to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in the point he makes&#151;and the Secretary of State for Health to tackle obesity in young children. That means we need within our school framework greater opportunities for exercise than obtain at present and aspects of the school curriculum need attention in those terms.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para1"></a>I bear in mind also what the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, rightly identified. This involves not just the school curriculum but also the opportunities for participation beyond the normal school day. We are keen to see how far we can extend educational facilities in the post-school hours. The noble Baroness will recognise the considerable efforts made by school governors these days to make their facilities more available, not just for their own students, but also as part of the community facilities. We need to encourage that in every way we can. That is why the Government absolutely insist that if any proposal comes before us with regard to the reduction of playing field opportunities and space, it is to be compensated for in adequate sporting facilities that at least match those which are being withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para2"></a>It is a simple fact that we are able to promote exercise and sport much more effectively in modern facilities than we ever could in our school sports fields which spent some months every year under water and in any case could probably only take 22 players over a period of one and a half hours&#151;I speak as a sportsman who toiled away on many wet muddy playing fields and I have a great nostalgia for those days. With indoor facilities we can encourage participation at much greater levels than that.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para3"></a>That needs to be encouraged. It means that schools need to pay greater attention to the question of exercise for young people. To that end the Government are putting £1 billion into sport for young people over the next two years, including 3,000 more sports coaches, 15,000 more sports teachers and 2,000 new facilities.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para4"></a>We recognise that we need to look at the question of calories going in and the way in which calories can be burnt, and my noble friend Lord Rea was keen to emphasise this, although his specific illustration must have chilled almost everyone in this House. When he was talking about the chocolate bar, I thought that he was going to recommend to noble Lords that rather than taking the lift from the Ground Floor to the Principal Floor of the House we should walk up the stairs and burn off the requisite calories. When I discovered that he was talking about a building 600 feet high, I winced. But the evidence he gave was, of course, accurate. It is a lesson to <P>


<a name="column_623"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 623</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>us all that over-indulgence in certain foods is not easily remedied by casual exercise and a slight additional walk of 10 or 15 yards, or even 25 stairs or so. It requires a little more than that.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para5"></a>There is no doubt that we need to address the issue of food in schools. Clearly schools have an important role to play, as eating habits are formed early in life. That is why my right honourable friend in the other place, Charles Clarke, is working with the Secretary of State for Health, John Reid, to develop an action plan that will set out to make healthy living a crucial part of school life. The Department for Education and Skills joint Food in Schools programme with the Department of Health covers what children learn in the classroom and what they eat during the day. They learn about diet, hygiene, nutrition and the benefits of healthy eating, while our nutritional standards set out what school meals should include.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para6"></a>But for any of this to work, food manufacturers have to think about the role they play and how they promote their goods to children&#151;which, after all, is the burden of the introduction to the debate of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. As a nation we are rightly concerned about the growing issue of obesity. The Government are determined to take action but, to make a difference, we need food manufacturers and the advertising industry to work with us to ensure a healthier nation.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para7"></a>As my noble friend Lord Gordon indicated, it may be that we cannot lay at the door of the advertising industry the accusation that the success of its persuasive techniques has transformed the dietary patterns of the nation. That is not so. It is the case, however, that food manufacturers would not invest the amount of money that they do in advertising if it was not efficacious to some degree. We want them to play their part in being efficacious in ensuring that we get good messages over to young people. Otherwise, against that background, our society is storing up for itself significant health problems in the future if the levels of obesity continue to develop at their present rate.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para8"></a>The debate has focused overwhelmingly on young people, but let us not, from our rather more advanced and mature stage of life, exculpate ourselves from the situation. There have been one or two frank confessions today that we ourselves are not always mindful of good dietary practice. We all succumb from time to time to the lure of products that do not provide healthy eating but which are hugely delightful to partake of. We all recognise that it is not only children who are becoming more obese. As we broadcast our opinions to the nation with a view to ensuring that there is some degree of response, we should be aware of the lessons that they imply for ourselves. I say nothing against the excellent catering facilities of the House in making such remarks. Far from it. It may be because of their success that over-indulgence takes place from time to time.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para9"></a>I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that we are concerned to improve the quality of media literacy within the framework of the school. We intend <P>


<a name="column_624"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 624</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to ensure that children are better equipped to meet the challenges of the modern world in that respect. We also recognise that parents need support in these terms.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para10"></a>The noble Lord brings to the debate his obvious commitment to the fact that the family is still by far the most important cultural unit in our society in determining perspectives and attitudes. In this respect, we need look not only at the child but also at the home background from which it comes.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para11"></a>As noble Lords have indicated, sometimes the issue of poor diet is crucially related to a poverty of resources. It is a simple fact that better and more nutritional foodstuffs often are more expensive. That is why we need to look at the issue of poverty in our society and that is why the Government take pride in the fact that we have a programme for an effective challenge to the issue of child poverty. It is to be hoped that we have the basis for improving the diet of young people living under more deprived circumstances.

<a name="40114-13_para12"></a>As I mentioned initially, this country is deservedly regarded as a centre of advertising excellence in terms of quality and the observance of high standards of integrity. It has strict controls over advertising to children. Any further restrictions therefore need to be considered very carefully indeed.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para13"></a>The Food Standard Agency's commissioned review of research into the effects of food promotion has clearly initiated a wide-ranging discussion on the appropriate way forward. It is consulting on the issues and options and we look forward to considering the results in due course. Through this work&#151;the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, produced direct evidence of this&#151;we are able to identify the crucial challenge presented by obesity among young people in our society. It is a challenge to which we need to respond across a range of government departments.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para14"></a>The debate today has taken forward these issues in a substantial way. I hope that I have indicated in response that a number of government departments have recognised the priority of these issues and are committed to pursuing strategies to help tackle them.

It has been an extremely wide-ranging and interesting debate in which a great many expert suggestions as to the way forward were made. We are not yet on the road towards new legislation but the precautionary principle is definitely out there and needs to be noted.
<P>

<a name="40114-13_para15"></a>For me, the most important thing to come out of the debate was a recognition of the need to involve parents. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has been a champion in this area for many years. He is right on every occasion to involve a partnership with parents. In the same way, a partnership between government departments and a partnership with the food industry is also crucial.

<A NAME="40114-14_spnew0"></A><B> Lord St John of Bletso </B>   rose to call attention to the measures which Her Majesty's Government are taking to promote affordable Internet broadband access throughout the United Kingdom; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am delighted to have this opportunity today to bring to your Lordships' attention and to debate this topical and extremely important issue. There is no doubt that broadband access has the potential to provide major, far-reaching benefits to every echelon of our population, as well as to business, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. I am extremely grateful to all noble Lords who at such short notice have put down their names to speak in this debate.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para1"></a>At the outset, I declare several interests. I was, until last year, the managing director of a large international ISP, providing Internet access to the corporate market. I am the chairman of the trustees of a UK charity, Citizens Online, which is an independent national charity committed to the objective of digital inclusion, universal access to the Internet, whether through narrow band or broadband, which partners with a number of leading UK companies and local government. This charity has for several years run projects throughout the country that demonstrate how digital inclusion can make a real and significant difference to disadvantaged communities.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para2"></a>I was keen to raise this debate in your Lordships' House for three principal reasons. First, I wanted to recognise the achievements of both government and commercial, non-government organisations in extending the reach and take-up of broadband services already secured. In the same vein, I wanted to identify what I perceive as the major obstacles and challenges we face in order to extend the take-up of broadband over the next few months and years. Secondly, important as it is to discuss reach and take-up, I feel it is important that we help raise awareness of the many benefits of broadband services to both the public and the private sector. There still appears to be an enormous amount of naivety about the exact definition of broadband, high speed Internet access. Finally, as is stated in the wording of the Motion, I wanted to identify what existing and additional <P>


<a name="column_626"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 626</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>measures, both financial and logistic, Her Majesty's Government are taking specifically to promote affordable broadband access in all parts of the country, not simply in the major cities but also in the rural areas.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para3"></a>At the outset, BT is to be commended for extending the reach of broadband services to cover, according to its most recent figures, 89 per cent of homes and businesses in the United Kingdom. There is no doubt, however, that to get from 89 per cent to 100 per cent coverage industry, government, regional development agencies, local councils and others will all need to join together in partnership and to adopt and to pursue a wide range of innovative strategies. Here I refer to the advances in satellite technology and wireless technologies.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para4"></a>What alarms me is that, despite this high availability, this reach of 89 per cent, less than 10 per cent of the population has so far adopted broadband. While there continues to be a drive for 100 per cent broadband availability, and for a solution for the rural broadband issue, the key question is what will drive the take-up that will deliver the broadband revolution.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para5"></a>Clearly, the joint challenge to industry and to the Government, including the regulators&#151;here I refer to Ofcom&#151;is to rectify this situation quickly and to optimise broadband's contribution to the UK economy. I was staggered by some statistics that I received this afternoon from the Centre for Economic and Business Research that claim that if business fully embraces broadband now, the benefits to the UK economy by 2007 could be an additional £13 billion. That is a substantial contribution.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para6"></a>The poor take-up can partly be explained by a lack of appreciation of broadband services, rather than narrowband services, but the key barrier to mass-market adoption is price. Here I am referring not just to the monthly fees for broadband but also to set-up and migration fees, which are not very competitive with the rest of Europe. The average retail price for the standard consumer 512 kilobits per second broadband service is between £27 and £30 per month, which remains relatively high. It is fairly competitive with the rest of Europe, but it is comparatively high and can fall.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para7"></a>Prices have been falling, but one way of reducing prices further would be to introduce more competition in the wholesale broadband market, which BT currently controls and has the lion's share. The move from British Telecom's IPStream only to the increasing availability of DataStream this year&#151;I must apologise for technicalities, as I am sure that not many of your Lordships are that up to speed about DataStream and IPStream&#151;should also provide greater competition in the broadband wholesale market. Wholesale competition, and particularly DataStream, will drive innovation and therefore lead to more competitive broadband products.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para8"></a>BT currently charges ISPs a £50 set-up fee in addition to the monthly fees for broadband. Invariably, the ISPs swallow them, but effectively they pass on these fees to their customers in the form of inflated monthly fees. In contrast, comparing this to the rest of Europe, in Italy Telecom Italia has no levies for set-up and in Germany <P>


<a name="column_627"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 627</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Deutsche Telekom even pays the ISPs 40 euros for every new broadband customer. If BT could reduce its set-up fees, it seems likely that the take-up of broadband services would be accelerated.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para9"></a>Moving on to the challenge of making the wider UK population aware of the benefits of broadband, I commend the work being done by the Office of the e-Envoy, particularly its UK online annual report, which was recently published. The Broadband Stakeholder Group has also made major strides in promoting the take-up of broadband services and I understand that it will soon be publishing a comprehensive report to this end. I was also encouraged by the work of the regional development agencies in both improving the availability of broadband in their regions and promoting the awareness of its benefits to both the public and business. Have Her Majesty's Government any plans to increase the UK Broadband Fund, which is currently around £30 million, to promote more affordable access in rural areas?
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para10"></a>The Prime Minister has pledged that all schools will be connected to broadband by 2006. Can the Minister provide an indication of what percentage of schools&#151;primary schools and secondary schools&#151;currently have 2MG broadband connections? Some schools are already exploring how they may, with their 2MG ADSL connections, become local Internet service providers, even using wi-fi. Broadband can and should play a major part in e-learning, particularly in those parts of the United Kingdom where there is a shortage of teachers and schools. There is a raft of commendable e-learning initiatives, which can come to fruition and maturity only when there is a greater take-up of broadband access&#151;not just access but take-up&#151;across the UK. Also, e-learning is not just about children. It is about lifelong education and has huge benefits for the elderly.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para11"></a>Of course, broadband is not just about ADSL. Other technologies, such as cable modems, wireless and satellite, all have the potential to provide fast and sophisticated access to the Internet and its services. Will the Minister elaborate on what measures Her Majesty's Government are taking to promote wi-fi wireless across the UK? I appreciate that in many parts of the UK it is not economic for the commercial telephone companies to upgrade their telephone exchanges to broadband. The cost is in the region of £250,000 per exchange. What scope is there for government to assist in that endeavour of local loop-unbundling?
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para12"></a>My next point relates to the specific measures that Her Majesty's Government are taking to promote affordable broadband. We are all aware of the substantial sums that the Government received from the sale of the 3G licences only a few years ago, which almost crippled many of the telcos. It is to be hoped that more government funds will be pledged to the rollout of affordable broadband services, particularly in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para13"></a>I understand that the Government intend to spend £1 billion on broadband connectivity for the public sector between 2003 and 2006. Will the Minister <P>


<a name="column_628"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 628</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>elaborate on the workings of the broadband aggregation project, and explain what assistance is likely to be given to the private sector? Will he also tell us how that will benefit those members of society who are currently digitally excluded? I was interested in the report of the UK Broadband Task Force, Public Sector Funding for Broadband, which examined the application of broadband by the public sector and outlined details of the broadband aggregation project's objective of seeking to aggregate public sector demand for broadband at both regional and national level.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para14"></a>The multi-faceted nature of the digital divide has been extensively discussed and debated, along with the motivations for tackling it as an urgent social inclusion issue. One area where the Government could help would be to extend the home computing initiative, which currently enables employers to lend PCs and peripheral PC equipment to their employees to increase household penetration rates. That tax-efficient scheme for households to acquire PCs does not currently include any tax breaks for broadband connectivity. Will the Government consider extending the home computing initiative to include broadband connectivity?
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para15"></a>It is furthermore crucial that the Government create a joined-up strategy for digital inclusion by creating a well resourced digital inclusion unit. That unit should support the co-ordinated working of all the initiatives, programmes and pilots relevant to the issue, such as e-learning, skills for life, community regeneration and other social inclusion activities.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para16"></a>Although there are encouraging developments in the promotion of broadband throughout the UK, it seems highly unlikely that our Government will meet their declared target for the UK to be the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G8 by 2005. Will the Minister give us some indication of where we are today in terms of broadband adoption in the UK, in relation to the pricing of the other G7 countries as opposed to supply broadband coverage?
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para17"></a>It is true that the take-up of broadband services in the rest of Europe, like the UK, is relatively low, but for UK plc to benefit from the many economic advantages that broadband can bring to the UK economy, all steps must be taken to promote the take-up of broadband throughout the United Kingdom now. I have no doubt about the commitment of the Government but, as ever, actions will speak louder than words. I beg to move for Papers.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-14_spnew1"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord St. John of Bletso, on securing this important and timely debate. On 16 December last year, Oftel released its second consultation on the wholesale broadband access market review. Once Ofcom assumed its powers on 29 December, it formally endorsed the draft decisions outlined in the review.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para18"></a>As the Government's 2005 targets loom, the review makes for worrying reading. Its essential message states the obvious. First, British Telecom has significant <P>


<a name="column_629"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 629</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>market power&#151;SMP&#151;within the sector. In turn, that encourages a supposition that the wholesale broadband access market is not effectively competitive. Secondly, current technological access alternatives to ADSL, such as satellite, wireless or cable, are not in a position to provide any competitive restraint on BT. Thirdly, that situation is not likely to change in the foreseeable future.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para19"></a>That unnerving state of affairs is echoed by the comments of industry insiders. John Pluthero, whom I think is chief executive officer of Centrica, has said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The market review says nothing new&#151;as ever it's jam tomorrow. Four years on there is still no broadband revolution&#151;instead we have one supplier, one product and one price. Tomorrow never comes&#151;the broadband revolution is on hold until further notice".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para20"></a>
Eric Abensur, CEO of Freeserve, has said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Without real competition to stimulate a major growth in demand, the Government's target of being the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G7 by 2005 is wide of the mark".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para21"></a>
That echoes the noble Lord's point. Inevitably, all that begs the question of what should be done to invigorate competition in the sector, and thereby not only make real progress towards the Government's 2005 targets, but increase affordability and widen consumer choice.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para22"></a>The review is as good a place to start as any. It seems nonsense that, having concluded that there is no effective competition in the sector, the regulator should determine that the status quo&#151;the existing retail-minus pricing methodology&#151;should be retained. As a spokesman for the Broadband Industry Group observed:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The regulators have missed the opportunity to introduce cost plus pricing which would increase competition in the market and lower broadband prices for consumers. As a group, we are frustrated, but remain determined to secure a fair outcome for both consumers and business. We will continue to campaign for 'cost-plus' pricing and greater competition in the UK broadband market".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para23"></a>
There is a widely held view that the move to cost-plus pricing, as a means to achieve appropriate price reductions in broadband product and stimulate real competition, is long overdue. Accordingly, I very much hope that both the regulator and the Government have such a move firmly in their sights. Indeed, I invite it.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para24"></a>The Minister will be aware that, via the medium of Questions for Written Answer, I have been pursuing other aspects of the pricing structure for wholesale broadband. In particular, I have asked about activation fees, but also migration fees, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord St John, and other aspects of the issue. To quote directly from one of the Minister's Answers to me, I note his premise that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The broadband market must necessarily be market driven".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para25"></a>
Moreover, it is essentially accurate to say that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Competition is fostering innovative pricing&#151;such as the free activation offer".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para26"></a><P>

<a name="40114-14_para27"></a>Indeed, it would be churlish not to admit that, since the start of 2002, progress has been made in reducing retail prices for broadband. However, at the same time we have to be mindful that, as the review makes plain, it is happening within the context of BT's SMP status. In terms, BT has a considerable and, in current <P>


<a name="column_630"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 630</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances, unassailable edge over its competitors. I cannot help feeling that some redress in respect of the activation-fee issue&#151;perhaps even the migration-fee issue&#151;would assist. Indeed, I draw some comfort from the Minister's statement that:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The independent regulator Ofcom, has the power to intervene if they feel prices are being maintained artificially high".&#151;[Official Report, 5/1/04; col. WA 26.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para28"></a>
To that extent I hope that, as Ofcom conducts its imminent strategic review of the whole UK telecommunications sector, it will take a very close look at that sort of issue. Moreover, I trust that the Minister will offer the Government's twopennyworth on the matter.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para29"></a>It could be argued that broadband is languishing in a chicken and egg situation&#151;and has been for a number of years. Undoubtedly getting its pricing structure right would act as an important driver for take-up. But it is a moot point that that can be achieved all the time that the market is not effectively competitive. Moves to create an appropriate pricing structure are inevitably subject to the prevailing lack of competition, rather than being geared towards achieving a natural level as a matter of course. So, while I do not dissent from the proposition that broadband product should be market-driven, I also believe there is a strong case for more proactive involvement in competition issues in the sector, if not directly from the Government, certainly from Ofcom, more probably both. Altroconsumo, the Italian equivalent of the Consumers' Association, has said that it is:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"convinced that, in particular at this initial stage, a good structuring and functioning of a competitive market in broadband has to be deemed more important than the possibility to have lower prices for the moment."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para30"></a>
I admit that something there may have been lost in translation, but I am bound to say that I have some sympathy for that view.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para31"></a>Of course pricing&#151;that is, affordability&#151;is a significant barrier to take-up of broadband services by the consumer. In the context of workable technological solutions, that is particularly the case in respect of the growing digital divide between urban and rural areas. As an aside and to put flesh on some of the observations of the noble Lord, Lord St John, it is worth bearing in mind that a number of other barriers, based on the age of the potential users, their level of income and, indeed, their motivation, are also important. In other words, we should not lose sight of the fact that it would be erroneous to assume that the establishment of a fully competitive market would, necessarily and as a matter of course, give rise to universal broadband access.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para32"></a>Moreover, in assessing the Government's and the market's progress towards,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"affordable internet broadband access throughout the United Kingdom",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para33"></a>
it is important to draw the distinction between availability and take-up&#151;a point well made by the noble Lord, Lord St John. I have a constant battle trying to decipher and interpret the statistics. It is accurate to say that, as of 12 January this year, <P>


<a name="column_631"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 631</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>2,146 of BT's UK exchanges out of a total, as I understand it, of 5,500&#151;that is, significantly less than half&#151;had been ADSL-enabled, covering 85 per cent of UK households. In addition BT has set trigger levels for a number of remaining exchanges which, if activated, would cover 99 per cent of households.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para34"></a>On the face of it, the prospect of 99 per cent coverage is marvellous; and yet the statistic is illusory, if not deceptive. In the first place, to state the obvious, coverage is not the same as take-up. The figure also has to be seen within the context of the digital divide. The vast majority of urban areas have full accessibility to broadband, whereas in rural areas, where demand for broadband product is much stronger, accessibility levels, according to anecdotal evidence, are running at only 30 per cent. The resolution of that imbalance should be an urgent priority for both Ofcom and the Government.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para35"></a>In respect of the distinction to be drawn between coverage and take-up, I return to one of my hobby-horses, already mentioned by the noble Lord, St John. Your Lordships may recall that, for some time, I have been nagging away at the issue of what constitutes a proper definition of broadband. The simple fact is that the Government's figures for take-up include connections operating at 128kbps; that is, data transfer speeds operating at approximately double a standard dial-up connection. Yet most people, even the regulator itself, regard "true" broadband as services offering data transfer speeds in excess of 500kbps. That is important for a variety of reasons. First, it is extraordinarily difficult to know how reliable the statistics are. For example, as the Minister will be aware as a result of some of my Questions for Written Answer, the World Economic Forum's global information technology report placed the UK eighth in the rankings in terms of competition in the ISP market and 67th the affordability of Internet access. As the Minister stated in his Answer to me:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the findings . . .  appear to be very much at odds with those of the more regular and focused Oftel benchmarking".&#151;[Official Report, 5/1/04; col. WA25.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para36"></a><P>

<a name="40114-14_para37"></a>I will say! My supposition is that the discrepancy arises at least in part because of different interpretations as to what constitutes broadband&#151;case of apples and pears. But the important point remains; namely, that, on measures of what most people would define as true broadband, UK performance is not as glorious as is implied by the statistics that we generally use.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para38"></a>There is another important point. Quite rightly, the Government perceive broadband to be a hugely important driver of both public service reform as well as a mechanism to:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"facilitate the next phase of e-commerce".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para39"></a>
The investment of funds, as with for example the NHS national IT plan, is massive and, so far as I can tell, at the heart of the thinking underpinning the policy is a recognised requirement to transfer very large data files, such as X-rays and so on, via the Internet.
<P>


<a name="column_632"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 632</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para40"></a>The problem is that data transfer speeds of anything less than 500kbps would not necessarily constitute the necessary step change from existing dial-up connections. They could even prove to be counter-productive, if not short-sighted, in the sense that users would be placed in a position where the benefits of true high-speed data transfer would not be readily apparent. In effect, using 128kbps as a bare minimum of broadband definition imposes an artificial constraint on the proper development and deployment of "true" broadband. To be fair, I have it in mind that the Government, in rolling out broadband to the education sector, are insisting on a bare minimum of 2mbps. That is all good and well. None the less, it contrasts starkly with the concurrent insistence that 128kbps is adequate for broadband in other situations.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para41"></a>I would not like the Minister, to imagine that I have been unduly critical. There are encouraging elements in some of their approaches to broadband. I am aware of recent developments such as Ofcom's decision to open up the 5.8 gigahertz band to wireless service providers. That should facilitate the deployment of broadband, particularly in rural areas. As the Minister, Stephen Timms, has said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"there will be cases where the market will not deliver and targeted support may well be needed. Where the lack of broadband availability is a limiting factor in economic regeneration, that can be a justification for using existing funds for regional economic development".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para42"></a>
That is a very welcome policy stance, albeit its virtue is dependent upon appropriate action being taken. Happily, like the noble Lord, Lord St John, I can extol the merits of the DTI's broadband aggregation project as a potential means of filling some of the gaps in broadband availability. Indeed, in that context, I have been very impressed by the Anglesey Connected programme and the imaginative way in which it has been used to extend the reach of broadband and the potential use of "piggy-backing" in that part of Wales. The key point is that, as BT has observed, the Government have to be seen to be utilising broadband capabilities, if at all possible in partnership with local communities and the private sector, in their own delivery of services. That would do a great deal to unlock both availability and take-up.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para43"></a>In conclusion, it is inevitable that we measure broadband against the Government's stated targets. The year 2005 is not that far away and I have growing doubts that the UK will be the most competitive and most extensive broadband market in the G7, or that all government services will be online by that deadline. Certainly, both the Government and Ofcom have their work cut out if they are to deliver. Be that as it may and as I hope I have made plain, there is much both of them could be doing if they had the will to bring achievement of the targets closer. I very much hope they will grasp the nettle and push the broadband agenda forwards.

<a name="40114-14_para44"></a>It is true that broadband has been a success story in bringing about a step-change in technological advancement in communications. From an initially slow start, the United Kingdom has made tremendous strides in catching up. BT broadband now covers 80 per cent of the country and within Europe the UK network is second only to Germany.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para45"></a>However, that is so only because of the UK's relative urban predominance. In order to ensure that the enabling of exchanges is cost-effective, BT has introduced a pre-registration system which allows it to register the level of interest in broadband in a particular locality. Trigger levels are set for each exchange, which means that there must be a certain number of requests for broadband before an exchange can be enabled. If the trigger level is not reached, BT will not enable the exchange. That means that businesses which clearly need broadband will have to consider a more expensive option because either the trigger level cannot be reached or no trigger level has been set.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para46"></a>In evidence to the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee inquiry in the other place in July 2003 into rural broadband, the CLA called for all exchanges to have trigger levels set. This was adopted by the Select Committee in its first recommendation of the report.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para47"></a>Of the 5,500 total exchanges, some 3,200 are located in rural areas. BT has set trigger levels for more than 2,600 exchanges and has said that in November it will set levels for a further 2,300. That means that 80 per cent of rural exchanges will have trigger levels set and take the UK to some 90 per cent coverage.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para48"></a>There are three key areas in which broadband is essential to the economic prosperity in rural Britain: food and farming; rural business; and the rural communities. Twenty-five per cent of unemployment is in rural areas. Agriculture remains in a perilous state. Figures from Defra illustrate this with more than 5,000 jobs lost during the past 12 months, despite the increase in incomes. The rural economy needs to diversify away from its dependence on farming and tourism. Access to broadband is key to the economic development of rural areas and it is essential to avoid an urban/rural divide over broadband access as the activities of small businesses can be transformed by this advancement. Rural areas need to become part of any technological framework to help them to adapt to change. Lack of access to broadband is not a sacrifice that can be made.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para49"></a>Although the take-up of broadband has been some 10 to 12 per cent in urban areas, the likelihood is that this uptake will be some 25 to 30 per cent in rural areas. The real barrier of high cost in rural areas has to be overcome. Some of the constraints are technological in that the remote areas are physically outside the six kilometre radius to be linked on ADSL. I understand that some 13 per cent of businesses are outside this six kilometre <P>


<a name="column_634"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 634</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>radius. Realistically for the last 10 per cent, the choice is between additional public funds&#151;for example, from regional development agencies&#151;to extend BT's reach, or for waiting for new entrants to meet what demand there is&#151;for example, lease lines and satellite. However, these have technological disadvantages.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para50"></a>BT has no intention of rolling out ADSL to all rural areas. It is unhelpful to raise the hopes of rural businesses in areas where there is no intention of enabling exchanges to provide ADSL, or where the reaching of trigger levels is so far off as to be impossible to establish any certainty. This means that rural businesses are not able to take sensible commercial decisions.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para51"></a>Given the Government's commitment to have broadband connections to every school and doctor's surgery by 2006, and that many of these are outside the six kilometre radius, can the Minister confirm how this will be achieved? To borrow the analogy of North Sea gas, we were all promised that we would be linked up to a cheaper national grid. Well, several areas, including my own in south Cheshire, are still waiting. Can the Minister confirm the commitment and confirm the money the e-commerce Minister in the other place has committed&#151;some £1 billion for broadband connection&#151;and that this will be sufficient?
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para52"></a>What happens where a village school is too far away from an exchange to benefit from affordable broadband? If a school is in an area where broadband is not commercially viable, will the Government install a private line to the school? Despite the Government's willingness to allow piggy-backing, I understand that cannot be done on a dedicated line. In effect, the Government will be putting in place a private network for a public-sector body which will not allow private business access, thereby denying access to affordable broadband.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para53"></a>According to BT, more than 70 per cent of the population in the north-west has access to broadband, covering some 800 schools and more than 250 libraries. In Cheshire, the area was given a recent boost with £3.7 million from the North West Development Agency. This was to assist up to 350 small and medium-sized enterprises with broadband access and a further 2,750 businesses with broadband advice. This funding will also help to extend the availability of broadband across rural parts of Cheshire, as well as to provide two mobile broadband demonstration units. I can report that in Cheshire, of 470 exchanges 228 have been enabled, with 132 having had trigger levels set. But as many as 23 will not have trigger levels set. My own exchange of Audlem is on the verge of being enabled, having attained 283 requests towards a trigger level of 300.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para54"></a>On the role that the Government can play in the roll-out of broadband, it is recognised that they are also a big customer because of the IT demands of the public services. The CLA has called for rural businesses to be able to piggy-back on the public broadband infrastructure in order to reduce the costs of purchasing backhaul&#151;that is, broadband capacity. Under the Government's public aggregation project, regional aggregation bodies have been set up and located in each <P>


<a name="column_635"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 635</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of the nine English regions to bring about public sector demand for broadband. I understand that the Government will purchase backhaul to an exchange where this is feasible to provide broadband for the public sector. Can the Minister confirm that enough will be purchased at a significantly reduced rate to make piggy-backing economically viable? Can he also confirm that state-aid regulation does not apply to this purchase?
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para55"></a>I understand that the CLA has been informed by the DTI that the East Midlands Regional Development Agency will be used as a pathfinder for other RDAs and RABs. I also understand that one plan under discussion is the creation of a small exchange set-up in the black holes that exist beyond the six kilometre radius. Will the Minister comment on that, as it seems an ingenious answer to bring broadband to all areas? Has EMDA's plan finally been agreed with government? Will RABs be permitted to act unilaterally rather than under an agreed uniform approach? Does this mean that the Government's projected timetable of broadband roll-out will now be met?
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para56"></a>These comments clearly suggest that there are still some significant problems. For many in the rural economy, the roll-out of affordable broadband is too slow. All types of broadband have their downsides. ADSL, for example, is unlikely to be available across the country as the economics do not make sense and satellite has disadvantages in terms of cost, adverse weather and latency. It remains essential that rural businesses know all the available options where broadband can made a difference. Farmers are now diversifying into other income areas such as online marketing, farm guides and trails as well as farm tourism and bed and breakfast. It is clear that rural business is unable to compete because of the failure to access broadband. Relocation is often not an option and development will take the by-pass, an example of rural exclusion. If rural business had access to affordable broadband it would speed up the whole value chain and allow rural businesses to exploit opportunities and help the market to work, re-connecting town and country, producers and consumers.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para57"></a>The community is the hub of the rural economy and it is at the heart of the countryside. Its vibrancy reflects the health of the rural economy. Your Lordships debated the setting up of community interest companies last week. These companies may well be the chosen vehicle to maintain rural shops in isolated villages and will look to the help which affordable broadband will bring them. The rural pub and post office can deliver other services via broadband thus increasing turnover for survival as well as providing a vital resource for the community. The very presence of broadband in the rural community can establish a gateway, a form of M25, where, once established, it will be very quickly used.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para58"></a>The Government must move quickly to offer all their services on-line, especially those directed at rural communities. This in turn will also stimulate demand and encourage take-up. Let us not miss this opportunity.
<P>

<A NAME="40114-14_spnew3"></A><B> The Earl of Erroll: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord St John of Bletso for giving us the opportunity to discuss this matter tonight. It is a very important subject because its scale has increased enormously over the past few years. In 2001, about 250,000 people were using broadband in the United Kingdom. Last year there were 3 million and the figure is growing. Although people seem to be worried about the take-up, we shall be facing very wide usage over the next few years. One needs it to do business in the modern world, and that is the bottom line. If one does not have high speed communications one cannot spread information or receive it rapidly enough to be effective. If it is too time-consuming one wastes a lot of time twiddling thumbs waiting for information to arrive over the communications link.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para59"></a>It has become not a like-to-have issue, but a must-have for business. Very often BT and various others who worry about take-up are trying to consider everyone having it. For them it is still a like-to-have. The reason for that is the expense in many cases. That is why the point made by my noble friend Lord St John of Bletso about cost is the key to the whole issue. People speak of social exclusion but there is economic exclusion. If people cannot afford it they will not take it up.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para60"></a>For many people the must-have is the mobile telephone, which is very expensive to run when compared to landline services in the past. There are many other priorities, possibly satellite television, which seems to be a great priority with my son who spends a lot of time watching sport. The priorities lie elsewhere. Broadband will come and people will put up with a lot of delay. When the pricing is right or people are making enough money, it will become the next must-have followed by the take-up, if it is available, which is the next matter to which one comes .
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para61"></a>As regards costs, from the point of view of small and medium size enterprises one must have costs which are within the reach of everyone. When a small business starts up it may comprise just one or two persons. Every cost matters because even if the new concern is financed by the Prince's Trust, for example, or anyone else, it is not dolled out huge amounts of money. The new concern does not want to go further into debt in order to have something that is a must-have for business.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para62"></a>It is interesting that the Traffic Management Bill may have some effect on this. That Bill is about digging up the highways. I am warned that we could end up with a situation where the highways authorities favour themselves. There are also problems of competition which could favour BT as it already has quite a significant infrastructure under the roads. We could prevent new people coming into the market because they do not receive permission or are charged far too much for laying their cable in order to provide the service to the end user. I shall return to traffic later.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para63"></a>Ultimately, the question is availability. My experience in trying to get ADSL so that I could join the parliamentary VPM and therefore gain access to the <P>


<a name="column_637"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 637</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>parliamentary system at home was very interesting. I dialled into BT to find out whether I could receive it on my home phone number. At first it could not be done, but then BT enabled the local exchange for ADSL and I was told that I was 6.5 kilometres away and could not receive the service. I am about 3.5 kilometres away as the crow flies so I raised an objection, particularly as I discovered that a house 100 yards could receive it through including its telephone number. BT said that I was definitely too far away. I asked the location exchange but they could not help me. The good news is that I now seem to have moved within the 6.5 kilometre distance and I shall be offered broadband after all. Whether the house or the exchange moved I am not sure.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para64"></a>That experience highlights some of the problems of joining the service. I was very reassured by the briefing paper for this debate which states that there are initiatives in progress that could bring ADSL to 99 per cent of the people. I suspect that a good deal of that is because of the highly successful partnerships it has at county level and with other council and local government organisations.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para65"></a>What worried me was the caveat "could". It could mean that if the initiatives are not progressed by other people it will not happen. There is the satellite system as well, but it has disadvantages. It is the answer for some people when no other service can be provided.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para66"></a>A paper was produced by the broadband stakeholders' group, which has been discussing these issues in great depth. One of the points it made was that wireless technology is probably going to have the biggest impact on extending coverage and in enhancing competition. There does not have to be a wire link. There is a huge future for that provision. But we must have regard for the small players. One particular company has just taken up 14 wireless licences. There are others who are very small players in the market who need to be encouraged. We need infrastructure competition in order for the system to work. That is one of the challenges for the future.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para67"></a>We speak about the current broadband and everyone is worried about joining it. But the type of broadband that we are talking about rolling out is not very fast. When one considers the potential contention rates on a 512 ADSL line, it could be that one is slowed up almost to the speeds of narrowband. There is going to be a demand for better service levels. With faster speeds people will need more band width. That will require public sector funding or one will have to offer private people a proper return on investment.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para68"></a>We do not need a repeat of the stand-off between the Government and BT. The Government said that we would all be enabled by 2005 and BT could see lots of money on the horizon. It said that it was too expensive and there was a stand-off while it was decided who would pay. That is why we have the terrible catch-up situation now. The role of Ofcom in this matter will be very important. I have noticed that it is already becoming over-tasked and I do not want to present it with another task. I flag up its role as important.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para69"></a>I have become interested in connecting with wireless. How does one find a connection? In that regard the partnerships have huge potential. The <P>


<a name="column_638"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 638</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>DTI's broadband aggregation project is a very good idea. The noble Lord, Lord Granchester, spoke about whether we could piggy-back on public service connections. I do not see why not. I believe that that should be a requirement. I hope that it will be very easy for the ordinary citizen to find out what is available, to benefit from it and to ride on the back of all the public money which is being put into connectivity for surgeries and schools.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para70"></a>We are also trying to get business going, because at the end of the day it is the small businesses which pay. Sometimes people in government forget that they are funded out of taxation. Businesses and their employees pay the taxes. Large companies are down-sizing and trying to become more efficient most of the time. Growth in the future is in the SMEs and the micro-businesses, the 3.8 million which employ 50 people or fewer. Over 2 million of them have five people or fewer. That is where future innovation and growth lies and those people need access to new technology in order to grow and become global. One can have a global business with one person. I have a business in America which I run via the Internet. One does not need to have a vast organisation. We must remember that those are the people who will be paying the tax that keeps us sitting here and keeps all those regulators and such people in jobs.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para71"></a>Finally, I turn to possibilities for the future, because it is nice to look forward positively. One great thing about broadband, because it is, or can be, an always-on connection, is the opportunity that it gives for peer-to-peer networking&#151;that should appeal to the House. There is grid computing. Oxford University presently has a grid project out searching for a cancer cure, because thousands of small computers out there can all add up to a massive amount of data analysis and number-crunching capability.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para72"></a>Someone estimated that 10 billion megahertz of processing power is sitting out there on the Internet for potential use. We need broadband to connect it up. We could use that for large projects for the greater public benefit at little cost. That could reduce research costs and other things.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para73"></a>There are environmental gains to be had from that. The Traffic Management Bill is aimed at reducing congestion. We can reduce congestion by using high-speed Internet links. When you are trying to discuss business, you need eyeball-to-eyeball contact with people. It is all very well just talking on the telephone, but eyeballing someone is useful. With high-speed connection, someone can appear to be sitting in front of you and you can have a conference remotely. Teleworking can reduce congestion&#151;I notice that the RAC and the teleworking group thought that it could cut commuter traffic by 10 per cent by 2005&#151;but we must have high-speed access for that.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para74"></a>That will also have an impact on planning policy, use of domestic property to run businesses, and all sorts of such things. Many policy issues involved need to be considered at some stage. However, equally, we do not want to slow the process by waiting for <P>


<a name="column_639"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 639</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>someone to produce a policy document on it; we just need to get on with it, so that people can build properly for the future.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para75"></a>My message is that if we are to be the country in the G7 best equipped to carry on e-enabled commerce by 2005, we need to encourage and envision that future now.
<P>

<P>
<A NAME="40114-14_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Chandos: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the initiative of the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, in raising the issue of broadband access and thank him for his excellent introduction to the debate. As the last speaker before the Front Benchers wind up the debate, I am struck that this 21st century subject has so far attracted as speakers only hereditary Peers&#151;whether elected or otherwise recycled, like myself.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para76"></a>Perhaps Tim Berners-Lee, the progenitor of the Internet who was so deservedly awarded a knighthood in the New Year's Honours List, already secretly enjoyed a far older title as the 18th Earl of Broadband. Vice-President Al Gore was unsuccessful in persuading the world that he was the inventor of the Internet. Perhaps we should take another tack and claim the true inventor of the Internet as a long-standing hereditary parliamentarian and politician.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para77"></a>I declare an interest, as disclosed in the Register of Members' Interests, as a director of several companies whose primary business relates to the Internet. A few years ago, the remarkable Dr Andy Grove, chairman of the Intel semi-conductor group, said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Soon we won't talk about investing in internet companies; we will just invest in companies, almost all of which will rely to some extent or another on the internet for their operations".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para78"></a>
That was an unerringly accurate prediction, so in declaring my interest, I feel that I am in the same position as almost every businessman&#151;even every consumer. Even someone who does not themselves use a home computer or the Internet will benefit indirectly from the rapid deployment and take-up of broadband connections, whether through improved deliveries to their local shop or enhanced access to information, data and records by their local hospital, as the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, described.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para79"></a>Other noble Lords have already comprehensively spelt out why broadband connections and the resulting fast Internet services are so desirable both socially and economically. They can improve the service and simultaneously lower the cost compared to narrowband and provide far richer content for consumers in education and business. Home shopping is not just a convenience for busy professionals or a boon to the collectors of the obscure but can be a Godsend to the disabled.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para80"></a>The Motion concerns the Government's measures to promote affordable Internet broadband access. Earlier speakers have fully covered that&#151;in particular the needs of rural and more remote areas. I shall therefore briefly consider the issue from a slightly different perspective&#151;both a broader view of broadband, as it does not concern only the Internet; and the provision of broadband <P>


<a name="column_640"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 640</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>infrastructure from a macro-market point of view rather than from that of the regional and rural challenges on which the previous two speakers, in particular, concentrated. Clearly, in theory, the stronger the overall market, the more it should encourage networks and service providers to cover areas that they might otherwise deem to be uneconomic; and the less, therefore, the initiatives that we have discussed may be needed.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para81"></a>In reality, I have no doubt that we need all the help we can get to create broadband Britain as quickly as possible&#151;both strong regional and rural initiatives and a powerful engine in the overall market. Broadband can deliver not just fast and always-on Internet services but digital television channels and video on demand simultaneously with a fast Internet connection on the same line. Although that currently requires greater bandwidth than the 512 kilobits per second that represents the standard adopted by BT for fast Internet, that is not a fundamental difference. The ADSL technology and modems are the same to provide speeds of 2 megabits per second or higher, which is what is needed for full-screen digital television pictures.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para82"></a>The only real difference is that there is a slightly greater sensitivity to the distance between the telephone exchange and the home to which the service is delivered. Even taking that into account, 90 per cent of homes can receive that level of bandwidth through the deployment of ADSL on BT's network and the constant development of compression technology is in any case decreasing the bandwidth needed for video on demand and digital television services. The masterly analysis of bandwidth issues of the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, is highly relevant here.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para83"></a>Why is the matter important? Yes, it is nice as a consumer to have those enhanced services. Yes, there are enormous opportunities for schools and universities to benefit from programming delivered on demand by broadband. But, most importantly, it is those richer and more popular content services that will drive take-up of broadband connections&#151;almost as much as the reduction in price emphasised by the noble Lord, Lord St John. Indeed, increased take-up will in itself probably be the most important factor in driving prices lower, over and above the ability to spread the cost of broadband connections across a greater number of services.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para84"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, spoke for every service provider's frustration in his dissection of the performance of BT. I was interested to read in BT's briefing notes that it emphasises the competitiveness of the UK market. Methinks it doth protest too much. As the noble Earl reminded us, there is an effective overwhelming monopoly exercised by BT in providing broadband services over its network and a dominant overall position, even after taking into account the position of the cable operators.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para85"></a>De mortuis, nil nisi bonum, but it is impossible not to conclude that the recently deceased Oftel's implementation of local loop unbundling was a disastrous non-event. We have suffered the worst of both worlds: no effective competition; and a deeply risk-averse monopolist that has moved forward at a painfully slow <P>


<a name="column_641"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 641</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>pace. At least in other markets, such as Germany, where competitive initiatives such as local loop unbundling have also failed&#151;some years before Oftel designed the system introduced in this country&#151;there has at least been a dominant player that, as the noble Lord, Lord St John, recounted, has driven take-up through aggressive pricing.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para86"></a>In respect of non-Internet broadband services such as digital television and video on demand, it is difficult not to be left with the impression that BT has managed the deployment of ADSL and the standard product offered in a way, and on a timetable, that is profoundly linked to its own ability and inclination to provide any particular service.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para87"></a>I conclude, therefore, by joining other noble Lords in expressing the strong hope, which I am sure the Minister will share, that Ofcom will bring to bear a far more vigorous and effective regulatory regime on the provision of broadband than Oftel achieved.

<P>
<A NAME="40114-14_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I declare an interest as a satisfied customer of BT Openworld since May 2001. I do not agree entirely, therefore, with the noble Viscount's remarks. But he is right that we face a new era, with Ofcom taking over the regulatory function. The Minister will remember from our debates last year on the Communications Bill, which set up Ofcom, that we placed on Ofcom the duty of having regard to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"the desirability of encouraging the availability and use of high speed data transfer services throughout the United Kingdom".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-14_para88"></a>
In spite of the convoluted language used, that means that Ofcom is taking over the baton from Oftel and doing what it can&#151;perhaps much better than Oftel did&#151;with the resources being made available to it as a regulator to support the Government's target of having the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G7 by 2005. I imagine that most noble Lords would agree&#151;certainly those who took part in debates on the Bill did&#151;that competition is on the whole the most effective way of achieving that objective. However, as noble Lords said during the debates on the amendments tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, in June, competition may not be able to deal with the rural/urban divide, which has been the subject of many noble Lords' remarks.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para89"></a>Access to broadband via DSL is now available to over 89 per cent of homes in the UK. The number of customers has passed the 3 million mark, with 55 per cent using DSL and 45 per cent cable. Some 40,000 new broadband users a week are coming on board. That is not a bad record. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, that we should not be unduly pessimistic about take-up.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para90"></a>Other technology may have a contribution to make in areas where DSL is not available, particularly broadband fixed wireless access, although to date they have not been very significant. We have noted the point made by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, that licences were awarded in the 3.4 gigahertz spectrum in June 2003. However, the winners of that option&#151;<P>


<a name="column_642"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 642</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>PCCW, which took over 14 of the 15 licences&#151;has yet to make any use of the spectrum. It would be interesting to know whether the Government have information about its plans. In the 28 gigahertz band, one firm offers low contention data services to business in four cities, but at quite a high cost. In February, BT will begin trials in some rural areas of the newly released 5.8 gigahertz band, which can provide download speeds of 1 megabits per second to people living beyond the reach of broadband-enabled exchanges. That may provide some comfort to the noble Lord, Lord Granchester, in particular, and others concerned about the rural divide.

<a name="40114-14_para91"></a>Noble Lords have mentioned 3G mobiles only en passant. They may be attractive to a new group of broadband users, mostly, I suspect, for non-business purposes, and particularly to teenagers. It is reported that manufacturers are offering models specifically designed for teenagers. To protect young people, the models are incapable of accessing adult services and gambling, and retailers will demand proof of age. Assuming that those rules work&#151;that is a big assumption&#151;children may still be able to enter chatrooms, where they may be exposed to temptations and risks.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para92"></a>A few months ago, ACPO placed a bid for £5 million for the Government to fund regional centres to combat Internet paedophiles. That would enable the police to copy hard disks without alteration, which is needed to comply with the rules of evidence. The growth of broadband creates new opportunities for criminals of all kinds, including terrorists, animal rights extremists, fraudsters claiming to offer partnerships in the assets of dead African dictators, and people who for a variety of motives engage in "denial of service" attacks, which preoccupied the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, and other noble Lords two years ago when he introduced the Computer Misuse (Amendment) Bill. The police must have the resources to deal effectively with all those threats. It would be useful if the Minister, in his winding-up speech, could say how the Government will respond to ACPO'S first, modest request for a mere £5 million.
<P>

<a name="40114-14_para93"></a>The retail market for broadband is reasonably competitive, with cable offering an alternative to DSL in some areas, and the introduction of a range of products based on datastream, which has been mentioned, starting with an entry-level 150-kilobits-per-second service at £16 per month, which has proved very popular. I am not sure whether I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, that we have the wrong definition of broadband. A variety of services at different speeds and different prices will stimulate the market most effectively. If what suppliers are telling me is true, there has been an astonishing take-up of the low-speed 150 Kb service that has been on offer.

<A NAME="40114-15_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for permitting me to intervene. My problem with the definition is not so much that there is something intrinsically wrong with defining 128 kilobits per second as the lower limit of broadband. My problem <P>


<a name="column_643"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 643</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is that, in analysing the statistics, it becomes impossible to know whether a particular series of statistics includes 128 kilobits or not.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-15_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Avebury: </B>   My Lords, I understood the noble Earl's point that it distorts the picture when trying to compare take-up in the UK with that of other G7 states. That point must be noted in future statistical comparisons.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para0"></a>We have heard that the suppliers of datastream services are complaining that BT discriminates against them because of its pricing policies, particularly in the charge of £50 for migrating from IP stream. Having endowed the regulator with extensive powers against the exploitation of a dominant position by an SMP, it would be incongruous of Parliament to egg on one party or another from the touchline in these debates. We have translated the rules of the game contained in the European directives into language that can be interpreted by UK players, and we set up Ofcom as the referee. After several seasons, we might well look at the rules again and, if necessary, improve the referee's powers. But it would be perverse in the extreme to do that when the first round has only just started.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para1"></a>I have read Oftel's 215-page document, published on 16 December, to which the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, referred, Identification and analysis of markets, determination of market power and setting SMP conditions for the wholesale broadband access market, and noted the finding, based on its growing market share, that BT possesses single-firm SMP in the broadband origination and conveyance markets. However, the regulator intends to set conditions, not only the requirement to provide access with retail minus pricing, which the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, criticises, but requirements not to discriminate unduly in favour of their own retail activities; to provide a reference offer; to notify charges, terms and conditions; and to provide transparency in the quality of service information.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para2"></a>I should point out to the noble Earl that it is still a draft report and that there is an opportunity to make representations up to 6 February. Ofcom will have to take those into consideration. It is in the nature of the process of regulation that not everybody can be satisfied, with the person having SMP&#151;in this case, BT&#151;wanting less onerous conditions and others wanting tighter conditions. However, the particular viewpoints of the players are not a matter for Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para3"></a>The Government's role in accelerating broadband rollout is principally that of a large customer. The DTI's broadband aggregation project, which has been mentioned, is an effective way of mobilising demand, and the principle of aggregation has also worked well in bridging the rural divide, although it is not the only way. The idea of having a variety of partnerships has been mentioned. Such arrangements have been deployed in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the regions of England to stimulate demand and usage. I noted that Stornoway, Kirkwall and Lerwick have <P>


<a name="column_644"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 644</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been connected through one such partnership and that accessibility has shot up in Scotland as a whole, from 39 per cent of users early in 2003 to 70 per cent by the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para4"></a>My noble friend Lord Redesdale has drawn my attention to the fact that most, if not all, successful partnerships have been in areas that qualify for EU Objective 1 status. I note that the Act Now partnership in Cornwall, which has been taken as a model by many people, is still a useful example to others. It is holding a conference next month to explore the possibility of further partnerships and consider how people can learn from existing ones. However, there are many rural areas. The rural areas in the constituency of my right honourable friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed do not have Objective 1 status, and there are many such areas. I hope that Stephen Timms, when he addresses the conference, will pay particular attention to rural areas that do not have Objective 1 status. If it is correct to say that it is only through EU funding that the partnerships have been successful, that will leave out a great many areas.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para5"></a>One of the recommendations that, I understand, is to be made in a report by the broadband stakeholders group in the next few weeks is that the Government should undertake a study of the potential implications of broadband-enabled remote and flexible working for the UK's communications, transport, housing and planning policies. I support that idea enthusiastically, because I think that we have, at last, the means of enabling remote working, which has been discussed for the past 20 years, and, in particular, a means of enabling women to balance work and home commitments and enabling many talented women to remain economically active while they look after small children. The Government might also conduct a survey of firms that already employ remote workers, to see what lessons there are to be learnt for management and for staff relations. In local government, they might investigate whether teleworking/broadband initiatives are being cramped by the need to concentrate on the e-government agenda, as I heard was the case in one London borough.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para6"></a>Apart from implementing the systems, the other huge problem, which has been touched on, is how to assist the information-poor to access the systems and share the benefits that IT-literate people already take for granted. According to the Commons Library, 88 per cent of 16 to 24 year-olds used the Internet in October 2003, but only 16 per cent of those aged over 65 did so. That point was made by the noble Earl, Lord Northesk. Of the one third of adults who had never used the Internet, just over half said that they did not want to use it, had no need for it or had no interest in it. My honourable friend Mr Richard Allan asked about the "won't surfs", as they are called, in another place the other day. The Minister who replied, Douglas Alexander, referred to the "Get Started" campaign, which targets hard-to-reach groups, especially the elderly, but said that he saw the difficulty as one of lack of skills and experience rather than lack of motivation. I suggest that we have to deal with both, and that should be one of the objectives of the digital inclusion panel, announced by the Secretary of State, Patricia Hewitt, on 15 December.

<a name="40114-15_para7"></a>The broadband industry group quotes research&#151;I think that it was mentioned by the noble Earl, Lord Erroll&#151;that shows that a clear link exists between communications technologies and economic growth. On the most cautious assumptions, it says that, by 2010, GDP will be £3.5 billion higher as a result of broadband, and that it could be as much as £16 billion higher. The benefits in terms of quality of life could be even more dramatic. UK-wide availability of broadband would encourage many businesses to migrate from London to the regions, and from high-rent cities to smaller towns and villages. It will help employers to stagger working hours, relieving pressure on commuter transport systems. It will enrich our leisure; for example, in the enormous growth of online genealogical information or in the creation of personal websites that enable us to share information with people throughout the world. It will enhance democracy by enabling us all to keep tabs on what the Government are doing and to build web-based coalitions for correcting their mistakes. That is why this is the most important issue that we face in the 21st century.

<A NAME="40114-15_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Wilcox: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, for introducing this timely debate, which has enabled us to hear his expert analysis of where we are today. It also enabled us to hear from other speakers, and I refer particularly to the tour de force by my noble friend Lord Northesk. It makes me feel weird standing here, as I am no techie. I am proud to say that I am now on broadband, but the side-effect has been that the telephone extension in my sitting-room and the telephone extension in my bedroom no longer ring. I am having great difficulty getting British Telecom to turn up at a time when I can be there. I have no doubt that all will be well.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para8"></a>Broadband is an umbrella term for various technologies that give users access to the Internet at a much higher speed than the standard 56-kilobyte modem. I am delighted to move at such a pace at home. The Government have asserted that broadband is important because broadband subscriber growth will,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"facilitate the next phase of e-commerce",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-15_para9"></a>
That is correct, but it has not happened yet, as the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, so eloquently outlined. The additional bandwidth provided by a broadband connection allows new value-added services to be delivered to consumers and businesses alike. That is wonderful.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para10"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, enthused about some of the benefits, some of which I have listed and some of which we have heard about today. Businesses can save time and money, and they stand to benefit from productivity improvements. Catalogue and stock databases can be hosted by specialist ISPs. Virtual private networks can be set up, and broadband enables application service provision that permits the outsourcing of IT functions.
<P>


<a name="column_646"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 646</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para11"></a>For consumers, the DTI has suggested that there are a number of additional benefits. The Internet can be accessible from several PCs, and online gaming, music and video can be available. Other benefits include two-way, real-time visual communication, opportunities for long-distance learning and the delivery of all kinds of key services. How exciting all that sounds. But so much more needs to be done to encourage those uses. I look forward to hearing the response of the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para12"></a>The Government's record so far with this exciting new opportunity is frustratingly poor. Their targets are still not being met. There is a lack of clarity in the institutional and competitive framework that the Government have created. Their failure to create an adequate competitive environment is damaging. The Government should have a duty to promote competition and to reduce regulation.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para13"></a>My noble friend Lord Northesk graphically outlined BT's hold on the market. The bottom line still is that we have one supplier, one product and one price. The Government should create a more competitive environment to encourage new entrants to that market. They should entrust the regulator with a remit to protect against market abuse until a competitive market evolves. It is for the regulator to protect users and consumers of national services and utilities and to stimulate national competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para14"></a>As a country, where are we? I am not as impressed as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, by where we are right now. The CBI states that Britain lies sixth among the G7 countries in broadband connections and that few small and medium-sized enterprises are yet connected. According to the broadband stakeholder group, only one household in 25 is currently subscribing to broadband. Less than one household in every 30 that has a computer is hooked up to a broadband service. In the business community, among firms employing more than 10 people, less than one in five has a broadband connection.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para15"></a>In January, only 1.4 million households and businesses were connected to a broadband service. According to Oftel, Britain has only slightly more than half as many lines connected to broadband per head of population as Germany, and just over a quarter as many as Sweden. The noble Lord, Lord St John, asked: where are we today towards the Government's avowed target? Perhaps the Minister will be able to cheer us up in his response. Perhaps the United States of America lags even further behind than we do.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para16"></a>It has often been said that the advent of broadband is similar to the invention and use of electricity. Not only does it capture the public's imagination&#151;it does not seem to have quite done that yet&#151;but also it is seen as essential in providing the link between business and the community. The Country Land and Business Association believes that broadband can be even more than that. Like the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, I, too, believe that it can be the tool that leads to economic prosperity while bringing communities together, as has been said.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para17"></a>Sadly, the clear lack of affordable broadband in rural areas illustrates the widening urban/rural divide. But that does not have to be the case. The recognition of the benefits attached to the introduction of broadband by policy makers will make a step in the right direction. Greater use of broadband technology by all government departments would be another step forward, as we have heard suggested today more than once. Broadband is vital to all elements that make up Britain. Without the ability to access affordable broadband, Britain will suffer. To let that happen due to lack of sensible co-ordinated policy direction, when the infrastructure is already in place, represents a truly missed opportunity.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para18"></a>I look forward to the Minister's reply. After all, he is a bit of a techie himself, and a major investor of his time. As I finish, I should like to observe that in this the most modern of our debates, every speaker, other than the Minister and me, is an elected hereditary Peer.

<A NAME="40114-15_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry   (Lord Sainsbury of Turville): </B>  My Lords, I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, has raised this issue. It is one to which the Government attach great importance. Your Lordships' contributions have demonstrated that there is a great deal of interest and expertise in broadband. We also need to recall that our purpose is to contribute to greater prosperity for all, through improving business productivity, giving consumers access to better information and greater choice, and to provide better services, including public services, such as education and healthcare, and to deliver those benefits to all parts of society, not just to a few of them.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para19"></a>A recent report by the Centre for Economic and Business Research suggested that broadband could be worth £22 billion to the UK economy by 2015. It is also interesting that hard evidence of the benefit to individual communities is starting to emerge as well; for example, a study of the small town of South Dundas in Ontario, Canada, with a population of 10,000, shows that implementing broadband has reversed a decade of declining employment. I also strongly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that there are huge quality-of-life benefits, including remote working, as well as the economic ones.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para20"></a>Beyond those important general economic impacts, broadband also promises to deliver a bundle of more specific benefits, including opportunities for digital content providers to commercialise new products. With our strong media and computer games industries, that is an area where the UK has the potential to benefit greatly. I was very glad that the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, introduced a subject which is dear to my heart; namely, grid computing. I think that in this country, we are developing a real world position in grid computing, which will drive the second generation of Internet in the future.
<P>


<a name="column_648"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 648</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para21"></a>In recognition of broadband's potential early in 2001, the Government set out an ambitious target for the UK to have the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G7 by 2005 because it is the market that can best deliver customer choice, value for money and innovation.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para22"></a>We have come a long way over the past three years. On competitiveness and extensiveness, we were at the time fourth and fifth out of the G7 respectively. OECD figures for broadband penetration had us in 22nd place behind the Czech Republic. Since then we have made huge progress. In spring 2002, prices fell, so that from sixth in the G7, we moved up to third best for price. That helped us to move from fourth to third in the overall competitiveness measure.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para23"></a>Now, with broadband available to more than 80 per cent of households, we have overtaken the USA for availability. For the overall extensiveness measures, we have moved up from fifth to equal third&#151;level with the USA and overtaking Germany. Only Japan and Canada among the G7 countries are ahead of us. That is a pretty remarkable transformation in our position.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para24"></a>It took until the autumn of 2002 to reach 1 million subscribers, but by November 2003, there were more than 3 million. Now, we should have about 3.2 million subscribers. The figures are rising at some 150,000 per month.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para25"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, and the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, raised the question of whether we would meet our target. Our current predictions are that by 2005 we are likely to be second behind Japan. There is a very clear story here. Not surprisingly&#151;this is true of most markets&#151;this market is driven by price. Price is driven by competition and with that comes service and the benefits that the consumer can get. As those have changed, so we have seen this take-off happen. I recognise that the national figures, though encouraging, provide little comfort for the mainly rural communities that are not yet connected. But there too the market is proving effective and innovative. The demand registration schemes promoted by BT and others have had a positive impact. BT's scheme has led to availability increasing well ahead of predictions made even a year ago.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para26"></a>Technological development will help us on a range of fronts. I expect wireless to be a big element in the next phase of broadband development. Last year, the Radiocommunications Agency concluded a successful auction of 15 licences in the 3.4 gigahertz band for fixed wireless broadband, between them covering the whole country. In answer to the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, PCCW has made public its intention to proceed with a soft launch of broadband services in a trial area fairly soon. They will do that under the name UK Broadband. This again will add to competition alongside cable and, in a small way, satellite. This is beginning to make the market very competitive. I shall say more about that later.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para27"></a>Satellite, as I said, also has a role. Alone of all the technologies it can cover the whole country. While satellite has some technological limitations, the main issue is price&#151;it is more expensive for a single <P>


<a name="column_649"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 649</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>connection. The Government are helping to develop the satellite market particularly for small businesses in rural areas through such schemes as the Remote Area BroadBand Inclusion Trial or RABBIT programme run by a consortium of RDAs.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para28"></a>An encouraging sign here is that people in rural communities are taking action to gain access to broadband services. Around the UK communities have either set up their own solutions or have demonstrated the value of demand for broadband to suppliers. There is a great ferment of innovation and energy at community level. It has been suggested&#151;slightly fancifully but interestingly&#151;that we have seen nothing like this since communities went out very publicly to try and get railways to come to their areas. In any case, it is a powerful and welcome force.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para29"></a>The DTI and Defra are working together to support this effort. We have set up a joint Rural Broadband Unit to make the response from the Government and the regional development agencies to the challenge of rural broadband more coherent and effective but more needs to be done. To realise the true benefits of broadband it needs to become ubiquitous so that every company and every community is able to access it.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para30"></a>I agree with the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, about the need for partnership. The Government have called for a new and deeper partnership between the broadband industry, national, regional and local government and local communities. We all need to work together more closely over the next two years to achieve our goal of a Britain in which broadband is available, not in 90 or 95 per cent of communities, but in every single community by the end of 2005. BT has already responded to this call to arms and also I suspect to increasing competition, by announcing that it is eager to work with local communities towards a vision of 100 per cent availability by 2005. I welcome that commitment.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para31"></a>There will undoubtedly be hurdles to overcome, highest in the remotest parts of the UK. We will have to foster continuing innovation in the market. We will need to build demand by working more closely with small businesses to show them the opportunities that broadband offers and by attracting more people to use government services online.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para32"></a>The public sector is committed to exploiting broadband. The noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, is absolutely correct. Between 2003 and 2006 public services will spend £1 billion on broadband connectivity to raise standards in schools, improve services at our GPs' surgeries and make our public libraries into community information hubs. The DTI is working with key public sector customers to aggregate demand and to use our buying power to extend the reach of broadband into new areas. This work will start to bear fruit this year through the network of Regional Aggregation Bodies that we are establishing in the English regions. Of course the private sector can ride on the back of these initiatives.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para33"></a>The RDAs have taken up the challenge and have committed, we estimate, some £235 million to broadband development over the period from 2000 to 2006. We will look for more opportunities to catalyse the <P>


<a name="column_650"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 650</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sort of partnerships that have already borne fruit in Cornwall and elsewhere. The devolved administrations have also been imaginative and creative with broadband. For example, Northern Ireland is aiming for 100 per cent coverage, while both Scotland and Wales have very active programmes. If we succeed in bringing these partnerships together, we can deliver the prize of a more competitive and productive UK, a country in which the benefits of broadband are available for all who want them.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para34"></a>I should like to deal with a number of general points raised by noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, asked whether further government funding would be available for rural broadband access following the £30 million DTI Broadband Fund. The present funding will expire in March this year. We estimate that the £30 million worth of DTI funding has stimulated or leveraged some £235 million worth of spending by RDAs up to 2006. Going forward, the Government will work in partnership with BT and other telecoms companies, with RDAs and other local agencies to complete access roll-out. The market is now beginning to work well, but further inputs from regional and local agencies will be required to complete the task.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para35"></a>The noble Lord asked about the position of wireless technology. The new regulator of the telecoms industry,  Ofcom, which took over from the Radiocommunications Agency in December, intends to continue to pursue the objectives of the radio agency; to make spectrum available in order to maximise the opportunity for operators to provide access to a full range of broadband services. I have mentioned the auction that has already taken place.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para36"></a>The noble Lord also asked about the proportion of schools which already have broadband access. The great majority of secondary schools already have it and the Department for Education and Skills already plans to ensure that by 2006 all primary and secondary schools should have a minimum of 2 mbps and 8 mbps respectively. Turning to local loop unbundling, another point raised by the noble Lord, Ofcom will be reviewing the local loop unbundling market later this year.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para37"></a>I should like to address the question of competition in the UK because a number of points were made about this which did not, I think, reflect the true situation. This was a major issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, and the noble Earl, Lord Northesk. Price, competition and the services that consumers can get are the three absolutely key factors that will drive the market. The UK is not perfectly competitive. As has been said, the recent publication by Ofcom of its wholesale market review makes it clear that the regulator believes that BT still has significant market power.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para38"></a>However, this is a problem shared with probably every other market in the world. Indeed, the UK market is significantly more competitive than those in many comparable countries, particularly in Europe. Not only are our prices lower, but 45 per cent of households are able to choose between different technologies. There are more than 150 re-sellers of <P>


<a name="column_651"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 651</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>BT's ADSL products. As a result, BT has a retail market share of 25 per cent, which compares with 90 per cent for Deutsche Telekom in Germany and 55 per cent for France Telecom in France. So it is simply not true to say, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, that we have one product, one supplier and one price. Further, when quoting Germany and Italy as exemplars, it should be noted that Italy is in seventh place on price, while Germany is also less price competitive than the UK and, of course, Deutsche Telekom is in a powerful position. This is a clear case where bringing competition to the market is paying off and we do not do at all badly on price.
<P>

<a name="40114-15_para39"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, mentioned cost-plus pricing. Ofcom has been established as an independent regulator and it is not for Ministers to interfere in these detailed decisions. Ofcom's wholesale broadband market review was published as a second stage of consultation. It has the difficult job of balancing incentives for BT and competitors and there is still an opportunity for companies such as members of the Broadband Industry Group to make representations to Ofcom.

<A NAME="40114-16_spnew0"></A><B> The Earl of Northesk: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for giving way. The real question I wanted to get to the root of in respect of cost-plus versus retail-minus is whether the Government have a particular view on whether there are advantages that obtain to retail-minus or advantages that obtain to cost-plus. Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-16_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Sainsbury of Turville: </B>   My Lords, we feel that this is an issue for Ofcom. There is no point in establishing a regulator and then trying to second-guess its policy. It is for the regulator to make decisions on this. It has issued a consultation document and it is now for people to respond to it in order to take this issue forward.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para0"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Northesk, also raised the question of the definition of broadband, which is a subject on which he and I have had frequent correspondence. I should perhaps let the rest of the House into that dialogue. The Government's definition of broadband is guided by the independent advice of the Broadband Stakeholder Group. It uses a dynamic definition of broadband that is technology neutral and focused on the "always on" and interactive characteristics of broadband. The definition is:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Always on access at work, at home or on the move, provided by a range of fixed line, wireless and satellite technologies to progressively higher bandwidths capable of supporting genuinely new and innovative content, applications and services, and the delivery of enhanced public services".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para1"></a><P>

<a name="40114-16_para2"></a>That is in line with the recent OECD paper, which concluded:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"There is no universally accepted definition of broadband and national definitions vary, but it is generally agreed that it applies to always-on services, considerably faster than Integrated Services Digital Network".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para3"></a><P>

<a name="40114-16_para4"></a>We do not keep information on other countries' definitions of broadband. However, in our analysis of the UK's relative position in the G7, we use the same definition to apply to all countries.

<a name="40114-16_para5"></a>The price of broadband in the UK, which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord St John Bletso, and the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, is a critical issue. Again, we should look at the total picture and the figures that we have. UK prices are competitive against most major markets, and they have continued to fall in the past two years to the point that, last year, according to Oftel, which is now Ofcom, broadband in the UK was cheaper than in Germany or the USA. That view is borne out by others. According to research commissioned from Telecom Communications, consultants for the DTI, we are the third best for price in G7, and more expensive only than Japan and Canada.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para6"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, raised the question of trigger levels. Their use is a way of checking that demand is present before investment is a legitimate and innovative way of managing investment. We could, however, be more transparent about the process, and Stephen Timms and Alun Michael have written to BT about that.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para7"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Erroll, raised the question of traffic management. That is an area in which the DTI and DfT are working closely together to make certain that problems do not arise.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, raised the question of child pornography, which we regard as a serious issue. While the Internet has undoubtedly facilitated the opportunity for individuals to view and distribute child abuse images, it has also offered law enforcement an increased opportunity to locate and deal with individuals engaged in child abuse, and the viewing or distribution of child abuse images. In answer to his specific question about the ACPO bid, that is a matter for my colleagues in the Home Office, and I shall write to the noble Lord on that subject.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para9"></a>There were a number of other specific technical questions, but as we are running out of time, I shall write to noble Lords on these matters.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para10"></a>Broadband makes what the Internet has promised for so long a reality for individual consumers. I agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Chandos, that for broadband to take hold in our lives, more needs to be done to stimulate compelling content. Technology alone is not persuasive. Customers have to see a marked difference from their current experience. The major existing content providers, such as BBC and Hollywood, will have a major part to play. The UK is also rich in smaller companies with great potential as broadband content developers. We have been looking at the market barriers to content developers realising their potential, and at possible solutions.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para11"></a>In the future, we can expect an increasing demand from consumers for higher-speed services. Telewest and NTL have led the way in offering 1 and 2 megabit-per-second services. In due course, we will need to push up to 5 and 10 megabits. We shall see more and more high value-added applications, delivered through an increasing array of broadband-enabled devices. A critical success factor is whether the UK can develop the next generation networks to carry this volume of data fast enough to keep up with demand.

<A NAME="40114-16_spnew2"></A><B> Lord St John of Bletso: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the Minister for his comprehensive response to many of our questions. I was interested that right at the outset the Minister mentioned that the benefits of fully embracing broadband by 2015 could be worth almost £22 billion to the UK economy. The emphasis should be on fully embracing broadband now&#151;that is one of the core issues that I tried to highlight in my brief speech.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para13"></a>The Minister also spoke in glowing terms of the availability of broadband in the United Kingdom compared with our international partners. That is true, but he did not, I feel, make enough reference to broadband take-up in this country, which has to be one of the main focuses.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para14"></a>I am pleased that the Minister also acknowledged the need for greater partnerships and certainly that the Government see broadband usage as a core objective. To that end, I am very grateful to all of your Lordships who spoke with so much authority and made well informed, wide-ranging and thoughtful speeches.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para15"></a>There were a number of common themes: the noble Earl, Lord Northesk, with his customary expert knowledge on this subject, along with the noble Viscount, Lord Chandos, the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and others, spoke on the need for greater competition, the greater affordability of broadband and the contrast between broadband coverage and take-up. I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Grantchester, focused specifically on the needs of the rural community. There is no doubt that there will be a great need for a greater reach of affordable broadband in the rural areas. I agree with him that if there is far more reach in the rural areas, that will result in a far higher percentage of take-up than in the urban areas.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para16"></a>My noble friend Lord Erroll, in his customary, wide-ranging and expert way, also mentioned the importance of wireless. Certainly, wireless will have a major beneficial impact on extending affordable broadband throughout the United Kingdom. He also said that broadband is not just about high-speed access but also about reliability of service. That is a point well made.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para17"></a>It was interesting to hear from the noble Viscount, Lord Chandos, about the different applications for broadband as well as the need for greater broadband roll-out.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para18"></a>I apologise for making reference to IP stream and datastream. I knew the one person to pick up on that point immediately would be the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, with his vast technical expertise in your Lordships' House. I am pleased that he made reference to datastream and the different broadband options. <P>


<a name="column_654"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 654</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>No doubt the extension of the reach of affordable broadband services in rural areas will need to happen through partnerships.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para19"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, and the Minister both said, this has been an excellent opportunity to eulogise on the many benefits and uses of broadband to consumers and, just as importantly, to business. I thank noble Lords who have spoken in this debate. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion for Papers.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-16_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Geddes </B>   rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what steps they are taking to redistribute light dues in an equitable manner across all users.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para21"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I am delighted to see the quality of noble Lords lining up to speak on this issue. May I also say how delighted I am that the Minister has chosen this subject this evening with which to open his account in your Lordships' House? The only problem, if I might say so, is that, by convention and custom of the House, we are unable to intervene in his winding-up speech. I assure him that on other occasions we will be so entitled, but this evening he will have a clear run.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para22"></a>For the record, let me outline what this arcane system of light dues&#151;this tax&#151;actually is and why I feel so strongly that reform is long overdue. Light dues are an historic tax on shipping users in UK ports. Vessels are assessed for light dues on their size and frequency of call. Shipping companies who operate from and to UK ports facilitating UK trade and contributing substantially to inward investment, and direct and indirect UK employment, have long campaigned against light dues. Their issue is that they should not have to pay for a service which they do not have to pay for at other European ports. Such shipping lines, of course, have the option of using other ports on the Continent as their primary European port of call. If the continuation of this tax makes our ports uncompetitive, that would clearly be very damaging to the UK economy.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para23"></a>As a result of long and concentrated action by such companies, the Department for Transport commissioned an economic review into the tax in May 2002. I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to give us a progress report on that review and some reassurance about its outcome.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para24"></a>Manifestly, all ships have to pay for the costs of visiting a port. Those costs cover a range of services, including pilotage, port costs, towage, mooring costs, and so forth. However, what distinguishes UK ports is that the additional light dues cost of up to £16,000 per port call is charged on each merchant vessel. That does not happen elsewhere in the world.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para25"></a>UK ports have made great strides over recent years in order to improve efficiency and introduce modern operating methods. Yet that enormous effort made by both port workers and management alike is being <P>


<a name="column_655"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 655</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>undermined by a government tax that threatens the competitiveness of our ports compared with those on the Continent. Other noble Lords may well enlarge on the statistics; I should like to give one. Like for like, Southampton is 25 per cent more expensive than Rotterdam.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para26"></a>Your Lordships will appreciate that the ports industry is increasingly competitive. It is vital for the UK economy that our ports can compete on equal terms with our European rivals. The Government maintain that charges should be fair and equitable and that the user should pay. I do not dispute that. Yet light dues are neither fair nor equitable. Many who need the services of navigational aids by and large do not pay for them. But those that may well not need them, do pay. That is perverse. If, because of this additional tax, shipping lines decide to use alternative ports on the Continent&#151;I have already mentioned Rotterdam&#151;and tranship goods to the UK, who will that benefit&#151;the UK economy or our European competitors? Surely the answer is clear.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para27"></a>In opposition, Labour promised the abolition of light dues in its 1993 policy paper Full Steam Ahead, which cited the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"commercial disadvantages to British port operations and shipowners",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para28"></a>
caused by this tax. But have the Government honoured that promise? No, as of yet they have not, but as always we live in hope.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para29"></a>The latest indictment of light dues came in Chapter 9 of the House of Commons Transport Select Committee Ports Report of 13 November 2003, which condemned light dues with these words:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The UK has historically employed a system of light dues to cover the cost of navigation aids. Such a system is inconsistent with other European countries and distorts competition. The Government should reconsider the entire concept of light dues".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para30"></a>
That was a Labour Party promulgation.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para31"></a>Of course, this was not the first time that the tax had been condemned by a Select Committee. As recently as 1834&#151;yes, 1834&#151;a highly regarded Select Committee called for the abolition of this tax. So this tax has been considered outdated and unfair for 170 years.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para32"></a>My Question relates to the redistribution of light dues in an equitable manner. Let me give three examples of inequitability&#151;I am assured that such a word exists. First, in 2001&#150;02, users of English and Welsh ports paid £62.5 million in light dues against expenditure by Trinity House of £30.2 million. In Scotland, the comparable figures were £8.5 million income against £24.2 million spent by the Northern Lights Board. In Ireland, north and south combined, income from light dues was £3.8 million against £16.2 million spent by the Commissioners of Irish Lights. Why the geographical disparity?
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para33"></a>My second example is that successive UK governments have laboured for years in renegotiation with the Republic of Ireland over the historic anomaly which means that the UK taxpayer subsidises Irish navigational aids from UK light dues to the tune of <P>


<a name="column_656"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 656</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>£5 million per year. Can the Minister enlighten the House on what progress has been made in removing this unwarranted subsidy?
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para34"></a>Finally, in the same year, 2001&#150;02, total income from light dues levied at UK and Irish ports totalled £74.8 million against expenditure of £70.6 million. What happened to the £4.2 million excess? Where did it go? Presumably in increasing the already enormous £64 million General Lighthouse Fund. In that respect I rely on paragraph 2.20 of the DTLR consultation document Light Dues Review. While half of that £64 million reserve is allocated to cover pension liabilities&#151;and quite rightly so&#151;the remaining £32 million seems to be being held to "clear wrecks"&#151;a cost the risk of which has for decades been covered by insurance policies. Is this not a classic case of duplication?
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para35"></a>As I have said, the May 2002 review of light dues needs to be brought to a conclusion. In his reply today, I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to give the UK ports and shipping industries some comfort. In particular, can he tell the House when the Department for Transport will bring this matter to a conclusion? And will he please give us some assurance that this outdated and unfair tax will be abolished once and for all?
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-16_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Berkeley: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, for introducing the debate. As he said, the subject has been around for a very long time and it is appropriate that we should now discuss it again.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para36"></a>I declare an interest as president of the UK Marine Pilots Association, which does not want either to gain or to lose by this. But the subject has a relevance to it, as I shall explain later.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para37"></a>I should like to talk about redistribution, the subject of the Question. In addition to being involved with a large amount of shipping, I sail. The navigational aids around our coast are extremely good and are essential for the safe navigation of big ships, little ships and many other vessels. I would have no objection in principle to contributing some money to the maintenance of lighthouses, but there would be a severe difficulty in getting off the ground the registration scheme that surely would be necessary.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para38"></a>I am thinking here of some of those lovely boats that one sees in mud berths around the country. Do they ever move? If they do move, it would not be like purchasing a vehicle excise duty and knowing which roads constitute highways and which roads do not. The question of when a waterway becomes the sea and therefore covered by such a scheme would become extremely complicated.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para39"></a>Given the amount of money, about £70 million as the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, said, that is involved in the provision of these lighthouses around this country and Ireland, which I shall come on to, I suspect that setting up and enforcing a registration scheme for small boats would probably cost almost as much <P>


<a name="column_657"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 657</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>money as it would raise, if not more. I am not sure that that is an option that is worth pursing, but perhaps the Government have a different view.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para40"></a>My second point about redistribution, again raised by the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, is the Irish question. It must be about 85 years since the Republic of Ireland came into being and we have been subsidising its lighthouses ever since. I was in Ireland last summer and I did not think the lighthouses were very good, so they probably reflect the fact that the Republic of Ireland only spends £5 million a year of our money on them. But what are we doing still keeping the Republic of Ireland's lighthouses alight? Surely the answer is to threaten the Republic of Ireland, with enough time so that it can get its own resources available, and say, "We shall switch you off on 1 January next year". Then we shall see what happens. It is ridiculous that it has been going on for 85 years or so. After all, the Republic of Ireland is independent of the UK, as we rightly keep being reminded. Why should we be maintaining its lighthouses? It is quite incredible.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para41"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Geddes, referred to the Select Committee and its report. I shall refer to the table on page 49. It shows the various charges made for big ships going into ports. It goes through pilotage, towage, linesman, port dues, light dues and total. What we see from it is that the charge for light dues is higher than the charge for port dues. Light dues are 34.9 per cent of the total and port dues are 29 per cent. It is extraordinary. The port dues are there because port facilities, such as dredging and quays, are provided for the benefit of the ships. To have the port dues less than the light dues is quite extraordinary. It confirms the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, that this is a major contribution to why ports in this country have a real struggle to remain competitive.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para42"></a>It is a shame that the port services directive, which was going through the European system, has probably stopped now. The differences in the way ports are owned in the UK and in much of Europe and in the way people pay for the capital costs, dredging and other services, mean that we are already at a severe disadvantage. Having to pay the light dues on top of that is very serious. It is seriously anti-competitive. I share the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, that more than 10 years ago my party committed itself to getting rid of light dues, saying that they were a commercial disadvantage to British port operators and ship owners. Ministers in the past few years have done a great deal in some ways to help British shipping, but they have not done much in this context. It is about time they did.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para43"></a>The Select Committee in another place produced a very good report. As the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, has said, it would be nice to know when the Department for Transport's own report will come out. When the Select Committee says that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The Government supports initiatives on funding and charging to create free and fair competition in the ports sector",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para44"></a>
it seems to me that they are doing exactly the opposite. It is not free and fair competition with the continent. You can go into most of the important continental <P>


<a name="column_658"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 658</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>countries on the western seaboard, I shall not go into detail, and you do not have to pay light dues. Here you have to pay. It is time we changed. I do not believe it is worth £75 million, less the £5 million that we shall switch off in Ireland. Seventy million pounds are not worth a registration system for small boats. In my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's overall Budget for this country, £75 million is not really a great deal. It would be much better to stop all the hassle, switch off Ireland and make it separate, and then give one boost to the British shipping industry, to follow what has been done in other situations, and say that we will fund it ourselves.

<A NAME="40114-16_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Greenway: </B>   My Lords, I, too, welcome the new Minister to his post and wish him well on his maiden voyage in this House and at the Dispatch Box. He is dealing with a subject close to the sea and ships. Debates of such a nature tend to come up rather late at night. I am not certain whether shipping will be an ongoing task so far as he is concerned, but if it is he may have to get used to taking debates quite late at night. That is a pity, because shipping is still very important to this country. I do not need to point out that, in weight, something like 90 per cent of our goods still come by sea.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para45"></a>I also congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, on his assiduousness in bringing forward the topic yet again. It is not the first time that the House has discussed light dues, and I am sure that it will not be the last.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para46"></a>So far as light dues are concerned, the Government have followed the user-pays principle, which, after all, is one of the principles of the EU. I am only sorry that their efforts to persuade some of our close neighbours have not borne fruit, but I may have more to say on that in a minute.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para47"></a>Light dues were last raised in 1993&#151;some time ago&#151;and reduced in 1997 and again in 2002. Some reduction has been made in terms of tonnage, which has benefited the larger ships coming to our ports.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para48"></a>The International Association of Lighthouse Associations&#151;IALA&#151;recently carried out a survey on light dues. It received responses from 55 countries, 23 of which&#151;getting on for 50 per cent&#151;charged something for the provision of lights and buoyage, either wholly or in part. In Europe, Sweden, Spain and Greece charge fully, like ourselves. Although it is claimed that our immediate competitors across the channel do not charge, charges are probably made in other ways, with some hidden in conservancy charges, local government charges and so forth. It is not entirely true to say that some of the countries are not charging.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para49"></a>The real problem arises from the fact that we are too honest in this country. We are transparent; our light dues are up there for everyone to see, and it is much easier to complain about something that one can see than something that one does not see. The moneys are paid into the general lighthouse fund, which comes under the Secretary of State's aegis, and are distributed to the three general lighthouse authorities. Those are <P>


<a name="column_659"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 659</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Trinity House&#151;I must declare an interest as a younger brother of Trinity House&#151;Northern Lights and Irish Lights. It is important to point out that 84 per cent of the dues are paid by foreign-flagged ships.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para50"></a>Huge progress has been made by the general lighthouse authorities over the past 10 years in cutting their costs through a very extensive modernisation programme, which has seen the abandonment of lighthouse keepers and light-vessel crews, and the widespread introduction of solar power for powering lights. The fleets of lighthouse tenders have been cut dramatically. For instance, Trinity House used to have five, and now has two. So the lighthouse authorities have been doing their bit and they should be congratulated on that. Can one imagine a government department being able to cut its cloth in that way? I cannot think of a way.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para51"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Geddes, is asking for a more equitable way of payment. There were suggestions that Royal Navy vessels and recreational craft should pay. Following yesterday's defence debate and what has been happening with the Navy, charging Her Majesty's ships light dues would go down like a lead balloon. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, touched on yachts. It can be argued that yachtsmen have just as little need for those navigational aids now as larger ships. They all use GPS these days if they are to go offshore, so they know where they are all the time and do not necessarily need those extra aids. Yachts are not earning money as commercial ships are. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, touched on how one can charge yachtsmen. That is probably the stumbling block. It would be almost impossible, short of full yacht registration, which I do not believe the Government want. Finding a way of charging yachtsmen, whatever the actual method of charging, would cost more than the money that would be realised. We are talking about only £2 million to £2.5 million at the most, which would not make a big blip compared with £70 million.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para52"></a>Contributions to the Irish Government have been mentioned. It will be interesting to see the results of the latest review. There is an argument for keeping lights&#151;I must also mention the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, which is in a similar position&#151;whereby services are provided without government money. It may be of interest to know that both France and Holland have approached Trinity House for information on "the user pays" system for light dues. That is a real step in the right direction and I hope that something comes from that.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para53"></a>Another argument against central funding comes from something that happened recently across the Channel, where the French Government have suddenly cut 25 per cent off the budget of the French general lighthouse authority. The cut is of such an extent that the authority has had to lay out tenders and it simply cannot afford to service some of its navigational aids. I suggest that that is not a road we should go down.

My interest in the matter, as the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, said, is as a former lighthouse keeper. I was born and brought up in the service of the Northern Lighthouse Board. Most of my comments will reflect the NLB rather than the other two general lighthouse authorities because I am more familiar with that board.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para55"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Geddes, was quite right when he said that a Select Committee in 1834 had recommended that navigational aids be paid from the public purse. Something of the same was said by another Select Committee more up to date in 1845&#151;and even more recently in 2003. That does not mean that they are correct in their analysis, but it is clear that the issue of light dues has been a talking point since the three statutory general lighthouse authorities were set up.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para56"></a>Ship owners are a pretty hard-nosed lot&#151;it comes with the territory and one does not blame them for, if I can use the metaphor, "wanting the penny and the bun". They would always have preferred the taxpayer to pay the Bill for lighting our shores&#151;and when that was not on offer, at one time they wanted to control GLAs because they held that the GLAs were inefficient. But to bring history more up to date than the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, the Royal Commission on Lighthouse Administration, reporting in 1908, put it that the possibility of shipping companies controlling GLAs would be a very unusual proceeding indeed because ship owners would be interested only in the most frequented trade routes rather than the wider interests of providing sufficient sea marks around our coasts.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para57"></a>The issue has moved on. It is said by some that lighthouses and other aids to navigation are no longer necessary and used by shipping, given the modern state-of-the-art bridges and vessels equipped with electronic charts and global navigation satellite systems. It is said that there is no need to impose on shipping what they regard as that tax and the cost should be transferred to the taxpayers as these traditional navigational aids are now used only by leisure users. Of course, as in the past, the accusation is still made that general lighthouse authorities are not efficient operations.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para58"></a>Ship owners and ports have an arguable point. It is important for UK plc that we do not lose business to the continent. But I submit that the transfer of light <P>


<a name="column_661"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 661</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>dues to the taxpayers is not the way in which the matter should be addressed. It will not stop transhipment by smaller vessels from highly efficient ports such as Rotterdam. It will not increase the numbers of post-panamax vessels coming into the UK. There is a huge availability of coastal vessels on the continent and a lack of berths in the UK ports for post-panamax vessels to come here. And I am afraid that that is a fact of life.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para59"></a>Let me try to deal with three issues: funding; the efficiency of the GLAs; and the future of aids to navigation. First, everyone wants to offload costs onto the taxpayers. We see it every day and hear it in this House and in another place all the time&#151;until the time comes for one to pay one's own bill. Witness higher education. It appears that everyone with a school-age child would like the taxpayers to pick up the bill for university education&#151;not to mention some politicians, whose motives are much less clear.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para60"></a>However, that is not the real world. There is a limit to what the public purse will bear. And what of the charge that transfer to general taxation will put our ports on an equal footing with the rest of the world? As the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, said, it is not true that light dues are a system peculiar to the United Kingdom and Ireland. He confirmed what I understood to be the position: if one takes the majority of coastal states in the developed world, about one third charge light dues, one third have a mix and one third fund it wholly from taxation. Like the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, I would be amazed if France, Holland and Germany do not manage to lose their aids to navigation costs and other charges. That is much easier to do, of course, given the smaller coastlines of two of those three countries. Contrast that with the Scottish and Manx coasts, which are the statutory area of the Northern Lighthouse Board, where there are 10,000 kilometres of coast; 790 islands; 198 lighthouses; 131 buoys; 41 beacons; 22 racons; four differential global positioning satellite stations; and most of the offshore oil installations in UK waters.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para61"></a>Most of all, I oppose the transfer to the taxpayer for the same reason that to this day the Royal National Lifeboat Institution is funded by voluntary contributions. It was always held in the fishing, crofting and maritime communities where I was brought up that if the RNLI were funded by taxation and transferred to, say, what is now the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Treasury would be quick to look for savings. Lifeboat stations would be closed on economic grounds and the absolute raison d'entre of lifesaving would be compromised. That same view holds true today in the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. As a case in point, there are not too many coastguard stations left. There are very few eyes watching the sea.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para62"></a>I believe that the same would happen to lighthouses as aids to navigation if transferred to the taxpayer. I believe that we have had an indication from the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, as to what is happening on the French coasts. The motto of two of the three general lighthouse authorities is In Salutem Omnium, which for the non-Latin scholars among us means "For the <P>


<a name="column_662"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 662</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>safety of all". I believe that that motto would be quickly made redundant if the matter was passed to general taxation.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para63"></a>As regards efficiency, as I have said the 1908 Royal Commission rejected the charges then of inefficiency, which left it with very few recommendations to make. Coming on many years, in my own experience there was no profligacy in the lighthouse service. I can well remember annual storing requisitions coming back full of red ink, deleting almost everything that we had asked for that the superintendents thought&#151;no, knew&#151;was unnecessary for the efficient running of the station. There was no chance of that extra boiler suit, extra pot of red lead or an extra few fathoms of rope. As I recall, there was never much shortage of Brasso. But there was efficiency.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para64"></a>The standard that we operated to was nothing but that the best was good enough. Even so, the service today bears absolutely no resemblance to my experience. It would be easy to be sentimental, but I can be as hard nosed as anyone. Today, there are no lighthouse-keepers; the solarisation programme is leading to huge cost savings and at many of the lights is obviating the need even for part-time attendants. The Northern Lighthouse Board has closed bases at Leith, Granton and Stromness. They have a wholly automatic and remote telemetry-operated service. They have two ships instead of four and one of those is a smaller, although a very capable, buoy tender.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para65"></a>Ships used to be kept for 30 or more years, but they are now worked so hard that already plans are in hand to replace the not-so-old NLB "Pharos". The use of helicopters working with a helicopter-capable ship has transformed the economics in servicing and storing lights and in reducing ship and crew complements.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para66"></a>The same process, as we have heard, has applied in the Trinity House Lighthouse Service and in the Irish Lights. There is close co-operation between the three general lighthouse authorities. When I was on the Isle of Mull last summer the Irish Lights ILV "Granuiale" was working in the Sound of Mull. I understand that both NLB ships were in Irish waters last year and Trinity House ships have been seen in Scottish waters. That is as it should be. The GLAs are working together to replace NLB "Pharos" and THV "Mermaid" to a common design based on the Irish Lights "Granuiale", again reducing costs with common ships with a smaller crew complement.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para67"></a>The Northern Lighthouse Board has certified to ISO 900l:2000 obtained at the first time of asking last year and that, as noble Lords will know, is an internationally recognised standard in business management practices.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para68"></a>Costs continue to be reduced and efficiencies increased in all three services, which are to the benefit of all who sail in our waters. That has enabled light dues to be reduced from 46 pence per tonne a few years ago to 40 pence per tonne. There is now the new tonnage cap at 40,000 tonnes.
<P>


<a name="column_663"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 663</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para69"></a>I turn briefly to the continuing need for aids to navigation. There seems to be a fiction that if only some shipping companies were listened to then some lights could be extinguished. The truth of the matter is that GLAs have in depth discussions and consultation with commercial and leisure users. They have good working relationships with bodies such as the Chamber of Shipping. Yes, some lights may be discontinued where they are solely used for waypoint navigation. But for the remainder&#151;and that is the majority&#151;lighthouses will continue to be part of the aid to navigation mix for the foreseeable future, not least probably for the next 20 years or so. That is going to include lights, beacons, floating aids, buoys, perhaps some audible signals, racons and terrestrial and satellite navigation.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para70"></a>At present the GNSS is not wholly reliable, and given the mix of equipment on bridges and the mix of quality and training of watchkeeping officers on the bridges, it is essential that there is comprehensive back-up to the seafarer. That is not just for the sake of the mariner, the ship and the cargo but for that of the environment.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para71"></a>For example, on the environment, the report of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, Safer Ships: Cleaner Seas, led to the construction of new lights to the west of the Outer Hebrides during the past few years. Some former major lights have been downgraded; some have been discontinued. That will have been done in consultation with users. At present, Tor Ness lighthouse in Orkney is being upgraded&#151;obviously in agreement with users&#151;to a major light.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para72"></a>So we are a long way from the demise of aids to navigation. They are as vital as ever and they need to be funded. How do we do that? As I said, my view is not that we should transfer the cost to the taxpayer. The Question tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, is along the right lines: how can the cost be fairly redistributed? I have no objection to leisure craft paying up. I know that there are difficulties with a licensing system, but I do not believe that people should be able to go to the boatyard, buy a cruiser or yacht and set sail without a licence or demonstration of qualification or competence of any kind. With a licence could perhaps come light dues. There is no reason why ferry companies should not pay up; I would not even mind if the taxpayer had some involvement through the Royal Navy and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para73"></a>My time is up, so I shall leave my speech there, but I want to welcome my noble friend to his new brief&#151;this is a rather esoteric subject for his first outing, but I look forward to hearing what he has to say.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_time5"></a><H5>9.6 p.m.</st></H5>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-16_spnew7"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   My Lords, it is always a pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord MacKenzie of Culkein, who speaks with such personal authority. I add my welcome to the Treasury Bench to the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, who will make his maiden speech in answer to the Question. I wonder how he will <P>


<a name="column_664"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 664</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>deal with the requirement not to be controversial. Perhaps he will agree with everything that the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, said. We will find out. I am certain that he will say whatever he has to say non-controversially.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para74"></a>I start by reminding the House that during the 1980s I was a member of the now-defunct Royal Naval Auxiliary Service in the seaman's branch and as such used and trained on the lights, beacons, marks and buoys around the shores of Britain, Ireland and the Channel Islands. The RNXS was equipped with radar and echo-sounders, but insisted on its seamen being trained on traditional navigational methods&#151;largely by looking out of the porthole but also by taking visual fixes and subsequently plotting the course on a chart. The lights were well named&#151;Skerrybore, Dubh Aach and Muckle Hugga&#151;and many are correctly celebrated as part of our built heritage.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para75"></a>This is by no means the first time that this subject has been debated in Parliament. I, too, read the same briefing material and learnt that Select Committees have been urging changes since at least 1834. Yet there seems to have been little movement. Perhaps the reason for that is that, on the face of it, light dues as currently determined are fairly easily collected in large amounts from relatively few companies, therefore meeting one of the canons of taxation&#151;that it should be collectable.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para76"></a>Other noble Lords have dealt with the general inequity of the current scheme and its potentially harmful effect on the economics of the shipping industry. I reinforce that economic disbenefit, which may harm the development of tourism in the form of visits to Scotland, say, by cruise liners. My honourable friend Viscount Thurso MP has cited the difficulty that Scrabster Harbour Trust has had in developing that trade. That is a good complaint, because many cruise passengers would like to visit the nearby Castle of May, if not other areas of Caithness. If light dues are harmful to the development of tourism, that adds to the demand for a change in the financing of navigation aids.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para77"></a>On the subject of Ireland, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, the subsidy to the Government of Ireland is presumably a hang-over from the treaty negotiations in 1921, and may need to be viewed in the same context as the four treaty ports, which expired in 1938. I suspect that the British negotiators did not trust the evolving Irish free state to maintain the lights properly. Ireland is central to the western approaches to England, Wales and Southern Scotland, so I am not surprised by the concern to ensure the Irish lights. The recent success of the Irish economy has reduced the likelihood of a failure to finance the Irish lights. However, I am not surprised that the Government of Ireland are dragging their feet over assuming responsibility for their lights. It reminds me of the attempt by the Danish Crown to pay off the mortgage on Orkney and Shetland. Curiously, the Scottish Crown regularly developed acute selective deafness.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para78"></a>I look forward to hearing the Minister's answer to the most apt question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Geddis. Will he admit that the Government will implement their proposals in opposition, full-steam ahead, or have they rung down to "dead slow ahead" and recanted?
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para79"></a>The issue is one of subsidy, which is paid at present by a few large shippers for the benefit of many others. That subsidy is certainly collectable but may result in harm to our economy. The choice facing Government seems to be one of either extending the range and scope of subsidy collection to most users&#151;the leisure sector and possibly even the Royal Navy&#151;or abolishing light dues and absorbing the subsidy into general taxation. Shipping and marine recreation both contribute to our economy, so the cost of providing lights, beacons and marks&#151;navigational aids&#151;can be seen as a national interest and hence suitable to receive funding from general taxation.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_time6"></a><H5>9.12 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-16_spnew8"></A><B> Viscount Astor: </B>   My Lords, I am very grateful to my noble friend Lord Geddis for introducing the debate. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, who is the new Minister, will have to make an uncontroversial speech on a controversial subject, as the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, said, so we wish him luck. Having been deeply involved in the Labour Party over the past few years, the noble Lord is uniquely placed to cast light on his party's policy in this area, which is clouded with mystery.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para80"></a>Perhaps I may start by taking the noble Lord back to a day that I am sure he remembers, 2 May 1996, when his colleague in another place, Graham Allen, talked about light duties. Mr Allen said that his plan would be to have the matter reviewed by the European Commission to minimise its impact on the competitiveness of UK ports. He said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Light dues is one instance where the UK is adopting a different position to its European partners, and we need to establish consistency".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para81"></a>
Whether the cost would be paid for by the taxpayer, as in other European countries, remains to be seen.
Mr Allen added:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"In addition, on the Continent there is evidence of substantial payments from state governments for basic infrastructure, such as new quays and container terminals, and even subsidies for basic conservancy services, such as pilotage, navigational aids and dredging. Labour should consider pressing for a more rigorous enforcement by the European Union of the provisions to prevent unfair subsidies and to ensure that fair competition operates within the single European market".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para82"></a>
He continued:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We should look at pressing for the EC"&#151;
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para83"></a>
I suspect that he meant "EU"&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to publish its fact finding studies in this area, e.g. transparency of accounts and abuse of monopoly. A formalised and effective system of identifying sources of national aid is needed, covering both established sources of aid and 'one-off' contributions".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para84"></a>
Those are stirring words from someone in opposition. We must look at them and ask: what has happened, where have we got to, and what have the Government done since those words were spoken? It is a perplexing subject.
<P>


<a name="column_666"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 666</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para85"></a>We have some great expertise on the subject. The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, has talked about the difference between port dues and light dues, and the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, on the Cross Benches, has shared with us his usual expertise in shipping matters. The noble Lord, Lord MacKenzie of Culkein, who is an acknowledged expert on lighthouses, confirmed that, as far back as 1834, there was pressure for navigational aids to be paid for from the public purse. He then took us further forward to about 1908, a step further than my noble friend Lord Geddes got in his speech.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para86"></a>In 2002, the Government launched a consultation on the possibility of reform. The consultation document stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The UK Government remains committed to a cost recovery system. It does not believe that taxpayers . . .  should meet the costs of providing aids to navigation for shipping. The DTLR wishes to consult light dues payers and the users of marine aids to navigation on how the system costs should be met by existing charge payers. The consultation will also consider whether charging can be extended to other users and/or redistributed among existing payers".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para87"></a>
Again, that was modest progress.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para88"></a>Unfortunately, in March 2003, the Transport Minister in another place, Mr David Jamieson, took the opportunity to make what was, in one sense, quite a good move by announcing the freezing of light dues rates for 2003&#150;04. He also commented on the Government's consultation and said that what had emerged had been "inconclusive" and that "no consensus" had emerged on a way forward. The Minister then announced that further work would be carried out.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para89"></a>Where have we got to? What is the answer? Some weeks ago, I had the good fortune to ask the noble Lord, Lord Bassam of Brighton, what the Government's policy was. With his usual good manners and deftness, he dodged the question, so I look forward to hearing this evening where we have got to. Some interesting points have been brought up, particularly the Irish issue, which is important. The Transport Select Committee in another place noted that 70 per cent of the expenditure of the Commissioners of Irish Lights related to the provision of aids to navigation in the Republic of Ireland. It is clear that the Government of this country funds a large amount of the costs incurred by the Irish Republic. Luckily, the Government have realised that, and they have got on to it. They have said:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The UK is seeking to renegotiate the current agreement to require Ireland to meet the full costs of their aids to navigation. Discussions with FCO and Irish Government are ongoing, but progress is slow".&#151;[Official Report, Commons, 14/10/03; col. 171W.]
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-16_para90"></a>
We know that the Foreign Office has many things on its plate. I suspect that the discussion of light dues is not terribly high on the Foreign Secretary's agenda, but we can live in hope.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para91"></a>The Transport Select Committee said that light dues were inconsistent with those in other European countries and distorted competition. It also said that the Government should reconsider the entire concept <P>


<a name="column_667"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 667</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of light dues. It supported the Government's aim to end the subsidy to the Republic of Ireland. Do the Government agree with the Select Committee's report? It would be interesting to hear.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para92"></a>I did a little background research. As far as I can see, the European countries that are wholly funded by the levy are Belgium, Greece, Ireland and the United Kingdom; those funded by a mixture are Finland, Norway and Sweden; and those funded by the exchequer are Denmark, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. There is no consistent policy in Europe.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para93"></a>I cannot leave the subject without saying that we have all received many briefings on the subject, particularly from the Chamber of Shipping, as well as suggestions on how more people should contribute. As the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, pointed out, the difficulty is that they all have said that everyone should contribute. But they have not pointed to a successful way in which that could be raised and how those who have a yacht could be forced to pay.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para94"></a>I should love to declare an interest that I own a yacht. Sadly, I think that a 21-foot boat with an outboard motor probably counts only as a boat rather than as a yacht. I am rather disappointed to acknowledge that to noble Lords. But I am ever hopeful that one day, with one more lottery ticket, I may be able to move up to something large enough to call itself a yacht. I am not entirely sure how large that would be.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para95"></a>It is quite difficult to extend light dues to a great number of other sectors because I do not believe that there is a satisfactory way in which to collect the money. We look forward to the Minister's response and some clearer understanding of what the Government's policy is on this subject.

<A NAME="40114-16_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Triesman: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may start by expressing the deep sense of honour and privilege that I feel on being made a Member of this House. I am well aware of the fact that I have joined a Chamber in which there is an exceptional body of knowledge and a remarkable gathering of experience. I doubt that there is an equivalent in any legislature anywhere that can match it. That makes the honour, of course, both special and particularly daunting.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para96"></a>So it is with some trepidation that I contemplate what I shall be able to add to the sum of knowledge that is concentrated here. All that I can do is to try my best both for this House and for the Labour Government, which I have the opportunity to serve. I thank noble Lords of all parties, and the Cross-Benchers, who have been very welcoming and very helpful. I certainly thank those who have offered their help and advice. I shall presume on those kind offers; I shall need all the help and advice that I can get, especially if I am to try to remain non-controversial.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para97"></a>The very first kindness that I was given was in the first letter that I received. It was from the House of Lords Yacht Club, which I took to be some kind of induction into this debate. My thanks for all of that. The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, has promised me some late-night debates on this subject. I look forward to them with great enthusiasm. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, has already made reference to owning some type of vessel. I must tell the House that I do not think that I own anything more than 21 feet long.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para98"></a>I turn now to the intriguing discussion that we are having today on the safety of our wonderful coastline&#151;10,500 miles of it in the United Kingdom alone&#151;and to the shipping industries and the leisure users mentioned in this debate. I thank noble Lords for their expert consideration of the issues. In particular, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, for securing the debate. I am glad to feel that I am contributing to a debate that has lasted approximately 170 years. It is always nice to know that there is some durability in a subject.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para99"></a>I welcome the opportunity to respond to the interesting comments that have been made. As has been mentioned, the Government undertook a review of light dues in 2002. We approached all classes of users and sought views on restructuring the charge. We made it clear right from that point that we were committed to retaining the charge, but that we would be happy to review the effects on various classes of users. Safety at sea is the overriding issue of importance to us. Lights contribute to the safe passage of vessels and the safety of mariners, while also safeguarding the environment and cargoes from risk of hazard.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para100"></a>I was very interested to hear the noble Lord, Lord Greenway, talk about what has happened in France&#151;an issue that I have promised to study. I shall also draw on the experience of the noble Lord, Lord Mackenzie, and his very perceptive comments that the critical issues and the critical values in all of this are about life saving and the safety of people. I do not think that I have ever had the chance to discuss such a matter with a lighthouse keeper. Since there are so few left and their numbers are declining, it may be the last occasion on which I shall have a chance to do so. But the core of it surely was right.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para101"></a>The response received during the government review has been disappointing. There were 158 responses. The split was roughly 25 from merchant shipping, 14 from fishing vessels and 63 from pleasure craft. The remaining 56 represented the port authorities, the cargo industry and individual responses. A number of the responses came from organisations representing a number of users, such as the Royal Yachting Association, the Chamber of Shipping and the National Federation of Fisheries Organisations. There was little by way of consensus in how the costs should be split. Well, that is not strictly true. There was general agreement on all sides that someone else should meet the costs. The pleasure users were generally convinced that the aids to navigation were mostly designed to meet commercial needs. The commercial users felt that their ships were better <P>


<a name="column_669"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column 669</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>equipped and relied much less on traditional aids to navigation&#151;lighthouses, buoys and beacons. The pleasure users did not accept that view. Overall, while we were grateful for the significant contributions to the debate, we had to conclude that the exercise has not shown a new approach to the structure of the charge.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para102"></a>There was another area of agreement. Many people would like the Exchequer to meet the costs. We do not accept that view. We are committed to a cost recovery system. The charge distributes the costs among users. It is cost-effective to collect, with a running cost of 1.5 per cent of the amounts collected. I agree with my noble friend, Lord Mackenzie of Culkein, that it is unlikely to distort competition. Taxation is familiar in this form in roughly a third of the major coastal states. The noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, has made a very important point about the possible distinctiveness of tourism. That is likely to be considered in the review and I shall certainly be asking that question.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para103"></a>However, we see no justification for the Exchequer taking on the costs. Despite frequent claims that elsewhere in Europe aids to navigation are state-aided, the UK is far from unique in operating such a system. The noble Viscount, Lord Astor, is right on the distribution of countries. In Europe alone, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Spain also fund aids to navigation by a levy on shipping, and Sweden and Finland raise some of the costs in this way. Many member states make other charges, such as piloting charges that are higher in European ports, balancing out the light dues costs of the United Kingdom. In any case, we are different from many other EU states&#151;we are an island whose coastlines border many of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. The noble Lord, Lord Greenway, is quite right to say that in many of those cases there are also local taxes which are very much harder to detect.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para104"></a>I have been asked to comment on where we are. I shall do my best. I am hopeful that, in due course, we will learn where the Opposition are, as a reciprocal arrangement to understand their policies. In March 2003, the Minister for Shipping announced that the department would undertake a study of the economic effect of light dues. The terms of reference were discussed with users. The study is being guided by a steering committee that includes representatives from all classes of user. The consultants have used the response to the department's review in developing their proposals. As I have stated, the report will be published following completion of the study, expected at the end of January. It will need careful consideration. That means it will probably be too late for any recommendations to be put in place in time for the new financial year. But we will make an initial announcement in March when the light dues rates for 2004&#150;05 are announced. We aim to establish charges in discussion with the industry that can be sustained over significant periods&#151;at least three years. We will also publish the responses to the earlier review on the DfT website, with copies available in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="40114-16_para105"></a>Good progress is being made on the programme of work also announced at that time. A new collection system will come into operation in April 2004. This will provide an electronic method of collecting light dues, permitting direct payment and removing the paperwork. It is expected to reduce costs and to open up the possibility of greater variations in the charging system. The review of the future requirements of aids to navigation will get under way once the conclusions of the economic study are known and fully evaluated so that they can be taken into account at that time. We remain fully committed to renegotiating the current arrangements with Ireland to meet the full costs of its aids to navigation and we shall work closely with the FCO and the Irish Government to achieve this objective. Work is proceeding.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para106"></a>We accept that the current charging system may not be ideal since many users pay nothing. But as has been pointed out in the debate, reductions in the rates have been made during the past 10 years. The last increase was made in 1993 and reductions were made in 1997 and 2002. We shall continue to look at the charging structure and the economic study.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para107"></a>I do not wish to pre-empt any part of that study, but changes must be cost-effective to operate. It is for that reason we feel that, although it is not an impossibility, the idea of making a significant change in relation to leisure and pleasure craft is extremely unlikely. As my noble friend Lord Berkeley pointed out, it is more than likely that the overall costs of trying to implement such charges would far exceed any of the benefits. Collecting the money would be a hugely complex exercise. Indeed, the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, made essentially the same point.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para108"></a>It is quite easy to criticise any charging scheme. Any replacement of the present structure must be cost-effective and efficient if it is not to make matters more difficult. The light dues system has its advantages and has broadly worked in its current form for 150 years. It is cost-effective to collect and it funds one of the best navigation aid systems and services in the world.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para109"></a>Of course there are disparities in payments, and I have been asked by the noble Lord, Lord Geddes, to comment on them. However, the system covers the whole of the United Kingdom and Ireland and it is important that the service overall is integrated. I would also point out that the reserve is kept for various purposes, such as for pensions, variations in income and to meet statutory requirements in relation to activities such as the surveying and marking of wrecks. I do not suggest that the reserve could not be reduced. That is a possibility, but it must be retained to meet essential developments such as new ships, depot redevelopment and other activities which are key to the safety features which I described in my opening comments.
<P>

<a name="40114-16_para110"></a>We shall approach change with caution and I hope that I have indicated that there is every intention to ensure that we proceed rapidly and achieve the changes necessary.

<A NAME="40114-17_spmin0"></A><B>The Deputy Chairman of Committees   (Lord Carter): </B>  Before we start this afternoon's proceedings I shall say a word about the microphones. Hansard's record of the Grand Committee's proceedings is produced from a tape recording. It is very important that when speaking Members should speak as near as possible to a microphone. It may be necessary for some Members of the Committee, particularly those sitting at the second row of tables, to move from their seats to the nearest microphone before beginning to speak. It would also help the engineers who are making the recording if, as far as possible, Members could avoid either touching or moving the microphones.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-17_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain </B>   moved Amendment No. 50:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>Page 5, line 13, after "purposes" insert "as if it were"
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-17_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40114-17_para7"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 50 is grouped with Amendments Nos. 51 and 52. In essence, I am taking issue with the pretence that a man can become a woman for "all purposes". Yesterday we touched on the fact that Clause 9 states that a person who has a gender recognition certificate,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"becomes for all purposes the acquired gender (so that, if the acquired gender is the male gender, the person's sex becomes that of a man and, if it is the female gender, the person's sex becomes that of a woman)".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-17_para8"></a>
The Minister reminded the Committee of the judgment in the Goodwin case which says that we must legislate to give transsexuals the right to change their birth certificates and to marry.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para9"></a>Even if that is the case&#151;some of us say that Parliament is still sovereign and we do not have to legislate just because an overseas court says so&#151;it does not mean that this Bill has to go to the extremes chosen by the Government; for example, to attempt to say in law that a man is for all purposes a woman is patently <P>


<a name="column_GC64"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC64</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>absurd. Yesterday my noble friend Lord Tebbit undertook the admirable job of exposing the madness at the heart of the Bill, such as the extraordinary mental acrobatics that people are required to go through to pretend that a man is a woman and a woman is a man, despite all the evidence to the contrary.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para10"></a>These amendments would at least have the virtue of allowing some leeway for people's consciences. Rather than being told by law that a man's sex becomes that of a woman, under these amendments the law would say that the man's sex becomes as if it were that of a woman. That recognises that there is a mental jump required from the factual reality to the legal reality. There must be room for many people who simply cannot, in all conscience, go along with that.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para11"></a>At the moment there is an example in the news of a BBC programme in which a transsexual man was referred to as a man. Press for Change, the transsexual rights group is campaigning for the BBC always to refer to transsexuals in their chosen gender. That is indicative of the Orwellian nightmare that the Bill encourages. Will people who refuse to call a transsexual man a woman routinely face that kind of hostility? Given what we established yesterday, which is that the Government believe that many people change their minds and revert to their real gender, or oscillate between the two, how are people to know which gender a person wants to be known as at any particular time? I say again that it is absurd to say that a man can become for all purposes a woman or vice versa.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para12"></a>Let us take the example of a woman who obtains a gender recognition certificate, but who does not undergo the surgery. She may be married and, under the Government's proposals, may convert her marriage to a civil partnership. After she receives a certificate declaring that she is for all purposes a man, she and her husband may decide to have a baby; she becomes pregnant; she is booked into a hospital as Mr Smith&#151;the first man to have a baby&#151;and the hospital in all its dealings with her must treat her as a man. Are there not privacy issues for other women in a maternity ward having to share with a man? What about her employers? Presumably, they are not obliged to give her maternity leave as she is, for all purposes, a man. Men do not get maternity leave.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para13"></a>This is really lurid tabloid headline stuff, I agree, but the Government are leaving themselves wide open to that because they are so much in thrall to transsexual rights advocacy groups. The Government are taking into account their views, and theirs alone, in proposing the Bill. I hope that we shall begin to see some willingness on the part of the Government to think again. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-17_spmin1"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs   (Lord Filkin): </B>  On our second day, I regret that I need to qualify or clarify one or two of the remarks made by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, who has made a very powerful contribution. I certainly did not say that the Government's position was that many people change <P>


<a name="column_GC65"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC65</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>their minds or oscillate between the two; I was explicit in quoting the percentage as about 1 per cent. I do not see that as captured by the way in which the noble Baroness referred to my remarks.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para14"></a>I am sorry that I have to speak like this, but I would have hoped that it was reasonably apparent by now that, while it is right and proper for the Government to consult and involve groups with direct interests, we have gone out of our way in this Bill to consider its effects on wider society. The process of publishing a draft Bill was part of that effort, and this is a classic example of a Bill that has benefited from the draft Bill process. I would not use the term "bending over backwards", but we have been seriously keen to engage with a variety of interests who have concerns. Where we may differ is in the fact that, as we have made clear, we see a duty to respond and legislate in law and a duty in terms of a civilised society to protect the rights of minorities. I regret that the noble Baroness and I, who have been on the same side on previous Bills, are not on the same side on this one&#151;but that is how it is.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para15"></a>On the specifics of what she said, I shall explain why it is neither appropriate nor necessary to agree with her amendments. I could spend a lot of time, but it would not help her or others in the Committee if I repeated the good discussions that we had yesterday&#151;and I thought that yesterday we had a first-class Committee day. Noble Lords know why we believe that it is necessary to legislate, why we are doing so, and the manner in which we are doing so.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para16"></a>Essentially, the Bill recognises a change of gender and gives it legal effect in certain circumstances and after a proper process. A person in law cannot be more than one gender: they are either male or female, and that is a fact of law. Therefore, although I know what the noble Baroness is getting at, the use of the words, "as if it were", is a way of signalling her distaste for the Bill&#151;and, perhaps, that of others. It adds nothing in the law, except perhaps to convey some gratuitous offence to other people. Therefore, I very much hope that she will not think it necessary to press for those words here and now, having well registered the areas in which she is out of harmony or sympathy with the Bill. They add nothing in law, but they do cause offence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-17_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   Well, I thank the Minister. I did not say yesterday how grateful I was that he saw me last Monday and wrote to me. In view of the fact that I believe that we have a very good relationship, I am sorry that he would even consider that I would want to cause gratuitous offence to anyone. It is not in my nature, and I have never done it. It may be that I have offended people, but totally unwillingly&#151;certainly not gratuitously.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para17"></a>The purpose of the amendments and all my contributions to this Bill, including those at Second Reading, is not to cause offence to anybody. I have absolutely no problem at all with transsexuals&#151;that is their choice. What I do have a problem with is getting my mind round the idea that, when God created man <P>


<a name="column_GC66"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC66</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>and woman he created that man and woman, and that a man cannot be a woman and a woman cannot be a man. That is the whole essence of the Bill, of course. However, having said that, we go further. Without wishing to go over old ground, as I said yesterday, my reason for getting involved in this Bill is that I am concerned that the House of Lords should continue to carry out its rightful responsibilities in ensuring that any legislation proposed&#151;whether Private Member's Bill, public Bill or government Bill&#151;is gone over properly by those who feel deeply about issues based on experience and expertise. I have no expertise regarding transsexuals but I do have experience&#151;as do we all&#151;in social relations and experience of being an employer and employee. I am also a committed member of the Church. From that basis it is absolutely right that we should speak about these subjects.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para18"></a>Based on that experience, I have a horrible feeling that, if this Bill as it stands becomes law, the law of unintended consequences will come in in spades. The problem is that we do not know. Yesterday, we heard that the medical evidence was unproven&#151;or, if not unproven, then unsubstantiated or not thoroughly accepted, although I cannot for the life of me remember the phrase. The fact that we have that view means that we are leaving ourselves wide open to create laws that have problems in their very nature and right from the very start. That is what I seek to point out. I do not seek to create gratuitous offence. I feel very deeply about this issue.
<P>

<a name="40114-17_para19"></a>I will read what the Minister said. I know that I cannot press the amendment because we are in Grand Committee, but I want to place my feelings on record and I cannot promise that I will not return to the matter on Report. In the light of that, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40114-18_para1"></a>The noble Baroness said: I was asked at the last minute to speak to the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit. On many issues&#151;not all, but certainly in some of the descriptive prose that he used yesterday&#151;I have disassociated myself right from the start. However, these amendments require birth certificates to disclose sex change. The amendments focus our attention again on the question of third parties, to which I briefly referred just now.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para2"></a>The Minister says quite openly that this Bill is primarily about the rights of transsexuals. That came out loud and clear yesterday. Yesterday, it was indicated that even the children and spouses of such people are to be regarded as having no rights under this gender recognition legislation. I hope that the Minister <P>


<a name="column_GC67"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC67</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>will reconsider what he said about that and will think much more deeply about the other people who are affected by this.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para3"></a>The amendments would make sure that other people would be entitled to know about a person's sex change. They reverse the approach taken by the Bill. Rather than compelling the General Register Office to keep a person's sex change secret, they require that all birth certificates should be marked to indicate a sex change has taken place and to allow the gender recognition register to be open to public inspection. I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit. There is a public interest in people being allowed to discover if a gender recognition certification has taken place. There are circumstances in which it is important to know for a whole variety of personal reasons and reasons of moral or religious conviction. I will have more to say about that later.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para4"></a>I know that the Minister is not going to accept these amendments. My noble friend Lord Tebbit yesterday referred to his mind-reading skills and I think his premonition that the Minister would not accept his amendments applies to all of them. But I should like the Minister to answer this question: does the Goodwin judgment specifically require the United Kingdom to make it impossible for third parties to discover whether a person has changed his gender in law? I beg to move.

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-18_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I shall speak generally and then return to the specific question at the end of my speech. At the heart of the Bill is the Government's clear view that, irrespective of what the courts say, it is right to allow people, who&#151;there is clear evidence&#151;profoundly believe that they are of another gender to that of their birth gender, to live their lives in peace and quiet. Therefore, we spoke yesterday about the process by which that is validated.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para5"></a>The second part of the situation is also relevant; that is, trying to ensure that the person who has made a gender change, and has had that recognised by the state, is then able to live in privacy and quiet without harassment. That seems to me and to the Government to be an important objective of the Bill. If one wants a clear example of why that is so, I refer to the article in the Guardian on Monday. It reported on the tragic case of a young woman who committed suicide after experiencing about 15 years of harassment by others in her community because she had changed her gender. It is an unfortunate fact that some people behave in that way and cause misery to people who through no fault of their own are living their lives as they believe it to be true and right.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para6"></a>That is a good enough reason why we think that the provision is necessary. It is absolutely crucial that we allow people the freedom to live their lives in private when it is right to do so. There is no general advantage for such issues to be publicised which allows those who might cause mischief and misery the freedom to do so.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para7"></a>However, there must be exceptions to that position. We talked about one at Second Reading; we talked about another yesterday. The first limit is that clearly <P>


<a name="column_GC68"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC68</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the detection and the prevention of crime make it essential that the criminal investigation agencies are able to find out whether there has been a change of name. I hope I spoke clearly enough on that issue at Second Reading; such that the original birth record will be accessible to the police and the Criminal Records Bureau, so that there is no possibility of people being able to avoid crime or being brought to justice as a second consequence.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para8"></a>The second exception we talked about was how we believed that it was perfectly possible for children and grandchildren, knowing the name and birth date of the parent or grandparent who had undergone a sex change, to be able to obtain a copy of the birth certificate. Therefore, we could not see a need to put anything on the face of the Bill, as that seemed perfectly possible. We agreed with the spokesman for the Opposition when he signalled why he believed that there were circumstances when a child or grandchild might want to do so.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para9"></a>To put the provision in such a way would make the information accessible at large to anyone who wished to cause mischief and misery. We believe that that is wrong.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-18_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I thank the Minister. My noble friend Lord Tebbit was quite right about mind-reading skills. I know that he will probably be disappointed by the noble Lord's reply. I can see the point of the two exceptions; first, the Criminal Records Bureau and the police; and, secondly, the one regarding children and grandchildren. We spoke about that yesterday. Will either of those exceptions be on the face of the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-18_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   No, because there is no need. One does not put again into legislation what is already in legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-18_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I shall check on that. It is not that for one moment do I think that the Minister is trying to pull the wool over my eyes, but it is something on which I need to be clear. I am sure that my noble friend Lord Tebbit will also wish to be clear on that. He apologises for being unable to be here today. I should have mentioned that at the beginning. In the circumstances, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<FONT SIZE=3>details pertaining to an entry in the gender recognition register would be inaccessible to them. That is not the case for other records such as Cabinet records, war records and census returns which all become available after a designated length of time. We have suggested a period of 75 years after the initial date of entry. Surely the same logic applies to the gender recognition register. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-18_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </B>   If this amendment is accepted in principle, a period of 75 years is not enough. I do not know how many 100 year-olds there are in this country now but I am fairly confident that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, will be able to tell me the current number. It will run into four figures. In 75 years' time that may include people who receive their certificate and are still alive. There are two self-evident ways of dealing with that. One is to have a longer period of years and the other is to exclude people who are still living.

<A NAME="40114-18_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions   (Baroness Hollis of Heigham): </B>  The noble Lord, Lord Carlile, made a helpful contribution that anticipated what I was going to say.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para13"></a>A consultation period on civil registration records as such finished at the end of October 2003, a major part of which sought views on the ways in which records of births, deaths and marriages should be held and accessed.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para14"></a>Under the current system records are held in separate registers which hold "snapshots" of life events, but nothing more. The gender recognition register is being set up within this framework. It is proposed to move to a system where records are updated to provide a thorough life record for each individual.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para15"></a>Currently, no civil registration registers are open for public inspection or search once they are filed and access to information in the records is available only by identifying the record you want and buying a certificate. It is proposed that records will be computerised and open access will be provided to historic records&#151;wearing my historian's hat I am obviously rather pleased about that&#151;while more modern records will be available, but that access to certain fields, such as addresses, will be restricted to the individual to whom the record relates or to their family, for example.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para16"></a>Many of the responses to the consultation have been about the proposed provisions for access to records and when and to whom they should be made available.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para17"></a>We need to provide a consistent framework for records so that those relating to minority groups&#151;they may concern ethnicity or other such matters&#151;do not stand out from others and raise questions about why some records are treated differently. We need to make sure, therefore, that the provisions for access contained in this Bill are considered alongside those for other registration issues. I invite the noble Baroness to consider that.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para18"></a>These issues require further consideration. It may be that rather than seeking to amend this Bill, and in order to ensure that records in the gender recognition register are treated in the same way as records relating to other minority groups, changes should be made at the same time as the wider review and in the same manner as changes to those records. That would be done by an order under the Regulatory Reform Act which will be considered by parliamentary committees later this year. I hope that the noble Baroness will accept that.
<P>

<a name="40114-18_para19"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, regarding the other matter that was mentioned, more difficult issues arise in relation to the link between a person's original birth record and the record made in the gender recognition register. I accept that the 75-year rule would mean that disclosure would normally occur at about the age of 93 onwards. I accept that there may not be so many people from the transsexual community who would fall into that group. None the less all the research carried out in recent months on increasing longevity suggests that more may fall into that group. More to the point, someone in their 60s in good health will not know whether they will live beyond the age of 93 or 94. The proposition of the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, may be a useful way forward. We shall reflect on that. However, in the light of my comments, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.

<P>


<a name="column_GC71"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC71</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para4"></a>The Bill takes away the ability of a Church to know whether a person who presents himself for marriage, membership or even employment in the Church is of the sex that he claims to be. The same is obviously true for mosques, synagogues and temples. My Amendment No. 60 seeks to amend paragraph 5 of Schedule 3 in order to deal with that. I should say that, for now, my amendments deal only with England and Wales. If I return to this matter on Report, I shall remedy that omission.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para5"></a>In the Bill, the privacy of a transsexual is paramount. The amendment of my noble friend Lord Tebbit in the previous group addressed the fact that the general position of the Bill is that the privacy of the person obtaining a gender recognition certificate is paramount. Hence, paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 prevents the gender recognition register being open to public inspection. In particular, as we discussed in the previous grouping, paragraphs 5 and 6 prevent birth certificates drawn up from the gender recognition register having any feature which would make them look different from real birth certificates. They cannot be marked or annotated in any way. The new birth certificates cannot allow such a marking because, of course, that would reveal that they do not reflect the true birth sex.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para6"></a>Transsexuals who obtain a gender recognition certificate are assumed to want to keep their birth sex secret, and these provisions help them to do just that. Perhaps it is true that, for most purposes, that will not matter. But for some people and some purposes it is crucial that the real sex is known. Marriage is the first heading. For example, the Government already acknowledge that there is a specific issue of conscience for Anglican clergy in relation to marriage. Church teaching requires them only to marry opposite-sex couples. Therefore, paragraph 3 of Schedule 4 creates a conscience clause for clergy of the Church of England and the Church in Wales by inserting a new Section 5B in the Marriage Act 1949. Anglican clergy are under a legal obligation to marry people in their parish who meet the statutory criteria for marriage. Section 5B relieves them of that obligation where a candidate for marriage has a gender recognition certificate.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para7"></a>It is contrary to the doctrines of the Church to marry people who are biologically of the same sex. For 2,000 years, the Church has understood marriage to be the union of a man and a woman. It is therefore profoundly wrong to require a Church minister, whose job it is to uphold that teaching, to officiate at a same-sex marriage; hence, the conscience clause.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para8"></a>However, the clause has serious limitations. Leaving aside for now the fact that it caters only for Anglican clergy&#151;I shall come to that later in my Amendment No. 80&#151;it has another, rather fatal weakness: it assumes that a clergyman knows that he is being asked to marry a transsexual. The reality is that, unless he knows the couple's history or unless the couple declare it, the minister has no way of knowing whether a woman who comes to be married, in fact, used to be a man, and vice versa. It is therefore possible that he <P>


<a name="column_GC72"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC72</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>could unwittingly marry two people of the same biological sex. This leads to all kinds of possible scenarios that put the minister in a difficult position.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para9"></a>For example, a minister is approached by a couple who have recently moved into the area. They ask him to perform the wedding ceremony; he carries out his usual formalities, including checking birth certificates, before performing the ceremony. Several years later he meets them again. He inquires if they have had any children. They explain quietly that this is physically impossible because one of them used to be a man. The minister is appalled to discover that he has been duped in this way and that he has taken part in what he believes to be a sacrilegious wedding ceremony.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para10"></a>In a second example, a minister is asked to marry a middle-aged couple. He is suspicious about the true sex of the female, because of her masculine appearance. He asks to see the birth certificate, which confirms that she is female. He makes the arrangements, but he is still unsure and plucks up the courage to ask the woman if she is really a man. The woman is furious, as is her fiance, and they storm out of the church vowing never to come back. A month later the minister receives a writ in the post, suing for damages for the emotional trauma of the cancellation of the ceremony, and making particular reference to the outrageous claims that she was a man.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para11"></a>In a third example, a minister of a rural parish is asked by a couple to perform their wedding ceremony. They greatly admire the location of the church&#151;which is a wonderful site of scenic beauty&#151;and they have long planned to marry there. He asks for birth certificates and explains that as a matter of course, because of the Gender Recognition Act, he always asks couples to declare whether either of them has changed sex. They both laugh and confirm that the birth certificates reflect their true sex. The minister carries out the wedding. At the end of the ceremony, the bride whispers in his ear that she used to be a man, but she did not want to tell him in case it prevented them from getting married in their favourite church.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para12"></a>It is all very well worrying about the rights of transsexuals, but what will the Bill do to protect the rights of ministers like these? My amendment seeks to address this problem head on by creating a specific exception to the rule that birth certificates should not disclose where there has been a gender recognition certificate. Where a minister specifically seeks to obtain a copy of a birth certificate&#151;I say "specifically" for the purpose of exercising his freedom of conscience under Section 5B of the Marriage Act 1949&#151;my amendment would require that the certificate of a person who changed sex must be marked. It must indicate that it does not reflect the person's birth sex, it does not require the registrar to disclose their birth name or anything else about them. They must ensure that the certificate contains some indicator of the fact that it relates to an entry in the gender recognition registry. The person entitled to the certificate knows that this person is therefore not biologically of the sex indicated on the certificate. The second point of this amendment is church membership and employment.
<P>


<a name="column_GC73"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC73</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para13"></a>My amendment would create the same right to know for two further purposes: first, determining an application for membership of a religious organisation; and, secondly, employment in a religious organisation. In both cases the same issues of profound religious conviction arise. As I said earlier, Christianity, or God, teaches that a person's sex is determined by God at conception. Undergoing a sex change represents a desecration of the image of God in that individual and a rejection of God's providence. Many Churches believe that a person who chooses to live this way is committing a serious sin. They cannot simply smile and accept it.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para14"></a>Clearly, Churches have a well-earned reputation for welcoming all comers as visitors to their services. Christians are to follow the example of Christ, who came to call sinners to repentance. You can hardly do that if you close your doors to all except those who already believe. Actual membership of the Church is different. That is reserved for those who share the Church's beliefs, for those who are baptised or are intending to be baptised as Christians. At the moment, if the Church has doubts about whether an applicant is telling the truth about his sex, they can request a birth certificate. If he is telling the truth, the birth certificate will confirm it. Where a person is a transsexual, this forces the issue. Either he admits it, or no birth certificate is produced, in which case the Church must assume the worst. Under this Bill, the person who wants to deceive the Church about his sex has the assistance of the Registrar General. He can produce the birth certificate, which shows his chosen sex. There will be no right for a Church to know whether a person who comes forward for membership has had a sex change operation.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para15"></a>The same is true for employment. The Bill will deprive Churches of their ability to exercise their right to refuse to employ transsexuals under Section 19 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975. Section 19 protects the ability of religious bodies to preserve their integrity by employing only staff who personally uphold the teachings of the faith in relation to transsexualism.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para16"></a>Once again, under this Bill a religious organisation has no way of knowing the true sex of a job applicant if he chooses to lie. It is possible that an organisation could appoint a man as a minister, only to discover a month later that he used to be a woman. This would be profoundly distressing for the congregation; it would be just as distressing, if not more so, than discovering that the minister is a practising adulterer. In the case of adultery, the guilty minister gets no assistance from the state for concealing his sin; he cannot get a certificate declaring him not to be an adulterer. However, the transsexual who wants to hide his past, knowing that if his past were known there would be a difficulty, would get every assistance from this legislation. Hence my amendment would allow Church officers to approach the general register office and obtain a certificate that reveals that there has been a sex change. My Amendment No. 97 deals with what he can do with that information, but we will come to that in a moment.
<P>


<a name="column_GC74"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC74</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para17"></a>What about the right to privacy? The Minister will object that mandatory disclosure of a person's true sex affects the transsexual's right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It does qualify the right of privacy as it is now understood in relation to transsexuals, but Article 8 is qualified in many ways that are necessary for the good functioning of society. For example, a church is entitled to apply to the Criminal Records Bureau for access to criminal record information to help root out volunteers and employees who might be unsuitable.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para18"></a>Article 8 states that limitations on the right are allowed where necessary,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-19_para19"></a>
Surely it is permissible to allow limited disclosure of a person's true sex to protect the rights and freedoms of Churches and other religious bodies? Surely we can protect their Article 9 right to exercise their religious conscience? The Government also clearly believe that ministers should have the freedom to refuse to marry transsexuals&#151;hence Section 5B of the Marriage Act 1949. Surely we can protect that freedom too? Allowing a minister who performs marriages to know if one of the parties has changed sex is essential for protecting his rights and his freedoms. Otherwise, the state is colluding with transsexuals to deceive Church ministers into acting against their beliefs.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para20"></a>A second objection to my amendment may be the fear that once a Church has a copy of a marked certificate, they can go around showing it to all and sundry, further breaching the privacy of the transsexual. This brings me neatly on to my Amendment No. 97. Under Clause 21, a person who, while acting in an official capacity, acquires knowledge of a person's gender history is forbidden from disclosing it to anyone. If he does so, he is committing a criminal offence liable to a fine of up to £5,000.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para21"></a>Amendment No. 97 does not seek to wreck this clause, even though in principle it is outrageous to criminalise voluntary agencies and private employers who dare to talk about a person's sex change. Amendment No. 97 merely provides limited exceptions to this criminal offence&#151;exceptions which mirror exactly Amendment No. 60, which is why it is grouped with it. It would allow very limited disclosure for the same three defined purposes, that is exercising a right of conscience under Section 5B of the Marriage Act 1949, determining an application for membership of a religious group, or exercising a right of religious conscience under Section 19 of the Sex Discrimination Act not to employ a transsexual.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para22"></a>Amendment No. 97 is necessary to make Amendment No. 60 workable. If a minister is entitled to a marked birth certificate for the purpose of his right of conscience about marrying transsexuals, he should also be entitled to disclose that certificate if it is necessary to do so. If his superiors in the Church threaten him with disciplinary action for refusing to marry someone in the parish, he can tell them about the certificate. However, he and his superiors would be breaking the law if they disclosed that information for <P>


<a name="column_GC75"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC75</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>any other reason. If the minister published the information in the parish newsletter, that would not be protected, since there is no necessity to do so for the purposes of his right of conscience, and that, of course, everyone would accept.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para23"></a>Clause 21 creates the prospect of one particularly bizarre scenario. Let us say that a minister is counselling a troubled young man who tells him that he wants a sex change. The minister advises him against it, but the young man goes ahead, and gets a gender recognition certificate. Several years later, he turns up on the minister's doorstep, looking every inch like a woman, with his fiance. The two want the minister to marry them. It becomes apparent that the groom has no idea that his bride-to-be is really a man, yet the minister would presumably be committing a criminal offence if he told him. Under Clause 21(3)(a), he could be deemed to have acquired the information about the person's true sex,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in connection with the functions of a . . .  voluntary organisation".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-19_para24"></a>
He is therefore banned from telling anyone. That cannot be right. There must be an exception for marriage.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para25"></a>There must also be an exception for the Church membership or employment situation. Otherwise, the Church official who discovers that a person has changed sex would be committing a criminal offence if he told another Church official. So if he obtained a marked certificate under my Amendment No. 60, he would be committing an offence to mention it when taking part in discussions about whether to employ the person in question or allow them into membership of the Church. The applicant could even tell the Church official himself about his sex change, but then remind him he would be committing an offence if he told any of the other people involved in the decision-making process.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para26"></a>Amendment No. 101 to Clause 21 protects the Church from discrimination claims where an applicant for ordination will not give permission to disclose his change of sex. The amendment draws attention to a particular problem faced by Churches as a result of the Bill and Clause 21 in particular. It focuses specifically on ordination. It stems from Clause 21(4)(b), which allows disclosure of information about a person's true sex if the person concerned gives permission. The amendment aims to protect Churches from legal action for discrimination if the applicant refuses such permission.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para27"></a>As I said, it is a matter of profound religious conviction that Churches continue to have the freedom to ordain as ministers of their Churches people who personally uphold the Church's basic teachings. It would be outrageous if Clause 21 prevented discussion of a person's sex change if he was applying for ordination in that Church.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para28"></a>In many Baptist churches, for example, the whole membership is involved in discussions about ordination. The membership as a whole must agree to put a person forward. Would it not be totally outrageous if one of the church leaders was <P>


<a name="column_GC76"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC76</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>criminalised for disclosing the fact that the man who is seeking ordination is really a woman? Would it not be appalling if the transsexual were able to say to the church leader, "I have admitted to you that I've had a sex change. But if you dare tell anyone else, I will call the police"?
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para29"></a>The Minister will say that transsexuals will not put themselves and others through the embarrassment of forcing such an issue. However, I am afraid that he does not recognise that not everyone is as honest and magnanimous as he is. Is it not often part of "gender dysphoria" to want to do just that? And the right to conceal is a thread which runs throughout the whole of the Bill. The combination of the Bill, the Goodwin judgment, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Human Rights Act is going to create a legal minefield for the Churches. There are already transsexuals pursuing legal action against the Churches. Only today I have seen a letter from solicitors acting for a transsexual man who are threatening the Church with legal action for no longer allowing him to be a preacher in the Church. That is happening and&#151;guess what&#151;the letter mentions the Gender Recognition Bill.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para30"></a>The Minister needs to realise that he is putting Churches in the firing line with this Bill. This amendment would not give the Church an unconditional right to disclose the person's true sex&#151;it would still require the applicant's permission&#151;but it would at least protect the Church from legal action for discrimination if the candidate refused that permission. I beg to move.

I should also like to broaden the question, as she did in some of her comments, from the Churches to the faiths more widely. Members of the Committee who were present on 18 December will remember a number of references to a letter received by a number of us from a representative of the Islamic Medical Association of the United Kingdom expressing a number of similar kinds of anxieties.
<P>

<a name="40114-19_para31"></a>I am speaking specifically to Amendment No. 100. The drafting of the amendment, although linked to my Amendment No. 84 to Schedule 6, in fact deals with a separate matter&#151;the question of permitting disclosure of information about a person's change of gender where they are seeking acceptance for training, recognition as a minister or appointment to a post within a Church or other faith community. I share the Government's sense that in almost every case a person in that condition would often wish to be frank and open with the religious body in question.

<P>

<a name="40114-20_para1"></a>I appreciate why the Government have included provisions to protect a transgendered person's privacy. However, this seems to be another of those moments when, as in so many other matters of human rights, there is a balance to be struck between different rights and different interests. One of the key questions running through the debate yesterday and today concerns the striking of that balance&#151;indeed, whether the Government admit that there is a balance to be struck at all and whether other rights beside those of the transsexual person should be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para2"></a>Whatever the Bill provides, it must be at the least very likely that where a transgendered person is engaged in public ministry in a religious body, information about his or her past will sooner or later become known to other members of that body. The Minister will remember that, on 18 December at Second Reading, I noted the very tricky question of professional directories. Unless elements are to be expunged from professional directories, they will themselves make clear the previous history of a transgendered person. That makes it all the more important for those involved in deciding on appointments and the like to know the true position at the outset, and to know it rather than imagine or infer it. Such people should not be put in the position of reaching decisions to which they and others&#151;including those to whom the transgendered person would be ministering&#151;would have strong doctrinal objections if they had known the facts.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para3"></a>Amendment No. 100 is related to but, strictly speaking, different from Amendment No. 84 to Schedule 6, to which we will come later. The object of the amendment is to ensure that making those facts known to those who need to know them does not fall foul of the ban in Clause 21 on disclosing information required in an official capacity. My example is from the Church of England, but I hope that Members of the Committee will understand that I am thinking just as much&#151;although I do not have the terminology&#151;both of other Christian traditions and, where appropriate, of communities of other faiths.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para4"></a>In the Church of England, for example, if a transgendered person was a member of the clergy or a lay minister seeking to move from one diocese to another, this amendment would allow his or her present bishop to provide essential information in strict confidence to the bishop of the new diocese. That is all the more important because Clause 21 does not merely give rise to a civil remedy; it creates a criminal offence. I am sure that that is something that all religions would take very seriously.

<a name="40114-20_para5"></a>I recognise that this is a complex area and that the Minister may say that it could best be dealt with by an order under subsection 5 of Clause 21, to which my later amendment relates, rather than by the Bill itself. If that is the preferred way forward, the Church of England would not wish to stand in the way. However, if the Bill were to pass without any express provision on this very significant and important area, I am sure that the Minister will appreciate our concern to have some explicit reassurance at this stage that the matter will be addressed and by whom.

<A NAME="40114-20_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   On a very quick point, I should be grateful if the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, could in due course give me a copy of the letter she cited towards the end of her speech. That would be very helpful.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para6"></a>On a second point, I am slightly inconvenienced&#151;I do not know whether other Members of the Committee are&#151;by the fact that many of these arguments cut across other and related amendments, particularly Amendment No. 79. In retrospect, I think it might have been more helpful if we had been able to group them together. Many of the issues, particularly issues of conscience, cut across the amendments. Slicing the amendments in this way makes the Government appear less helpful than we intended to be.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para7"></a>Like other Members of the Committee, I accept that there are people in certain religious organisations who dispute the Bill's fundamental proposition that a person should be able to change gender in law. That proposition raises issues of religious conscience as far as they are concerned. The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, was rightly very clear on the issue. They do not feel able, for example, to solemnise the marriage of individuals seeking to marry in their acquired gender, or that those recognised in their acquired gender should be admitted to membership or to be able to hold office in a religious organisation. It may be&#151;I will defer to the right reverend Prelate on the matter&#151;that these issues are not so very different from some of those previously raised around the conscience issues of divorce.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para8"></a>It would be puzzling&#151;and this is where I am somewhat disconcerted&#151;knowing the views of a religious minister or religious organisation, if a transsexual person who was an adherent of that same religious faith were to seek to force the conscience of a co-believer; or indeed, knowing the views of that minister or organisation, if a transsexual person were to conceal the fact that he or she had been recognised in the acquired gender. I think that when such issues arise between members of a religious community&#151;issues of conscience&#151;the state should have as minimal a role as possible.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para9"></a>An amendment is proposed to Schedule 3 to enable a religious organisation to receive a birth certificate which makes plain whether it had been compiled from the gender recognition register. That is entirely inappropriate. The very purpose of the gender <P>


<a name="column_GC79"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC79</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>recognition register is to enable the issue of a new birth certificate that does not violate the privacy of the transsexual person. The very personal fact that a person has changed gender should not be made apparent on the face of this public record. My noble friend has said on several occasions that we are protecting privacy here.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para10"></a>In any case, if a religious minister or organisation needs to know whether a person is or is not a transsexual person, the solution would be to ask the person, particularly if their co-religionist is within a specific faith. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the question being asked. I do not understand why we should assume that a person who is asked this question&#151;a person who is a member of the same religious community&#151;will refuse to answer or will lie, particularly to his priest. Essentially, I cannot believe that a member of a faith group will base his faith on bad faith. That is what the amendment impugns.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para11"></a>Officials have discussed the issues in this area at length with, most recently, officials from the Church of England. There are practical ways in which the information required by a minister or organisation can be requested and obtained. Following on from those discussions, I agree in principle that the "conscience clause" in relation to marriage should be reworked slightly. In a moment I shall turn to Amendment No. 75, tabled by the right reverend Prelate, and I hope to say something that may move the discussion forward. Were we able to group that with this amendment, we could take the point on board now.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para12"></a>I also agree in principle that where information about a person's gender history is obtained by one member of a religious organisation, there may be a need&#151;for example, in relation to appointments&#151;to disclose that information to others involved in the appointments process. Primarily, there is no reason why the consent of the person concerned should not be obtained. The onward disclosure of information would then be permitted.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para13"></a>The question of whether there is a residual need for any other exemptions to the disclosure provisions depends on the detail of, for example, the appointments process in different religious communities. My noble friend's officials are in close contact with representatives from religious organisations, including officials from the Church of England, and I think that the matters of detail which will have to be entered into in order to get satisfactory answers in this area are not for today. I know that the noble Baroness raised a series of possibly&#151;I think she would accept&#151;worse case scenarios. I accept that the law must be able to look at those and see what would be the responsible situation. I invite her to say that this is best conducted in discussion with officials from the Church of England and other appropriate organisations to see how they might be resolved.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para14"></a>Officials will continue to examine these issues in conjunction with representatives from religious organisations. Any further disclosure protection that is needed will be provided in secondary legislation. The Committee will, however, appreciate that the <P>


<a name="column_GC80"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC80</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Government are bound by their obligations under European Human Rights law to protect the privacy of transsexual people. Any further exemptions in secondary legislation will have to be consistent with those obligations.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para15"></a>So my answer is really in three parts. First, I am assuming a congruence between the faith of a person and the good faith of that person when working within a religious organisation, seeking to marry within that Church or indeed to become an ordinand of that Church. I cannot concede that a believer would wish to construct his vocation on bad faith. That is so profoundly implausible that I find it hard to understand as a serious argument.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para16"></a>Secondly, I absolutely accept the argument of the&#151;what I would call&#151;"conscience clause", that ministers have the right to refuse to marry people and that there are particular responsibilities and obligations on the Church of England, given its pastoral and established status. The issue of conscience will be further opened up in Amendment No. 79. But my understanding is that if a minister has a reasonable belief that someone is a transsexual who refuses to confirm or deny it, and as a result feels unable to pursue a marriage ceremony, that that would be a legitimate response and protected by the conscience clause.
<P>

<a name="40114-20_para17"></a>Thirdly, I remind the Committee that we are also subject to the European Convention on Human Rights. Although we cannot go down the line pursued by the noble Baroness in some respects, my noble friend has made it clear that he is happy to continue to discuss with the faith communities how best to reconcile the European obligations with particular concern for British organisations, so that we treat people decently while respecting conscience.

<P>
<A NAME="40114-21_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </B>   We have listened to an interesting debate on an important subject, opened with some emphasis, which we well understand, by the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain.
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para0"></a>The Committee is encouraged to hear from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester that he believes that Clause 21(5) provides an opening for the law to be amended on a realistic basis. It may or may not be that any additional orders will be made available before the Bill is enacted. But I believe that Ministers should and would be sensitive to considerations of whether further orders were required under Clause 21(5). No group of transsexual people would wish in any way to inhibit the proper exercise of Clause 21(5) if it was thought necessary.
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para1"></a>I am encouraged too to hear that the Minister believes that the conscience clause needs to be looked at again. I have a great deal of sympathy with ministers of religions other than the established Church who may wish to be placed in a similar position to ministers of the Church of England and the disestablished Anglican Church in Wales. I remind the Committee that it is disestablished and that Wales is very proud of Lloyd George's achievement in securing that position about 100 years ago.
<P>


<a name="column_GC81"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC81</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para2"></a>I agree also with the Minister that the criminal provisions, which have caused some difficulty certainly for some of my noble friends who are not present today, need to be looked at. In appropriate circumstances where disclosure is given in a particular function, it could be forwarded to someone else exercising the same capacity, with the risk of a criminal offence being committed by the original recipient of the information. That would just be bad law. It probably would never be enforced, which makes it even worse bad law&#151;if one can have such a thing.
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para3"></a>I have, however, been troubled by some of the arguments I have heard during the debate. In my view, we have had a slight muddle between conscience, which I understand to be a subjective matter, and an attempt to turn conscience into an objective concept. This debate could open up a very long discourse on the difference between, and the relative importance of, faith and doctrine. I shall not go down that road. I share the Minister's view that it is extremely unlikely, save in the world of those who could defraud any of us, that any conscientious transsexual is going to try to force a minister of any religion&#151;any clerk in holy orders&#151;into doing anything that they would not wish. That is to break the faith which underlines not only their religious belief, but the whole objective behind the legislation.
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para4"></a>I remind the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, that religious organisations have to put up with many things that are contrary to their subjective consciences, of which they can know nothing. For example, it must be commonplace for people who have committed adultery to marry in church. No register of adultery is kept, so that fact can never be discovered. There must be many clerks in various forms of holy orders who marry women who have undergone abortions, but there is no register as such of abortions. Of course, if one could look into a woman's private medical records one could find out whether she had undergone an abortion. I am unaware of any attempt in recent years to amend any legislation to give a doctor, who may be conscientiously opposed to carrying out an abortion, the opportunity to examine medical records that he may not have in his possession&#151;for example, the records of charitable organisations that carry out such procedures. Indeed, there may be clerks in holy orders with conscientious objections to marrying women who have undergone abortions, but they have no register to turn to. No one is suggesting, so far as I am aware, that they should be able to look at the medical records of the women they are about to marry just in case they may have had an abortion.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-21_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   The last examples that the noble Lord has given are quite outwith the matter. The legal situation, which is what we are talking about, is simply quite different. Therefore, the parallels he adduces, either with adultery or abortion, do not relate to the matter in hand.
<P>


<a name="column_GC82"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-21_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </B>   I very respectfully disagree with the right reverend Prelate. I think the matter is right on the point. If a clerk in holy orders conducts the marriage of a woman who has had an abortion and he finds out about it afterwards, he may well have a great concern that he has been forced to act outwith his conscience; but he has no right to find out whether the woman has had that procedure carried out.
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para5"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, in my view&#151;I say this with great respect&#151;used such words as "duped" and "deceived" in a totally inappropriate context. The legislation seeks to give a changed legal status to people whose change of gender has been recognised. The nature of marriage is that in law it is a contract between a person who in law is a man and a person who in law is a woman. If a person chooses to go to a clerk in holy orders and says, "I am a man", and he is in law a man, I am afraid that in law he is deceiving no one; and the Churches faithfully apply the law.
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para6"></a>Of course the conscience clause, with appropriate information provided, gives clergy the privilege to break the law on the basis of their consciences. In my view that is something that should be considered as privilege. So I support what the Minister has said; I think that there is a little room for manoeuvre on legal grounds, which the noble Baroness mentioned during her speech; but we should not allow ourselves to be emotionally moved by the use of verbs and adjectives that talk of fraud, deceit and lack of conscientious behaviour by people who are likely to behave perfectly properly at almost all times.

<P>
<A NAME="40114-21_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Turner of Camden: </B>   I have listened to the debate with a great deal of interest. I know little about religion, but I am interested, as my noble friends know, in employment. In moving the amendment the noble Baroness made reference to employment, as did the right reverend Prelate, who referred to appointments. What concerns me is that Churches, like many large organisations, employ great numbers of people. I think that it would be quite inappropriate if individuals applying for employment were to be subjected to a loss of the privacy which is otherwise guaranteed by the legislation and be forced to disclose personal information for positions with religious organisations.
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para7"></a>I know the amendment refers to ordination, which is quite separate. But, on the other hand, I would be very unhappy if that position were extended in any way to appointments other than ordination and to ordinary employment within religious organisations. That would be totally inappropriate. I am sure that my noble friend will have regard to that issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-21_spnew4"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Chester: </B>   Perhaps I may ask the Minister a specific question in relation to ordination and not employment. I think that there is a clear distinction between the two cases. In the Church of England various bishops hold different views on the matter. Suppose a priest who has changed gender <P>


<a name="column_GC83"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC83</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>applies for a job in another diocese. Would it be lawful for the bishop of the first district, in the consultations which naturally take place between bishops on appointments, to disclose the fact to the second bishop that the priest in question&#151;for whom he has been asked to provide a reference&#151;has a gender recognition certificate? Or would the bishop be in danger of committing a criminal offence if he passed information on to fellow bishops?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-21_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I shall comment briefly on two points. First, I want to say how much I agree with my noble friend Lady Turner. Clearly, employees within a religious organisation could be running the local teashop provided in the cathedral vestry, for example. I am quite sure that the right reverend Prelates do not mean to suggest that as a result this consideration comes into play. I think their concern is primarily on ordination. As the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, indicated, we wish to make clear the Church's exact position on that.
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para8"></a>The more detailed questions are much better explored in discussion. However, on the specific points raised by the right reverend Prelate, if the consent of the ordinand or the priest moving from one diocese to another has been granted, the answer is that it would be lawful. Otherwise, it is a matter that will be considered in secondary legislation.
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para9"></a>Does the right reverend Prelate expect a priest moving to another diocese not to reveal that information to his bishop? As the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, the whole of the Bill is based on trying to defend a concept of integrity that transsexual people wish to pursue in their lives. We are discussing the integrity of a priest moving from one diocese to another, presumably knowing the views of both bishops. Is there any suggestion that if the bishop were to ask that a priest might feel it appropriate to lie?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-21_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Chester: </B>   I take a specific case that arises all the time. When a priest moves from one diocese to another, he deals with two bishops. I can understand that it would be natural for the bishop in the first diocese to ask the priest concerned for his consent to pass on the information that he had been subject to a gender recognition certificate. The point is that we are creating a criminal offence. It is a serious matter if the bishop is going to be prevented from passing that matter on where permission has not been given.
<P>

<a name="40114-21_para10"></a>The amendment seeks to avoid criminalising a bishop going about his ordinary business in advising a fellow bishop on the appointment of a priest. We are a little sensitive to&#151;I agree&#151;the unlikely case because the Bill creates a criminal offence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-22_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   At the moment it would be an offence if that information were given without consent; in other words, it would run contrary to this provision. Again, there is no reason why the issue <P>


<a name="column_GC84"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC84</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>should not be pursued as part of other discussions and, if necessary, as I said, the amendment of secondary legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-22_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Chester: </B>   I thank the Minister for that assurance. There is a real issue that should be pursued.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-22_spnew2"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   I thank the Minister for the assurances she has given that the officials and the Minister in charge are prepared to continue with the very considerable and detailed work. She has also undertaken that the discussions may appropriately be widened to include representatives of other Churches and other faiths. I welcome both what she and the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said. I have every intention of pursuing these issues. They are delicate, detailed and important.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-22_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I have listened with not surprise but pleasure at the conciliatory nature of the Minister's comments. At least I have not been gratuitously offensive, even though I used the word "duped". Her answer generally has to be welcomed, but, like the curate's egg&#151;which I think is very appropriate&#151;it is good in parts.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para0"></a>The Minister made three points, the first of which is that the faith of persons would not permit them to act in anything other than good faith. Sadly, we are all fairly frail human beings and there have been cases where that has not occurred. It is wonderful that she feels so positive about people of faith. We have had discussions privately on faith in the past. I hate to disabuse the noble Baroness, but actually people of faith are not necessarily of good faith all the time.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para1"></a>Secondly, the Minister's acceptance that the argument of the conscience clause should be looked at again was very positive. I thought&#151;as I mentioned during the course of the debate to the right reverend Prelate&#151;that that was good and that it gives us an opportunity and opening before Report for the issue to be examined away from the heat of Grand Committee. I am sure that some progress can be made.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para2"></a>Of course, the noble Baroness reminded me gently that the issue was subject to human rights legislation. I agree. However, as I said, it depends on how far one goes along those lines. I have a horrible feeling on this issue, as I do with many issues that come before the House that deal with the European Union or the European Court of Human Rights. And, by the way, I voted the right way in the Division&#151;probably the wrong way for my party, but it was the right way. We tend to fall into gold-plating time and time again. I think that that would be generally accepted. People will not necessarily do that with this Bill, but, generally speaking, we have done so. That is something that we must bear in mind.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para3"></a>With the assurance that we can have further discussions, in a way which I have found very helpful, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>

<a name="40114-22_para8"></a>Amendment No. 64 deals with another point raised by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. The Regulatory Reform Act creates a general power to amend other statutes by secondary legislation. The Regulatory Reform Act procedure cannot be applied to another Act within two years of its enactment. It is also subject to an elaborate procedure of consultation and scrutiny. Schedule 3(11)(a) eliminates the two-year limbo period in relation to the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para9"></a>For reasons given in paragraphs 10 and 11 of its report, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has no objection to that proposal. However, it objects to paragraph 11(b), which eliminates the first-stage scrutiny procedure and converts a regulatory reform order into what is in effect a simple affirmative resolution procedure. The purpose of the amendment is to remove paragraph 11(b) and to require the normal scrutiny procedure to be applied.

terms set out in the Bill. Any member of the clergy who feels that the marriage should not occur because of a strong belief that it is not possible to change one's gender and as a consequence the marriage would be a same-sex marriage is not required to undertake the ceremony against his or her wishes. That is only right.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para18"></a>It seems unfortunate, however, not to extend that right towards registrars, who may have equally strong beliefs concerning a marriage involving a transsexual person.

Amendment No. 77 adds to the Bill an opt-out for registrars, and guarantees that they would not be subject to any disciplinary procedure for refusing to conduct or solemnise such a marriage.

My noble friend's amendment deals with registrars, while my amendment widens the marriage conscience clause in the schedule to encompass anyone who performs weddings. For the purpose of the Committee, I have tabled an amendment relating only to England and Wales, but if I returned to the issue on Report I would plan to insert the same wording in the legislation for Northern Ireland and Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para19"></a>The Government's proposed conscience clause in new Section 5B in the Marriage Act 1949 relieves Anglican clergy of the obligation to perform marriage ceremonies involving people who have a gender recognition certificate. The Government will say that it is worded in that way because only Anglican clergy are under a legal obligation to perform marriages for those in the parish. They must marry anyone in the parish who meets the legal criteria for marriage. The Government may argue that ministers of other denominations and religions are free to choose whom they marry because they are acting in a private capacity, but that ignores the fact that we are entering new and unknown territory with the Bill and the human rights complications that gave rise to it.

<a name="40114-22_para20"></a>The Human Rights Act 1998 combined with the recent rulings of the European Court of Human Rights and this Bill could be used to make serious attempts to impose an obligation to perform transsexual weddings on all those who perform the function of officiating at wedding ceremonies. The Human Rights Act of course incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights into UK law. In the Goodwin case of July 2002, the convention was reinterpreted as including a right for transsexuals to marry. As a result, noble and <P>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC87</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>learned Lords from this House decided in April last year, in the Bellinger case, that UK marriage law was incompatible with the convention.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para21"></a>Article 6 of the Human Rights Act requires public authorities to comply with convention rights. It states that a public authority includes,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-22_para22"></a>
It is very easy to imagine that an activist judge in a UK court might hold that a person performing marriage ceremonies is fulfilling a function of a public nature. It is also easy to imagine that a person who refuses to carry out transsexual weddings could be deemed to be exercising that public function in a way that is contrary to the convention. Such a use of human rights litigation to force the issue of transsexual marriage is a real possibility.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para23"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Filkin, wrote to me on 5 January, saying that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it seems unlikely that a person who has changed gender would place him or herself in the embarrassing position of forcing the issue before a minister who, in conscience, did not want to marry him or her".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-22_para24"></a>
I am bound to say that that sounds optimistic, given that the reason why we have a Bill in the first place is because, for a period of more than 20 years, transsexual people have fought to force the acceptance of transsexual marriage in the courts, including going all the way to the European Court of Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para25"></a>The Minister may be unaware of the case that I mentioned earlier of the male to female transsexual Mr Parry, who sued a church for refusing to allow him to join the ladies' fellowship. Mr Parry has a track record of using litigation, or the threat of it, to pressurise organisations into accepting him as a woman. There are some who will force the issue, and not only with Anglican clergy.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para26"></a>Clearly there are clergy in other denominations who perform weddings and who are just as vulnerable to litigation. Is the Minister aware that it is the practice of many of the free churches to allow lay persons to perform their wedding ceremonies? Then there are other religions, and not all those who perform religious weddings sit within the term "clergy", which the clause uses at present. There is also the issue of freedom of conscience for civil registrars&#151;and I greatly welcome the fact that my noble friend Lady Buscombe has addressed that in Amendment No. 77. Registrars, too, should be allowed to have a conscience; there will no doubt be many who took up the job because of a strong belief in the importance of tradition and marriage. They may disagree very strongly with the idea of marrying people who are biologically of the same sex. Whether those beliefs are religious or not makes absolutely no difference. Article 9 of the European convention protects freedom of thought and conscience as well as religion. A profound conscientious objection in that area ought to be respected.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para27"></a>There is a comparison to be made here with the Abortion Act 1967, in which public sector employees such as doctors and nurses were made responsible for <P>


<a name="column_GC88"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC88</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>performing abortions once it became legal, while those who conscientiously objected were given a conscience clause. Although Parliament had decided that it should be legal, it recognised that there were profound issues of conscience and that not everyone would want to be involved in such a procedure. There is a similarity with marriage in this case, although we are not of course talking about issues of life and death but about people's convictions about marriage, which can be profoundly important to them. They may consider it deeply immoral to take part in marrying two people of the same biological sex. Are such convictions to be ignored? Registrars across the UK will probably all be employees of the local authority, rather than office holders. That makes them vulnerable to dismissal by a politically correct local authority that wants all registrars to be willing to perform transsexual marriages.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para28"></a>I revert to another issue that we have addressed&#151;I took part in it&#151;in which a local authority took that approach with the social workers Dawn Jackson and Norah Ellis in relation to adoption by a homosexual couple. Although there are very few such adoptions and other staff were willing to cope with any that arose, Sefton Borough Council applied a politically correct litmus test. It wanted Jackson and Ellis to be willing to undertake homosexual adoptions or lose their jobs. Because of their strong beliefs they lost their jobs. Can registrars expect a similar litmus test in relation to transsexual marriages? My amendment prevents their employers from obliging them to perform such ceremonies.
<P>

<a name="40114-22_para29"></a>It is worth mentioning the situation in the Netherlands where civil registrars were obliged to perform transsexual weddings. However, one lady&#151;Mrs Bellinger&#151;took the matter to court. She said that it was her human right not to be forced to take part in such a ceremony. The Dutch court agreed. The Government should take note of that case. It must take action to ensure that anyone who performs weddings, whether civil or religious, is not required to go against his or her conscience when it comes to the fundamental issue of whether two people of the same sex can marry. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40114-23_spnew0"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   I support both amendments in the group. On Amendment No. 80, to which the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, has just spoken, the wording may need to be altered because the word "obliged" in Schedule 4, which she attempts to amend, places particular legal responsibilities and obligations on the clergy of the Church of England and the Church in Wales. That detail apart, it seems to me that, as the noble Baroness has pointed out, there are many other Churches and people of other faiths who conduct marriages and who, as I read the Bill, could be acted against in some way if they judge that they should not conduct such a marriage.
<P>

<a name="40114-23_para0"></a>In relation to registrars&#151;I mention this because I noted it in my Second Reading speech&#151;this is an important matter for the reasons that the noble Baronesses, Lady Buscombe and Lady O'Cathain, have mentioned. It is an important matter because <P>


<a name="column_GC89"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC89</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>they are highly responsible and valued public officials. Also, in every registry office&#151;it is not the case in every church, chapel, mosque or wherever&#151;there is publicly and obviously displayed in a prominent position a very clear notice that sets out what marriage is according to the law of this land. I can conceive that some registrars&#151;the Bill recognises that there will be some clergy too&#151;will find it extremely difficult to conduct a marriage in which one of the parties is a trans-gender person, not least when, for everyone to see, there is a very clear statement of the law of the land at the minute.
<P>

<a name="40114-23_para1"></a>That brings us straight to the core of the Bill and to the matter of whether a sex is changed when it is acquired. I recognise that the Government are firm on that point. It seems to me that the least that the Government can do is to note the potential difficulty for some registrars&#151;maybe not many but some&#151;and to honour their conscientious position as I am delighted to see that they are prepared to honour the conscientious position of clergy of the Church of England and the Church in Wales and as I hope they will be prepared to honour the conscientious position of some others who conduct marriages.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-23_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I do not believe that I can help noble Lords because I profoundly disagree with the position that they are taking. Marriages contracted by transsexual people, once the change of gender has been legally recognised, will be valid marriages between a male and a female.
<P>

<a name="40114-23_para2"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, discussed the point about ministers other than those of the Church of England. Other ministers could not be considered to be a public authority and therefore they are not bound by the Human Rights Act and are free to make the decision whom they marry or not. Other ministers are in a different situation. The core of these amendments is about registrars.
<P>

<a name="40114-23_para3"></a>Registration officers have no legal grounds on which to refuse to provide the service and I would expect them to provide it. Many people in their public office must undertake functions with which they may not always, in every single respect, agree. That is part of being a public office holder and a public employee. Registrars will be asked and expected to marry people&#151;as I am sure they will&#151;who in the law of the land are entitled to be married. That is a registrar's job. It goes with the territory and rightly so.
<P>

<a name="40114-23_para4"></a>On that argument, on the grounds of conscience, I can conceive&#151;I hope this is not regarded as too far-fetched&#151;of a junior member in a local Jobcentre saying, "I do not wish to pay benefit to a transsexual at the age of 60 because she is really a male and therefore we should wait until she is 65 and my conscience says that". I do not want to impugn any religious group, but an individual Islamic male in a local authority may seek not to make payment of housing benefit to an Asian lone parent on the grounds that he or she brings the family and faith into disrepute. Those may be exaggerated instances but they are public office holders and they have no such <P>


<a name="column_GC90"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>right to bring that argument into the territory. They have to do their job, which consists of treating people as the law of the land says that they should.
<P>

<a name="40114-23_para5"></a>In practice there may be ways around the matter if someone feels so strongly. We are talking about a very small number of people who may seek marriage. Registry offices have a number of registrars and unlike the Church of England one does not have to marry in the registry office in the area in which one lives. If one knows that there are strong concerns, one may seek to avoid embarrassment by going to a different registry office.
<P>

<a name="40114-23_para6"></a>At the core, I profoundly believe&#151;this is my conscience&#151;that public officials are required to exercise their duties and public responsibilities. That is the case whether someone is the most junior member in a Jobcentre but disagrees with what is being undertaken on benefit sanctions or whatever, or whether they are the registrar at a fairly senior level. On that I rest my case.

<A NAME="40114-23_spnew2"></A><B> The Earl of Mar and Kellie: </B>   I did not expect to speak on this amendment, but the Minister may have made a slight error. She did not cover the position of ministers of the Church of Scotland. Could she clarify their position? I suspect that their position is the same as for those in the Church of England because it is an established church. She has brought me to my feet so perhaps she could put me down gently.

<P>
<A NAME="40114-23_spnew4"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   I have a question, but not on registrars. The noble Baroness will acknowledge that in the light of the very clear statements of her colleague at Second Reading and in writing since in his gracious and full letter, that point was clearly made. I respect the fact and the ways in which she noted the case.
<P>

<a name="40114-23_para7"></a>I have a detailed question about who is and who is not in public office, or whatever language was used. What would be the situation for a substantial number of free Churches whose premises may have been assisted by lottery money or the like? In the past there has been discussion on the extent to which such funding made Churches public bodies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-23_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I cannot conceive, knowing some of the issues associated with, say, racial discrimination, that this would affect that situation. We are talking about individuals who are public employees, whether of the local authority or of central government, in some way or another. We are saying that when their duties encompass X, Y or Z, as laid down by the law of the land, they are required to do that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-23_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   I was referring to the second of the amendments, Amendment No. 80.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-23_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   It may be the case that those providing the funding will insist that the premises are accessible to disabled people, for example, as a condition of a grant. If I am wrong about that I shall write to the noble Lord, but my understanding is that that does not affect the status of the ministers of religion in those Churches.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-23_spnew8"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   I have a point of clarification. Suppose a Baptist minister also had a job as a local authority employee&#151;some do because they are part-time ministers. What would be his position in terms of marrying people? Could he put aside his local authority job and, as a Baptist minister, use the conscience clause?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-23_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   If I understand the noble Baroness correctly, she is saying that if someone has an occupation in local government and independent of that has a parallel occupation, there are segmented responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="40114-23_para8"></a>I am now able to help the noble Earl in relation to the Church of Scotland. Ministers of the Church of Scotland are approved celebrants, but they are not required to marry couples. They do not have a statutory obligation as is the case in the Church of England.

<FONT SIZE=3>point. They appear in the Bill, as has been noted, because of the legal requirement on clergy in the Church of England and the Church in Wales in certain circumstances to marry parishioners.

<a name="40114-24_para6"></a><P>

<a name="40114-24_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment is extremely important. I may speak to it so briefly as to embarrass the noble Baroness, as she appears to be sucking a sweet at the moment. I hope that that is not unparliamentary language.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para8"></a>The amendment relates to social security and pensions. A small group of people who are female-to-male transsexuals will apply for certificates. Some of them, such as Mark Rees, for example, have made well publicised applications to the domestic courts and to the European Court of Human Rights and a number of years ago they lost their cases. They have planned their lives accordingly. That is a group of people who expect to receive their state pensions at age 60 because the state has regarded them as female until now, whereas when the Bill becomes an Act they will become male in law and, therefore, will receive their pensions at the male age.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para9"></a>I thank the Minister for the extensive consultation that there has been and particularly for the explanations that she has attempted to give, not all of which&#151;this is not her fault; I am sure it is mine&#151;I have understood comprehensively. However, I understand the situation to be that the Minister will be able to assure the Committee that the group of people to whom I refer will not be financially worse off, that they will have financial equivalence in accordance with the aims of the amendments. Therefore, I propose to leave the matter to the Minister to explain herself as she explains herself much better than I can. I hope at the end of this short debate we shall be reassured about the outcome. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-24_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   Yes, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, said, the purpose of the Bill, and in particular of Schedule 5, is to ensure that transsexual people are given the same rights as others of their acquired gender to social security benefits and pensions. The schedule takes effect only from the point at which the full gender recognition certificate is issued. So it allows an interim period&#151;it is worth spelling this out on the face of the Bill so that people understand&#151;for transsexual people to consider their financial position on benefits and pensions before applying for a full gender certificate. The Government will produce guidance for applicants on the implications of recognition for benefits and pensions. That will be sent out with the application forms. In other words, we shall do our best&#151;I was going to say our damnedest&#151;to ensure that choice is informed choice. That is very important.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para10"></a>What the noble Lord has said is correct. If female-to-male transsexuals born before 1 January 1954, aged 60 to 64, were allowed to become entitled to their retirement pensions at the age and rates appropriate to women, a special category of men would be created; those whose male legal status is acquired through the gender recognition process, but none the less they would seek to draw their pensions as though they were women.
<P>


<a name="column_GC94"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC94</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para11"></a>There are serious arguments about discrimination against people who have been male since birth, which is contrary to the intention of this Bill. That is the situation that we face. Given that, one could question whether someone wants a category where they would have to explain at a Jobcentre office that although they were living as a male, they were for social security purposes able to draw their pension as a female. That too would run counter to the spirit of the Bill and all the issues about privacy, data protection and so on that we have talked about.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para12"></a>None the less, I can help the noble Lord. The problem arises because men and women currently become entitled to state retirement pension at different ages and rates. A person who changes gender therefore becomes entitled to the state retirement pension at the age and amount applicable to his or her acquired gender. Had a male to female transsexual who is 62, remained a male he would not draw his pension until 65, but now he would be entitled to draw it from the age of 60. So at the flick of a switch, he, now she, immediately could draw the basic state pension.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para13"></a>Equally, if a 62 year-old she becomes a he, and has been drawing the state pension for two years, there is a switch and that person is no longer entitled to draw the basic state pension until he reaches the age of 65, as though he were male. That is why I am talking about informed choice. That comes with the consequence of changing legal identity in this way. This is in keeping with our principles.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para14"></a>Before I go on to explain why, I hope that your Lordships will not fear that this will lead to financial hardship as suggested, because the pension age will begin to be equalised from 2010, and that will be completed by 2020. Therefore, this problem should not exist after 2020. Men and women will have identical retirement issues, so any transsexuals will have identical treatment whether they be female to male or male to female.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para15"></a>There could be a problem with recognition if it led to severe financial hardship, and it could be argued that it might discourage people from seeking to do what they feel they ought to do to preserve the integrity of their identity. Let me explain why a female to male transsexual should not suffer financial hardship. A female to male transsexual will acquire all the same rights and financial support as all existing birth males have between the ages of 60 and 65.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para16"></a>Three options are available to them. The first is the option to go to work or to continue in work&#151;as some will be doing&#151;as men would do between 60 and 65, and if they are sufficiently low paid they would be eligible for the working tax credit. That applies to earnings up to £9,000 or £10,000 over 30 hours&#151;very low earnings&#151;and could be supported by the working tax credit. Similarly, they could claim job seekers' allowance, as men can between 60 and 65.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para17"></a>For many of them there is a more attractive alternative. All men aged 60&#151;including in future those who have the acquired gender of male&#151;can now instead of seeking JSA claim income support for that age group. That is because of the pension credit <P>


<a name="column_GC95"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC95</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>guarantee&#151;what we used to call the minimum income guarantee&#151;which is equalised for men and women at the age of 60. All existing men can have their income support topped up to pension credit minimum income guarantee level of £102.10 per week for a single person and £155.80 per week for a couple. That happens now.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para18"></a>This means that if a woman decided not to go for gender reassignment and remained female, she would have a basic state pension of £77, topped up by pension credit to £102. Were she now to become a male, she would be treated like other men and be entitled to income support, which is topped up to the same figure of £102 pension credit. There is no requirement to seek job seekers' allowance and there is no requirement to seek work.
<P>

<a name="40114-24_para19"></a>Therefore, in the circumstances that I have outlined, subject to the income tests related to the pension credit, the situation of male-to-female and female-to-male transsexuals should prove identical. There is also an additional allowance for disabled people&#151;for carers' responsibilities, housing costs and so on. I hope that I have given the noble Lord the reassurance that he sought. I have taken a little time to spell out the situation because it is obviously a matter of major concern to people between the ages of 60 and 65 who may seek a gender recognition and wish to know where they stand. I hope that that is helpful to the Committee.

<A NAME="40114-24_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for making those points. However, she will accept&#151;indeed, she pointed out&#151;that income support is a means-tested benefit. A female-to-male transsexual may, from the age of 60, be in receipt of a modest occupational pension, which will continue. However, unless that pension is very modest indeed, he will not be able to draw income support. Therefore, while the provision may not lead to severe hardship, it is also true that someone who may have planned his retirement on the basis that from the age of 60 he would be in receipt of an occupational pension and a state pension will find that he is significantly less well off than he had expected because his occupational pension is too large to allow him to draw income support and he loses the state pension.

<A NAME="40114-25_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   That is undoubtedly true, but I wish to make two points. First, if the individual remained female, the fact that she had an occupational pension might very well not allow her to claim the existing pension credit top-up from £77 upwards. However, secondly, I believe that basically this forms part of informed choice. My concern was to ensure that someone who was poor, who currently had access to the basic state pension, which was topped up because there was no other income, and who, as a result of being a female, may not have had access to a decent occupational pension scheme and whose basic state pension was therefore topped up to the minimum income guarantee, should not lose that money by virtue of changing her gender by law. Under certain <P>


<a name="column_GC96"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC96</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>circumstances, the occupational pension would already disqualify someone&#151;whether male or female&#151;from entitlement to the pension credit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-25_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am sorry to return to this matter. I entirely understand that that will affect the position of people who are still at work and who recognise that, if they become female-to-male transsexuals, they will need to work until they are 65. Of course, their occupational pensions will no doubt be larger as a result when they do retire. However, a transitional problem arises for some people who may already have retired or who may have committed themselves to plans to retire and cannot increase their occupational pensions by working beyond the age of 60. Is there not a transitional problem here which should be dealt with by the Bill?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-25_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   There is an argument on two levels. First, this matter forms part of informed choice. People may plan to draw their state pension from the age of 60 but, simultaneously, plan to change their gender identity. They do not have to go all the way to gender recognition; they can live the life and have the surgery without necessarily applying for the gender recognition certificate. If, as a result, they retain their pension entitlement, then that route may be available to them in certain circumstances. However, if, none the less, they choose to undergo gender reassignment, that is part of the informed choice obligation.
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para0"></a>The noble Lord is right that this is a transitional problem. We shall be correcting it from 2010 to 2020. It is also the case that there is nothing to stop people who have taken retirement and are drawing an occupational pension from seeking part-time work if that is their choice. Many men and woman do so now.
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para1"></a>However, I have to say that my primary concern was not for those who have reasonable occupational pensions and are now disconcerted to find the basic state pension taken away because they are making the change from the female to male gender. My primary concern was the hardship suffered by a person who has only a basic state pension topped up to the MIG level. As I hope I have persuaded the Committee, that person is protected under the Government's legislation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-25_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </B>   I am very grateful to the Minister for the explanation she has given. She has added flesh to the bones of a piece of paper in her own fair hand which I have been carrying round with me since moments after the debate on Second Reading. I now understand what she wrote&#151;and that, I am afraid, is not merely a criticism of her manuscript.
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para2"></a>As my noble friend Lord Goodhart has made clear, we are very concerned about this area. We will read the transcript of today's proceedings with great care and may possibly return to it on Report. For the time being, we are content to beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<a name="40114-25_para9"></a>The right reverend Prelate said: The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the Churches and the faith communities are properly safeguarded in acting on the basis of doctrine or deeply held religious convictions in matters of employment, appointment, selection for training for ordination and even ordination itself. I referred to the concerns about this in my speech on Second Reading, and they stem from the present legislation on sex discrimination, in the Sex Discrimination Act 1975, which also extends&#151;by action in 1999&#151;to discrimination on grounds of gender reassignment and indeed on grounds of marital status.
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para10"></a>This is a very difficult and complex area, not least from the legal point of view. The present legislation applies mainly to employees, and of course many ministers of religion are not employees but office holders. However, there are some clergy and ministers who are employees; chaplains in schools, colleges and the like are normally in that position. I understand that there are also arguments for saying that part of the 1975 Act, in particular the section on conferring authorisations and qualifications, could extend well beyond employees, and that in the context of the Church of England it could, for example, cover a bishop's decision whether to ordain a given individual. <P>


<a name="column_GC98"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC98</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>This is clearly something of major importance, and we understand that other Churches and other faith communities may face analogous issues.
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para11"></a>My Amendment No. 84 seeks to amend the already amended Section 19 of the 1975 Act so as to safeguard action taken&#151;or not taken&#151;on grounds of doctrine or the strongly held religious conviction of a significant number of a religion's followers. It would also cover "indirect discrimination" where the religion's normal principles and practices might present particular issues for transgendered people. For example, where a religious body requires its ministers to be people who show stability in their own personal lives, it may well want to insist that, even if it can accept transgendered people in principle, they must first wait a reasonable time after the huge personal upheaval that gender reassignment involves. There are a range of other bodies&#151;I guess that Relate would be one&#151;in which a counsellor would be expected to stand down from counselling through a period of extreme personal upheaval.
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para12"></a>I appreciate that Section 19 of the 1975 Act already provides some protection for organised religions, but only if they have an absolute position accepted by all their representatives, in this case concerning those who are undergoing or have undergone gender reassignment. Some Churches and some faith communities may have a substantial number of members with very real difficulties of religious principle over gender reassignment. They may not wish to seek to achieve the kind of absolute position that some other Churches and faiths have or will have, rather recognising that they are in a situation where there are genuine differences of belief and conviction among their members. It is this situation which my amendment seeks to address.
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para13"></a>If a religious body in that position had to impose a total ban in order to obtain proper legal protection, its members might well think&#151;and this would certainly be the case in the Church of England&#151;that it was not in the interests of honest, open and thoughtful debate to do so. Indeed, those who wish to further greater acceptance for transgendered people would certainly not think it was helpful from that point of view.
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para14"></a>I should also emphasise that we are not simply dealing with problems that exist already before the Bill is passed, if it is to be passed. However, if the Bill is passed the situation will become even more complicated. Churches and other faith communities will be faced with the existence of people who as a matter of law have become males&#151;or, as the case may be, females&#151;but whom a substantial number of people would regard as a matter of religious conviction as still being female. It is that which, for some, poses particular problems. Thus there would be a situation involving doctrinal objections regarding women's ministry as well as gender reassignment. If the person concerned were subsequently to contract a legal marriage with a person of the same "birth gender" within the meaning of the Bill, then that would give rise to even further problems for some, many or all of a number of Churches and faith organisations.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para15"></a>We fully recognise that framing an amendment to the Bill to deal with all these complexities is not an easy task. It is also one in which discussion between officials has already been enormously helpful. I should like again to thank the Minster for the marvellously skilled and patient collaboration of his officials with ours.
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para16"></a>Perhaps the Minister will suggest regulations under the 1975 Act as a more satisfactory way forward. As far as the Church of England is concerned, and I guess other faiths and Churches, we would not want to close the door on any possibility for tackling most effectively what I hope the Minister will understand are real problems. However, if the Bill does become law, then I would stress the importance of having the necessary legal protection for Churches and faith communities in place as soon as new law comes into force, and not simply to wait until regulations are needed for other reasons. There could be a substantial gap in time. This is vital in practice because there is substantial evidence of the enormous drain on religious bodies' small resources that any litigation can produce. However, it is also vital in principle. We are dealing here with matters of doctrine and religious conviction. I have no doubt that the Minister and other noble Lords will agree that those are something which must be appropriately safeguarded, not least from the point of view of human rights, when we legislate in the immensely sensitive areas covered by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40114-25_para17"></a>I apologise for speaking at such complexity, but it is a matter of considerable complexity and considerable interest. I know that the Minister well understands that. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40114-26_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Not for the first time, I agree with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester that these issues are extremely difficult and complex legally, morally and doctrinally. In essence, they address in what circumstances it is legitimate to allow Churches to judge that they will not, in certain circumstances, treat women, transsexuals or, even more complicatedly, men who have become women through the transsexual process. Clearly, the state has not drawn a rigid line in the sand on this matter because in previous legislation it has already taken the decision to allow Churches to be exempt in certain matters from the full force of sex discrimination law.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para0"></a>I have also previously indicated that it is important that, as well as providing rights to transsexual people, the Bill protects the rights and freedoms of others where appropriate and where possible.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para1"></a>I should mark that the focus of the Bill fundamentally concerns providing transsexual people with the opportunity to gain recognition in the acquired gender. It is not a Bill about discrimination per se. The purpose of making that point is that the amendment, understandably for the clear and important reasons spelt out by the right reverend Prelate, seeks to provide religious organisations with the freedom to discriminate against a person recognised in the acquired gender in relation to training for ministry or service ordination and appointment. Perhaps I may explain why.
<P>


<a name="column_GC100"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC100</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para2"></a>I shall give, to the best of my ability, my encapsulation of where we sit legally and procedurally on this matter and I shall set out what I consider to be the best way forward. As the right reverend Prelate signalled, the provisions in the Sex Discrimination (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 apply the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 to transsexual people. However, as I believe the right reverend Prelate indicated, the 1975 Act applies only to discrimination against employees and not office holders. The great majority, although not the totality, of the clergy are office holders and not employees. Therefore, to the extent that ministers of religion are office holders, in the current situation there is not a problem. That is not a full answer because obviously some are not office holders and a change is also about to take place.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para3"></a>As I am sure the right reverend Prelate knows better than I do, the situation will change with the introduction of the amended Equal Treatment Directive, which must be implemented by the UK by October 2005. The directive will extend protection to office holders. Exemptions will be permitted only when they reflect a genuine and determining occupational requirement to be of a particular sex.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para4"></a>Questions have been raised as to whether the prohibition in the 1975 Act against discrimination in,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"conferring an authorisation or qualification",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-26_para5"></a>
needed for a particular profession might apply to ordination. I do not believe that we have finalised an answer or a position on that at present.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para6"></a>Fundamentally, I am saying that a whole process of discussion and negotiation is necessarily taking place between the Government and interested bodies about how the EU directive, which we must introduce into British law, can be implemented and whether or not there is scope for discretion on it. The Women and Equality Unit in the DTI takes the lead within government on anti-discrimination law. It is consulting the Church on the way in which it will be affected by the directive and on what exemptions may be permitted in relation to clergy, both in terms of discrimination with regard to women and discrimination against transsexual people. Any protection given to the Church in this area must be consistent with the implementation of the directive; in other words, it is self-evident that we must fulfil the obligation, although there is no obligation to gold-plate it. Therefore, we shall deal with the matter in the context of the regulation which implements the directive.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para7"></a>I say that that is the right place to deal with the matter, first, because one must consider the totality of the situation and, secondly, because, even if there were no Gender Recognition Bill, the Government and the Churches would have to face this issue as a result of the EU directive. Therefore, I believe that that is the right place for it to be tested.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para8"></a>I shall signal only that we are not unsympathetic on the principle of the issue raised by the right reverend Prelate. I hope that that has been clear as we have dealt with a number of points in the Bill. It is a question of whether it is possible to meet the wishes of the <P>

<A NAME="40114-26_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   I am grateful, as ever, for the way in which the Minister has responded and for the specific detail that he has set out. Not only in the Church of England but fairly generally in the Churches and the faiths, people are aware of where this question lies, although some may not have quite grasped it. I am grateful, too, for the Minister's clear commitment to these questions being worked at through continuing discussions between officials. I shall, of course, ask for the amendment to be withdrawn so that those can continue.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para9"></a>My anxiety, and that of others, relates to the time-lag in this matter. We are concerned that we may find that the Bill goes through with amendments to the 1975 and 1999 regulations, with consequent work to be done following the coming into force of the employment directive with substantial gaps. It will be very much part of my concern and that of our officials, together with, I am sure, those of the Minister to see how all that can best be managed. There are some very awkward lacunae, if not abysses, in the middle into which some people may fall.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-26_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Before the right reverend Prelate sits down, I understand the point that he makes. I believe we should consider that issue between the earliest date by which the Bill could be passed and the latest date by which the directive could come into force. We should consider it with an open mind, although I cannot guarantee that we shall necessarily find a solution. However, I respect the point that the right reverend Prelate makes.

<a name="40114-26_para14"></a>The noble Baroness said: This is a probing amendment by which I hope to discover the Government's intentions vis-a-vis legal documents other than the birth certificate. The result of the Bill would be that the holder of a full gender recognition <P>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC102</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>certificate would be entitled to be issued with a new birth certificate, with the sex on the certificate altered to reflect the individual's acquired gender. The original birth certificate would no longer be accessible to the public and, indeed, would be suppressed in perpetuity.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para15"></a>All the while, however, a number of other legal documents may exist that refer to the person by his or her gender at birth. Many of those documents would be open to inspection by the public. It would not be very difficult for a suspicious member of the public, a journalist or any person with an interest in, for example, exposing a person as a transsexual to access a will or instrument that is open to inspection. I should like to know the Government's intention on that. Will all legal documents have to be altered? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-26_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   The matter of wills and succession is complex. The Government have given consideration to issues surrounding the rights of transsexual people under the Bill. The noble Baroness wishes to allow people with a gender recognition certificate to apply to have publicly available wills and instruments amended to reflect their acquired gender. We do not consider that to be necessary. Further, we believe that to do so would rewrite history.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para16"></a>As the noble Baroness will be aware, the Government are of the opinion that transsexual people's gender histories should, wherever possible, be a matter only for them. We are committed to securing their privacy. However, I do not believe that the ability of the public to obtain copies of wills detracts significantly from the privacy of transsexual people. Wills are indexed by testator, and someone who seeks information in relation to a particular transsexual would need to know the identity of any testator who may have left that person a legacy.
<P>

<a name="40114-26_para17"></a>We are taking exactly the same position on other documents. For example, the original birth entry relating to the transsexual person will remain on record, although it will be superseded by the entry on the gender recognition register. A copy of the original entry may be obtained by anyone with the relevant information. In conclusion, it may also be of interest if I say that the transsexual community has not raised this matter with us.

<A NAME="40114-27_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. I note that he suggests that my amendment would rewrite history. I believe that a number of people would suggest that the Bill is rewriting history. Therefore, I find that a difficult argument to accept. In the light of the Bill, individuals will be allowed to have a new birth certificate, and that could be argued as rewriting history.
<P>

<a name="40114-27_para0"></a>In the same way&#151;I believe that we are talking about the need for consistency here&#151;I am suggesting that, if the Bill provides the opportunity for individuals to obtain a new birth certificate, in a sense it does not seem consistent if they may then be possibly exposed by other means&#151;for example, through copies of wills.

"( ) Nothing in this section shall prevent the holder of any peerage or dignity or title of honour who is in receipt of a gender recognition certificate from styling themselves as if they had inherited the peerage or dignity or title of honour in their acquired gender, and the person concerned shall have the right to require any organisation or body of which they are a member to address them by the style appropriate to their acquired gender.
<br>
( ) A person who is the holder of an order of chivalry which is limited to one sex shall after receipt of a gender recognition certificate have the right to petition for conferment of the equivalent degree of the order of chivalry appropriate to their acquired gender."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40114-27_para6"></a>The noble Baroness said: Amendment No. 86 is designed to draw out some detail from the Minister on the subject of peerages, which is explained in Clause 16. The clause states that acquiring full gender recognition,

<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"does not affect the descent of any peerage or dignity or title of honour",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-27_para7"></a>
or the devolution of property in a will. While that has the air of the absurd about it, in all seriousness I want to ask the Minister a number of questions. For example, would a transsexual man who was a Countess become an Earl or would he become a male Countess?
<P>

<a name="40114-27_para8"></a>Given the Bill's extensive provisions on disclosure of information and the right to privacy, surely all that would be made a mockery of if, in attempting to prevent an individual changing gender simply to inherit a title or property in a will, the Bill created, for example, a female KBE. Anyone coming across the individual's name would either become immediately aware of that person's intimate gender history or, alternatively, just become very confused. I should like to know the Government's intentions on this matter. I beg to move.

<P>
<A NAME="40114-27_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We are grateful to the noble Baroness for tabling the amendment. As she says, it raises some very interesting issues with which we must cope. Although on one level it is quite humorous, it is a serious matter.
<P>

<a name="40114-27_para9"></a>Clause 16 is intended to safeguard the rights of Peers and holders of titles of honour to retain their titles. However, it was never the intention that, for example, a male-to-female transsexual person should remain a Baron. We had envisaged that she would style herself as a Baroness. However, it has been brought to our attention that, while a person may adopt a particular <P>


<a name="column_GC104"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC104</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>form of address, the instrument which conferred the peerage or the title of honour may be somewhat less flexible.
<P>

<a name="40114-27_para10"></a>It is arguable that a person who previously had the title of Dame Commander conferred upon her should not begin to use the male equivalent&#151;Knight Commander&#151;because that was not the title conferred by Her Majesty. There are issues to consider here not only about how a title is officially recognised but also about how other matters flow from the holding of a title. For example, we must consider the forms of address of a Peer's spouse and of the ex-spouse where a new gender has been acquired after marriage.
<P>

<a name="40114-27_para11"></a>We shall be happy to bring forward an amendment on Report in order to achieve what I believe we all want. I hope that, when tabled, that amendment will meet with the approval of the House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-27_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response and, of course, I welcome his reply. Perhaps I may suggest that the Minister uses the example of a Baron becoming a Baroness. I believe I am right in saying that, notwithstanding that, in effect, women are referred to as Baronesses, in our letters patent we are Barons. I would like to take this opportunity to say that I would be extremely grateful if, when considering all of this, the discrimination between Baronesses and the inability of their husbands to take a title might be taken into consideration. Perhaps that is a matter for the Government to consider another day because the situation is somewhat confused. I am grateful to the Minister for his response.
<P>

</P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-27_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Cobbold: </B>   I would just like to say a few brief words on this issue, because there seem to be many potential anomalies, especially one that occurred to me. Would a daughter of an Earl or a Lord who had inherited a title be entitled to gain that title ahead of a younger brother when the parent died?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-27_spnew5"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   I was deeply surprised to hear the Minister say that the object of this clause was to preserve Peers' rights and honours. I never thought that the Government would be heard saying that. I congratulate them and hope that they will continue this happy feeling throughout all their legislation. However, the provision produces some quite curious questions. It was suggested at Second Reading that an Earl could not change his sex and retain his earldom. We should consider the matter. What happens if an Earl changes his sex and becomes a woman when he is already married to a Countess? He obviously does not become a Countess because there cannot be two. Does he retain his earldom? It would be funny to have an Earl as a woman. If he has a son and if the earldom is therefore vacant, does the son become an Earl? There would then be two earls, which would be curious. What would happen?
<P>

<a name="40114-27_para12"></a>The Minister may say, "This is trying to exempt the peerage", but how can one exempt part of the population when the whole purpose of the Bill as I understand it is to meet the requirements of a very few <P>


<a name="column_GC105"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC105</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>people? In order to do that we have to carve out a whole lot of the peerage. Under the present Government, we have always been told that hereditary Peers are a bad thing. Why are they therefore getting this wonderful treatment? The Minister shakes his head but I am telling him a fact. What happens if a Peer changes sex and retains his peerage?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-27_spnew6"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   There is another issue that it is permissible for me to raise under this amendment, certainly in the light of one element of the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe. At Second Reading, I raised the question of public directories which, for the Church of England, has already occurred. There are a number&#151;Crockford's Clerical Directory, Who's Who and a range of others, such as Debrett's, Dod's and so forth. A transgendered person made the point to us that it was an infringement of her rights that Crockford's continued to contain details of the early stages of her ministry from the existence of which it could be adduced that she had been through the transgendering process. As you can imagine, this caused some of us to spend a remarkable amount of time thinking through this issue and I am by no means sure that we have thought it through sufficiently. However, it will not just be Crockford's that will have to think about this matter.
<P>

<a name="40114-27_para13"></a>The other point of real importance is that, if we were to remove the first half of someone's career from a professional directory&#151;which people buy as a reputable document&#151;what have we done in terms of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968? The alternative might be that, if such a person were determined on such a course they should not appear at all. That question relates sufficiently for me to ask the Minister for guidance.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-27_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   When I rose to speak to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, I thanked her for tabling it. I said that it raised a number of very interesting and important issues that the Government must consider. I said that we would go away and consider the points raised and return before Report with amendments. The past 10 minutes of discussion have shown what a challenge it will be for us to produce amendments that will make everybody happy. However, I am confident that we will. At this time, however, there is nothing more that I can say in detail. We will carefully consider all the points made and return to them on Report.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-27_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Ferrers: </B>   Would the Minister also be kind enough to consider this point? There are occasions when a Peer has to prove his peerage&#151;to come to Your Lordships' House, for example, although that will not happen very much in the future. What happens when a son has to prove that he is his father's son if his father has become a woman and has a gender recognition certificate? He is not allowed to say, "That person is my father", because he would be in danger of making a legal mistake.

The difficulty is that the underlying purpose of the Bill as I understand it is to protect the privacy of these individuals. Therefore, there is a problem with Clause 16 as it stands.

<a name="40114-28_para9"></a>The noble Earl said: I did not take part in the Second Reading debate. However, the debates that we have held over the past two days have been enlightening and I believe myself to be reasonably apprised of the fundamentals of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40114-28_para10"></a>All the amendments to which I have put my name have been inspired by the Law Society of Scotland. I remind members of the Committee that gender is a devolved issue in a Scottish context. However, after the previous amendment, the Minister will be pleased to hear that these amendments are procedural and constitutional in nature in that they impinge on the power of the Scottish Parliament and of Scottish Ministers.
<P>

<a name="40114-28_para11"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 90 is to bring clarity to the Scottish gender-specific offences clause&#151;Clause 19. The amendment would delete the rather woolly and difficult-to-recognise subsection (2) and replace it with a complete list of legislation to which that subsection refers. I have no objection to Amendment No. 91, which I fully acknowledge is consequential. Indeed, I suspect that I should have added my name to Amendment No. 91.
<P>

<a name="40114-28_para12"></a>Amendment No. 90 improves the Bill, but I also recognise that we may have a clash of cultures here between the culture of Westminster parliamentary draftsmen and the Holyrood parliamentary draftsmen. In the latter case, much credence is given to the avoidance of obscurity. Members of the Committee should not be surprised by that. It is inevitable that diversity in legislative style will be demanded consequent upon devolution. When this Parliament is legislating on behalf of the Scottish Parliament, through the Sewel Motion procedure, Scottish provisions ought to be drafted in the established Scottish parliamentary style. I note that the Scottish Parliament has yet to pass a Sewel Motion on this Bill. If this provision is not passed, the Bill will have to be substantially amended to write out Scotland.
<P>

<a name="40114-28_para13"></a>Amendment No. 90 has only a positive effect on the Bill, assuming that the provision will be passed. There is no distortion to the Bill except that there will be greater clarity&#151;is that a distortion? There is a further legislative benefit. Should it come about that a piece of legislation has been omitted by error, or a new piece of legislation needs to be added, that can be done positively by amending the Act. Everyone would know about it as a result. As the Bill is currently drafted, there is no such possibility. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-28_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Cameron of Lochbroom: </B>   I put my name to this amendment for several reasons, not the least of which is that, as the notes on the clauses make clear, there is a great distinction between the nomination of sexual offences in Scottish law which are gender-specific. The equivalent provisions can be found in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. So far as English criminal law is concerned, they were introduced in gender-neutral terms. As members of the Committee will recollect, Schedule 2 to that Act specifically sets out offences to <P>


<a name="column_GC108"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC108</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>which Section 72 applies&#151;offences outside the United Kingdom. The Scottish offences should be set out clearly and in full on the face of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="40114-28_para14"></a>That principle, which I regard as proper in the preparation of legislation&#151;whether it be for England and Wales, Northern Ireland or Scotland&#151;in the United Kingdom Parliament, should obtain in this case. Therefore, I support the intention with which the amendment was proposed. However, having put my name to the amendment, I am conscious that, in certain particulars, the nomination of the offences is not accurate. For example, "clandestine injury" in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 is fully "clandestine injury to a woman", and in,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"assault with intent to rape",
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-28_para15"></a>
the words "or ravish" also appear as the appropriate nominations for the Scottish offences. Other offences may also be appropriately listed. It is proper that those who may be affected by what is an important new offence should know specifically to what it applies. In my humble submission, the amendment is well founded.
<P>

<a name="40114-28_para16"></a>The reason for tabling Amendment No. 91 is that the provision would have remained on the face of the Bill even if Amendment No. 90 had been accepted. That underlines the importance of having a full list because it is not entirely clear what offences would be covered. For example, an offence may be committed only by a person of a particular gender. However, in the case of rape, one can imagine a circumstance in which a woman assisted a man in the act of rape. She would be responsible, as we say, "art and part", but the man may not have been identified. She would be able to stand trial on her own account. Those are the kinds of difficulty that could have arisen from a distorted way of construing Clause 19(3).
<P>

<a name="40114-28_para17"></a>There may be other reasons why the provision should be included in the Bill. It might best be included in the schedule. Perhaps that is something that could be looked at further. However, I urge the Minister to look seriously at the fundamental point that has been made. As far as Scots criminal law is concerned, it would be appropriate for these offences to be listed in full in the Bill.

I entirely agree with everything that the noble Earl, Lord Mar and Kellie, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, have just said. It would be otiose of me to repeat what has already been said about the amendments. I especially agree with what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, has just said about having a definitive list as set out in Amendment No. 94.
<P>

<a name="40114-28_para18"></a>There is a difficulty however. The proposed subsection (2)(j) in the amendment refers to the,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"abduction of a woman or girl with intent to rape".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-28_para19"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>
That is one example in which it is dangerous to be too specific in terms of the listed offences.
<P>

<a name="40114-28_para21"></a>For the sake of consistency and clarity, however, I do not know why what was good enough for the Sexual Offences Bill is not good enough for the Gender Recognition Bill. I therefore entirely support the noble and learned Lord's amendment, with the proviso that the definitive list may not always be adequate.

<A NAME="40114-28_spnew7"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   I speak very much as someone who is not a lawyer. However, I confess that, even with a good deal of experience, I am finding some legal language very hard to construe. I had not really read this clause until these past 10 minutes, but I am puzzled by subsection (1). The more that I look at it, the more I am beginning to think that it undermines the whole purpose of the Bill. It seems to be based on a premise that those who have acquired a new gender are not fully operative in that gender and something has to be safeguarded as a result. Perhaps I am misreading the clause, but I need to be assured that the Government are not cutting off their legs with Clause 19(1).

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-29_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   That was an interesting short discussion. As we have heard, in Scots law, many sexual offences remain gender-specific; that is to say that the gender of the victim and the perpetrator are essential elements in the definition of the acts involved. Under the Bill, once a person has been recognised in the acquired gender, criminal liability will be determined with reference to a person's acquired gender. In addition, Clause 19 ensures that, when criminal liability for a gender-specific offence exists, but for the fact that a person's gender has become the acquired gender, that criminal liability should still exist. The Office of the Scottish Parliamentary Counsel not only approved this clause but it drafted it.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para0"></a>The proposed amendment seeks to insert a list of gender-specific sex offences into Clause 19 in place of the general definition that the clause contains at present. The problem with using a list, as is proposed, is that, if further offences are created or the definition of existing offences is changed to include or exclude a gender specific element, the list would require amendment. The virtue of using a definition of gender-specific sex offences is that the need for future amendments is avoided.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para1"></a>I appreciate that the definition of gender-specific sex offences is complex. This is a complex area of the law. The definition has, however, been pored over and we are confident that it catches all relevant gender-specific sex offences as intended. I invite noble Lords to write to me if they believe that the definition offered in Clause 19 is insufficient.

<a name="40114-29_para11"></a>The noble Lord said: I anticipate that, by now, Members of the Committee will be aware of my view that, without an exemption to allow governing bodies the right to determine the classification for competition, the alternative route of allowing people to change their gender with the full legal rights accorded to them under this Bill will, particularly in the case of those who do not undergo surgery, jeopardise the entire future of competitive sport.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para12"></a>In Amendment No. 94, I have tabled a series of important rights and the protection of those rights in sport. First, I shall address the importance of protecting the rights of governing bodies of sport in the United Kingdom to determine the eligibility criteria for competition, as set out in proposed new paragraph (a) in Amendment No. 94. In so doing, there are three issues to address. The status of governing bodies of sport is a critical and important issue. I am most grateful to the Minister for his courtesy in considering this matter yesterday and, if I may say so in parentheses, for his courtesy throughout the debate over this difficult issue, not least in his recent comprehensive letter to me, to which I shall return.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para13"></a>Yesterday, he assisted your Lordships on the question of whether a governing body was always a private body, whether on some occasions it was a public body, or whether the law was uncertain in this area. That is critical to the amendment because, in the event that all governing bodies are private entities&#151;private clubs&#151;then no exemption would be required to this Bill. It would be a matter for the governing bodies and the Bill would not impact on those bodies.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para14"></a>I put aside for one moment the important point that it is not only governing bodies of sport which organise competitions and lay down the rules and regulations for entry to competitions. Local authorities also undertake that, as do government departments. When I was Minister for Sport, I had the honour and privilege of attending their sports days in the summer. They also determine the classification for entry into male and female categories. The key issue is for governing bodies of sport.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para15"></a>Yesterday, the noble Lord responded on this subject by stating that I was right to say that there are circumstances in which some sporting bodies could be treated as public bodies and could therefore come within the ambit of the ECHR and the challenge under Article 8 that they are potentially infringing private lives. That is not the end of the issue. Our firm position is that, in the interests of competitive parity, a sporting body will be able to discriminate against transsexuals in that situation. That would be a defence and a rebuttal.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para16"></a>In the world of sports law, I have never come across the concept of competitive parity, but I await with interest the Minister's description of that concept and of where its status in law is defined. In recent years, sports bodies have increasingly been seen to be public bodies. I refer noble Lords to the work undertaken by Dr David McArdle, who looked at the relationship between judicial review, public authorities and governing bodies.

<FONT SIZE=3>bodies have committed discriminatory acts, the courts have taken the opportunity to force those bodies to comply with anti-discrimination law.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para17"></a>There have also been occasions&#151;for example, in Couch v British Boxing Board of Control and Hardwick v Football Association&#151;when the courts have reviewed the procedural fairness of football's internal decision-making processes, not least in the case brought in 1996 involving Stevenage Borough Football Club. Moreover, it would be accurate to say that public authority is not defined in this legislation, nor in the Human Rights Act 1998. It has been left to the judiciary to determine whether a particular organisation amounts to a public authority. That means that, while the decision to regard sports organisations as private bodies for the purposes of judicial review might seem to prevent them being seen as public bodies for another purpose, they could still fall within the scope of the Human Rights Act. The idea of sports bodies being subject to human rights legislation may seem far-fetched but if the courts interpret the phrase as meaning pertaining to people generally or collectively rather than narrowly defining it as governmental or official, then most sports bodies would be covered.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para18"></a>The crucial point of the 1998 Act concerns the Football Association and the Jockey Club, to which I referred yesterday, and most other sports, which through their origins and the monopoly powers they possess, would, indeed, arguably be brought within the scope of a public authority. This is an interesting area of law, not least because, in the wake of the Diana Modahl affair and the treatment of James Masani and others and attempts to stymie individuals' freedom of speech, the arguments in favour of extending human rights legislation to them seems certain to come before the courts in the near future.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para19"></a>There is at the very least uncertainty over the definition and the role of governing bodies. There is no doubt at all that there is case law that demonstrates their role as public bodies. If we do not place the exemption on the face of the Bill, the imposition will fall on the clubs. There will be an obligation on the clubs and the governing bodies to make a decision which, arguably, could interfere with a transsexual's rights under this legislation. It could lead to a court case and to significant involvement in fees for the governing body. In my estimation, a determination would be required to prove that that action is proportionate to the legitimate aim of their decision.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para20"></a>This is particularly relevant and important in the context of a case which is before a Manchester employment tribunal at the present time; namely, Claire Ashton v Philip Heaton, a secretary of Cycling Time Trials. The relevance of that is the weight that the employment tribunal placed on our proceedings in this House vis-a-vis that hearing. Just a few weeks ago, Claire Ashton requested that the tribunal postpone the further hearing of the case pending the passing of the Bill that we are considering into law. That would allow Cycling Time Trials time to consider the relationship between its rules and regulations&#151;which it recognises will have to change&#151;and the new law. Claire Ashton <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>was very mindful of the point that I have just made about the costs that will be incurred by governing bodies in trying to decide this issue&#151;a cost which we can avoid by placing the exemption on the face of this Bill, but a cost which can escalate significantly, particularly when incurred by a body such as Cycling Time Trials which has a very limited resource. It is a comparatively small national sporting body and any legal action of this kind would obviously place a very heavy financial burden on it.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para21"></a>I must say in passing that I have been greatly assisted by the experts from Lawrence Graham in trying to get to grips with this important and difficult area of law. I recognise their expertise and I am grateful to them for their advice. The first point I want to make relating to paragraph (a) of Amendment No. 94 is a critical one. Even if there is doubt, the very fact that governing bodies undertake public duties, or can be deemed to be public in the context of their role, means that the argument that has been put forward so far&#151;that as private clubs they are outside the remit of this Bill&#151;is incorrect. Therefore, we need to address that issue. I argue that we best address it through an exemption.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para22"></a>I turn to my second point under paragraph (a) of Amendment No. 94. I am conscious of time. Members of the Committee will be pleased to learn that most of my remarks address paragraph (a) of Amendment No. 94. This point has been politely discussed by the Minister in conversation with me and in exchanges across the Committee. I refer to the views of governing bodies. What do governing bodies think about this legislation? What representations have they made? Yesterday, in an exchange on this matter, the Minister pointed out that he himself had not&#151;I think that I use the phrase correctly&#151;licked the 300 stamps that led to the consultation exercise that the Government have undertaken. He, indeed, mentioned that it was the Department for Culture, Media and Sport that had undertaken that consultation exercise. I have to say that I am saddened by not hearing the view of the Minister for Sport on this subject at any stage. I am even more saddened by not seeing the evidence of what I hope was a comprehensive analysis of the 300 responses presented for the consideration of this Committee. However, the Minister asked me, in the absence of that, for any evidence that I could produce in writing.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para23"></a>First, I shall quote from a select number of the responses that I have. Secondly, I shall pass on the record of anything that I have had in writing. I hasten to add, using as delicate language as I can, that some of the responses I have received are rather vehement in their desire for an exemption. I am not sure that that will enhance the reputation of those organisations vis-a-vis the Government when it comes to seeking financial support for their governing bodies. I hope that the Minister will allow an exemption to be made vis-a-vis those representations.
<P>

<a name="40114-29_para24"></a>Thirdly, I took very seriously what the Minister said yesterday. I hope that my next point will be of assistance to him and his officials. In the middle of last <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>night I decided that the best way to take this matter forward was to host a sports summit at the House of Lords. It is scheduled for Monday 26th at 11.30. I shall invite some of the very finest minds from the governing bodies and the international federations to join us. I issue an open invitation to any Member of the Committee who wishes to attend that summit. I issue that invitation particularly to the Minister and the Minister for Sport and his officials. I hope that they will attend that event to hear the concerns of those bodies. I shall ensure that invitations are sent to them. By that time, I very much hope that the Minister will have accepted the strength of the arguments that I put before the Committee and, if he is unhappy with my amendment, will have tabled an amendment of his own to cover the exemption. Monday 26th falls shortly before the date when I anticipate that we shall pass rather quickly to Report stage. I am sure that the rumour that is circulating is completely erroneous; namely, that the Bill will be fast-tracked so that its Report stage coincides with the week in which the vote on tuition fees will take place along with the publication of the Hutton report in order to shield this very important legislation from the public eye. However, I am sure that that rumour is mere mischief in the corridors of Westminster and Whitehall.

Dope testing of transgender athletes would be extremely problematic. The Bill is potentially in conflict with the Sex Discrimination Act under section 44, which allows the restriction to one sex where the strength and stamina of the average woman would put her at a disadvantage to the average man.

<A NAME="40114-30_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   I am most grateful for that intervention in one respect above all others. Many people genuinely understand the reason why there needs to be a sensitive approach to transsexuals. They <P>


<a name="column_GC116"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC116</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have a genuine and reasonable approach to the issue of transsexuals within the law but nevertheless argue equally strongly for an exemption for competitive sport. That is a pertinent and important intervention and one that is useful to place on the record although I distance myself from the definition of the contribution of my noble friend Lord Tebbit to our proceedings which to date have been heartfelt and helpful in the consideration of the various clauses that do not relate to competitive sport. That concludes what I consider the fairly foolproof argument for paragraph (a) of Amendment No. 94.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para2"></a>Paragraph (b) of Amendment No. 94 is specific to the British Olympic Association. Here there is an interesting development. The International Olympic Committee has recognised the difficulty of defining male and female. The IOC medical director, Patrick Schamasch, recently argued that, following the removal of gender testing at the time of the Sydney Olympics, the IOC is keen to move towards a position where it will have no discrimination and that it will respect the human rights of transsexuals. What is interesting about the position of the IOC, which, incidentally, is not finalised at the present time&#151;the International Olympic Committee will meet in February to consider the whole question further&#151;is that the IOC medical director, Patrick Schamasch, has stated that transsexual athletes will be eligible for the Olympics once a certain amount of time has elapsed after their sex change surgery.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para3"></a>Here you have within the IOC at the present time&#151;I emphasise that the IOC has yet to reach a firm conclusion on the matter&#151;already a markedly tighter definition than the requirement in the Bill. Why is that? It is because the IOC accepts sex change surgery as a condition for recognising a transsexual for potential competition in the new sex. The Bill does not require sex change surgery. I was sympathetic to the medical case described yesterday in which a transsexual who has moved from being a man to a woman&#151;and who might want to have the surgical operation to move from one gender to another but could not&#151;would nevertheless have the full weight of this law behind them. They would receive their certificate whilst having the body of their previous gender; namely, a man. That has not been covered by the International Olympic Committee nor is it envisaged that that individual would be able to compete in the Olympic Games. It is a far, far tighter definition.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para4"></a>I emphasise that the IOC has yet to reach a final view on this matter. It is receiving reports. I understand that those reports will be presented to the International Olympic Committee delegates next month.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para5"></a>The position of the British Olympic Association is very clear. The British Olympic Association's position is that it is governed by the IOC concerning participation at the Olympic Games. The British Olympic Association states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"The IOC still has no official position on the issue of transsexuals".

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para7"></a>The International Olympic Committee has status in the world of sport only for two weeks every four years. It is the British Olympic Association that needs the exemption because within the United Kingdom that association is in charge of all our Olympics preparation and the selection of the team that competes in the Games.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para8"></a>For that reason, in this difficult area of determining what is a man and what is a woman for the eligibility of competition in the Olympic Games, I would strongly argue that that role and responsibility should be undertaken by the International Olympic Committee as it concerns eligibility for its competitions. The British Olympic Association should thus have its rights respected in ensuring that it determines the gender of athletes selected for either male or female competition in the Olympic Games.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para9"></a>Paragraph (c) of Amendment No. 94 refers to the paralympics. In my view the paralympics are just as important as the Olympic Games. I believe that to date they have received far too little consideration regarding publicity and the importance attached to them in the context of the 2012 bid. I hope that they will receive far more consideration in those regards. This country has some of the finest disabled athletes in the world and we should appreciate them to a far greater extent than we do. However, for the purposes of the amendment, the British Paralympic Association has stated:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"We should advise that competitive sport needs to be exempted from the requirements of the Bill. We would have grave concerns over the protection of vulnerable adults and children and the implications for volunteer supervisors in the world of disability sport, in particular in relation to the issues presented by a pre-operative individual".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-30_para10"></a>
I am quoting selectively but on no occasion have I failed to reflect the views of a governing body that has written to me or contacted me in favour of this legislation. However, in the interests of time, I give a brief summary of the views of a number of governing bodies. In the context of paragraph (c) of Amendment No. 94 it is important to recognise that the British Paralympic Association should continue to determine the gender of athletes seeking selection to compete in the paralympic games. The best way of ensuring that is to place an exemption on the face of the legislation.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para11"></a>Paragraph (d) of Amendment No. 94 comprises a sensitive issue. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on that paragraph. Many sport and recreational clubs in this country&#151;indeed, throughout the United Kingdom&#151;have very real difficulty with regard to the provision of changing rooms if this legislation is enacted.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para12"></a>I would like to quote someone. I hope that in so doing Members of the Committee will not react negatively or over-emotionally to what I am about to read. It is from a top sports person who wrote not to me but to someone else in the sport, and she requests to remain anonymous. She states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"I am writing to let you know how I am getting increasingly extremely angry with a certain competitor. I am not the only person to feel like this. Imagine my absolute horror yesterday <P>

From that moment on I almost dropped my handbag in shock. I felt under extreme pressure for the rest of the day. It has put me increasingly in a very embarrassing situation. I felt I was being watched all day. I came out with an enormous headache".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-30_para13"></a><P>

<a name="40114-30_para14"></a>There is a genuine issue here. There are those who understandably will respect their gender change, be sensitive to it and respond accordingly. I would have thought that that would refer to the overwhelming majority of transsexuals. But in sport there is a problem, especially under this law, with transsexuals who have behind them the full weight of the law to change in female changing facilities and yet they have a male body or what is traditionally perceived to be a male body; in other words, their gender prior to the reception of the certificate for change.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para15"></a>Mothers, children and daughters use the women's changing facilities. At present there is a real problem among competitors, as I have demonstrated. We should not make light of the difficulty that that creates in the immediacy of sports clubs the length and breadth of the country, many of which have very limited resources. It is impossible simply to ask them to create another two changing rooms and many would regard that as completely unreasonable.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para16"></a>In many circumstances it is possible to ensure sensible arrangements are achieved. But there are issues and incidents, even before this legislation is enacted. The one example that I have given shows that it is very important that we leave sports clubs and governing bodies of sports the right to ensure that sport and recreational clubs determine their own restrictions on access to changing room facilities based on their definition of gender.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para17"></a>In Amendment No. 94, paragraph (e) deals with,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"gender classification of competition for hermaphrodites".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-30_para18"></a>
That is a probing amendment for this reason: in making this case I do not want to lead the Committee to the conclusion that this is not an extremely difficult issue when it comes to determining the sex and thus the eligibility for different classifications of competition; namely, male and female. It is enormously difficult. It cannot be done simply on the basis of chromosomes. The International Olympic Committee recognises that. It is not just a matter of the simplicity of XX or XY chromosomes. There are XXY chromosomal people. It is not just a matter of testosterone levels. Some women have very high levels of testosterone, in addition to those who undertake gender reclassification, and there are competitors who have very high testosterone levels.
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para19"></a>Equally, it is not possible to match chromosomal patterns with testosterone levels and oestrogen levels. One would probably achieve a fair definition of what conventionally would be determined as male or female for fair competition by matching those three, but the issue is enormously difficult for any governing body to undertake. Each and every governing body in making that assessment will have different criteria because of the differences between sports. There is a huge difference between the criteria necessary for fair competition in a contact sport, as opposed to fair competition in darts.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-30_para20"></a>I table this not so much&#151;I anticipate that the Minister will not immediately accept the amendment carte blanche&#151;to emphasise that this is a big problem for sport, but it is a problem that sport has to address. It is better left to governing bodies to determine fair and reasonable classifications for competition within their sports. The sentence, which is one of the Minister's great historic sentences, in his letter to me reads as follows,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"considering this issue, it is important to note that it is not for sport to define male and female".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-30_para21"></a>
I would strongly argue that that is precisely what sport must do. Sports bodies must define who may and may not compete in male and female sporting competitions, as the Minster went on to note. In defining who competes in either a male or female competition, by definition that sport, that governing body, must take a view as to whether someone is male or female. They must have regulations and, if necessary, supporting tests to satisfy their ability to make that distinction.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-31_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   Just in case it assists to shorten the debate on this clause, the issue is not that sporting bodies need to go into the business of deciding whether someone is male or female. They must decide how to uphold competitive parity. That is the issue.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-31_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   But it is the issue. You cannot uphold the principle of competitive parity&#151;whatever that principle is&#151;if that means fair competition. I am with the Minister completely. You cannot uphold fair competition unless you define what is required to enter the men's 100 metres in the Olympic games as opposed to the women's 100 metres. I have said in my comments on paragraph (e) of Amendment No. 94 that that is enormously difficult. It is so difficult that it has caused the International Olympic Committee not to test for gender after the Sydney games, although it is now coming back, having reflected on the matter, to what is fair. One cannot state that one is not going to test for gender at all unless one is prepared for a total free-for-all. That would be a nonsense in sport.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para0"></a>If you are not going to test on the basis of gender, you must classify for fair competition, for "competitive parity", a high testosterone event, or a low oestrogen event, or some form of classification to make competition fair. Unless you have that distinction, it is unfair for women to compete in open events against men. It is clear that there would be no fairness in many sports&#151;certainly the strength sports and any of the athletic sports that I can think of&#151;to make it totally open competition. Surely nobody in this room is seeking to persuade the International Olympic Committee to abandon the male/female distinction when it comes to open competition. We are seeking, I hope, to enable the International Olympic Committee and all governing bodies to have reasonable rules to ensure fair competition.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para1"></a>By providing them with an exemption, they can then determine those rules, put those rules to the test and ensure the continuation of fair sport. That is why I have put down the exemptions in paragraphs (a) to (e) <P>


<a name="column_GC120"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC120</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>of Amendment No. 94. Paragraph (f) of Amendment No. 94 focuses on the obvious dangers. It is an obvious safety issue with regard to contact sports. I quote the Football Association. I know that the Government rightly take great cognisance of what it says. I made it clear earlier that the personal safety issue in the context of football means that allowing male to female transsexuals to compete in female football would involve our having to consider mixed football rules. We would have no argument for prohibiting it. The disparity in strength levels would unarguably lead to an increased risk of physical injury. It is vitally important that all governing bodies recognise that their principal role is that of the safety of the competitors whom they control, to manage events and to provide the opportunity for fair and safe competition.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para2"></a>In paragraph (g) of Amendment No. 94 I summarise that and go one step further. One cannot simply exclude governing bodies. Sport is not just run by governing bodies. I mentioned local authorities at the beginning of this short assessment of what is a comprehensive subject on which I could speak for much longer if we had time, and the importance of events run by government departments.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para3"></a>I would say with all the minimal persuasion that I can muster that, should the Government be in agreement with me about what I have said, there is no better way to demonstrate that agreement than by placing an exemption in the Bill. The principle of exemptions in the Bill is accepted&#151;with regard to inheritance and the Monarchy, for example.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para4"></a>The principle of exemption is there, and I would argue that it is vitally important that we exempt competitive sport, more than any other part of society that I can think of. If we do not do so, we are adding a huge burden to the governing bodies of sport, and not only to prove their case before the courts if anyone with a certificate turns up. We immediately give primacy, with regard to all public bodies, for anyone who comes away from this legislation after two years with a certificate that they have acquired a new gender to insist that they can compete in that new gender in that sport, irrespective of the rules that are placed there for fair competition by the governing body. That is unacceptable. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40114-31_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   We support the principle behind the amendment, although we would not regard this particular amendment as the appropriate one to include in the Bill. We believe that an exemption should be clearly placed on the principle in particular of competitive parity, and for safety.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para5"></a>There is an obvious problem with male to female transsexuals, because the evidence suggests that they retain to some extent, even after surgery, the advantages given by the male physique in most athletic sports. However, unconditional exemption should not necessarily be given to governing bodies. For example, I can see no reason why a female to male transsexual should not be eligible to compete in a men's golf <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-31_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I fully support my noble friend's amendments, and I can merely repeat what he has already said. I find it extraordinary that the Bill as currently drafted protects the status quo with regard to succession and peerages and the devolution of property, but not something so important as competitive parity. I hope that the Government will listen to my noble friend on the amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-31_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   This is one of the not totally unique occasions when there is an agreement on objective but a debate about whether there is a problem in practice. The agreement on objective is that we are foursquare with the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, on the fundamental importance of maintaining fair and safe competition. I shall not give a long speech about the importance of sport in our society, but clearly fundamental to that is the ability to have a sense of fair competition.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para6"></a>I do not believe that the problem as advanced by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, is quite of the extent or extremity that he has expressed, but I do not want to incite him to give me further evidence at this point in our proceedings. No doubt we shall have opportunities to have further discussions.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para7"></a>I also mark that sporting bodies have a problem, as he said, irrespective of the Bill. There is a problem of transsexuals in our society. I do not by that mean to imply that the problem is transsexuals; the problem is how to ensure competitive parity while recognising that some people are transsexuals. The issue is not caused by the Bill but is one that sporting bodies at international, national and local level are already addressing to varying degrees. However, in the evidence that I read, it was interesting how many national sporting bodies had not specifically engaged with that issue. It is an issue, but it is not necessarily at the top of their agendas, although that does not mean to say that it is irrelevant.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para8"></a>I shall set out, I hope not too lengthily, the Government's position on the matter. We believe that maintaining competitive parity, or fair and safe competition, is fundamentally important, but we are not convinced that there is a problem. I shall set out the law briefly as we see it, leaving that open as an opportunity for further engagement&#151;perhaps not tonight, but it is a genuine invitation. We want to know whether people believe that we are wrong in our judgment that there is not a problem. Our ears are wide open.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para9"></a>Section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act provides a broad exemption for any act in relation to any sport in which women are on average at a disadvantage. That broad exemption ensures that men have no right to participate in women's events, but it also allows single-sex sports teams not to employ transsexual team <P>


<a name="column_GC122"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC122</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>members when it is a reasonable response because of unfair competition or safety. Therefore, that section already provides for sporting bodies that are not public bodies&#151;and I underline that point&#151;to make judgments about whether competitive parity or safety would be infringed by allowing a transsexual person to be engaged, whether or not they had a legal gender recognition certificate. Therefore, they are totally at liberty to make a judgment not to allow a person to compete, if they can demonstrate its reasonableness, which in many sports they would easily be able to do.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para10"></a>The judgment of the ECHR on Goodwin does not require the enactment of a general prohibition on discrimination against transsexual people. All it requires is legal recognition in the acquired gender and a right to marry in that gender; the Bill will not give transsexual people the general right to participate in sport in the acquired gender.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para11"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, is correct in saying that some sporting bodies will be public bodies. When and if they are, they will engage ECHR. If that happens, Article 8.1 is engaged, concerning the right to a private life. There is a consensus that the ability to participate in sports is seen as part of a right to a private life. However, Article 8.1 is governed and limited by 8.2, which essentially allows interference with Article 8.1 when it is for one of the legitimate aims set out there, which is protection of health and the rights and freedom of others.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para12"></a>Our position, and the position of many others, is that because Article 8.2 explicitly governs Article 8.1, there will be occasions when safety will clearly be engaged&#151;for example, in judo. Therefore, it is legitimate for a sporting body in such circumstances to refuse to allow a person who was, for example, a male to female transsexual, whether or not they have been given a gender recognition certificate, to participate in a sport as a consequence.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para13"></a>The other limb of Article 8.2 is the issue about rights and freedoms of others. The right of a woman to be able to compete in sports on a fair basis is a perfectly proper right, to be protected by Article 8.2. Therefore, in a situation in which a sporting body was a public body and when the physical advantage of a male to female transsexual, whether registered or not, would put a woman at a disadvantage in competitive parity, it is perfectly possible for that sporting body to discriminate against a transsexual as a consequence under Article 8.2.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para14"></a>Restrictions imposed by sporting bodies would be justified provided that they were proportionate to the need to ensure fairness of competition and safety. I am not stating, and nor would anyone who was sane, that that is completely at large: clearly with reference to a tiddlywinks competition, those issues would not be engaged. However, we are talking about the sort of example that the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, mentioned. The issue is one of seeking to have a dialogue with those sporting bodies and explaining to them why we do not believe that they are at risk as a consequence of the law. In other words, the law is there and the issue is there for sporting bodies to face, whether or not the Bill is passed.

<a name="40114-31_para15"></a>We intend to publish guidance on the issues, as that will be helpful to sporting bodies. We shall ensure that the guidance is published in draft, as usual, well before the Bill is enacted, so that they can see it and consider the issues.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para16"></a>I apologise for having spent some time setting our position on the law, but this is essentially an issue about the law and whether there is a hole in the law that causes an anxiety for sporting bodies. I respect the importance of those concerns and anxieties, and we welcome those bodies, if they wish to, to have further dialogue with us about those issues. We shall also consider further representations from them on the issues.
<P>

<a name="40114-31_para17"></a>I am in the Committee's hands, as I could put on the record a response to paragraphs (b) to (g) of the amendment. If the noble Lord wishes me to do so, I shall be pleased to do it . On the other hand, I could write to him and set out why we do believe those aspects of the amendment are unnecessary, copying the letter as ever to Opposition Front Benches. I have focused on the first part because I believe it to be the heart of the issue, and the issue that matters most to him. If he would like to intervene at this point, I shall defer to him.

<A NAME="40114-32_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   I am conscious of time and the will of the Committee to make progress and preferably to complete at the end of this second day. Therefore, I am more than happy to accept the kind offer of the Minister to write to me on the specifics of the issues relating to paragraphs (b) through (g), especially given the fact that I fundamentally disagree with his interpretation of the substantive point. That is why we shall return to that point in later stages of the proceedings of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-32_spnew1"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Winchester: </B>   I am grateful to the Minister for his courtesy, as ever. I have listened with great care to the Minister's fascinating response to the still more fascinating disquisition given by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan. The reason why I listened with such interest was because what I was hearing was the recognition of the importance for our society of comparative parity and the preparedness of the Government to put some restrictions, by implication, on the crucial phrase "for all purposes" in Clause 9. If the Government are doing that&#151;and if they give way on that point to competitive sport, as it seems to me they must, and not on the institution of marriage&#151;they will have a great deal of explaining to do, not only to the churches and the faiths but more widely in society.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-32_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Filkin: </B>   I admire the adventurous busking that came in at that point, and I note it. I do not wish to excite the optimism of the right reverend Prelate; I was not signalling that we thought that there was a need to add anything to the Bill in that respect. I was saying why we believe that the current law gives adequate protection to sporting bodies.
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para0"></a>I shall go slightly further and mark that, if the argument is that some sporting bodies are public bodies&#151;which we agree&#151;and that the Human Rights <P>


<a name="column_GC124"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Act is engaged, writing things in the Bill will not disengage the Human Rights Act. I leave that as pause for thought. Having said that, I conclude by saying that we are happy to look at further representations and to consider the issue further before we get to Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-32_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Moynihan: </B>   I thank the Minister for his response. As I said, I fundamentally disagree with some of his interpretations. The Bill is clearly in conflict with the Sex Discrimination Act under the exemption under Section 44. I need only read Clause 9(1) to underline that point. We shall need to return to that.
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para1"></a>I have never argued that, by putting an exemption on the Bill, the governing bodies would be exempt from the human rights legislation. On the contrary, I have argued that not only will they be clearly within the remit of that legislation but they will have the duty to deal with those cases that are difficult and which are prevalent in sport today, and will be in future. It will create a status quo for governing bodies, which will have to deal with the issue. Putting an exemption in the Bill would emphasise that they should continue to deal with the issue rather than entering the legal minefield that would be created, not only by the conflict with the Sex Discrimination Act but on the other issues that the Minister raised.
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para2"></a>The one item on which I do agree with him is the concept of proportionality. In the context of human rights legislation, that will be a very important one for sport. I am grateful to the Minister and the other Members of the Committee for being so patient, and look forward to returning to the issue in detail on Report and Third Reading. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

(i)" 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="40114-32_para6"></a>The noble and learned Lord said: The amendment is grouped with Amendment No. 96 in my name. These amendments were suggested by the Law Society of Scotland, and I am happy to take them up as probing amendments. I start from the premise that this clause creates an offence and that it is proper that the limits of the offence and any defence should be set out as clearly as possible for the sake of certainty.
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para7"></a>The nature of the offence in subsection (1) is in the form of a prohibition against disclosure, with the important words, "to any other person". Subsections (2) and (3) deal, respectively, with protected information and the person who is subject to the prohibition in subsection (1).
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para8"></a>Subsection (4) sets out the conditions under which disclosure is not to be regarded as an offence. The conditions vary: paragraph (a) refers to identity; paragraph (b) to agreement to disclosure; paragraph <P>

<a name="40114-32_para9"></a>
Paragraph (e) also deals with that, but paragraph (f) relates to disclosure,

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-32_para10"></a>
It is as bald and short as that. Unlike paragraph (g), it does not actually state to whom the disclosure can be made, and it is in that regard that I raise the matter.
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para11"></a>When one is dealing with the issue of prevention or investigation of crime, the two institutions most narrowly involved are the prosecuting authorities or the police. Clearly, disclosure should be to as few people as possible. I submit that it is proper in principle that the limits to such disclosure should be, so far as possible, stated in the Bill in paragraph (f), so that one is clear what the offence is and what the defence may be to the disclosure.
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para12"></a>Amendment No. 96 would nominate the two persons in each of the two criminal jurisdictions who are responsible for prosecution&#151;that is, the Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate&#151;and for the police investigation, the chief constable. It is for those reasons that I suggest that it is proper that the terms of paragraph (f) should be extended to make it clear to whom the disclosure should be made in very special circumstances for the purpose of preventing or investigating crime. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-32_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I have added my name to that of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, in relation to both amendments in the hope of probing the Government and pressing them to set out more clearly the permitted exceptions to the offence of disclosing protected information about a transsexual person.
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para13"></a>I entirely agree with all that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cameron of Lochbroom, has said thus far. The importance of subsection (4)(f) cannot be over-emphasised. It permits disclosure for the purpose of preventing or investigating a crime. As the Minister said in his Second Reading speech, there is no reason at all to believe that a transsexual person is any more likely to commit a crime than anyone else. However, the fact that he has acquired a new gender and birth certificate could, if we are not careful, make it easier for a criminal to cover his tracks.
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para14"></a>Sadly, we know only too well of cases in which criminals have tricked the authorities as to their identities with far less than a brand new birth certificate. It is essential that it is as easy as possible for a police officer investigating a crime to be fully informed of an individual's identity history. On the other hand, I accept that there must be limits on who is able to access the information.
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para15"></a>In short, we believe that subsection (4)(f) is too loose. It must specify the identity of the recipient of any disclosed information. Amendments Nos. 95 and <P>


<a name="column_GC126"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC126</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>96 would provide one way in which to do that, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response on this important aspect of the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-32_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I hope to be extremely brief. The Bill provides a prohibition against disclosure of a person's gender history when that information is acquired in an official capacity. However, it also stipulates a range of exemptions that reflect legitimate public policy objectives&#151;for example, preventing or investigating a crime. The noble Baroness has only to remind us of the change of name in the Soham case to illustrate the problems that that can generate.
<P>

<a name="40114-32_para16"></a>While I agree with the spirit of the amendment&#151;that disclosure of protected information should be permitted only in limited circumstances and that the privacy of transsexual people should be protected as widely as possible&#151;the clause as drafted already fulfils that purpose. It limits the reason for disclosure, which means that it is unnecessary to specify individuals or organisations. It is also worth bearing in mind that the prohibition on disclosure applies to each person who acquires the information in an official capacity. Therefore, a police officer who acquires information about a person's gender history may disclose that information only under the terms of Clause 21&#151;for example, when that onward disclosure is itself for the purpose of investigating a crime or when it is for the purpose of proceedings before a court or tribunal. The clause therefore provides a powerful safeguard for the privacy of transsexual people.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-32_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Cameron of Lochbroom: </B>   I am grateful for the support that I obtained from the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, in this matter, and for the explanation given by the Minister.

The group is designed to remove from the Bill the opportunity for both the Westminster Secretary of State, in Amendment No. 102, and Scottish Ministers, in Amendment No. 103, to make regulations that will create further circumstances under which disclosure is exempt from the criminal offence provisions.
<P>

<a name="40114-33_para2"></a>Subsection (4) is drafted to give a wide and broad-ranging list of the circumstances that will be exempt from the criminal offence provisions.

<FONT SIZE=3>the exemption provisions. Therefore, subsections (5), (6) and (7) would seem to be unnecessary. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-33_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Cameron of Lochbroom: </B>   I have put my name in support of the amendments, to discover what the circumstances could be in which any such orders are as suggested in subsection (5) could arise. I do that against the background of subsection (4), in which the purposes for which such protected information should be disclosed are clearly set out&#151;in paragraphs (f) and (h), for example. Furthermore, there is provision in paragraph (j) for disclosure,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"in accordance with any provision of, or made by virtue of, an enactment other than this section".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-33_para3"></a>
So Parliament will have the opportunity to expand on the circumstances in which disclosure may take place.
<P>

<a name="40114-33_para4"></a>For those reasons, I support the amendment. I should say that some reference to subsection (4)(i) was made in the course of a debate on Amendment No. 60, relating to the concerns about passing information between two individuals for a certain purpose of onward transmission. It might be that, when one looks at the terms of subsection (4) and the reference to purposes, that if that was passed with that intent and it should go to the investigating authority into the crime, neither person would be caught in passing on the information.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-33_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Disclosure is a matter of great sensitivity to transsexual people, and it is right that it should be restricted. There is a strong case for saying that disclosure should be made only for reasons set out in the Bill. However, even if one does not go as far as that, and even if it is accepted that there may be circumstances in which orders made under subsection (5) are required. In that case, it seems clear that orders under that subsection should be upgraded from the negative to the affirmative procedure. No amendment is standing for that purpose in the Marshalled List today, but that is something that we may well wish to table at Report stage.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-33_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I add my support, and I have added my name to the amendments. It would be otiose of me to repeat the comments of other noble Lords, but I add my voice on one aspect. Paragraphs (a) to (j) already cover such a broad range of circumstances that it is wrong to give the Secretary of State that additional leeway.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-33_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I do not believe that saying. "It is wrong for the Secretary of State to have additional leeway" reflects the reality of the situation. Legislation changes and circumstances change. Even in the course of today, following our discussions with the right reverend Prelate and the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, we have taken the discussions forward on issues such as ministers for other religions, which we may need to include in the legislation.
<P>

<a name="40114-33_para5"></a>The first argument relates to flexibility. If one insisted on having only those things in the Bill, it would restrict one's capacity to respond as other issues arise. <P>


<a name="column_GC128"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC128</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>We shall consider the issue of whether the process should be done through negative or affirmative procedure, and we shall study the implications.
<P>

<a name="40114-33_para6"></a>The second point is that the Government's proposal to handle the matter in this way is, as I understand it, fully in accord with the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. I would therefore suggest that, the Committee having fully scrutinised the matter, the Government are wise to have that capacity to engage in extending the range without seeking to amend primary legislation&#151;doing it by regulation.

<P>

<a name="40114-33_para10"></a>We return again to Clause 21, which may turn out to be the most difficult part of the whole Bill, because it actually makes it a criminal offence to talk about a person's true sex. If you acquire information about a person's true sex in an official capacity, you can be prosecuted in the magistrates' court and fined £5,000 if you tell anyone. People may say that civil servants and people like that are in positions of great public trust and are already under all sorts of confidentiality restrictions, so what is wrong with Clause 21? What is wrong with it is that it does not apply just to civil servants; it applies to voluntary organisations and to private employers. In no way are these people in the same category as civil servants.
<P>

<a name="40114-33_para11"></a>A mosque may be regarded as a voluntary organisation.

He may want to tell his friends who are imams in other mosques in the area. He may know that they feel just as strongly as he does that it is immoral to try to change one's sex. Should he really be fined thousands of pounds for talking to his fellow imams and giving them information which they need in order to preserve their religious integrity?
<P>

<a name="40114-33_para12"></a>What about employers? They have to give references for previous employees. What if Bob Smith were absent from work for months and finally resigned from the employment as part of his transition to becoming Barbara Smith? One may feel very strongly <P>


<a name="column_GC129"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC129</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>that what he was doing was wrong. Aside from the fact that he had not been doing his job for months, you may see his actions as having a devastating impact on his wife and children and you might have very strong views about that. What happens when his next employer writes saying, "Please provide us with a reference for Barbara Smith. Please make particular reference to your assessment of her honesty, her ability to work as a team player and her reliability"? The employer may well have difficulty in honestly answering those questions without mentioning the sex change.
<P>

<a name="40114-33_para13"></a>The employer may object strongly to having to write a letter referring to him as "her". He may, in all conscience, simply not feel able to lie by sending a letter calling Bob, "Barbara". Yet if the reply is honest and refers to the historical reality that, "When Bob Smith worked with us he held a post in the administration department", you have broken the criminal law.
<P>

<a name="40114-33_para14"></a>The Government have clearly not thought this through. The Bill enshrines a kind of selfishness that says that the only person who matters when someone is having a sex change is the transsexual and everyone else has no locus. That really is not good enough. My noble friend Lord Tebbit says that his Amendment No. 99 takes a broad approach to the issue of disclosure and allows it "in the public interest". That would at least give a person hauled up before the magistrates the opportunity to make out a defence if he can show that he believed there was some public interest in his disclosure.
<P>

<a name="40114-33_para15"></a>"The public interest" is an existing legal concept with which the courts are used to dealing. I wait with interest to hear what the Minister has to say about this proposal. Specifically, I should like her to say what she thinks Bob Smith's employer should say in his reference. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-33_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Carlile of Berriew: </B>   I should like to say a couple of things about this issue. The first is that I am astonished by the suggestion that an imam would regard something said by a member of his congregation as less confidential than anything said by any other members of a congregation to their priest, their rabbi, or, for that matter, their doctor or their solicitor. This is a relationship governed by confidentiality. Frankly, whatever example one chooses, we have no business to be talking to other people about the private business that is disclosed in that way.
<P>

<a name="40114-33_para16"></a>My second point is that the amendment does not seek to provide a public interest defence. It seeks to provide a subjective public interest defence. That is an extraordinary proposition, which would drive a coach and horses through many of our notions about public interest defences. If the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, wishes to attempt to place a public interest defence on the face of the Bill, he should do so; but this is not it.

<A NAME="40114-34_spnew0"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   I am so glad that I was here to listen to the comments of the noble Lord, <P>


<a name="column_GC130"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC130</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Lord Carlile. I have to say that&#151;and I do not mean this disrespectfully&#151;I was astonished at amendments which seemed in an ethical sense to be wrecking amendments to the concept of the Bill; that someone might gossip about someone else, simply because he thinks that it may be of interest to another person. I could not, and I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, does not, believe that to be a legitimate public interest defence of any sort.
<P>

<a name="40114-34_para0"></a>We have carefully drawn up what we mean by public interest. We know that&#151;for example&#151;under Article 8 it obviously includes our national security. It is about the economic wellbeing of the country; the prevention of disorder and crime; the protection of health; and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Except for that, there can be no public interest defence. I think it would wreck the Bill if anyone who thought they might have a public interest in this could gossip maliciously or otherwise to other people. There would be no point in the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-34_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   "Do not shoot the messenger", I suppose one should say.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-34_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   We drew that distinction.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-34_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness O'Cathain: </B>   There is serious point here. I have a great deal of sympathy with the point about references. It will put people in a very difficult position. I know that there are people who say, "Once someone leaves your employment, it does not really matter what kind of reference you write". Having been in receipt of some of those references and employed people, I know that this is a very nasty habit that is creeping into our management practices in this country by virtue of the fact that people want to be litigious and sue on anything. So it is an issue that bears consideration. What does someone do in those circumstances? I should be grateful if the Minister could give me her feeling off the top of her head?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-34_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Hollis of Heigham: </B>   In so far as we are talking about names, Robert Smith&#151;an employer&#151;can and should refer to his former employee by reference to his current identity. This is the new name set out in the gender recognition register. It is as though someone had changed their name by deed poll.
<P>

<a name="40114-34_para1"></a>Perhaps the noble Baroness is pressing a deeper issue, such as to what extent the employer should be free to discuss the medical condition and history and so on. That is protected information.

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-34_para7"></a>The noble Earl said: I apologise to the Lord Chairman for me being a little dopey. Amendment No. 105 is of a constitutional nature. It imposes a requirement on the Westminster Secretary of State in order to bring in some parity with the Scottish Ministers.
<P>

<a name="40114-34_para8"></a>Clause 22(2) requires the Scottish Ministers to go through a process of consultation before tabling amendments to this legislation. That consultation is the procedural requirement of the Scottish Parliament. Amendment No. 105 has the effect of imposing the same requirement to hold the consultation process before proposing amendments to the legislation upon the Westminster Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="40114-34_para9"></a>Clause 22(1) as drafted allows the Secretary of State to modify the legislation by order without a statutory process of consultation. Not only do I believe that it is unwise to have procedural diversity in this circumstance, but I also believe that it would be very wise for us to legislate now for such a process of consultation. I beg to move.

<A NAME="40114-34_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   Amendments Nos. 107 and 109 in the names of my noble friend Lord Carlile and myself are grouped with this amendment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-34_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   I shall be very brief. The amendment proposes that the power should be exercised only after the Secretary of State has consulted such persons as he sees fit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-34_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   Clause 25 sets out the commencement procedure for this Bill. My opposition to the Question whether the clause shall stand part is intended to probe the Minister further on an issue which we discussed at Second Reading and which, indeed, we discussed briefly yesterday&#151;that is, the timing of the Bill compared with the time at which the <P>


<a name="column_GC132"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC132</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>provisions set out in the civil partnerships Bill will be enacted. I have to say that the Government are slipping into the habit of getting ahead of themselves. Indeed, another Bill in your Lordships' House is currently creating huge powers for regional assemblies, and that is before the Government have held any referendums to decide whether the regions want them.
<P>

<a name="40114-34_para20"></a>With this Bill, the Government are asking people to divorce in order to receive a full gender recognition certificate before the provisions are in place for them immediately, or almost immediately, to enter into a civil partnership&#151;in fact, before the Bill has even been printed. Originally, I had in mind an amendment which stated explicitly that the Bill would not commence until the provisions of the civil partnerships Bill were in force. However, I was unable to name a Bill that had not yet been presented to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="40114-34_para21"></a>After Second Reading, the Minister kindly sent me a letter saying that it was up to individuals to choose. If they want a minimal gap between marriage and civil partnership&#151;I quote from the Minister's letter&#151;
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it will be for a married transsexual person to decide whether to wait for the implementation of civil partnership proposals".
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-34_para22"></a>
But what if those never happen? What if parliamentary resistance is such that the Government are forced to abandon the Bill? Surely that would leave the people whom we have been discussing over the past two days in relation to the Gender Recognition Bill in a terrible limbo. What will happen? I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-34_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We have acknowledged the powerful arguments for allowing married couples to move smoothly into forming a civil partnership where one partner has changed gender. I do not believe that anything is gained by preventing transsexual people applying for gender recognition until a civil partnerships Bill is enacted. After all, there are very many unmarried transsexual people. We estimate that there are around 5,000 such people in the UK. Of those, groups representing the transsexual community suggest that only between 100 and 200 are in existing marriages.
<P>

<a name="40114-34_para23"></a>Even for transsexual people who are in existing marriages, this Bill does not force them into applying immediately. The individual is in control of the process. Therefore, a married transsexual person is perfectly free to wait until civil partnerships are enacted before making an application to the gender recognition panel.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-34_spnew12"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   I thank the Minister for his reply. However, my key point is that we should ask what would happen if the civil partnerships Bill never came into force. Let us suppose that the Bill, for whatever reason, falls. In that case, in my view, there would be a serious problem because the individuals who might wish to go ahead and seek gender recognition would do so on the understanding that they might then be able to enter into a civil partnership arrangement. However, if that Bill does not become law, there will be a problem.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-34_para24"></a>I know that the Minister is correct in saying that a minimum number of people would be affected by the legislation, but the fact that it is a minimal number does not negate the problem. I do not wish to detain your Lordships this evening, but I believe that it is a serious challenge to the Government to appreciate that it is difficult for noble Lords to accept that the Gender Recognition Bill should come into force when the civil partnerships Bill is, to date, merely a wish and a hope. Can the Minister respond to that point?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-34_spnew13"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   We are obliged to give rights to transsexuals. We cannot deny all transsexuals recognition because of a possible delay in relation to civil partnerships. Is it not purely hypothetical that the civil partnerships Bill will not become an Act?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-34_spnew14"></A><B> Baroness Buscombe: </B>   Personally, I hope that it is hypothetical that the civil partnerships Bill will not be enacted, particularly in the light of the Gender Recognition Bill. However, I believe that I have put the Minister in a difficult position here because he obviously cannot guarantee that the civil partnerships Bill will be enacted. However, I hope that he accepts that, in some senses, we are jumping the gun here. I understand that the problem may be that the civil partnerships Bill is not ready, but I do not consider that to be a good reason for moving ahead with this Bill before that one. The hour is late. I know that we want to progress quickly and, for the time being, I shall not oppose the Question whether the clause stand part.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3></UL>
<a name="40114-35_para0"></a><P>

<a name="40114-35_para1"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 113, I shall speak also to Amendment No. 114 in the names of my noble friend and myself.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para2"></a>Clause 26 provides for fast-track applications to be made within six months of commencement of the Act. It can be relied on only by people who have already, prior to commencement, lived in their new gender for at least six years, as opposed to the two-year minimum for standard applications. However, in return, Clause 26 makes it easier to satisfy the evidential requirements. It is obviously intended to simplify the recognition procedure for those who underwent treatment in the more distant past&#151;although it is not exclusively for them&#151;and have lived in their acquired agenda for a long time.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para3"></a>The six-month time limit is very short. Transsexual people who could have applied may not become aware within that time that a fast-track procedure exists or that it is subject to a six-month time limit for making an application. Amendment No. 113 extends the basic time limit for fast-track applications from six months to 12. I accept that some time limit is necessary, but I can see no reason why it needs to be shorter than 12 months.
<P>


<a name="column_GC134"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column GC134</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para4"></a>Amendment No. 114 allows a panel to hear an application which has commenced after the basic period has elapsed if it is satisfied that the applicant has a reasonable excuse for not applying within that period. For example, the applicant may be someone who has lived in his acquired gender for many years but who is, at the time of commencement of the Bill, working abroad and does not return to the United Kingdom and become aware of the new rights until the end of the basic period.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para5"></a>Amendments Nos. 113 and 114 both leave necessary the fulfilment of the condition of a six-year life in the acquired gender prior to the commencement of the Bill. I believe that these amendments will make life easier only for people who are in fact entitled under Clause 26 to make the fast-track application. They prevent them losing that right because of extraneous circumstances outside their control. I cannot see that either amendment will do any harm to anyone. I therefore beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-35_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Evans of Temple Guiting: </B>   From speaking with various members of the transsexual community, I am aware that they wholly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, that the six-month cut-off point for applications under the fast-track scheme is viewed by some as a short period. I wish to give more consideration to this matter. I shall explore whether it is possible to ensure that the modified application process for those who have lived in the acquired gender for six years is available over a longer period. I am especially mindful of the position of transsexual people who are in existing marriages. They may need additional time to consider their situation in order to make arrangements for their spouse or any children of the family.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para6"></a>Between now and Report stage I shall explore this matter and, if possible, I shall table an amendment at that stage to enable, among other things, longstanding married transsexual people to take advantage of the fast-track process concurrently with securing the civil partnership. I shall consider whether the time limit should in fact be extended beyond the period suggested by the noble Lord.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-35_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Goodhart: </B>   I am most grateful for that undertaking. I assume from the responses that have been given that the Government do not look kindly on Amendment No. 114. However, obviously there has been a supportive reaction to Amendment No. 113. I look forward with interest to seeing the Government's amendments. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-35_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office  (Baroness Scotland of Asthal): </B>  My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department has today announced a change to the Home Detention Curfew Scheme (HDC).
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para12"></a>HDC has been in operation since 1999. It provides an effective and measured transition for offenders moving from custody into the community. Eligible prisoners are subject to a careful risk assessment before any decision is taken to grant them early release. Previous amendments to the scheme have balanced extensions to the period of early release with restrictions designed to maintain public confidence in the scheme as a whole. In April 2003 the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department announced an extension of HDC to a maximum of four and a half months. The extension was accompanied by the introduction of a presumption against release for prisoners convicted of certain serious offences&#151;those which the Government consider cause the public particular concern.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para13"></a>Prisoners released under the HDC scheme serve the remainder of their custody period at home under electronic curfew, usually from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. At present there are approximately 3,700 prisoners on electronic tag. The scheme is kept under constant review.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para14"></a>Public confidence in the scheme is essential. It is for this reason that the Home Secretary has already made it clear that offenders serving sentences for certain current offences and prisoners with any history of sexual offending must be considered unsuitable for release on HDC unless exceptional circumstances exist. This presumption against HDC will continue to apply.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para15"></a>A recent case has highlighted the fact that, in addition, there will be exceptional cases where an offender may be considered unsuitable for HDC even though he or she has not committed one of the offences which give rise to the presumption, if to grant HDC would undermine public confidence in the scheme. This will depend on the circumstances of the particular case.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para16"></a>The Home Secretary has decided that such exceptional cases should be referred to the chief executive of the National Offender Management Service who will take the decision whether or not to grant HDC.

<P>
<UL><P></UL>




<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114-35_spmin1"></A><B>The Minister of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister  (Lord Rooker): </B>  My right honourable friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.

<P>

<a name="40114-35_para17"></a>The Government have always been clear that county councils and other authorities with strategic planning expertise would play a key part in preparing draft revisions of regional spatial strategies and in their implementation. Draft Planning Policy Statement 11, which we published for consultation in October, sets out in some detail how the county councils and these other authorities can assist the regional planning body, including exercising functions on behalf of that body within a partnership arrangement.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para18"></a>The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill already encourages regional planning bodies to enter into arrangements with county councils and these other authorities but it does not require them to do so. The Local Government Association, the County Councils Network and others have expressed concern that, without a guarantee of involvement for county councils on the face of the Bill, their role could be marginalised under the new arrangements.

<P>

<a name="40114-35_para19"></a>I have discussed with the association and the County Councils Network how we might secure in legislation our policy intention for the future role of county councils without creating unnecessary bureaucracy or providing opportunities for unreasonable delay or obstruction. 1 am pleased to announce to the House that, as a result of these discussions, we will be tabling an amendment to the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill which is currently in the House of Lords. Whether or not the Bill is amended is ultimately a matter for that House to decide.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para20"></a>This amendment would require regional planning bodies to seek advice on the preparation, review and monitoring the implementation of regional spatial strategies from county councils and other authorities with strategic planning expertise. They would in turn be under an obligation to provide advice, providing that their delivery of services was affected in some way. 1 would also amend our draft Planning Policy Statement No 11 on Regional Planning to explain in more detail how this would work in practice.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para21"></a>The amendment would also allow regional planning bodies to enter into arrangements with counties, other authorities with strategic planning expertise and district councils to carry out functions on behalf of the regional planning body.
<P>

<a name="40114-35_para22"></a>I am delighted that, in the light of this proposal, the Local Government Association and the County Councils Network have agreed to give their full support to making the new regional planning arrangements a success. 1 look forward to our promoting together a system that I believe will deliver better strategic plans for our regions in the years ahead.

<A NAME="40114-36_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health  (Lord Warner): </B>  My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Health has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para15"></a>I am today publishing National Service Framework for Renal Services, Part One: Dialysis and Transplantation.
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para16"></a>The national service framework (NSF) programme is a major part of our agenda to tackle health inequalities and to drive up standards across the National Health Service. Part one of this NSF covers dialysis and transplantation. It sets standards and identifies markers of good practice that will help the NHS and its partners to manage the demand for renal services, increase fairness of access and improve choice and quality in dialysis and kidney transplantation.
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para17"></a>This is an important part of our modernisation programme to improve renal dialysis and transplantation services over the next 10 years. The framework sets out five quality standards to provide a flexible, responsive service that provides patients with better access and choice. It identifies 30 markers of good practice drawn from national and international evidence. This NSF builds on the programme of modernisation set out in the NHS Plan and the national service frameworks for diabetes, coronary heart disease, older people, and children. It reflects the principles of empowering patients and frontline staff contained in the NHS Plan and <i>Shifting the Balance of Power</i>, and of extending patient choice as set out in <i>Building on the Best: Choice, Responsiveness and Equity in the NHS</i> (Cm 6079).
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para18"></a>This NSF complements <i>Saving Lives, Valuing Donors&#151;A Transplant Framework for England</i> and supports our aim to increase the number of kidneys available for transplantation.
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para19"></a>The five NSF standards for renal services set out a vision of a service that is equitable and integrated and that provides people with the support they need to <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>make individual choices and to manage their own condition.
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para20"></a>The NSF for renal services sets out five steps for the NHS to take by 2006:
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para21"></a>Use national data to support planning and to identify local priorities, including the needs of black and minority ethnic groups;
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para22"></a>Continue to expand haemodialysis capacity;
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para23"></a>Join the UK renal registry and take part in national audit;
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para24"></a>Implement National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on home haemodialysis;
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para25"></a>Implement forthcoming NICE guidance on immunosuppressive therapy for transplantation.
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para26"></a>In addition we will establish five modernisation programmes to support the implementation and delivery of the NSF. These programmes are to:
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para27"></a>Redesign the renal dialysis and transplantation workforce;
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para28"></a>Re-engineer elective dialysis access surgery;
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para29"></a>Redesign access to hospital (patient transport);
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para30"></a>Redesign care plans to enable partnership and choice;
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para31"></a>Redesign the built environment.
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para32"></a>We will continue to work with doctors, nurses, allied healthcare professionals, NHS managers and people with renal failure to develop part two of the NSF concentrating on prevention of established renal failure, primary care and care towards the end of life.
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para33"></a>Copies of <i>National Service Framework for Renal Services, Part One: Dialysis and Transplantation</i> have been placed in the Library.

The arms embargo against Iraq remains in place under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003), with the exception of "arms and other related material required by the (Coalition Provisional) Authority to serve the purposes of this and other related resolutions". <P>


<a name="column_WS30"></a>

<a name="40114-36_para35"></a>(ii) small arms ammunition which is to be provided to the Coalition Provisional Authority for use by the Ministry of the Interior in Iraq.
<P>

<a name="40114-36_para36"></a>These exports are consistent with the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.

This equipment will be used by the Royal Nepalese Army, who are part of the Ituri Brigade of the UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC).

<P>
<UL>What progress has been made in Iraq to ensure that the recommendations of the Royal Society and the United Nations Environment Programme, with regard to post-conflict monitoring of depleted uranium contamination, are followed.[HL572]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114w02_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Bach: </B>   Substantial progress has been made on implementing the recommendations. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) expects to commence its full environment field survey in Iraq&#151;of which depleted uranium (DU) is a part&#151;in spring 2004. However, this will depend on the local security situation. The Department for International Development (DFID) has, in principle, agreed to part-fund this work.
<P>

<a name="40114w02_para0"></a>In support of the UNEP survey, the Ministry of Defence has provided UNEP with details of UK DU target locations and has offered to provide advice on carrying out risk assessments on DU within urban areas and on long-term monitoring of the DU in the environment, including water. In June 2003, MoD scientists completed a preliminary technical assessment of a number of Iraqi tanks thought to have been struck by DU rounds. These tanks have been clearly marked pending further detailed examination by an MoD scientific team when the security situation allows. Preliminary findings indicate very low levels of DU in the vicinity of the tanks. The MoD is sharing the information obtained on these tanks with UNEP as well as the Royal Society.

<a name="40114w02_para1"></a>All surface-lying DU fragments are being removed from the battlefield as they are discovered. Iraqi locals have been warned by signs and leaflets that they should not go near or touch any debris they find on the battlefield. All UK Armed Forces personnel are being offered a test for total uranium in their urine followed up by an isotope test if this gives anomalous results, to determine whether the uranium is depleted. Personnel who are identified as being most likely to have received high level exposure to DU are being offered both tests from the outset.

<FONT SIZE=3><A NAME="40114w02_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Lord Warner): </B>  Continence services play an important role in the health and education of children affected by problems of incontinence. Good Practice in Continence Services, issued by the Department of Health in April 2000, provides guidance to primary care trusts (PCTs) on continence services. This includes the advice that PCTs should have specialist continence services in place, which provide patients with an individual assessment of their needs.

<a name="40114w02_para2"></a>It is estimated that 10 per cent of five to 15 year-olds have a mental health disorder. Among children with a mental health disorder, an estimated 5 per cent suffer from enuresis as a physical complaint and 1 per cent from soiling.

<A NAME="40114w02_wqn4"></A><B> Lord Jopling </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>What are the symptoms, incubation period, methods of spread, diagnosis, treatment and prevention as well as the frequency of death from agents weaponised by the former Soviet Union such as marburg, tularemia and plague. [HL643]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114w02_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Warner: </B>   There has been no occurrence of marburg, tularemia or plague as biological weapons and therefore the characteristics of the agents as naturally occurring infections are given in the answer as follows.
Marburg
Marburg virus disease does not occur naturally in the United Kingdom. Symptoms include headaches, fever, muscle pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, haemorrhaging, conjunctivitis, sensitivity to light (photophobia), skin rash and jaundice. The incubation period is five to seven days and method of spread is via direct contact with infected bodily secretions, organs or blood of a person or animal. Samples from patients are submitted for laboratory testing (virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)). There is no specific treatment and prevention relies on the isolation of infected individuals and animals to prevent transmission. The fatality rate is about 25 per cent.
Tularemia
Tularemia does not occur in the UK. There are two groups of symptoms which depend upon the route of infection. If infection is by the inhalation route, the symptoms are characterised by sudden onset of chills, fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, loss of body fluids. If infection is via the skin, this is characterised by deep ulcers on the skin with swelling of regional lymph nodes. The incubation period is one to 21 days. Method of spread is via blood or tissue of infected animals or bites of infected deer flies, mosquitoes or ticks. Less commonly infection can result from inhalation of contaminated dust or ingestion of contaminated food or water. Samples from patients are submitted for laboratory testing (microbiology, serology and PCR). Antibiotics such as streptomycin or gentamicin are effective in treating tularemia. There is a vaccine for the disease (produced in the United <P>


<a name="column_WA90"></a>

<B>14 Jan 2004 : Column WA90</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>States and not licensed) but it does not appear to protect against the airborne form of the disease.
There are two forms of the organism&#151;type A which causes more serious disease in humans, and type B. If untreated, the mortality rate of type A infections ranges from 4 per cent for the skin form, to 30 to 60 per cent for the inhalation form of the disease.
Plague
Plague does not occur naturally in the UK. There are two forms of plague which depend upon the route of infection&#151;bubonic plague and pneumonic plague. Both types are associated with high fever, headache, general aches, extreme weakness, glandular swelling and pneumonia. The incubation period is two to six days for bubonic plague and one to six days for pneumonic plague. The bubonic form is spread from rodents to humans by the bite of an infected flea. The pneumonic form is spread by inhalation of the organism. Samples from patients are submitted for laboratory testing (microbiology and PCR).
Antibiotics such as streptomycin, doxycycline, gentamycin and ciprofloxacin are effective in treating disease. No vaccine is available and prevention is primarily via control of the rodent population. If untreated, both forms of plague are usually fatal.

Note:<P>

The financial model used assumes: (i) that the athletes' village is based at Mill Meads and (ii) a main stadium with a football legacy. The financial model includes all attributable costs and revenues covering: the bid, staging, construction and infrastructure, land assembly and elite sports funding. The figures in the table are forecast to outturn figures (assuming an inflation rate of 2.5 per cent pa) and are rounded to the nearest million pounds.<P>

Arup's work was used to inform the Government's own detailed analysis of the costs and risks associated with a London Olympic Games, which was based on a critical appraisal of risk and contingency, probability analysis and benchmarking past games. This work led to the development of a public sector funding package of &#163;2.375 billion, which bridges the &#163;1.1 billion gap between expenditure and income identified by Arup and provides further contingency to cater for foreseeable risks in staging the games.<P>

The Arup model includes total figures of &#163;399 million and &#163;491 million for land assembly and land disposal respectively. These activities account for much of the income and expenditure in 2004 and 2005. Under the memorandum of understanding between the Government and the Mayor governing Olympic funding, the London Development Agency (LDA) will meet the costs of the required land assembly during the bid period and beyond. Income from the sale of this land will be at the disposal of the LDA. During the bid period the LDA will only acquire land which could be used for regeneration purposes should the bid not be successful.<P>

<A NAME="40114w03_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs   (Lord Whitty): </B>  The current restrictions do not allow the sale of Type 3 rams in hill breeds of sheep after 2006, but allow their continued breeding on farm until the end of 2008.

<A NAME="40114w03_wqn2"></A><B> The Duke of Montrose </B> asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>Whether they are able to trace recent purchasers of plants susceptible to phytophthora ramorum from nurseries that have been found to be infected; and to what extent they undertake this.[HL675]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="40114w03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Emergency measures put in place in May 2002 required the notification of any movement of rhododendrons and viburnums, the two types of plant which in Europe have been most often found to be infected. These were superseded in November 2002 by EU-wide measures to ensure that consignments of these plants intended for trade are accompanied by a plant passport. This passport will identify the registered producer from whom any infected material originates. The registered producer is under an obligation to keep records of consignments despatched. Host material purchased by the premises where infection is found can therefore be traced back to the original supplier and an inspection of those premises takes place. Similarly, all commercial premises to whom infected material has been distributed will be inspected. This would include any material sold on for general landscape purposes where the buyer is known.
<P>

<a name="40114w03_para0"></a>Clearly tracing of plants sold on to the general public is more problematic. Buyers of host species have been advised to check plants before purchase for symptoms of the disease and to contact their garden centres if these subsequently develop. Any confirmed findings will then be subject to the tracing procedures outlined above. A number of initiatives have also been instigated to raise public awareness including a poster and information sheet which is available on Defra's website at www.defra.gov.uk/planth/graphics/sod.pdf. Copies have also been placed in the Library of the House.

<A NAME="40114w03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Whitty: </B>   Plant passports must be attached to all rhododendrons and viburnums going to retailers or landscapers. Authorisation to issue plant passports is given to nurseries which have been officially inspected and at which either no symptoms of P ramorum have been seen, or plants found to be infected, and those in a surrounding cordon sanitaire, have been immediately destroyed under official supervision. Nurseries are free to publicise their authorisation if they wish, to provide an assurance of their disease-free status. As indicated in my answer to Lord Greaves in the House on 6 January, action at sites where there is persistent infection will in future include notification of those responsible for adjoining land. Further consideration is being given to the appropriate balance between the need for transparency and the need to avoid a disproportionate reaction to isolated findings which have been swiftly eliminated. A map of outbreaks is already maintained on Defra's website and is available at www.defra.gov.uk/planth/graphics/sod.pdf. Copies have also been placed in the Library of the House.
