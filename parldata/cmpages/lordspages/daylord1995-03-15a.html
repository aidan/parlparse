<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spopq0"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many primary schools were inspected in 1994 and how many are expected to be inspected in 1995, 1996 and 1997.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, 777 primary and nursery schools were inspected by Ofsted in the calendar year 1994 under the new inspection arrangements which were introduced in the Autumn term. By the end of the academic year 1994-95 the total will have risen to at least 2,600. Over the next three academic years Ofsted aims to cover the remaining 17,000 primary schools, thus completing the four-year inspection cycle.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington: </B>   My Lords, while that Answer is extremely interesting, does it mean that the target of the four-year cycle to which the noble Lord referred, and about which this Government frequently boast, is unlikely to be achieved? Is that the case mainly because the registered inspectors are not tendering to undertake inspections? If so, is not the shortfall a direct consequence of the ludicrous decision to privatise school inspections?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, we are confident that we shall complete the four-year cycle. I answered a similar Question from the noble Baroness, Lady David, a month or two ago. Since then we have become gently more confident that we shall be able to meet the target of the four-year cycle. I believe I explained last time that one of the principal reasons for the shortfall is that local authority inspectors are being used to a greater extent by local authorities and have less time available for primary school inspections than we anticipated. In a way that is a good thing. In relation to privatisation, the new inspection system is an enormous success and an unimaginable improvement on what went on previously.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware of the tremendous strain being put on inspectors and the hours that they are working? Apparently, over a 10-week period, one inspector was working 70 hours a week. If that is the way that they are expected to get <P>


<a name="column_844"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 844</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>through the inspections, it does not seem to be a good idea. Is the Minister aware that one inspector fell asleep while giving his report to the school governors?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am sure that Ofsted will keep a careful eye on the quality of work being done by inspectors. As long as the quality is up to scratch, how it is achieved must be a matter for the inspectors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Gisborough: </B>   My Lords, can my noble friend say what percentage of schools, after inspection, transpired to be below the standard expected?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, around 2 per cent. of schools are judged to be failing or near failing. That percentage is the same in primary as in secondary schools.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Strabolgi: </B>   My Lords, is it proposed that preparatory schools in the private sector will be inspected? Many of them are not up to standard. They do not have boards of governors like the better private schools.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, the affairs of independent schools are, fortunately, outside my remit.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the AMA's most recent inspection survey showed that 88 per cent. of responding authorities were dissatisfied with the current inspection arrangements for primary schools? Inspections were viewed as not being cost effective. Various authorities already had their own efficient LEA inspection arrangements, which they greatly preferred, and Ofsted teams were criticised as being,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"demoralising, offering careless feedback, monopolising information, operating an inappropriate framework, and deferring inspections".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-01_para0"></a>Would the Minister care to comment on that verdict?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, the Association of Metropolitan Authorities clearly harbours the desire to bring all schools back under its wing and to end local management of schools as we know it. Its opposition to the inspection system&#151;which is working a great deal better than anything that went before and is showing up enormous weaknesses in what local authorities were doing previously&#151;is naturally part of the same package.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew11"></A><B> Lord Morris of Castle Morris: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Lord have any quotable written evidence that that is part of the AMA's intention, or is he merely repeating rumour?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am summarising AMA documents.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew13"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, are the hours of work described by the noble Baroness, Lady David, part of what the Government mean by "efficiency"?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, efficiency is not determined by the hours of work, not least in this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew15"></A><B> Lord Dormand of Easington: </B>   My Lords, in case there should be any misunderstanding, perhaps I can make it clear to the Minister that we on these Benches are as concerned about full and regular inspections as <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>are the Government. Can the Minister confirm whether the budget for the inspection service will be cut by 10 per cent. this year and 5 per cent. next year? If not, can the noble Lord give us the figures?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, there is no cut in the budget in terms of activity. Ofsted was over-optimistic as regards the number of primary schools that it would be able to inspect this year and next and that resulted in there being a lower financial requirement in those years. We are funding Ofsted to do the work that it is able to do and we are not cutting the money available to it.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew17"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister approve of heads and deputy heads of primary schools being advertised for at rates of &#163;49,000 a year when we understand that it is quite difficult now to fill the jobs of heads and deputy heads? Surely it is unwise to try to take them from the schools because of a shortage of inspectors.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure that I entirely understand what the noble Baroness is aiming at. Is she saying that heads of primary schools are paid too much or that the new&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew19"></A><B> Baroness David: </B>   My Lords, perhaps I may explain. Apparently, advertisements are being directed at heads and deputy heads of primary schools. Does the noble Lord think that it is a good idea to try to take these heads and deputy heads from primary schools where they are very much needed?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Lucas: </B>   Yes, my Lords, it is an extremely good idea. The posts that are being offered are for one year. They will offer the heads and deputy heads who are successful&#151;there have been 3,500 expressions of interest and more than 1,300 applications for these posts&#151;an enormous breadth of experience of what is going on in other primary schools, which they would have no other way of obtaining and from which they will benefit enormously.

<A NAME="50315-01_spopq1"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How many paid public appointments or reappointments of persons aged over 70, and of persons aged over 75, have been made since the publication of the Cadbury Report; and how many of those were women.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew21"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, the details requested by my noble friend are not held centrally. But, from the information available from individual departments, we know that at least 134 people aged over 70, and eight aged over 75, have been appointed or reappointed to paid positions on public bodies since January 1993. Of those, 21 were women, two aged over 75 and 19 aged between 70 and 75.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew22"></A><B> Baroness Gardner of Parkes: </B>   My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply. I am pleased to note that the <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>Government are not adopting an ageist policy. Is she aware of the British industry Third Age Initiative to improve re-employment opportunities for workers from the age of 50? Does she know that older people below pensionable age who are made redundant often find themselves rejected simply on the basis of the age shown on their application form? With the recent statement that more public appointments will be advertised, can my noble friend confirm that people made redundant will be considered with all others applying for such posts?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-01_spnew23"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I am aware of the initiative about which my noble friend asks. I believe, however, that her question is slightly wide of that on the Order Paper, as it deals with appointments in the commercial field rather than public appointments. However, I can tell my noble friend that the Department of Employment is in close contact with two related organisations&#151;the Re-Action Trust and Third Age Challenge. With regard to the last part of her question, I think it is true to say that people are free to nominate themselves, or others can nominate them. The individuals are carefully appraised against key criteria. There is no reason why someone who has been made redundant at the age she mentioned could not be considered for a public appointment.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Gainford: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend have any information as to whether there is any possibility of Britain following the example of Canada and the United States of America where it is illegal for an employer to ask the age of any applicant for a job?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, there are no such plans. In fact, research has shown that in countries which have introduced such legislation it has been ineffective. We shall carry on encouraging employers to take advantage of the business benefits from employing everyone with the appropriate skills, whatever their age.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew2"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   My Lords, does the Minister accept that while there has been some welcome improvement in the number of women of all ages on public bodies, overall that improvement is not reflected in the number of chairs? For instance, in the Department of Employment there are no women chairs&#151;and those are the paid posts. Is she aware that the six male chairs in the Department of Employment&#151;

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew3"></A><B> Noble Lords: </B>   Oh!

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew4"></A><B> Baroness Gould of Potternewton: </B>   &#151;received a total of &#163;184,000? Can the Minister indicate whether the Government have any proposals or have set any targets to rectify that position by using the nominating process?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I must say to the noble Baroness that I have no knowledge of male chairs at all. However, I share her concern about appointments for women and I think I have a very good story to tell. On a purely personal basis, in 1987, when I was chairman of The 300 Group, the group, together with the Fawcett Society, launched the Women into Public Life Campaign in order to try to make sure that more women were appointed to public bodies. At that <P>


<a name="column_847"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 847</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>time only 17 per cent. of all public appointments were held by women. There were various other initiatives&#151;from the EOC and the Hansard Commission&#151;on women getting to the top. As a result, by 1990 23 per cent. of all public appointments were held by women. That percentage stayed the same through 1991 when my right honourable friend the Prime Minister launched Opportunity 2000, urging departments to look at women with the necessary skills and to make the appropriate appointments. I am delighted to tell the House that by 1992 26 per cent. of all public appointments were held by women. By 1993 the figure was 28 per cent.; by 1994, it was 30 per cent. Perhaps even more encouraging is that today nearly half of all the new appointments are women. As regards the specific question about male chairs, I shall look into that.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hailsham of Saint Marylebone: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend confirm that a chair is an article of furniture?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I can confirm that. As far as I am concerned, I have never been unhappy to be called "Chairman".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, the Minister is correct to inform your Lordships' House that there is no reason why people who have been made redundant should not serve on quangos. I have in mind, of course, that almost all the Conservative Members of Parliament who were made redundant at the last general election have been placed on quangos.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Miller of Hendon: </B>   My Lords, I am not sure whether that was a question or a statement from the noble Lord. I have no comment to make.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew10"></A><B> Baroness Platt of Writtle: </B>   My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend on the picture she has given of the number of women who have been appointed. Does she agree that some people switch off at 50 years of age but that others, well over 70, are lively and bright?

<P>

<A NAME="50315-02_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Department of the Environment   (Viscount Ullswater): </B>  My Lords, there is no reason why mortgage lenders should treat residents <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>of high-rise ex-council dwellings differently from any other applicant for a mortgage. However, it is true that some prospective purchasers of ex-council flats are having difficulty obtaining a mortgage where lenders are reluctant to advance loans on such properties until a resale market has become fully established. My right honourable friend hopes shortly to approve a more flexible form of mortgage indemnity agreement which local authorities will be able to use to encourage mortgage lending in such areas and help speed up the development of a healthy resale market.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew14"></A><B> Lord Blyth: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Viscount for that helpful reply, but does he realise that it is a little difficult at the lower end of the market? Is he aware that it is not just the obtaining of mortgages which is difficult but also estate agents are reluctant to take this type of property on their books? Will his right honourable friend continue to work on the problem and, we hope, improve the position, as he said?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew15"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   Yes, my Lords, I understand the problem identified by the noble Lord. The purpose of the mortgage indemnity agreement is to act as a comfort to the lender to secure a mortgage for the prospective purchaser.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew16"></A><B> Lord Molloy: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that there are millions of ordinary British families who live in rented property but who have the laudable desire to own a home of their own? Following the encouraging reply which the Minister has given, would it not now be possible for the Government, the noble Viscount's department, the bankers and all the other folk involved to take note of this laudable desire of very many ordinary people and do their best to assist them to achieve that end?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew17"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, I welcome the noble Lord's question and I shall put the problem in context. Local authorities have sold over 169,000 flats since 1979. A recent survey of leaseholders by Bristol University found that the vast majority were pleased with their flats.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew18"></A><B> Lord Dean of Beswick: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the slowness in disposing of council-owned property not only concerns flats? Is he also aware that anyone who has bought a council house and places it on the market has an almost nil chance of selling it? Is he aware too that there have been demonstrations in London by people living in flats which they are unable to sell under any conditions, as nobody wants former council flats?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew19"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, it is an indictment of the construction of the flats in the first place and we have to be worried about that. As the noble Lord identified, currently a great many people are living in those flats, whether they own them or are tenants. As the noble Lord, Lord Molloy, indicated, the option of purchasing a home is something which a great many people have in mind.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew20"></A><B> Lord Stoddart of Swindon: </B>   My Lords, the Minister takes great pride in local authorities having sold so <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>many houses. Will he now allow local authorities to use all the proceeds of the sales to relieve the housing shortages in their areas?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew21"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, that is a completely different question to the one on the Order Paper.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew22"></A><B> Lord Williams of Elvel: </B>   My Lords, does the noble Viscount recall that in the leasehold reform Act, which I know the Chief Whip will recall, the Government introduced a scheme called Rent to Mortgages? Is the noble Viscount aware that the Government have spent approximately &#163;400,000 advertising the scheme and that the take-up so far is five? Given the failure of the scheme, does the Minister agree that it is now right that the Government should go into reverse and help people out by going back to a Mortgages to Rent scheme?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-02_spnew23"></A><B> Viscount Ullswater: </B>   My Lords, that is a consideration which is presently being thought about. The difficulty is that a great many people living in these flats want to sell them because they want to move. They then do not want to become tenants of the local authority.

<a name="50315-03_para0"></a>As the noble Lord said, the precise circumstances to which it will apply and its validity are important. It must be plain that the intention of the person making the directive was incorporated in the instrument.

<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Allen of Abbeydale: </B>   My Lords, as one who introduced the Bill on advance directives perhaps I may say how much I welcome the statement which the noble and learned Lord has just made. In the meantime may I put in a plea for avoiding use of the extraordinary phrase "living wills"? An ordinary will is made when one is still living. The advance directives we are talking about are concerned with how one dies.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spmin1"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I would be the last to criticise the noble Lord. I imagine that the phrase "living wills" is designed to point to the fact that a living will is supposed to take effect during life whereas ordinary wills take effect on death.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Jenkins of Putney: </B>   My Lords, is one to assume from what the noble and learned Lord says that an advance directive and a living will are virtually the same thing?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spmin2"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I shall limit my answer to my understanding of this, which is that they are two names for the same thing.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Stallard: </B>   My Lords, would the noble and learned Lord care to comment on the recommendation set out in Clause 9 of the Law Commission's draft Bill that doctors can withhold treatment, which ends a patient's life, if that patient has specifically stated in a living will that he or she wants to die? Surely that can be interpreted as amounting to an encouragement to patients to express suicidal wishes.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spmin3"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, one has to read the Law Commission's report as a whole. It would not be wise to take a small passage out of context. So far as I am concerned&#151;and so far as the Government are concerned&#151;we are entirely in line with the views on euthanasia expressed by a Select Committee of this House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew4"></A><B> The Countess of Mar: </B>   My Lords, will the noble and learned Lord confirm that all general practitioners are being circulated with leaflets which advise patients how to make a living will?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spmin4"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, I believe that there are such initiatives. The Law Commission considers that some clarification of the precise circumstances and effects of such documents is required.

Regardless of what the Law Commission says, I believe that where people specifically state that they do not want to be kept alive by such means they have the right to refuse medical treatment even if that would lead to death, provided that they specify that clearly. It is wrong for doctors to insist on going ahead with medical <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>treatment when it is clearly against the specific wishes of the person concerned. That is the key element in the whole equation.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spmin5"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, the noble Lord advises me to keep the whole of the Law Commission's report in mind. I shall certainly seek to do that&#151;and I do so gladly. However, with the greatest respect to the noble Lord, I do not accept his view that the Law Commission's report is self-contradictory. As I said, if one reads the report as a whole one realises that it has the cohesion and effectiveness that we have come to associate with reports from the Law Commission.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Mishcon: </B>   My Lords, will the noble and learned Lord bear in mind the substantial opinion that whereas such documents can be recognised and doctors may pay attention to them they should not be mandatory upon doctors because circumstances may well change?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spmin6"></A><B>The Lord Chancellor:</B>  My Lords, that is certainly true. The noble Lord's question gives me an opportunity to emphasise the fact that for an advance directive to be relevant it must be applicable in the particular circumstances in which the patient and the doctor are placed at the time. It is therefore important that it should be sufficiently specific for that properly to be judged.

<A NAME="50315-03_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Callaghan of Cardiff: </B>   My Lords, I beg leave to ask a Question of which I have given Her Majesty's Government private notice, namely: whether Her Majesty's Government will make immediate representations to the Nigerian Government for the release of General Obasanjo, former Head of the Nigerian Government, who was arrested on 13th March.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spmin7"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  My Lords, we have already made it clear to the Nigerian authorities that Her Majesty's Government are gravely concerned at the arrest of former President Obasanjo. He is one of a number of distinguished political figures who have been detained recently by the military regime. Others include Yar'Adua, a leading member of the Constitutional Conference.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew8"></A><B> Lord Callaghan of Cardiff: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for that Answer. Is it not ironic that the Nigerian Government should arrest the head of the Constitutional Conference (whom they themselves appointed) because he has had the temerity to recommend a return to civilian government? Is it true that General Obasanjo has been detained but not arrested so far and that no charges have been made against him? Finally, in view of the fact that the Minister's concern is shared by other governments, will she consider using the machinery of the European Union to co-ordinate representation, which would then have much more effect in securing the early release of those who have been detained?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew9"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord is correct that that is ironic. President Obasanjo <P>


<a name="column_852"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 852</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>is a distinguished Nigerian who has expressed strong commitment to an early return to democratic civilian rule. As the noble Lord will remember, President Obasanjo is the one former military president who returned his country to civilian democratic rule after three years. He has been arrested and is being detained, but he has neither been charged nor, as far as we know, has any evidence been laid against him. Therefore, it is essential that the Nigerian legal process is allowed to take place and that he is either charged or promptly released. The proper processes of the law must be followed.
<P>

<a name="50315-03_para1"></a>We are already in touch with other governments who have made their own direct representations. We shall co-ordinate our representations not only with our European Union partners but with our Commonwealth partners. We shall do all in our power to ensure that this is brought to a successful conclusion. We still hope to see President Obasanjo here in the United Kingdom for the "Britain in the World" Conference on 29th March. If he is not here, the whole world will be united in his defence.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Wright of Richmond: </B>   My Lords, is the Minister aware that the concern expressed by both the noble Lord, Lord Callaghan, and herself must be shared by all of us in this House who have the well-being of Nigeria and its future democracy at heart? I welcome the representations which the Minister has told us have already been made. I welcome particularly the Minister's remarks about co-ordination and co-operation with the Commonwealth Secretary-General.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew11"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Lord for his comments. Although the resolution that was tabled by the European Union at the UN Commission on Human Rights last week was narrowly outvoted by manoeuvring, that has not altered the position of the members of the European Union, and the military regime under General Abacha in Nigeria can take no comfort from it. The latest events underline the deteriorating human rights situation in Nigeria. Given that volatile situation, I shall say little more except that we shall be doing everything in our power to ensure that people who are detained without trial are either charged or released.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew12"></A><B> Viscount Waverley: </B>   My Lords, will the Minister confirm that a "military disturbances board" was established yesterday in Abuja; and is she concerned that the Attorney-General has no authority in the matter?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-03_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, there is no confirmation of what the noble Viscount has just said. A tribunal may have been set up, but it is not clear what is happening in Abuja. Certainly, if the Attorney-General's authority over the due processes of the law has been removed, that is further cause for grave concern.

<FONT SIZE=3>there? Will they see this in the wider context and recognise that, with the restoration of democracy in South Africa, the restoration of democracy in Nigeria (which is perhaps the richest and strongest African state south of the Sahara) would be a tremendous event for the continent as a whole? Therefore, will the Government do everything that they possibly can to encourage positive action towards a return to democracy in Nigeria?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-04_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, yes, I agree with the noble Lord. We have a historic relationship and we try to have a special influence, but it is extremely difficult at the moment to know to what influence General Abacha and his small military regime clique will respond. We have made many attempts to talk to leading Nigerians&#151;not the military&#151;to exert a greater influence and obtain a greater understanding of what is going on in Abuja. At the moment we must just work away to get released all the people who have been detained.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-04_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Milverton: </B>   My Lords, does my noble friend realise that there are many in this country who served in Nigeria in the past? I am thinking of my father, who finished his career in the Colonial Service with his last governorship in Nigeria. Such a person would be most disturbed by what is happening in Nigeria now. Therefore it is good that this matter is being brought out into the open. I give my noble friend all my support in the hope that her efforts will bear fruit in achieving a happy solution in that country.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-04_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend for what he has just said. Our debate on 7th March illustrated your Lordships' deep concern over what is going on in Nigeria and the absolute determination of all parties united in the House, and, indeed, in the country, to see an end to the regime which is so unacceptable and a return to democratic civilian rule.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-04_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Richard: </B>   My Lords, we are grateful to the Minister for what she has said. We support the efforts that the Government are making in this present situation. Perhaps I may ask her just one factual question. Presumably when we make representations to the Nigerian Government they answer. What is their excuse? Is there one, or are they just playing for time at the moment?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-04_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, the noble Lord may be aware that there were press reports here and in Nigeria about the arrest of a large number of serving and retired military officers who were said to have been involved in a coup. When we question, we are told that people have been taken for questioning in connection with that apparently abortive coup. The essence of what is going on is that the National Consultative Council, having been adjourned during <P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-04_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Archer of Weston-Super-Mare: </B>   My Lords, will my noble friend confirm that the trade unions have gone on strike to make absolutely clear where they stand on the arrests? Secondly, has not the time come for the Foreign Office not just to issue statements but to consider our aid to Nigeria, because time and time again, year in and year out, we are told that the people of Nigeria want to return to a democracy?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-04_spnew7"></A><B> Baroness Chalker of Wallasey: </B>   My Lords, first, there have been many strikes against the military regime in Nigeria. I am not in a position to tell my noble friend whether another has started today. We have made it clear that we shall not give aid to the military government or their institutions. The only assistance going to Nigeria is assistance which brings direct benefits to poor Nigerians. We use non-military channels such as NGOs. Aid from the European Commission and other European member states follows those guidelines which we set down two years ago.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-04_spnew8"></A><B> Earl Russell: </B>   My Lords, I thank the Minister for what she has already said.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-04_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke </B>   rose to call attention to the case for expanding the role and funding of the McFarlane Trust, whose original purpose was to make payments to haemophiliacs infected with the HIV virus from contaminated blood transfusions; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para0"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we are having the debate for two reasons. The first relates to the principle that the Government should give special protection to people who are especially vulnerable to damage from NHS treatment, particularly if they have very little choice whether to accept that treatment. That applies to haemophiliacs.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para1"></a>The second reason is the Minister's failure to respond reasonably to Questions in the House and her apparent inability to see the justice of people's claims. I am very sorry to have had those responses from the Minister for whom I have great respect and a warm regard. The House should not be fobbed off with unsatisfactory Answers at Question Time on issues of this kind.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para2"></a>Some 90 per cent. to 95 per cent. of haemophiliacs who received blood products before 1985 were infected with the Hepatitis C virus; 3,000 men and boys were given that particularly virulent virus which can lead to serious illness and death. Medical opinion is that up to 80 per cent. of those infected will develop chronic liver <P>


<a name="column_855"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 855</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>disease; between 10 per cent. and 20 per cent. will develop cirrhosis of the liver; and a number of those will develop liver cancer.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para3"></a>The progression to severe liver cancer can take between 20 and 40 years. Many haemophiliacs have already been infected for up to 20 years; and 41 people have died. Deaths now occur regularly at a rate of approximately one per month. As yet, only a small minority is seriously ill or dead. Even if we allow for those who will become infected, that will probably be a minority of haemophiliacs. I willingly and readily accept that fact. Nevertheless, it is an important minority and it is those people, and those people alone, whom we are discussing.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para4"></a>It was wrong for the Minister in her responses to Questions in the House to refer to the mass of other people, because my noble friend Lady Jay and myself have referred continuously, and emphasised continuously, that we are concerned only with the small minority who have become seriously ill and the families of those who have died. I want to re-emphasise that we are discussing those people, and those people alone.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para5"></a>There is little doubt that the likelihood of early death from HIV is greater than it is from Hepatitis C. But, whereas 1,237 men were given HIV, 3,000 were infected with the Hepatitis C virus. Regardless of numbers, the case of the people with Hepatitis C is that there is no basic difference between haemophiliacs who are critically ill and who have died from HIV and those who are critically ill and have died from Hepatitis C. The source was exactly the same; the outcome was exactly the same; the principle is exactly the same; and so the payment should be exactly the same.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para6"></a>There is no justification for making a payment to a haemophiliac who is dying as a result of an HIV infection and for refusing it to someone dying from Hepatitis C. Both should receive it. I believe that the case is unanswerable and that the Minister has been wrong. For that reason, and with all good will and friendliness, I am trying to bring her to account today. I hope to secure a change of mind and to receive proper answers to the questions that we have posed at Question Time. My noble friend Lady Jay and I feel most deeply about the matter and we do not wish to be fobbed off with unsatisfactory answers.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para7"></a>For those reasons my noble colleagues and I have put forward proposals that, having contracted Hepatitis C, haemophiliacs should be paid in a way similar to those with HIV. Your Lordships will recall that the 1,237 haemophiliacs were given &#163;42 million by the Government after sustained pressure from Parliament and the public. That was not&#151;and I repeat the word "not"&#151;compensation in the legal sense. There was no question of negligence; negligence did not arise. It was an ex gratia payment.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para8"></a>I raised the issue at Question Time on 30th January and 21st February. On 21st February I specifically asked whether the Government would expand the role and the funding of the McFarlane Trust to cover those with Hepatitis C. Noble Lords who were then present will remember that in the exchanges I emphasised the fact that I was referring solely to the haemophiliacs who were critically ill or who had died from Hepatitis C. My <P>


<a name="column_856"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 856</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble friend Lady Jay specifically told the Minister that we were not asking for compensation. She repeated that fact most clearly and said that we were asking for an ex gratia payment. Nothing could be clearer.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para9"></a>My noble friend asked for an ex gratia payment because the basis of the McFarlane Trust is an ex gratia payment. It is not compensation. That is why my noble friend Lady Jay and I have emphasised, emphasised and emphasised again the fact that we are concerned with a small minority and are not asking for compensation. But the Minister continues to refer to compensation. She continues to refer to those haemophiliacs who are not seriously ill and who have not died. We are not prepared to accept those answers and I repeat that our points are put forward with all the good will in the world because we have a high regard for the Minister.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para10"></a>However, the Minister's response to the questions asked by my noble friend Lady Jay and myself was a reiteration of the fact that there is no question of the Government giving compensation. As I have repeated today, we were not asking for compensation. There was a non sequitur dialogue between the three of us. It was as though my noble friend Lady Jay and I had never spoken. I found that most difficult and that is another reason for detaining the House and putting forward the case in this debate. The Minister was knocking down an Aunt Sally that she had raised herself which, in terms of the McFarlane Trust, was not even considered, let alone pressed.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para11"></a>It was remarkable that when my noble friend Lady Jay repeated the fact that we were not seeking compensation the Minister, incredibly, spoke of litigation and compensation becoming a national sport portending the end of the National Health Service. She spoke of a national sport and the end of the NHS because my noble friend Lady Jay and I were asking for an ex gratia payment. That does not add up or make sense. That is why we are asking for reconsideration.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para12"></a>That floodgate type of argument is a favourite defence of beleaguered Ministers. What are the facts? We wish to discuss only the facts today. When the payments were made for HIV infection there was no flood of claims from non-haemophiliacs infected with HIV from blood transfusions. The floodgates were not opened and no new pressure for payment for medical accidents was provoked. If the Minister can prove me wrong I shall be delighted but my information is that the floodgates were not opened and there was no great pressure. I believe that people acknowledge and respect the special problems of haemophiliacs. The floodgate argument has no foundation.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para13"></a>I wish to repeat, and I hope that the point will be taken, that we are not seeking compensation and litigation but an ex gratia payment through the McFarlane Trust&#151;just the same as the payment to haemophiliacs with HIV. However, I suggest that there is one important difference; that in this case the payment should be activated not by infection from the virus, as is the case with HIV, but by the onset of the disease. That is when people really begin to suffer because they can have the virus without suffering. That is what in earlier debates I called the "trigger mechanism". The proposal pays due regard to the differences between <P>


<a name="column_857"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 857</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>HIV and Hepatitis C. There are differences but there is also much in common and it recognises the justice of both cases where severe illness and death are concerned.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para14"></a>The Minister raised yet another bogey to justify the Government's refusal to make the payments. She said that the treatment was given in good faith and without it the haemophiliacs would have died. That is right; it is undeniable. But exactly the same applied to the haemophiliacs with HIV. They too were given treatment in good faith and without it they would have died&#151;but they were paid. Therefore, how can the Minister argue the case for the treatment being given in good faith but of the patients dying if they were not given it? Where is the logic in that argument? Perhaps today she will explain it to the House because I am a little bewildered. The haemophiliacs acted in good faith believing that the treatment would help and not damage them.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para15"></a>Haemophiliacs are a special group of people because their lives depend upon blood products. For them, blood transfusion is not rare but a life-saving, regular occurrence. They are excessively vulnerable to impurities in the blood. Other people may be able to decide whether or not to accept the risks involved in accepting the blood of others. Haemophiliacs cannot do so because their lives depend on it.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para16"></a>I suggest that this is a moral not a legal issue. These people are exceptional in their dilemma, the risks involved and the consequences. The fact that they are a small minority is a factor in their favour rather than against them. Assuming that the Minister is correct in saying that only a few will be affected, that the majority will not suffer and that drugs can help all those who do&#151;and I accept that&#151;the cost to the Government will be small. However, I must add that the low cost is no consolation to those who suffer or die as a direct result of Hepatitis C infection. I repeat again that we are concerned only with those people.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para17"></a>I conclude by saying that the Government now have an ideal opportunity to meet their moral obligations at minor cost with maximum benefit. Never has it been so easy for a government to achieve moral justice. The McFarlane Trust exists and the administrative structure is there, running very smoothly. All that is required is a little more money, a widening of the criteria and the agreement of the Government.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para18"></a>I repeat that I have an extremely high regard for the Minister, although I have been critical of her answers to Questions. But I hope that the Minister and her colleagues in the Government will reconsider their attitude in the light of today's debate and that they will do justice to that beleaguered minority.

This is a time at which we can go into the matter in more depth.
<P>


<a name="column_858"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 858</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para20"></a>The noble Lord admirably outlined the problems, and in particular the plight of those haemophiliacs who were infected with the Hepatitis C virus. The reason that I contribute to the debate today is that I was very concerned eight year ago with the problems of the haemophiliacs who were injected with the HIV virus. Noble Lords who were in the House at that time will remember that I was, I think, the first to raise the matter in this House in 1987.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para21"></a>About eight years ago it became apparent that some haemophiliacs in this country had been inadvertently infected with the HIV virus through their necessary medical treatment. The infection came through blood products which they received through the National Health Service. The HIV virus and AIDS were new phenomena at that time. No one knew about them or how to cure them and at that time it was realised that the injections had caused the virus in the haemophiliacs.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para22"></a>There was no question of negligence. I remind your Lordships that in 1987 and 1988 when we discussed the matter in this House everyone accepted that there was no question of negligence by anyone in the NHS because it was something completely new and unexpected.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para23"></a>I raised the subject in this House for the first time in November 1987. At that time the Government were clearly impressed by the case which was subsequently made inside and outside Parliament. Nearly a year later, in October 1988, in reply to another Question of mine the Government made a very welcome statement which included the formation of the McFarlane Trust. That trust was authorised to decide upon and to make ex gratia payments&#151;not compensation&#151;in particular cases. The money was provided by the Government for that purpose.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para24"></a>I recognise that most of those who are taking part in today's debate were not in your Lordships' House in 1987-88, including the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, but he and I have worked together for many years, especially when we were both together in another place. However, he may not be familiar with what was taking place in this House seven or eight years ago.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para25"></a>It was clear in 1988 that the trust was appointed to deal with very special circumstances; namely, those in which the infection would probably lead to death. The infection involved a little known illness, AIDS, for which no cure was known. It was also an illness that had a disreputable aura because it was usually caught through sexual promiscuity or drug abuse.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para26"></a>The number of haemophiliacs infected&#151;all males, of course &#151;was known. Known also was the number who had already died of AIDS by 1988. The total number who were injected with the HIV virus is 1,237 and the most recent figure for deaths is 596, which is nearly half of them. I presume that a very large majority of those deaths were caused by AIDS.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para27"></a>Incidentally, haemophilia afflicts men and not women. Perhaps the Minister will confirm to me that no women have been diagnosed as haemophiliacs or, if so, very rarely. Now that changes of sex are possible, statistics may be affected.
<P>


<a name="column_859"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 859</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para28"></a>In 1986, the NHS, having discovered what was happening, introduced the necessary treatment of the blood products, which ended the possibility of infection. No NHS transfusion since 1986 will have infected haemophiliacs with the HIV virus.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para29"></a>In the past six years since it has been operating, the McFarlane Trust appears to have carried out extremely well the task assigned to it. I remember that when the Government announced its establishment there was some doubt as to whether it would work well and whether that was the right way of dealing with the matter. But I have heard no serious criticism of the way in which the trust has carried out its duties. I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that when she replies to the debate.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para30"></a>That is no doubt why the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, proposed that it should have tasks added to the functions which it was allotted in the first place. It is a compliment to the trust and the way in which it has operated. When the noble Lord asked a Question on 21st February, he referred&#151;although the Question did not&#151;to the Hepatitis C virus, and it is about that in particular that he has spoken today.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para31"></a>I have every sympathy as regards the Hepatitis C virus but it is very different from AIDS. I recognise that both illnesses are to be avoided, but the noble Lord seemed to paint the picture that they are similar. Although Hepatitis C is a very nasty illness, it is in quite a different category to AIDS. Hepatitis C can be virtually invisible for years because few, if any, noticeable symptoms may appear. However, it damages the liver and is a cause of death in some cases, but it is not almost always a cause of death, as is the case with AIDS.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para32"></a>I understand that about 3,100 haemophiliacs were infected with the Hepatitis C virus before that key date in 1986, because the Hepatitis C virus was neutralised at the same time as the HIV virus. But that figure is more than twice the number of those infected with HIV, and only about 640 of those infected with HIV are still alive because of deaths from AIDS. That high rate of mortality is one of the special features of the HIV infection which led to the establishment of the McFarlane Trust.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para33"></a>When the trust was established it was made clear that its one purpose&#151;indeed, its only purpose and its single mandate&#151;was the HIV virus and the havoc that it was causing among people with haemophilia. To use a current expression, it was a one-off job. I do not know what the Government's response is likely to be today. They were not very forthcoming during Question Time a few days ago. I shall understand if the Government are not prepared to expand the functions of the trust. I shall not be surprised if they consider that it still has a great deal to do with the surviving people for whose welfare the trust is responsible.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para34"></a>I believe that the difference of opinion that has arisen between the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, from his speech, and myself is whether the McFarlane Trust is the appropriate and suitable body to take on that extra work. If, as I surmise, the Government consider that the McFarlane Trust is inappropriate and has enough to do without extending its activities to the Hepatitis C virus, <P>


<a name="column_860"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 860</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>I would ask them whether they can arrange for more to be done to help haemophiliacs with the Hepatitis C virus. By help I mean finance and resources&#151;for example, help to provide the best possible treatment, especially with tests and medicine: in particular, Interferon, which is the medication most used for damage to the liver. I also have in mind assistance for all the associated problems arising from hepatitis and liver damage.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para35"></a>Whatever the Government's attitude may be to the proposal put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, will they undertake to examine sympathetically, and afresh, every way in which the lives of haemophiliacs who have been infected with the Hepatitis C virus, or any other serious disease or illness, inadvertently through NHS transfusions all those years ago can be made easier?

<A NAME="50315-04_spnew12"></A><B> Lord Addington: </B>   My Lords, I should like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, for raising the subject and also the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, for his speech. After those two speeches, I feel rather like the American senator who once said: "Everything that can be said on this subject has been said, but not everybody is yet saying it".
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para36"></a>We are dealing with an infection that was caused by patients receiving vital medical assistance which was induced into their bodies in order to keep them alive. Unbeknown to the people who gave them that very necessary treatment, those patients acquired an infection which can lead to death. We already have the McFarlane Trust, which was set up to deal with exactly the same situation but involving a somewhat more virulent virus which will almost certainly lead to death; namely, the HIV virus as opposed to Hepatitis C.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para37"></a>Here is the dichotomy between the two cases: one will almost certainly kill you, while the other one, which may not kill you, will certainly do you some damage and may well lead to you actually needing support at a later stage. The Minister shakes her head. However, I am informed that it will do damage but that such damage becomes noticeable only later on. However, the noble Baroness probably has at her disposal more technical detail on the matter.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para38"></a>If we deny the fact that people who have been infected with Hepatitis C do need assistance, we are effectively denying what we have already agreed to as regards the HIV virus. If it is a matter of a very much smaller number of people, why cannot we give them such assistance? If the illnesses that they are acquiring do not guarantee their death, why can we not give them the assistance that they require? It is very simple. We are dealing with a much smaller problem than that which has been incurred, in exactly the same manner, as regards a much bigger problem. There is very little else to say about the matter.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para39"></a>I have been provided with an example of the absurdity of the situation. It is a case where three haemophiliac brothers all received treatment. Unfortunately, two of them were infected by the HIV virus because the blood products that they used had not <P>


<a name="column_861"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 861</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>been treated as is currently the case. Those two brothers died, but the third brother was infected with the Hepatitis C virus. He, also, subsequently died. The first two brothers received compensation for their loved ones and their family and assistance when they were actually ill. However, the third brother did not. What is the ultimate difference to the individual? They are dead because of an infection that they acquired through medical treatment.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para40"></a>As has already been said, we are not talking about compensation; we are talking about an ex gratia payment for something that was done accidentally while someone was trying to give another person medical assistance. That has been agreed today by both previous speakers. I shall be very much surprised if the noble Baroness contradicts that fact. If we cannot give that kind of assistance to such people, we must think very hard about why we are continually giving assistance to people who simply caught another virus through exactly the same means.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para41"></a>It is a question of logic which points the way towards setting up some body or providing some form of support&#151;and here I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy &#151;indeed, it may well be necessary to establish a new body, if, for some reason, the McFarlane Trust cannot take on the extra work. It is important that such assistance should be given. As we have already accepted that anyone who has acquired the one virus needs assistance, surely those who acquire the second, and who may not require as much assistance, should also receive it.

<P>
<A NAME="50315-04_spnew13"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am most grateful to my noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke for reintroducing the subject about which I know both he and I share a joint concern. Indeed, it is the latest in his courageous and tenacious attempts to speak for the disadvantaged and those who have suffered an injustice. Perhaps my only regret this afternoon is the fact that more noble Lords have not put down their names to speak.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para42"></a>However, from those who have spoken thus far, I believe that we have heard a very clear exposition of what is, as the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, said, an issue which is too complicated to deal with during Question Time but which, on the other hand, I suggest is a relatively simple one. I believe that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, illustrated that most clearly in the example that he gave the House of the three brothers, one of whom had been infected with the Hepatitis C virus and did not receive any recompense, while the other two brothers who were infected by the HIV virus did.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para43"></a>At the risk of irritating the Minister, I should like, once again, to emphasise&#151;and, indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Addington, is right, I do not take a different position either from him or from my noble friend on the matter&#151;that we are talking about ex gratia payments and not about compensation. Like my noble friend, I too remember the Minister's replies to the Questions which <P>


<a name="column_862"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 862</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>my noble friend Lord Ashley tabled earlier this year. She said that she suspected the floodgates would be opened if that ex gratia payment was extended to those haemophiliacs who had Hepatitis C and that she also saw such operations as opening floodgates not simply on this issue but also, potentially, leading to the destruction of the NHS.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para44"></a>History does not relate any such floodgates being opened when the McFarlane Trust was established. It is not a question of inviting the sort of legal extravagances to which the Minister referred when she talked about the possibility of an American determination to achieve compensation for medical malpractice coming to this country. We are discussing a simple request for an ex gratia payment to a limited number of people who received an infection which was acquired as a result of medical treatment under the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para45"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, said&#151;and I suspect that the Minister may repeat it&#151;that Hepatitis C is not nearly as bad a condition as HIV and AIDS. Of course, we all accept that what one might, I suppose, call the "risk assessment" of dying from Hepatitis C, is less than that of dying from HIV infection. But I think we should not underestimate the chronic liver problems which are already being suffered by several people in this category and the potential for cirrhosis and liver cancer which has already been graphically described. I also think that if we are considering those people who already have haemophilia we should not underestimate the difficulties and unpleasant nature of that condition, which in itself may well reduce life expectancy.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para46"></a>But I do not think that this afternoon we are really arguing about the relative seriousness of symptoms caused by blood products which have been infected and are caused by infections contracted through NHS treatment. What we are talking about is why these people are infected. Whether or not they are ill, very ill, or dying is, in a sense, irrelevant. The point is that all of them received these contaminated blood products through NHS treatment. Some of them have been recompensed but some of them have not.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para47"></a>The Minister also said previously in answer to my noble friend that although there were obviously medical differences between the two groups of people who were suffering from these infections there were also social differences, and that the previous agreement to fund the McFarlane Trust had been partly based on consideration of the particular social problems which people with HIV confront. However, I have been told by the Haemophilia Society that those with the kind of infection which we are discussing this afternoon may also have to cope with uncertainty and anxiety in not knowing precisely what their condition may lead to. All of them face the worry of possible transmission to their sexual partners or transmission to an unborn child, and all will face the same kind of difficulties with life insurance and employment with which we are familiar in regard to those with HIV and AIDS.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para48"></a>As I have said before, this is a simple case of relative injustice in applying one standard to one group of people who have had their infection caused by one result and not to another who have contracted a different infection but through precisely the same cause. As my <P>


<a name="column_863"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 863</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke said, there really is a moral case here. I think the moral case is made completely and clearly for immediate hardship payments to those who are already ill and to those who are the dependants of those who have already died. I would then like to see an extension of the McFarlane Trust to provide some kind of financial adjustment and financial reward&#151;I apologise as "reward" is an inappropriate word to use&#151;or rather financial funding for those who have the Hepatitis C virus.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para49"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, said that he felt this might not be the way to do it. But it seems to me that, as my noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke explained, the mechanisms of the McFarlane Trust are in place. It is clearly a well run and well organised fund. It would simply be a matter of an extension of an organisation, which has already justified and proved its worth, to try to act in the way that my noble friend suggests.
<P>

<a name="50315-04_para50"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, rightly pointed out that when he was raising these issues about HIV and AIDS at an earlier stage, neither my noble friend, nor I&#151;nor, I suspect, the noble Lord, Lord Addington, the other speaker in the debate&#151;were Members of your Lordships' House. But I was peripherally involved in this issue when I was director of the National AIDS Trust in the late 1980s and early 1990s. I recall that the struggle to get the McFarlane Trust established, and the concerns which were expressed by many people at that time, were unpleasant and, in a sense, reflected what seemed to be almost a decision on principle by the Government that they were not prepared to act in this field. Some cynics suggested that it was only the run-up to the general election in 1992 and the enormous public outcry which by that time had surrounded the question of compensation for haemophiliacs with HIV that caused the Government finally to concede. I very much hope that we will not be faced with&#151;

<A NAME="50315-05_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Campbell of Croy: </B>   My Lords, I hope I may intervene but we do have plenty of time in this timed debate. The announcement, in answer to a Question of mine, was in October 1988. It stated that the McFarlane Trust was going to be set up. Therefore, that was rather earlier than the time of the 1992 election.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-05_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Jay of Paddington: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. I suspect he will recall that although there was a decision to set up that trust it was not funded, and payments were not made until very much later. I suspect he will find that that occurred nearly four years later. I would in any case suggest that the general point I was making&#151;I think I am right about the timing of the funding and the payments under the trust&#151;was as I have described and that there was a somewhat unpleasant discussion between the many people who were concerned about this issue.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para0"></a>I echo the admiration of my noble friend Lord Ashley of Stoke for the Minister and for the stand that she takes on many of these issues.

<P>
<A NAME="50315-05_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health   (Baroness Cumberlege): </B>  My Lords, I very much welcome the opportunity to discuss the role of the McFarlane Trust but I have to say I am disappointed that the noble Lord, Lord Ashley of Stoke, should feel that I try to fob off your Lordships' House. That is never my intention&#151;in this debate or any other. I respect your Lordships' House and I try to be fair, honest and direct. But the noble Lord, as an experienced parliamentarian, will recognise there are occasions when a Minister gives answers which are not those sought by noble Lords opposite and which prove disappointing to them.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para1"></a>I agree with my noble friend, Lord Campbell of Croy, that this is a difficult and complicated question which requires more time than has been available through Starred Questions. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to him for his foresight in raising the subject as early as 1987. Perhaps I can put the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, right. The McFarlane Trust was set up in November 1987 with government funding of &#163;10 million and the purpose of making grants and weekly payments to HIV infected haemophilia patients and their families. The work of the fund is regularly reviewed. Its income was increased by a further &#163;5 million in March 1993.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para2"></a>The running costs of the trust are met by a Section 64 grant so that the whole of the capital sum is available for the beneficiaries of the trust. Since its inception the trust has given out &#163;14 million. That is in addition to &#163;66 million in special payments. The trust carries out its work both caringly and conscientiously and I know that both patients and the Government appreciate the way in which the trustees have approached and indeed carried out their task. My noble friend can rest assured on that.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para3"></a>As your Lordships will know, the trust was established to deal specifically with those haemophilia patients who were infected with HIV as a result of receiving blood products.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para4"></a>Your Lordships will be aware that there are many instances where people have reacted adversely to drug therapy or medical treatment given in good faith where non-negligent harm has occurred. Although those suffering as a result have pressed for government compensation, the Government have not accepted liability. In these incidents haemophilia patients received the best treatment available in the light of the medical knowledge at the time.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para5"></a>Contrary to the views expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, the Government have accepted that the patients who, tragically, contracted HIV through NHS treatment were in a different position from others and we have made provision for them because of their special circumstances. As my noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy stated, those affected were all expected to die very shortly. In addition they were <P>


<a name="column_865"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 865</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>subjected to significant social problems, including ostracism. For instance, people were treated as lepers. They had their doors daubed with graffiti; they lost their jobs; and their children were not allowed to mix with other children at school. They were denied a normal married life.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para6"></a>In the case of the infected haemophilia patients, the problems of HIV were superimposed on the health, social and financial disadvantages they already suffered as the result of their hereditary haemophilia. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Ashley, is anxious that those patients with haemophilia who may have been infected with Hepatitis C should receive similar consideration to the HIV victims. But if an exception were to be made there would be others who would argue that they too were deserving. The noble Lord, Lord Ashley, and the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, may have forgotten that when payments were agreed for haemophilia patients with HIV, representations were subsequently made on behalf of blood transfusion recipients infected with HIV. After the settlement the campaign was intensified and payments were made to that group too.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para7"></a>Although patients receive the best treatment available, based on existing knowledge, it has to be recognised that not all medical interventions are risk free. Risks may be evident at the time of treatment or may be discovered later. If we were to offer payments for each such incident we would soon slip into a general no fault compensation scheme.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para8"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, and the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, made a point of drawing a distinction between compensation and ex gratia payments. It does not really matter whether we call it compensation or ex gratia payments. The arguments against both are the same. Additionally, I stress that the majority of the payments made were not ex gratia since an undertaking had to be made not to take the matter to the courts.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para9"></a>Your Lordships will be aware that the Government are opposed to a no fault scheme. There are sound reasons for this. First, proof of causation is still need. It may be just as difficult to establish that the medical treatment has caused injury as it is to prove that someone has been negligent. It also has to be demonstrated that it was not a foreseeable and reasonable result of treatment. It would be unfair to others in that those whose plight was the result of a medical accident could be compensated whereas those whose condition stemmed, for instance, from disease or birth would not. The costs of any such scheme would be substantial and would inevitably impact on the amounts available for patient care. Health care negligence is not considered to be fundamentally different from negligence in other walks of life where claims for compensation are resolved through the courts. In addition, the present system arguably has a deterrent effect on malpractice. No fault compensation might conceivably encourage doctors to be less cautious.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para10"></a>The experience of other countries which have tried to follow the no fault path has strengthened the Government's views. In New Zealand, whose system is most often quoted, several major problems have become <P>


<a name="column_866"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 866</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>apparent. The costs of the scheme have proved to be extremely high. Estimates of more than 1 per cent. of GDP have been made. In addition to a number of other practical difficulties, the scheme also effectively denies people access to the courts.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para11"></a>In Sweden a different scheme operates. The payments made are relatively small. Indeed, it was necessary for the authorities to make additional payments to those infected with HIV because of the inadequacy of the sums available through the no fault scheme.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para12"></a>I do not wish to minimise the impact of Hepatitis C on those who have been infected. For some it is a real tragedy, not only for themselves but for their families and friends. The Government have every sympathy for them. However, it has to be acknowledged that Hepatitis C is different from HIV. Many people infected with Hepatitis C may enjoy a long period without any symptoms appearing.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para13"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Ashley, presented figures on the natural history of Hepatitis C which were similar to those available to my department. However, I would put the figure for chronic hepatitis at 50 per cent., and 80 per cent. for those who do not recover fully after infection. Noble Lords will forgive me for repeating some of the estimates.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para14"></a>Fifty per cent. of sufferers may progress to chronic Hepatitis C with varying degrees of good and ill heath. Perhaps 20 per cent. of patients will develop cirrhosis, a progressive destruction of the liver that may take 20 to 30 years. The majority of those years will be trouble-free in terms of ill health and only a very small percentage will actually die of liver disease.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para15"></a>We readily acknowledge that each death is an individual tragedy for the family concerned. If we look specifically at haemophilia patients, the Haemophilia Society has stated in a press release launching its current campaign that over 40 people with haemophilia have died as a result of infection with Hepatitis C virus. It is important that we retain a clear sense of proportion and timescale. The figures quoted by the society relate to the five years between 1988 and 1993. I understand that, for example, in 1993 12 haemophilia patients died with the cause of death shown as liver disease. That was out of 126 haemophilia patients known to have died in that year. Of those 12, eight were also HIV positive. I seek in no way to minimise the tragedy but these are small numbers when weighed in the balance of the good that treatment has brought to many of these and countless other haemophilia patients.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para16"></a>My noble friend Lord Campbell of Croy asked about women haemophiliacs. I understand that virtually no women are haemophiliacs. There is a similar disease called von Willebrand's disease which affects both men and women, and some patients have contracted HIV and/or Hepatitis C.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para17"></a>I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that the Government remain very concerned about the position of people who have been infected with Hepatitis C. Discussions are taking place between the department and the directors of the haemophilia centres about what needs to be done. We need to develop further good practice for the treatment of people with haemophilia who are also Hepatitis C positive and to ensure that they <P>


<a name="column_867"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 867</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>have ready access to treatment centres. The department is supporting an initiative by the Haemophilia Society to undertake a study into the best way to support its members who are infected with the virus.
<P>

<a name="50315-05_para18"></a>It is the Government's view that the most effective use of finite resources is to seek to improve the understanding, management and treatment of the condition. I know that that view is shared by the majority of clinicians in the field. Only in this way can the impact of the disease on individual patients and their families be effectively minimised.

<a name="50315-05_para19"></a>I am afraid that I must put the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Croy, right. He said that I may not have known about what happened here seven years ago.

I am more than happy to give way to the noble Lord.

<a name="50315-06_para0"></a>The noble Lord is under a misapprehension. I certainly knew of his activities at that time. I reminded your Lordships' House about what happened when I originally raised these matters because I realised that some noble Lords taking part in the debate were not here then. Of course the noble Lord and I spent many years in another place dealing with a number of subjects which arose in the disabled field. I knew that he was active in the other place at that time on this subject, but in the same way I did not know what exchanges took place and exactly how the subject was raised. The noble Lord can be at rest. I certainly knew that he was active at that time. I merely reminded your Lordships of what happened in this Chamber.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-06_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ashley of Stoke: </B>   My Lords, I am glad that we have clarified the issue. I not only knew but admired what was being done here because it was very helpful indeed. However, it is as well to set the record straight.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para1"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Addington, said that it may be necessary to set up another organisation. I would go along with that. If when the Minister changes her mind, as I am sure she will shortly, she does not want the McFarlane Trust to do the work but would prefer another organisation to undertake it, she has my agreement in advance. I hope that she will take note of that.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para2"></a>I agree with every word that my noble friend Lady Jay said, except that I believe that she should have used the word "shall" instead of "should". Apart from that one detail I agree with her 100 per cent.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para3"></a>I am afraid that it is not a great day for the Minister. I suspect that her brief was written before the debate and before people knew the essence of the debate. The <P>


<a name="column_868"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 868</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>essence was that we were not dealing with compensation, but much of the opening part of her speech dealt with the compensation issue, which is totally irrelevant. I am becoming boring on the subject, but we are not asking for compensation. We are asking for an extension of the ex gratia payment only for those people who are ill and for the relatives of those who have died. There is no question of asking for compensation in the established and accepted sense. I am sorry that the Minister spent so much time on that issue.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para4"></a>The Minister said that Hepatitis C is different from HIV. I explained in my speech how different it was. However, I also sought to emphasise the similarities. If a man is seriously ill from Hepatitis C, he is in the same position as someone seriously ill from HIV. (I am prepared to accept an intervention.) If a man dies from Hepatitis C, he is just as dead as someone who dies from HIV caused by contaminated blood. Admittedly, the social points about ostracism and so on are different. But the essence is illness and death. We are talking about the small minority who are ill and those who have died. I stated that five or six times in my speech. I admire the Minister very much; I am fond of her. But we must try to attain some understanding on the issue. We are talking about that small minority.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para5"></a>I must not continue. Other matters are to be debated. It has been a depressingly short debate. However, I promise the Minister this: I shall not let her down. I shall come back to the subject for further discussion in this House. Nevertheless, I thank her for her contribution. I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.

<A NAME="50315-06_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior </B>   rose to call attention to the possible relaxation of quarantine controls relating to animals, with particular respect to rabies; and to move for Papers.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para7"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, we are justly proud of the high health status of animals in the United Kingdom. That has been achieved by the help of our island situation and by the rigorous application of import controls and the application of equally rigorous measures should exotic animal disease enter.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para8"></a>The country has experienced devastating episodes of animal disease in the past, some being of such national concern that in 1865 the then Archbishop of Canterbury sought the ear of the Lord in a prayer saying:

<a name="50315-06_para10"></a>Though this and other diseases are things of the past, the price of such freedom is eternal vigilance&#151;a task devolving on our highly competent and world respected animal health service. I am sure that no one would wish to weaken this fortunate health status achieved by rigorous application of controls, but this should not mean a rigid attitude to change which could achieve as much, if not more, control than hitherto and at the same <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>time allow greater freedom of movement both of animals and people for agriculture, sport, commerce and companionship purposes.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para11"></a>We are all aware of the particular importance of animals in our society in this country. In this House periodically there are debates concerned with animals. It would be foolhardy&#151;especially for me, a veterinarian&#151;to argue for changes which would not guarantee the continued high health status of animals in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para12"></a>The report of the Agriculture Committee of another place on Health Controls on the Importation of Live Animals has met with a positive response from Her Majesty's Government, with the exception of the proposals for the changes to prevent the importation of rabies and the removal of quarantine requirements for dogs and cats from the European Union and certain other countries elsewhere in the world.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para13"></a>As I believe all noble Lords will admit, rabies, with its distressing course and invariably fatal outcome, is one of the most dreaded diseases of man and animals. The first allusion to it in the British Isles was in 1026 in the laws of Howell the Good of Wales, and periodic outbreaks occurred until 1922, after which the country has remained free, with the exception of rabies in two dogs, one of which (in 1969) was probably infected in quarantine and the other (in 1970) probably had an abnormally long incubation period, being infected before going into quarantine. As a result of those two cases, the Waterhouse Committee recommended that all dogs and cats entering quarantine should be vaccinated to prevent the intra-quarantine transmission of the disease.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para14"></a>Since 1971 nearly 200,000 dogs and cats have been through quarantine, having been vaccinated when they entered quarantine, and two cases of rabies have occurred within quarantine, both in animals whose origins were from outside the now European Union. No cases of rabies have occurred after release from quarantine&#151;which tells us two things: the effectiveness of quarantine but also that no dogs entered quarantine incubating rabies, since the vaccine does not prevent the development of rabies once a dog or a cat has been infected.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para15"></a>What is the validity of the claim that a system of vaccination can replace quarantine? I shall attempt to parade the evidence that has been given to the Agriculture Committee and elsewhere in a large amount of documentation. First, the countries to which this would apply are either free of rabies&#151;Australia, New Zealand and a number of other countries, the majority of which are islands&#151;or countries of the European Union, some of which also are already free of the disease, or those with an extremely low prevalence of dog or cat rabies and which have not experienced any human rabies for several years&#151;20 years or more. Some of these countries have extensive wildlife (fox) rabies, but this is a different situation with respect to human and dog health, as I shall explain later.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para16"></a>Secondly, the vaccine now used&#151;dead vaccine&#151;has proved completely effective in both man and dogs. In man it has been effective not only when given prior to <P>


<a name="column_870"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 870</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exposure but even immediately following exposure. Unfortunately, that is not the case with dogs, since if they are exposed to rabies prior to vaccination they may well then go on to suffer rabies.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para17"></a>There is a possibility that cats with immuno-deficient virus infection will not respond well, but it is now believed that this is only the case when cats have developed an extensive form of the immuno-deficient disease and they would be unlikely to be candidates for exportation. When they are incubating the immuno-deficient disease, the evidence seems to be that they would respond effectively to the rabies vaccine.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para18"></a>Thirdly, it is now agreed that the vaccine may be safer than quarantine on two points: first, it would prevent rabies well beyond the six-month period covered by quarantine and thus avoid the cases of prolonged incubation to which I referred a short while ago; secondly, because it is much cheaper than quarantine, it will reduce the temptation to avoid quarantine&#151;the smuggling of dogs and cats into the country&#151;which occurs. The amount of smuggling is unknown, but we know that between the years 1985 and 1993 some 800 dogs and cats entered the country illegally. Probably more did so but we have no real idea of the iceberg beyond the 800. The important point is that none of those has introduced rabies into the country.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para19"></a>The fourth point is that the system of proposed controls similar to the Swedish model would entail strict requirements. They are: identification, via a microchip; six months' residence in an approved country; vaccination and proof that the vaccine has worked by evidence of good response; and possession of a passport showing vaccination and other health requirements. Quarantine for dogs and cats would still remain for all other countries.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para20"></a>What would be the benefits of a system based on vaccination? It would allow greater ability to travel with one's pets. It would allow people with pets both to travel into this country and to leave the country with their pets, so that it would increase tourism greatly. It would increase the mobility of people wishing to work in other countries, and there is good evidence that people may not move to another country because of the present restrictions. Indeed, there has already been a change in quarantine requirements through the Balai directive, under which commercial dogs and cats can be imported. The provisions of the directive are strict, though not too dissimilar from those proposed by the Agriculture Committee.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para21"></a>What then are the concerns? To dog, cat and human health the risks are infinitesimal. There has been no case of human rabies in the European Union for the past 20 years; and it is estimated that if free movement of dogs from, say, a country such as Germany, with no mandatory vaccination, were allowed at the level of 5,000 dogs per year imported into this country, it would be 30 years before a rabid dog entered the country. From those countries that have mandatory vaccination, on the same scale the period would be 1,000 years.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para22"></a>Wildlife rabies is of particular concern. The fox population in this country is greater than in other European countries, and it is quite different, with the urban fox population. It has often been said that, were <P>


<a name="column_871"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 871</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>rabies to be introduced into the fox population, the effect would be devastating. That is quite correct. But Professor Harris of Bristol University, who has studied the subject extensively, maintains that the chances of fox rabies entering this country are infinitesimal. The rabies virus has the characteristic known as compartmentation, whereby fox rabies is restricted to foxes and dog rabies is restricted to dogs and humans and the two never meet. In other words, to get fox rabies introduced into this country one has to introduce a rabid fox. The chances of that occurring must be very low indeed since no one other than an arsonist would wish to import a rabid fox into this country. The chances of it coming through the Channel Tunnel are, as we now know, very remote indeed. Fox rabies does not spill over into the human population, as witness the absence of human rabies in a sea of fox rabies in Germany. The only source of fox rabies would be the importation of a rabid fox.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para23"></a>What then are the problems in adopting the vaccination instead of quarantine? It is fair to say that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the British Veterinary Association and other bodies accept, with the exception of a few points, the scientific evidence that quarantine is no longer scientifically tenable. The problems lie with compliance: to ensure compliance at the point of origin, to undertake regular inspection and to ensure the reliability of micro-chipping. In this country some 150,000 dogs have been micro-chipped and two famous dogs have recently had it done to them. The cost to the taxpayer is also a concern.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para24"></a>Relaxation of quarantine has already taken place through the Balai directive. Stringent control has nevertheless permitted more freedom of movement for commercial animals. Modifications of the Balai directive must, I submit, be possible. The present quarantine regulations are a major restriction on the freedom of movement of animals and people within the European Union. I submit that one of the ways ahead is that we should move fairly quickly, possibly to a two-part arrangement using the Balai directive as a model: first, to arrange that certain countries outside the European Union&#151;such as Australia, New Zealand and others &#151;should be included in the vaccination proposals. That would require some lead time during which we would have the experience of what is happening in Norway and Sweden. We would then be able to judge whether total allowance of animals coming in under the vaccination proposals would be possible. Should that Swedish experience be disastrous, we would need to stop any further progress.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para25"></a>I believe that the time is now ripe for the process to begin. I trust that the Minister will shed some positive light on doing so. I beg to move for Papers.

<A NAME="50315-06_spnew3"></A><B> Lord Houghton of Sowerby: </B>   My Lords, this is one of those occasions when the atmosphere of your Lordships' House is conducive to restrained discretion and reasonable argument on a controversial subject. That suits the style of the noble Lord who introduced the Motion. I am proud to follow him. We always listen <P>


<a name="column_872"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 872</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to the only veterinary surgeon in your Lordships' House and pay the highest tribute to his experience and wisdom in these matters. I wish we had more such people.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para26"></a>The veterinary side of life is increasing in importance and value all the time. I need not enlarge on that. It is not merely a matter of pets; dogs and cats. We are becoming concerned a great deal more with the animals we exploit&#151;those we eat and all the other things that man requires of the animal kingdom. When one listens to the noble Lord, one finds him persuasive, full of facts and arguments. One is apt to say, "Well, then, what about it? Why can't we begin?" Noble Lords know as well as I do that you cannot begin to change something that is so deeply rooted in the English tradition as rabies control without taking account of public opinion.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para27"></a>In my lifetime, many people in this country have become obsessed with the word "rabies". They are scared of rabies; they are anxious to maintain anything that protects them from this unknown horror. It is a subject upon which a combination of prejudice and exaggeration can wreak havoc with any political consideration of the matter. As Rab Butler so wisely said years ago, the art of politics is the art of the possible. It is public opinion that we have to deal with here.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para28"></a>I was delighted that the Select Committee on Agriculture in another place decided to give attention to the matter. I was more surprised still when the committee produced a report which was so reasonable and rational, and so favourable to a different approach. However, before the debate had been under way for many days, the Government decided: "We're having none of this. We're going to nip this one in the bud before the tabloids get at us". So they decided that it was not going to happen. Since then the debate has petered out and, save for a modest amount of attention, it has not occupied the more reasonable and rational press.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para29"></a>There is a serious problem in relation to getting these things done. Let us be honest. We have a government who would rather do nothing than do something which may land them in more trouble. I am afraid that the report received all too scant and abrupt a reception from the Government. They could have put it forward as a matter that the public should earnestly consider. It has to come. We cannot be an island on our own for ever. We have become so used to our island status, and to doing things our own way, that we find it very difficult to arrive at a point of view in order to accommodate our interests with those of others. Nevertheless, we have to learn.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para30"></a>I do not take a dogmatic approach this afternoon. There are some aspects of the single market and some points about the free transportation of agricultural merchandise and animals that must lead us to pause before we concede to full freedom of movement in the European Union. I need not mention the genuine concern throughout the country, as never before in my experience, over the transportation of young farm animals to Europe for slaughter. We see the difficulties of remedying the position. We have to wait for standards to improve before we can be content. We have no control over our animals when we send them across the <P>


<a name="column_873"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 873</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Channel. It is not our business to do more than ask for confirmation and observance of mutually agreed conditions in the European Union. Other countries are slow to come to the kind of standards we now require.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para31"></a>A debate must be initiated. We must get people used to the idea and get them to understand the lack of risk in this matter. The British seem completely to misunderstand the risk attached to things in life. I remember one of the first Dimbleby Lectures by the late Lord Rothschild on the risks of life. It was surprising how small the risks were in many of the cases that most excite public anxiety. We cannot live with our risks. We have to consider whether we can reasonably reduce them further without consequences that make the cure worse than the disease. I hope that we shall encourage the debate and ask for more facts and contributions in respect of the matter that is under consideration.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para32"></a>There is an additional prejudice in relation to rabies. It is usually associated with dogs. There is a dog phobia in Britain today. We have to elevate the animal that is supposed to be man's best friend to the level of estimation that we expect from that status. Do not let us dismiss this matter and feel that it can wait for other people to take it up later. That is all I have to say.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para33"></a>Good will and understanding are now wanted. Most of us should endeavour to bring about the atmosphere in which change may be made. Quarantine is a distressing experience, both for the animals and for their owners. It is unjustifiable to impose it for any longer than is necessary as a guard against a contingency which&#151;grievous as it would be if it arose&#151;is becoming less and less likely. I am very grateful to the noble Lord who has introduced this subject. I hope that we shall all give him and those who think like him a good deal of support in the debate to come.

<A NAME="50315-06_spnew4"></A><B> Viscount Allenby of Megiddo: </B>   My Lords, it is always a very humbling experience to follow the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, and to listen to all the wisdom and knowledge that he brings. I welcome this short debate, initiated by the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior. It gives us the opportunity yet again to debate animal welfare, a subject which is so dear to our hearts, and in particular the subject of rabies.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para34"></a>Dogs in this country&#151;I want to concentrate my comments mostly on dogs and cats&#151;are used by many different individuals. Blind people in particular, of course, but others use dogs as part of their everyday life. One has only to look round the Houses of Parliament to see the police sniffer dogs being used. They play an important part in our everyday life. Dogs are also used to sniff out smuggled drugs and illegal arms traders. So we are more and more dependent on the use of dogs.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para35"></a>All such dogs&#151;except, for some unknown reason, military dogs&#151;are subject to quarantine restrictions which the Government are set, as we see it at the moment, to continue into the future. It has been estimated that 150,000 dogs and cats have been taken into quarantine between 1972 and 1993. The noble Lord, Lord Houghton, mentioned a figure of 200,000; the <P>


<a name="column_874"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 874</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>exact figure is unquantifiable, but it is very large. That number of dogs has been taken into quarantine over a period of 20 years. As the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, also said, only two cases of rabies were detected. Both were caused by the very dangerous live vaccine, as opposed to the dead vaccine. Those cases would never have occurred under a passport system, as we have already heard.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para36"></a>Around 150,000 dogs and cats suffered in quarantine for no purpose at all, including 2,000 which died. They were examined for rabies subsequent to their death and tested negative.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para37"></a>The Agricultural Select Committee in another place heard evidence&#151;I shall not rehearse the comments already made by the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby&#151;from all quarters. It carried out research and unanimously called for change. Here I refer to dogs and cats from European countries. The agricultural committee categorically identified that an animal passport supported by an updated vaccination certificate, a blood test and a microchip offered a much improved method of keeping the country free of rabies.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para38"></a>If the need for quarantine were to be removed, it would in turn remove the need to smuggle animals into this country. The numbers are high and obviously not reported&#151;smugglers do not put up their hands and say, "I smuggled an animal into this country". However, Mr. John Simmonds, head of Kent's trading standards department which handles the prosecution of smugglers, warned,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"When the Channel Tunnel really gets going people will hide animals and get them through&#151;it is inevitable".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para39"></a>Quarantine is inefficient and ineffective and gives inducement to smuggle. Quarantine is expensive and distressing to the animals involved. In that regard I speak as a serviceman who has brought animals back into this country and twice had to put a dog into kennels. To see those dogs in quarantine, although one visited them, was extremely distressing. The blind and the deaf still cannot travel, yet the Government admit that any dog in the UK, properly vaccinated and tested, can go abroad and return in complete safety.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para40"></a>We should remind ourselves that the meaning of the word "pet" is that it is a domestic animal kept for pleasure or companionship. While I have nothing against quarantine establishments, it is traumatic for family pets, used to good homes and healthy exercise, to be kept in cages in quarantine. Kennels are small because they have to be and the runs are often not as clean as they should be. As a result, the health of animals undoubtedly suffers. For some unknown reason, on which possibly other noble Lords or the Minister can enlighten me, RSPCA inspectors are not admitted into quarantine quarters to carry out inspections.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para41"></a>Can the Minister say whether there is any evidence from the veterinary department to show that the removal of quarantine regulations for dogs and cats belonging to pet owners would allow the spread of rabies into this country? Further, can he say why the Government continue to reject the findings of the Agricultural Select <P>


<a name="column_875"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>Committee in another place? Quarantine does not keep out rabies. Quarantine causes distress; costs a lot of money and locks up healthy animals.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-06_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Kimball: </B>   My Lords, in this debate today we are being asked to consider the possibility of some relaxation in the quarantine controls in this country. The problem that this House must face is to decide whether or not a case has been made for scrapping the firm recommendations made by the Waterhouse Committee in 1970. The committee said categorically that it was unwise to rely on vaccination as a substitute for quarantine. In 1970, when the committee was looking at the problem&#151;both an interim and a final report were produced&#151;it looked at the whole spread of rabies across Europe.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para42"></a>In 1970 rabies was advancing towards the Channel at 25 miles a year, mostly through the Ardennes in Belgium. The Waterhouse Committee was looking at a European Community which at that stage was made up of only Germany, France, Holland, Belgium and Denmark. Since that time there has been a successful programme of inoculation, particularly of foxes in the wild, throughout Europe. But we are looking at a period of only 10 years during which that success has been achieved and I should like to see an extended period before one is satisfied that the spread of rabies within those five European countries has been contained.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para43"></a>Another problem pointed out by my noble friend is that all the veterinary evidence shows that there is a greater success rate with the vaccination of dogs than of cats. The fact that the vaccination of cats is not totally successful was recognised by the new Swedish and Norwegian regulations. The Select Committee in another place said that it wished to see the immediate scrapping of quarantine and a change to vaccination built up with microchip identification and animal passports.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para44"></a>Microchip technology is in its infancy. There are five companies each vying with the others to obtain approval for its specific microchip. At this stage of our considerations it would help if there were an early decision on which chip is to be approved. Which chip will be accepted for the Balai Convention? The Balai Convention lays down clearly that we must have an approved system of identification.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para45"></a>The problem lies not only in deciding which one of the five chips is considered to be the best, but also in appreciating that a chip is no good without an electronic reader. We must face the fact that large expenditure will be involved in supplying every port in this country where animals can be imported. The passport and the chip must be checked. That is a far greater problem than the select committee in another place realised. We shall be faced with equipping every little fishing port and landing place with an electronic reader so that when somebody arrives in his yacht with his pet and its passport checks can be made. That will be a major development.
<P>


<a name="column_876"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 876</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para46"></a>We must realise also that we are likely to be looking at a much wider Europe than the Europe at which Waterhouse was looking. It may be difficult for my noble friend, when he comes to reply to the debate, to comment on the veterinary standards of Greece, Italy and Spain. But, even if it is not very tactful, it must be said that veterinary education in those countries falls a long way short of what we expect in this country. The standard of inspection of the veterinary schools in those countries is far short of that in our schools here. As part of the possible relaxation, we must make it clear that the standard of veterinary education and veterinary inspection of schools in all those countries must be raised before we can consider this problem.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para47"></a>It is not only a question of the southern edge of Europe&#151;Italy, Greece and Spain. Poland, Czechoslovakia and Romania are about to join the EC. We have already experienced one disastrous horse disease&#151;EVA&#151;which came into this country entirely due to the failure of the Polish veterinary service. Another problem is the danger of importation into this country of animals, particularly dogs, that were taken into those countries as the first stage. There is a danger of those countries being used as a staging post for importation into this country. We must be certain that there is no relaxation in that area.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para48"></a>As my noble friend said, two outbreaks of rabies have occurred in this country. The worst one was in 1919 to 1922. It was caused by the pets of returning ex-servicemen. Luckily, it was not fuelled in any way by cross-infection in this country, and died out. Veterinary science has given us a goal to work towards but many safeguards have to be built into any new system. The chipping procedures must be standard and must prove to be tamper-proof. The experiment being conducted by the Kennel Club and the Battersea Dogs' Home gives one great hope that one of the chipping systems is tamper-proof. We want to be assured that the cat vaccine is effective. It must be proved and then developed. We need to know the cost of a national chip reader programme, because without that the system will be ineffective. All this needs to be be proved and costed and worked to a truly European standard&#151;a standard for the whole of the extended EU. These conditions are the minimum before we can think of changing our safeguards.

<A NAME="50315-06_spnew6"></A><B> Baroness Wharton: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, for introducing this debate on rabies. Even though rabies had been present in Britain for most of recorded history, very few cases were recorded in wild animals. However, rabies among the stray dog population was an enormous problem. So, in 1901, Walter Long MP, the then President of the Board of Agriculture, brought in quarantine laws. By 1902, the disease had been eliminated with the control of stray dogs. As we know, the next outbreak occurred after the First World War, with servicemen smuggling dogs into this country. However, the disease was speedily dealt with by the destruction of stray dogs and muzzle and leash <P>


<a name="column_877"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 877</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>restrictions. Apart from two other incidents, well documented and not imported from Europe, we have continued to be rabies free.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para49"></a>I have to say that prior to listening to a talk on rabies by Professor Stephen Harris, of the University of Bristol, to an all-party animal welfare group in January, I did not question the quarantine laws, believing that they were the only way to control rabies. I now know that we have an alternative. As the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, outlined, we have an effective vaccine. In order to fall into line with the European Union, I believe that we too should adopt this method of immunisation rather than subject animals to six months' quarantine when they have already been inoculated against the disease and carry the necessary documentation to that effect.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para50"></a>Clearly, no pet has entered this country from the European Union carrying the virus. As we have heard, we quarantined some 100,000 dogs and 50,000 cats between 1972 and 1993, with no outbreak originating from Europe. A percentage of older animals do not survive the ordeal; others become traumatised and are unable to return to their owners. With the opening up of opportunities in Europe, many families are relocating abroad. Those with pets ensure that their animals are inoculated against all the diseases in the country to which they are going. However, heartbreak comes when they have to return to this country and are faced with either having to leave their pets behind or subjecting them to six months' quarantine. Since January 1993, Customs checks appear to have been relaxed at ports of entry. I should think that in 1995 it is relatively easy to smuggle in an animal.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para51"></a>Returning to a conversation I had with Professor Harris, it would appear that, even though we have been exposed to a risk from Europe and elsewhere, no rabid animal has been smuggled into Britain in recent years. I understand that the virus appears to have strains that are pre-adapted to particular hosts and do not seem to transfer readily between hosts. It is interesting to note that at the turn of the century rabies was common in dogs here but was not transferred to the fox population. Therefore, if a rabid dog, which is infected with a strain of virus adapted for dogs, bites a fox, both will die, but the odds are against the fox passing it on to other foxes. The reverse is also true. At this point in time I think it is highly unlikely that a dog, if bitten by a fox, would not be taken to a veterinary surgeon and treated. However, foxes tend to avoid dogs.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para52"></a>According to the Rabies Bulletin Europe, which I picked up in the Library, a sample taken between April and June 1994 showed that 11 countries were rabies free, and of the others, only a handful of cases were found in dogs and cats. In France, Italy and Austria there were no cases of rabies in dogs. The problem is greatest in Poland and the Russian Federation but even there it is diminishing. In Europe, the majority of outbreaks occur in foxes, not domestic pets.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para53"></a>Europe has had great success with its programme of oral immunisation. So far, we appear to be the only country not contemplating an oral vaccination programme. I am told that MAFF considers the use of poisoned baits to be the most effective method of rabies <P>


<a name="column_878"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 878</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>control. Given that we have a high density of urban foxes, I wonder what would be the effect on the pet population in cities. The vaccine has improved considerably since those two dogs developed rabies in 1969.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para54"></a>I hope that Her Majesty's Government will look again at the Agriculture Select Committee's fifth report on the health controls on the importation of live animals. The report clearly recognises the enormous scientific advances in vaccination and blood testing as an alternative to quarantine for companion animals. I really cannot accept that countries like Sweden and Norway, which have been rabies free for far longer than us, are less conscientious when it comes to protecting their own wildlife. If they can allow into their country domestic pets which have been microchipped and vaccinated with an improved inactivated rabies vaccine and blood tested, surely we can give this alternative method of protection the serious consideration it deserves.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para55"></a>I read the Government's reply to the report. I did not find it very helpful. The reference to the Norway/Sweden method as,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"still very novel and unproven",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para56"></a>is slightly dismissive. It is easy to sit back and continue to monitor the performance of the new arrangements. What responsible pet owners who work within the EU want is some positive action. After all&#151;as the agriculture committee's report and the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, said&#151;should 1,000 dogs chosen at random in France be imported into the UK each year, it could be expected that a dog incubating rabies could enter once every 1,250 years! We have seen more and more dogs and cats quarantined over the years and still there has not been one case of rabies since 1922, with the exception of the two already mentioned.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para57"></a>Smuggling dogs into this country is wrong. When the Channel Tunnel becomes fully operational, and border controls are inevitably more relaxed, it will become rather like catching rainwater with a sieve. And where will our quarantine laws be then?
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para58"></a>Finally, what about working dogs, which are sent for duty on the other side of the Channel? If they are to continue to be useful, they will have to remain on the Continent, as they will not be able to return and work in the UK. As these dogs are extremely expensive to train, I suspect that the Customs dog unit will be hoping for a change in the law, or extra money for training new dogs.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para59"></a>Immunisation would cost between &#163;15 and &#163;20 while quarantine costs up to &#163;1,200. If I had a choice, I know which method I would choose. The public at large are still not aware that countries in Europe have had an immunisation policy for some years. I do not want to give the impression that I believe that quarantine laws should be lifted universally, because that is not so. Europe's problem is rabies within the fox population, and we are not quarantining them. We already know that cross-species infection is remote. Dog and cat cases are becoming fewer and fewer in number. Horses which carry the requisite documentation and veterinary certificates are able to return to this country. All I ask is that we should consider putting the necessary <P>


<a name="column_879"></a>

<FONT SIZE=3>procedures into motion so that companion animals which live with families and which comply with all the recommendations can be allowed back into the UK.

<P>
<A NAME="50315-06_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Astor of Hever: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to live in a rabies-free country and I want it to remain so. Therefore, I supported Her Majesty's Government in 1992 when they secured a Community commitment that any proposals on importation of pet animals must offer at least the same level of protection as exists for trade dogs and cats and quarantine.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para60"></a>However, I am concerned that there is now a greater risk of rabies from pet smuggling than from relaxing the quarantine regulations. The RSPCA and customs and veterinary officers that I have spoken to have warned me that illegal entries of animals through the tunnel will rise dramatically with the number of passengers, cars and lorries. The various port authorities rely on the public to report sightings of possible smuggled animals, but with innumerable uncontrolled ports and airstrips, river estuaries and thousands of miles of coastline, the possibilities of smuggling are immense.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para61"></a>Given the profound reluctance of many people to be parted from their pets for six months, the outrageous cost (which in itself leads to a great deal of abandonment) and the cruelty of quarantine, it seems inevitable that the vaunted protective barrier will be breached.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para62"></a>I now believe that Her Majesty's Government should seriously consider alternatives to quarantine, particularly as the antibody blood test is so effective. Clearly, the public must be assured that the dog or cat presented on entry is the same animal that has been vaccinated, as the reliability of veterinary certificates in some countries is very questionable. I quite agree with my noble friend Lord Kimball on this point.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para63"></a>But we cannot forever carry on locking up healthy pets. We need a modern, reliable and humane system which will enable properly vaccinated and blood tested pets, clearly identified by an approved tattoo or implanted microchip, to come into the United Kingdom with their owners. I am sure that the public will welcome and use such a system because they will know that, unlike quarantine, it is fair and affordable. Vaccination and blood testing will enable this country to stay rabies free. Costs should be at the owner's expense, rather than down to the public purse.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para64"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Wharton, said, it is significant that Denmark, Norway and Sweden, all rabies free, recently abandoned quarantine in favour of vaccination and antibody testing. Scandinavian health authorities do not take unnecessary risks. Interestingly, Sweden insists that pet owners have their own microchip reading equipment. These pocket machines cost under &#163;200, but I understand that prices are expected to come down in future.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para65"></a>It must surely be only a matter of time before the Government agree to ease the six-month period of quarantine in line with other European Union countries. I understand that Her Majesty's Government will be monitoring closely the Scandinavian system and the <P>


<a name="column_880"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 880</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>performance of the new arrangements for importing trade dogs and cats into this country other than through quarantine.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para66"></a>Would Her Majesty's Government consider widening their monitoring to include pets of service personnel, the Diplomatic Service and the blind, deaf and disabled who rely on their guide dogs? On the whole, these are responsible groups of people. Having served overseas in the Army, I feel particularly strongly about the plight of the Armed Forces. Under Army regulations soldiers must have pets vaccinated and carry an up-to-date passport clearly annotated. It would not be difficult to extend this to a requirement that electronic identity "chips" are implanted in these animals, with owners carrying their own microchip reading equipment for journeys to the United Kingdom. I understand that many service pets are already clearly identified with Kennel Club registration numbers of different countries tattooed in their ears. Our troops feel particularly aggrieved in Cyprus, which is rabies free. I hope that my noble friend will give this proposal his serious consideration.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para67"></a>Would my noble friend also consider the plight of the Customs Drug Unit sniffer dogs at Dover, which are being moved to the control zone at the tunnel terminal near Calais? They will not be allowed to return to this country unless they first endure six months' confinement in quarantine kennels.

<A NAME="50315-06_spnew8"></A><B> The Viscount of Falkland: </B>   My Lords, this has been an interesting debate. I would like to thank the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior, for introducing it, as one would expect, so expertly. I dare say that, as is often the case, the debate which we have had in your Lordships' House reflects the views of any similar discussion which may take place in a reasonably well informed household. I believe that the views and fears which have been expressed across the House are pretty well shared throughout our community.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para68"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Houghton, referred to risk and the perception of risk. I absolutely agree with him. I would go further and say that the perception of risk in our society depends an enormous amount on television and other media coverage. Often the perception of risk gets somewhat out of balance, which is probably the case with rabies. A number of noble Lords have pointed out that, happily, there have been only two cases since 1922 detected within United Kingdom shores.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para69"></a>However, we must not underestimate the risk. Anyone who has heard of a human being infected by rabies would not wish to leave any stone unturned to find proper ways to prevent it coming to these shores.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para70"></a>Smuggling has been referred to by several noble Lords. It is probably much more widespread than we think, and it is likely to increase. The noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, referred to the many ports and airfields in our country which are easy points of access for pets carried in by people for whatever purpose, whether it is just frustration at our laws or for more nefarious reasons. We have to be vigilant.
<P>


<a name="column_881"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 881</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para71"></a>It is an expensive and distressing business to have dogs in quarantine. It is always distressing to have dogs in kennels awaiting the outcome of whatever deliberations are taking place. I refer now to dogs who are languishing in kennels, at great expense to the taxpayer, as a result of the Dangerous Dogs Act. I would also like to pay tribute again to the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby, who has endeavoured on many occasions to get the Government to accept some kind of advisory body to enable decisions to be arrived at in a better way than one suspects happens through media pressure. There will be continuing media pressure about the risk of rabies.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para72"></a>Some of the most interesting remarks in the debate, because they dealt with the new technology, were made by the noble Lord, Lord Kimball. He referred to the microchip and the difficulties in arriving at a decision as to which microchip to use. He mentioned that there are five, which I know. We are getting closer to the point where there will be a uniform acceptance of one chip and one scanner.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para73"></a>Perhaps I may refer to another area of microchip use. Scanners and chips are used very much to help detect stolen vehicles, which is a problem with which I am much concerned. I know that we are very close to uniformity of chip and scanner in that field. The chip is effectively the same as that which goes into a cow's ear or the scruff of a dog's neck.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para74"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kimball, put his finger on what we lack at the moment. I refer to a proper European standard on dog identification and vaccination. Indeed, if I dare say so, we need a dog registration scheme. I do not want to enrage the noble Earl by going further. It always enrages the Government when we talk about dog registration. Inevitably, however, when one vaccinates dogs and information on that is stored on computer, it is de facto a registration scheme. Such a registration scheme will come sooner or later, and the Government will have to accept it, whether it is run by local authorities or other bodies, because that is the only way in which we can control matters such as we are discussing this afternoon.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para75"></a>Now that I am warming to my task of being critical of the Government over pets, and dogs in particular, perhaps I may say that we seem to order pet welfare and the control of pets in this country in an extraordinarily haphazard and unsatisfactory manner, especially for a country which prides itself on its worldwide reputation as a nation of animal lovers. Having said that, however, we now seem to be moving towards being able to assess such problems properly. The debate has enabled us to air the problems, and great expertise has been shown in the views expressed.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para76"></a>We must recognise that there is a risk and ask ourselves whether we have an effective replacement for the quarantine system that is in place, with all its faults and undesirable consequences. I believe that we are probably near to such a position. Technology has now developed so that we can identify animals efficiently. If necessary, pages of data about an animal can be stored on a computer and be readily available to those with scanners. I hope that the noble Earl will be able to tell <P>


<a name="column_882"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 882</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>us how near we are to being able to replace quarantine with a system that is at least as effective as the present one. Having said that, this has been an excellent debate, as I am sure that all those outside the House who are interested in the problem will agree.

<A NAME="50315-06_spnew9"></A><B> Lord Gallacher: </B>   My Lords, in speaking in this debate on behalf of the official Opposition, I shall place some reliance on the response of Her Majesty's Government to the document that was produced by the Select Committee in the other place. I refer to Command Paper 2735. If I go a little wider than the question of rabies and domestic pets, I hope that the House will accept that wider issues relating to animal health are involved, in addition to those mentioned in the Motion which was so ably moved by the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior. I also propose to ask the Minister a number of questions. In view of their nature, I do not expect to receive replies this evening.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para77"></a>The Government's response to the Select Committee report is good and comprehensive. Although I may not always agree with the Government's view of the points raised in that report, they have undoubtedly treated it with the seriousness that it deserves. However, the Government's comment that the creation of a single market from 1st January 1993 has not,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"increased to any appreciable extent",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para78"></a>the disease risk from imports has prompted the thought in my mind that it may yet be early days for making such a comment. One would have liked to discuss the motivation for live animal imports. Not being a specialist in the area, I envisage that pedigree breeding may play a part, but what about the rest? Perhaps we should be asking the farming livestock community why such imports are necessary and to what extent they are likely to increase.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para79"></a>We agree with both parties&#151;that is, the Select Committee and the Government&#151;that a holding period for imports is an essential safety factor. The only question is whether a three-day period is adequate, as opposed to the seven-day period that was recommended by the Select Committee. What has happened, if anything, since the Government's response was published in Command Paper 2735?
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para80"></a>The Government are at pains to stress the importers' responsibility. I agree totally. However, if an importer is responsible in terms of any introduction of disease, how can the Government ensure serious, effective and continuing discharge of such responsibility? If exporters of livestock may soon be regulated or licensed to ensure observance of transport and welfare requirements, can we safely leave imports to poster campaigns?
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para81"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby, will be happy to hear me say that we agree that veterinary standards are a key area. We also support the provision of European Community funds for the Advisory Committee on Veterinary Training. We were disappointed that the Commission decided to discontinue that, particularly in view of what has been said this evening about variations in the standard of veterinary training throughout the Community. Can the <P>


<a name="column_883"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 883</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Minister tell us what grounds the Commission had for withdrawing finance from that important advisory committee?
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para82"></a>Reliable certification is basic to safety. How much can reporting malpractice to authorities in exporting countries be relied upon? What sanctions are available for abuse or deficiency in that respect?
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para83"></a>I turn now to border inspection posts, which have been mentioned by other noble Lords. We are concerned that in their response to the Select Committee, Her Majesty's Government regard the establishment of import inspection posts as matters for "commercial decision" by operators. Is there any centralised information point about existing posts, as well as about patterns of use? Other noble Lords have mentioned the growth of trade at small ports with regard to imports. We certainly know a great deal about the growth in terms of exports. The principles of certification are essential for Community initiatives in this area. However, we also need a document which avoids the pitfalls that are associated with spoof invoices. What progress has taken place in that area since the Government's reply to the Select Committee was published?
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para84"></a>The prevailing disease situation in other member states and third countries is also important. We should like to know whether a single source of information exists or whether the establishment of such a source is contemplated.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para85"></a>I turn now to the issue of the quarantine of pet dogs and pet cats. I remember being greatly amused by a radio programme in which a Frenchman was asked what he would like to return as if there were reincarnation. He promptly said that he would like to be a dog in England. I do not know whether that was because we are rabies-free or because our pet dogs are creatures much to be envied by Frenchmen who are asked questions on the radio.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para86"></a>The Government's response to the report mentions that there has been progress towards the eradication of rabies, particularly in Western Europe. We would welcome more detail about that eradication, especially as regards areas bordering the English Channel about which other noble Lords have expressed concern. Naturally, there is such concern in East Kent, especially now that the Tunnel is fully operational&#151;even to the extent that customers are turned away.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para87"></a>We ask whether there are alternatives to quarantine. Has the ending of dog licensing and Her Majesty's Government's consistent refusal to consider even a dog registration scheme heightened the risk that is associated with any scheme to replace quarantine with the alternatives proposed by the Select Committee? That point was properly raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para88"></a>Pressures for easements for pets are not just about quarantine, they continue to grow; for example, local authorities and housing associations are being asked to lift restrictions in some of their housing schemes to allow domestic animals to be kept as pets.
<P>


<a name="column_884"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 884</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para89"></a>The alternative systems of control proposed by the Select Committee and, for various reasons, turned down by the Government are somewhat reluctantly accepted by us, at least for the present. The risks associated with relaxation, however small, exist, and the responsibility for authorising that even such risk is acceptable is a considerable one for any government to take. To that extent, we can understand and sympathise with the Government's present caution.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para90"></a>Her Majesty's Government's response to the details of protection schemes recommended by the Select Committee&#151;vaccination, blood checking and the unique identification of animals concerned&#151;accepts their validity in protecting against rabies in cats and dogs, but stresses that that is subject to effective control in practice. That view is shared by the British Veterinary Association and others. The Government, however, say also that it would be premature to introduce immediate changes. I wonder whether in the use of the words "immediate changes" there is a prospect that changes might be possible at some date in the future, perhaps when the technical improvements mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Kimball, have taken place. Does that mean however that such changes could be made in the future? Are there conditions which could be met then with more certainty than now? That is a question which arises naturally from the comment made by the Government in their response to the Select Committee.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para91"></a>The distinction suggested by the Select Committee for "approved" countries, while sound in theory, may be less easy to practise, even with a licensing and passport system. One has only to watch from Langford Cliff the flow of traffic at Dover Port on a busy Saturday in summer to recognise that any system requiring even random checking will seriously affect the present highly efficient and speedy operation at that port. As others have said, the possible use of checks on cross-Channel railway travel one can only guess at in the light of the limited operating experience we have had to date.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para92"></a>This has been a highly important debate, and one conducted as always on this subject in your Lordships' House with a great deal of sense and responsibility. We are indebted, as I said at the outset, to the noble Lord, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior. We look forward with anticipation to a fairly heavy task which in my opinion now confronts the Minister.

<A NAME="50315-06_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   (Earl Howe): </B>  My Lords, like so many other speakers, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Soulsby for prompting this debate. It comes at a very opportune time when we have just had an inquiry into this subject by the Select Committee in another place. The Government's response was published in January. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, for his endorsement of that response.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para93"></a>The debate has shown that this is a very sensitive issue. Indeed many of the points which have been raised were discussed within government when we considered the report of the Select Committee. On the one hand, it is clear that our current quarantine arrangements cause <P>


<a name="column_885"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 885</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>a great deal of distress and concern to pet owners, a point made powerfully by the noble Baroness, Lady Wharton, and others. Many feel that they are placed in a very difficult position when having to consider moving abroad for career or personal reasons. There can be few cases more poignant in the postbag of an agriculture Minister than the letters from those returning from abroad to the United Kingdom with pet cats and dogs they have grown to love over the years which are now reaching the end of their natural lives and whose owners feel will not survive the six months' quarantine. I can assure your Lordships that we take no pleasure whatsoever in that situation and would dearly love to be able to remove the burden of quarantine which causes such anguish in those cases.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para94"></a>However, one has also to recognise&#151;a fact which many noble Lords have stressed&#151;that rabies remains a serious health risk in many parts of the world, and although progress has been made towards its eradication, particularly in Western Europe, there are many countries, including parts of Europe, where the incidence of animal rabies remains high. Although animals, both wild and pet animals, can be vaccinated against the disease and humans can be treated, it is nevertheless an extremely unpleasant disease and once symptoms emerge in man it is invariably fatal.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para95"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Houghton, said that rabies was usually associated in the public perception with dogs. He may be interested to know that in Florida only last Friday television programmes were interrupted with the message that rabies had been confirmed in two cats and people were advised not to let their children play out of doors and ensure that their pets were fully vaccinated. That is only one incident, but it is a telling one and should give us pause.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para96"></a>Rabies was eradicated from the United Kingdom in the early part of this century and we believe the consequences of the disease re-entering the United Kingdom would be severe. An outbreak of the disease would lead to the destruction of wildlife over a wide area and onerous controls on pet owners until the disease was wiped out. It would be an extremely difficult time, not just for government but for all those living or working in the area where disease was confirmed. Although it is not possible to put a price on the value that society places on our current freedom from rabies, the Government, like the noble Lord, Lord Houghton, believe that it is substantial. The Government therefore endorse the view put forward by the Select Committee in its report that it would never support a change in our rules which increased the likelihood of rabies entering the United Kingdom. We believe that that central principle must be borne in mind when considering any change from the current arrangements.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para97"></a>Quarantine was introduced at the beginning of the century to prevent the reintroduction of rabies into Great Britain. As my noble friend Lord Soulsby said, it has done so effectively since 1922, except for two isolated and quickly resolved incidents in 1969 and 1970. Because the system is based on licensing of animals before arrival and the controlled movement of animals between the authorised port of entry and the quarantine <P>


<a name="column_886"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 886</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>kennels, it does not rely on border controls and has been able to continue to offer the same level of protection since the introduction of the Single Market. It has the additional advantage that it is not dependent on accuracy of identification or certification.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para98"></a>My noble friend Lord Astor of Hever and the noble Viscount, Lord Allenby, suggested that quarantine encourages smuggling and increases the risk of rabies through illegal imports. The Government do not accept that. The current rules are simple and the public know and understand them. A system which would lead to substantial numbers of pet animals openly entering the UK with their owners would lead the public to make the presumption that any cats and dogs they observed were legal imports and we would lose valuable co-operation from the public in detecting illegal imports.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para99"></a>My noble friend Lord Astor of Hever and the noble Viscount, Lord Allenby, suggested that there might be a possible rise in the illegal entry of animals as a result of the Channel Tunnel. The situation with the tunnel is the same as it is with other ports of entry. Animals are not permitted on trains using the tunnel, but there is always the risk that irresponsible people might try to smuggle animals. As at other ports and airports, the general public and H.M. Customs will be our first line of defence against the possibility of animals being smuggled into this country. In addition, the authorities on board trains will be on the lookout for any breaches of our laws, including smuggled animals.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para100"></a>My noble friend Lord Soulsby said that 800 dogs and cats had been imported illegally between 1985 and 1993. I am advised that that figure is correct, but most of those were technical offences involving, for example, a licence not having been obtained in advance by the airline rather than smuggling as the term is generally understood.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para101"></a>Having considered the situation extremely carefully and having taken into account the heavy burden which our current arrangements place on those wishing to return to the United Kingdom from working or living abroad, we have reluctantly had to conclude that now is not the time to relax our quarantine arrangements. I should like to explain in a little more detail why we have reached that conclusion.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para102"></a>The Government have considered the situation very carefully, particularly in relation to countries without rabies and the European Community where progress has been made to eradicate rabies. This afternoon we have heard a great deal about the success of wildlife vaccination programmes in Europe. I commend that success, but I have to say that much remains to be done. It has to be recognised that, although progress has been made in the western part of the European Community, rabies is still relatively common in the eastern parts and there are difficulties, particularly in those areas bordering the old Iron Curtain.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para103"></a>My noble friend Lord Soulsby pointed to the differences between fox mediated rabies in Europe and dog mediated rabies in other parts of the world. It is undoubtedly true that the risk to human health in western Europe, even in those countries with rabies, is <P>


<a name="column_887"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 887</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>less than in those third world countries which have dog mediated rabies. But that is not to say that the risk is negligible and can be completely ignored.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para104"></a>My noble friend suggested that the fox adapted virus cannot affect dogs, cats or other animals or humans. But fox rabies can affect dogs and cats. In 1993 15 dogs and 43 cats were known to have died of rabies in the European Union. The origin of those cases must have been foxes. The noble Baroness, Lady Wharton, concentrated on the dog/fox relationship. The greater risk is between cats and foxes, where the relationship can be much closer.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para105"></a>My noble friend Lord Soulsby also pointed to the rarity of human rabies in Europe. There have been five cases of human rabies in this country during the past 10 years. All were infected overseas. In 1991, a woman died of rabies in Leipzig, Eastern Germany. That was the first human fatality from rabies contracted in Europe in recent years. We cannot wish away the several thousand cases of rabies each year which occur in the European Community. Nor can we ignore the fact, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Wharton, that the United Kingdom has a very large number of urban foxes which could prove more difficult to control, if disease were to enter the United Kingdom, than the rural fox which makes up the bulk of the fox population on mainland Europe. The risk to human health in Western Europe may be small but the economic consequences of having to control endemic rabies are serious. The Government must take a cautious line.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para106"></a>We have also heard about the special arrangements that were introduced last year for commercially traded dogs and cats. I wish to make it clear that that is a very special arrangement which requires not only the animal to be vaccinated, blood tested, unambiguously identified by a microchip, imported in a specially approved vehicle and covered by the same automatic notification in the ANIMO system as other commercial livestock imports, but also that the animal must have been maintained in captivity on the holding of birth since birth and not come into contact with wildlife. That is something which commercial breeders who wish to make use of the arrangement have to do. I believe that, on reflection, noble Lords will see that very few pet cats and dogs will have spent the first nine months of their lives isolated from the outside world in this way. In effect, we have not abolished quarantine for these traded animals; we have merely transferred it from a post-import quarantine to a pre-export isolation system.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para107"></a>These new rules apply only to imports of commercially traded cats and dogs into the UK and Ireland from other member states of the European Community. As a result of its accession to the Community, Sweden, which has a high health status for rabies, is entitled to request the extension of these rules to imports into Sweden from the other member states. We believe that the Commission will soon make the necessary changes. This will involve some amendment of the rules for importing commercially traded cats and dogs into the UK and Ireland from Sweden, but the details have not yet been settled.
<P>


<a name="column_888"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 888</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para108"></a>It has also been suggested that a combination of vaccination and blood testing alone, together with proper identification of the animal, will offer sufficient guarantees for pet cats and dogs entering Britain from Europe. That point was made by my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever. In a perfect world, that might well be true. However, one must recognise that even a positive reaction in the blood test does not necessarily prove that the animal will not develop clinical rabies. If an animal is exposed to the disease and then vaccinated, a blood titre will develop in response to the vaccination but the animal will still succumb to rabies. Vaccination of an animal which is already infected will not prevent the development of clinical disease. That is a technical but very important point.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para109"></a>It has also been suggested that a number of countries outside Europe which are completely rabies free have extremely tough import controls of their own and that we should allow pet animals from those countries to be imported without quarantine. That is a most difficult issue which was looked at by the Waterhouse Inquiry in 1970. That inquiry concluded that, although on paper there was a good case for relaxing the controls in these circumstances, to do so could increase the risk of fraudulent misrepresentation of animals and rabies being introduced by the back-door. I do not believe that during the past 25 years human nature has improved to such an extent that we can ignore the wise views put forward at that time. However, of course we shall continue to keep our import policy under review as regards third countries free of rabies.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para110"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Allenby, suggested that quarantine does not keep rabies out. Ninety years experience shows exactly the opposite. The real question is whether there is an alternative that gives the same level of assurance. With effective enforcement&#151;as with the Balai arrangements that I have outlined&#151;there can be. But we must be sure that everybody complies, which implies border controls. Sweden has kept them but we do not have them.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para111"></a>The noble Viscount said that RSPCA inspectors were not admitted into quarantine kennels. Ministry vets are entitled to take others with them when they inspect quarantine kennels if they wish to do so. In any case, all animals in quarantine are inspected at least twice a week by a veterinary surgeon.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para112"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wharton, made the point that some animals enter quarantine already having been vaccinated. Pre-vaccination is not a requirement for quarantine. Dogs and cats are vaccinated when they arrive at the quarantine kennel, and that is a mandatory arrangement.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para113"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, spoke about standard dog identification. I entirely agree with what he said. We need a universally accepted standard but, unfortunately, that does not yet exist. International agreement, brokered by the international standards organisation, is required.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para114"></a>The noble Viscount also referred to the possibility of national dog registration. He will not be surprised to hear me say that the Government remain opposed to a national dog registration scheme. It would be bureaucratic and difficult to enforce and the <P>


<a name="column_889"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 889</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>irresponsible owner would probably not register in the first place. Surely the way forward is to look at the specific problems related to dogs in society rather than to impose a bureaucratic registration system. These problems are best dealt with through the dog control legislation in the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para115"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, asked whether our resistance to registration had increased the risks of the import of disease. I do not believe that it has. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it was irrelevant to preventing the introduction of an animal incubating rabies.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para116"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wharton, asked why we do not adopt the system used in Sweden and Norway. Changes were introduced there last summer to allow the import of pet dogs and cats provided they had been vaccinated against rabies, that a blood test had shown that the vaccination was effective and that they were identified individually. The animals must go through the normal customs procedure on entering either country. It would not be justifiable to introduce into the United Kingdom new border controls solely for the purpose of inspecting pet dogs and cats. Nor is it clear whether the Swedish authorities will be able to keep their border controls in the long term.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para117"></a>My noble friend Lord Astor asked about service dogs from Cyprus and other rabies-free countries. The problem is that it would be impossible to be certain in every case about the true origin of a particular animal. There is also a serious risk of animals being substituted for the purpose of evading the regulations.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para118"></a>My noble friend asked also about the possibility of instituting special arrangements for service personnel. I am sympathetic to that suggestion, especially in the case of guide dogs. But the proposal cannot be looked at in isolation or taken out of context. There should be no change at present for pet or companion animals. The only change that has now been implemented is for traded animals, and they are subject to conditions which I believe pets could not meet.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para119"></a>I understand that the services are now insisting on microchipping and vaccination. If there is a change in the rules at any time in the future, that may well provide basic support for the changes.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para120"></a>My noble friend Lord Astor mentioned also sniffer dogs. Sniffer dogs can continue to be used in the Channel Tunnel, including at the French terminal. Quarantine standard kennelling is provided. Therefore, the dogs can continue to be used for the purpose for which they are trained; and of course, they are not pet animals.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para121"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, spoke about the veterinary standards which apply in other member states. We have no evidence to suggest that official veterinary services in other member states are any less competent than those in the UK. Occasional errors in veterinary certification have occurred but they have been taken up immediately and vigorously with the member state concerned. We are pressing for harmonised European standards of veterinary certification based on principles drawn up by the <P>


<a name="column_890"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 890</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Federation of Veterinarians in Europe, in particular, that vets should certify only where they have personal knowledge of the relevant facts. If discrepancies are found, the matter is raised with the authority in the country of export and the Commission, if appropriate.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para122"></a>The Government have considered very carefully this whole issue. The noble Lord, Lord Houghton, asked why we could not begin with alternative arrangements. We have begun and that is exactly what the Balai arrangements are, but we need to see how they work in practice. At this time we are not persuaded that the situation in Europe&#151;although there have been a number of encouraging trends&#151;has developed sufficiently to justify replacing the well-tried existing quarantine system. However, the position will be kept under review in the light of developments elsewhere in Europe and experience gained in the implementation of alternative systems both in relation to commercially traded animals in the United Kingdom and also to the new arrangements which were introduced last year in Sweden. The Chief Veterinary Officer has already visited Sweden to discuss the new arrangements and we shall follow events there closely.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para123"></a>I have taken note of the points put forward this afternoon. I assure your Lordships that we shall take into account what has been said in future consideration of the issue. The situation, particularly in Europe, is improving. As I emphasised, we monitor the situation very carefully. When it is safe to make changes the Government will do so, guided by the principle which I mentioned at the outset&#151;that they will not support changes which increase the likelihood of rabies entering the United Kingdom.

<P>
<A NAME="50315-06_spnew10"></A><B> Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior: </B>   My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have contributed to the debate. A number of valuable points have been raised by all noble Lords. In particular, I am grateful for the perceptive thoughts of the noble Lord, Lord Houghton of Sowerby. He referred to the need for good will and understanding from the general public on this important issue.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para124"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Allenby, mentioned animal welfare, which is very important. He used compelling evidence to highlight the problems caused by limited travel for the deaf or blind and their guide dogs. Those people are restricted to this country and cannot travel abroad, as many other people can.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para125"></a>My noble friend Lord Kimball was more cautious in his attitude. He talked about microchipping and made a plea for one approved microchip. He raised the important issue of veterinary standards in certain European Union countries and the standard of veterinary education. We are aware of the problems which occur both as regards training and problems of certification, which was dealt with by the Minister.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para126"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Wharton, mentioned welfare and emphasised the stress caused to pet owners who wish to return to this country. She emphasised also the unique nature of fox rabies. She pleaded for greater <P>


<a name="column_891"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 891</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>faith in the arrangements for the importation of dogs in Norway and Sweden. She identified the problems for disabled people with working dogs.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para127"></a>My noble friend Lord Astor of Hever mentioned smuggling. Although comments on the extent of it have been rejected, a number of noble Lords seem to feel that it may well be on the increase. That poses serious problems. Like my noble friend Lord Kimball, my noble friend Lord Astor expressed caution about the introduction of new approaches, but he does not reject them.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para128"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, also referred to smuggling, as well as microchipping and veterinary standards in Europe. I was pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Gallacher, rightly drew to our attention that the debate dealt with issues other than rabies, but because of time it was clearly not possible to discuss them at length. However, he re-emphasised the major problem of veterinary standards and veterinary education in some parts of the European Union.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para129"></a>Finally, I am grateful to the Minister for the sympathetic understanding that he showed over the distress caused to individuals wishing to return to this country because of quarantine for their pet dogs and cats. We clearly disagree about the risks involved in regard to quarantine and vaccination and the onward transmission of rabies from one species to another; for example, from foxes to dogs and from dogs to foxes.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para130"></a>I am disappointed, as I believe other noble Lords will be, that a first step is not to be made to recognise the need to abandon the need for quarantine. However, we should be encouraged by the Minister's comments that importation from third countries where rabies is absent will be kept under review. I welcome also his wider comment that the whole issue will be kept under review. I hope that that occurs sooner rather than later.
<P>

<a name="50315-06_para131"></a>The subject has been well aired this afternoon, which illustrates the concerns of a wide range of individuals. I trust that noble Lords who contributed to today's debate will feel content that they have brought such issues to the attention of my noble friend the Minister. With those few comments, I beg leave to withdraw the Motion.

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-07_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I beg to move that the Bill be now read a second time.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para0"></a>The Bill, like many other things, has a pre-history. There were very similar debates in your Lordships' House on 14th June and 11th July of last year during the passage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill. Therefore, it may be asked why I am returning to the subject only eight months later. There are several reasons. The first is the extent of child prostitution especially in Asia, but also in other countries. There can be little doubt that the prime cause of it is the absolute poverty of the parents, or the breakup of the families of the children who find themselves caught up by prostitution. In some cases, the parents themselves allow or encourage their children to be abused for money. In <P>


<a name="column_892"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 892</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>other cases, conditions at home become so unbearable that the children run away, usually to the nearest big city where they become easy prey for the organisers of commercial, under-age sexual exploitation. It is important to emphasise that boys become victims of this almost as much as girls.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para1"></a>A few figures will give your Lordships some idea of the extent of the problem. There are estimated to be between 60,000 and 100,000 child prostitutes in the Philippines serving both the local population and the many expatriates and tourists from Europe and America. The same is true of Kenya where the number of children suffering abuse is not known for certain. In Sri Lanka, estimates of child prostitutes vary between 15,000 and 30,000. The United Kingdom is the second largest source of European visitors. The lowest estimate in Thailand for child prostitutes is 40,000 and the higher figure is 200,000. There, the UK ranks third among the sources of European tourism. Vietnam has a small number of child prostitutes under 16, India probably has 30,000&#151;but possibly many more&#151;and Taiwan has up to 100,000.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para2"></a>Throughout Asia, as elsewhere, tourists are welcomed for the spending power and hard currency that they bring. For that reason, among others, there is no great eagerness to prosecute them even for offences involving the sexual abuse of children. Nevertheless, the UK ranks fourth in the table of foreign nationals who have been arrested in Asia for offences against children. Therefore, our record is a serious and, indeed, a shameful one.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para3"></a>In our national legislation the interests and well-being of the child are always prime considerations both for the courts and for those framing legislation. The effects on the child of abuse and exploitation are completely and totally opposed to its welfare. They start with pain and continue with degradation, loneliness, rejection and depression. On top of all that, there is usually a serious risk of HIV and AIDS; for example, in one brothel in Bangkok 17 out of 18 girls were found to be infected with HIV and all of them were under 20 years old.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para4"></a>The first reason for the Bill, therefore, is the size and extent of the problem with which we are faced. The second reason lies in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child which we ratified in 1992. The convention says plainly:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"State parties shall prevent exploitative use of children in prostitution".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para5"></a>Article 34(b) defines a child as any person under the age of 18, thus overcoming the varying ages of consent for sexual intercourse in various countries and providing a norm for the future harmonising of laws.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para6"></a>I am glad to say that this country has had a fair measure of success in protecting its own children against sexual abuse. I suggest, therefore, that it behoves us to do all that we can to prevent our nationals from exploiting the children of other countries.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para7"></a>I trust that we shall follow the example of Australia, France, Germany, Norway and Sweden and, I believe, also of Finland and Italy. Those states have already taken power to prosecute at home for offences committed by their nationals against the children of other countries. Similar changes in law are impending in Belgium, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the United <P>


<a name="column_893"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 893</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>States. Your Lordships will notice that, in those combined lists, there are included four countries which have a common law tradition similar to our own.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para8"></a>The third reason for legislating now is to be found in the weight and quality of favourable public opinion, both international and domestic. A group calling itself End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, was formed in Bangkok, Thailand. Incidentally, it estimates that there are some 1 million children subjected to prostitution in Asia. That voluntary initiative stimulated strong responses from UNICEF, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and its special rapporteur on the sexual abuse of children, together with the ILO and the Council of Europe.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para9"></a>In Britain, the campaign for legislation is headed by the Coalition on Child Prostitution and Tourism which is supported by the NSPCC, Save the Children UK, Christian Aid, CAFOD, the Jubilee Campaign, Action for Children, Soroptimists International, the Association of Inner Wheel Clubs in Great Britain and Ireland, the National Council of Women and the United Federation of Travel Agents.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para10"></a>In case your Lordships should make light of that rather long list of organisations, I should perhaps add that an Early Day Motion was signed last year by 250 Members of another place, whereas 100 signatures is normally considered a strong expression of opinion. In the country at large, 90,000 persons have signed a petition in favour of domestic legislation on the subject. The consensus of well-informed opinion can no longer be ignored. The problem is one for which we have to take responsibility. The point is well made by the Association of British Travel Agents. Its chief executive wrote to me saying:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"This is a problem requiring both industry and Government intervention".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para11"></a>I turn now to the contents of the Bill. Clause 1 creates a new offence. A child is defined as a person,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"under the age of 18 years",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para12"></a>in harmony with the UN Convention. Clause 1(1) (a) and (b) require the sexual offence to be a crime under the laws of both the country where the offence is committed and of the United Kingdom. Paragraph (c) requires the person charged to be either a UK citizen or to be "ordinarily resident" in this country. Your Lordships will note that subsection (1) (b) accommodates slight variations in the legislation of the three legal jurisdictions within the United Kingdom. Clause 1(2) upholds the principle of avoiding double jeopardy. Clause 2 is headed:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"Short title, commencement and extent".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para13"></a>I now turn to the arguments used by the Home Office for resisting legislation on this subject. It is said that it is the primary duty of foreign countries to protect their nationals against abuse and exploitation. In general, I do not disagree with that. Certainly we should use the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990 to help those countries to do so. Nonetheless, it is against the direct financial interests of the countries concerned to prosecute tourists, or indeed business <P>


<a name="column_894"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 894</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>visitors. This is, no doubt, why so many Western countries have decided to take extra-territorial jurisdiction for themselves.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para14"></a>It is most significant that in the case of Australia, which took jurisdiction last July, the number of arrests of Australian tourists for sex offences in Asia has increased quite markedly. Australia takes this matter so seriously that every traveller leaving the country is now given a leaflet warning of the penalties for sexual offences against children. The conclusion to be drawn is that countries such as Britain have to show that they themselves are taking stern and comprehensive measures before others will also do their part in law enforcement.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para15"></a>The next argument against legislating is that it would be difficult to bring successful prosecutions for overseas offences in British courts. Distance, the securing of witnesses, the possibility of bribery, the need for interpreters, and attendant costs, all certainly pose problems. Nevertheless, to give just one example, Norway successfully prosecuted three men in 1990. I would also point out that it is not necessary to rely in all cases on evidence to be provided by governments and local police forces. Non-governmental organisations could play a major part if this Bill becomes law and so could human rights lawyers of whom there are an increasing number in overseas countries.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para16"></a>Only last week Father Shay Cullen was describing in the Palace of Westminster the rescue work which his Preda centre carries out for child prostitutes in the Philippines. The New Life Centre in Chiang Mai, Thailand, is another excellent voluntary organisation that would, I think, be willing to gather evidence for British courts. There are by now considerable numbers of people who have escaped or been rescued from child prostitution, some of whom may prove good and reliable witnesses.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para17"></a>I would also ask Her Majesty's Government to reflect on the timetable for this Bill. It could not possibly receive Royal Assent before July. Then there would be six months before the Act came into effect. On this point I would be happy to be flexible. Perhaps the interim period could be extended. The point I am seeking to make is that there would be ample time to alert foreign governments, police and non-governmental organisations so that successful prosecutions could be mounted here.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para18"></a>The other main point to which I should draw attention is that the reference in line 7 of the Bill to,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"aiding, abetting, counselling or procurement"</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para19"></a>will, I believe, provide a most important preventive deterrent to the abuse of children overseas. It would make possible the prosecution here of people who may never have left this country but who are accessories to crimes committed elsewhere. It is known, for instance, that there are paedophile rings in this country who seek to promote so-called "sex tourism" and who do their best to lure foreign children to this country under the pretext of giving them holidays. Children in Romania are understood to have been abused under the pretext of taking aid supplies to a local hospital. Certainly the Social Services Inspectorate and several voluntary organisations here are concerned about the problem of <P>


<a name="column_895"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 895</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>bogus aid workers. This Bill would strengthen their hand. Furthermore, the production of pornographic films and videos is frequently linked to paedophilia and some production could be caught if this is the result of crimes committed overseas. There is already a proved connection between child abuse in Thailand and pornographic videos produced for sale in Germany.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para20"></a>It is not widely known that the United Kingdom already has extra-territorial jurisdiction for the crimes of murder, slavery and torture. I submit that this list should be extended to include sexual offences against children. There will not be many cases per year under any of the four headings which I have just given, but all are essential elements of our laws. Child abuse happens to combine elements of both slavery and torture. I therefore commend the Bill to your Lordships' House. I beg to move.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-07_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Ashbourne: </B>   My Lords, I rise to speak with a heavy heart. It seems to me that the Bill tackles one of the most distasteful topics that this House is ever likely to debate. I find it hard to understand how any adult would abuse the trust of a child and commit sexual offences against him or her. The horror seems magnified when we realise that adults are travelling thousands of miles to take advantage of poor children in poor countries of the world for their own perverted sexual satisfaction.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para22"></a>I am reminded of the words of the Lord Jesus when he spoke of the consequences for anyone who might cause a little child to do wrong. In Matthew 18, verse 6, he said that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para23"></a>People committing these offences will ultimately have to face up to their creator.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para24"></a>I am conscious, however, that some find it difficult to listen to Christians who are concerned on this issue. They point to the sad series of cases where priests, ministers and Church leaders have abused their position in order sexually to exploit children. There are examples of such people travelling abroad to abuse children. There are examples of paedophile priests waiting for extradition to Britain for alleged offences committed against children. Such cases grieve me and bring great dishonour not only to the Church but to the name of Christ. I accept that we Christians have much to do to set our own house in order.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para25"></a>I draw the attention of the House to a conference of religious leaders from around the world which was held in Manila in the Philippines in January this year. The conference addressed the issue of pornography and its links with other evils such as sex tourism. More than 160 religious leaders from 37 countries and over 40 faiths were present. The declaration at the end of the conference acknowledged the need for Churches to address the issue of pornography and child sex abuse within their own numbers. I was encouraged by the honesty of that declaration and also by the clear call,

<P>

<a name="50315-07_para26"></a>I shall not be surprised if the Minister reiterates the usual Home Office briefing as to why it is inappropriate for Britain to introduce legislation. It seems to me that a Bill such as that before us today can be made to work and that it gives a crucial signal to those engaging in sex tourism that there is no escape from their crime. If they are not prosecuted in other countries, at least they will be prosecuted in Britain.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para27"></a>I hope that the Bill receives a Second Reading. I wish the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, well in his crucial task in pushing the issue forward and seeking to protect underprivileged and vulnerable children of the world.

<P>
<A NAME="50315-07_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, reminded us, this is the third occasion within 12 months on which your Lordships have debated this issue. The noble Lord has increased our debt to him by his very comprehensive and sensitive introduction to our debate. The debates which we had last year served to crystallise the issues.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para28"></a>As I understand it, it is not in issue that this vile trade exists in a large number of cities, nor that it has increased substantially over the past 10 years with the increase in tourism from the West to the third world. That is not in dispute.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para29"></a>As I understand it, the Government say that there is no issue of principle; there is no objection as such to the principle of extra-territorial jurisdiction. The objections are those which were specified by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para30"></a>First, it is said, it is better wherever possible that offences should be prosecuted in the jurisdiction where they take place. That is not in dispute. Nor, unhappily, is it in dispute that that is not practical in this case, for the reasons which the noble Lord gave. There is corruption in the police forces involved, in the prosecuting authorities involved and at various official levels. That is not something that we say about those countries, it is something that they say about themselves. The Government of Thailand are well aware of the problem and have indicated that they would like to see this country take the initiative which is proposed by the noble Lord tonight.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para31"></a>No one seems to dispute either that a substantial proportion of the offences in those countries originate in the tourist industry. Father Shay Cullen of the Preda Foundation who was mentioned by the noble Lord, who is leading the campaign in the Philippines, estimates that, of offences against children there, something like 60 per cent. are committed by tourists. Therefore it is not suggested that this is a problem which can be left in the laps of the countries concerned.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para32"></a>The second argument is that there would be no point in our courts having jurisdiction to try these offences because we could not bring successful prosecutions as the evidence would not be available. Since that argument was specified, a number of us have directed our minds to addressing the problem. We have made <P>


<a name="column_897"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 897</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>some inquiries. There are a number of ways in which I believe I can assist the House today with the results of those inquiries.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para33"></a>In one of our earlier debates the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, pointed out that there are non-governmental organisations of a very reputable status whose members and officials are to be found in many of these cities. He pointed out that they would be ready and willing to find out what had transpired and to marshal and present the evidence. That is undoubtedly true. At present a prosecution is proceeding in Sweden which rests on evidence supplied by non-governmental organisations. As the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, told us, there have been three prosecutions in Norway. In each case the prosecution led to a conviction. Two of them related to offences in the Philippines and they arose specifically as a result of evidence supplied by Father Shay Cullen and his organisation. The other related to an offence committed in Thailand, where again I believe the evidence was initiated by a non-governmental organisation.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para34"></a>I do not have all the details that I should like on those cases, but it might be helpful if the Home Office were to pursue that line of inquiry. It can find details in the report for 1994 of the United Nations Special Rapporteur, Mr. Muntarbhorn. I have no doubt that he can supply the details if the Home Office wishes to pursue the matter.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para35"></a>I ventured to ask Father Cullen whether it would be possible if necessary to arrange for witnesses to come from the Philippines to this country in order to give evidence. His answer was a very clear affirmative. He said that, contrary to what we have sometimes been told, many of the children concerned are not reluctant to give evidence. They would be happy to have the opportunity to tell people what had happened.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para36"></a>Father Cullen well appreciates the difficulties of approaching a child about these matters and taking a statement, and the dangers of producing in consequence unreliable evidence at a later stage. He is aware broadly of the rules but would be very happy to work closely with the police and prosecuting authorities in this country and to take their advice.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para37"></a>On that evidence it is no longer possible to argue persuasively that the evidence would not be available if prosecutions took place in this country.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para38"></a>No other argument appears to have emerged from the earlier debates. We are almost alone among the many countries which have been considering this matter in not proceeding to place an extra-territorial jurisdiction provision on the statute book. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, listed some of the countries which already have that provision and others which are proceeding to discuss it.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para39"></a>I do not think that any further contribution from me will serve a purpose. Nor do I think that it is needed, because that was the only argument which was addressed against the proposal. We in this country have a proud record, and one which has stood our reputation in good stead, as initiating the legislation which over a period stamped out the slave trade. I believe that if Wilberforce and Buxton and their colleagues were here <P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-07_spnew3"></A><B> The Lord Bishop of Ripon: </B>   My Lords, like other noble Lords who have spoken I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, for introducing the Bill into your Lordships' House and for speaking so ably in its support.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para40"></a>The wicked practice of child prostitution and its link with tourism is well known and well documented. Indeed, there are groups in my diocese of concerned people who meet to do what they can to help in the eradication of this evil.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para41"></a>I use restrained language in your Lordships' House, but there is no restraint to my feelings of abhorrence at the activities of those who travel as tourists to countries overseas and commit sexual offences against children. They use children as objects for the fulfilment of their desires, using them as one would a toy and then discarding them. Children are dehumanised, left with feelings of guilt and low esteem. There may be physical damage to immature youngsters. Perhaps most frightening of all, there is the possibility that children may be sought for sexual gratification because they are less likely to be HIV positive than adults. As a result they themselves become more likely to be infected. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, has already mentioned figures to bear that out.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para42"></a>The pressures and forces, sometimes physical force amounting to virtual slavery, which drive children to be exploited in this way arise largely from poverty. The majority of child prostitutes are from marginal families in cities and from destitute families in rural areas, or they are themselves the children of prostitutes. Child prostitutes are usually either street children who drift into prostitution as a means of survival or children whose families collude with their being taken for prostitution. In some cases children are simply snatched. Often families are deceived by the offer of a job to their child in a far away town as a servant or waitress, when the reality is quite otherwise.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para43"></a>Because poverty is at the root of the availability of children for prostitution, those who take advantage of them may be tempted to expiate guilt by saying that they are contributing to the relief of economic hardship. It is clear that that is self delusion. There are many proper ways in which economic hardship may be alleviated. But self delusion may work in other ways also. Those on holiday in Asia&#151;an exotic part of the world&#151;may feel far from home and free from the inhibitions which normally govern behaviour, believing in a vague way that they are in a different culture, and that what is unacceptable and unlawful in their own country is somehow permissible in this holiday setting. All that is, of course, fantasy.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para44"></a>A programme is needed which has a number of elements: the raising of awareness in this country; work with the tourist industry to establish codes of conduct; and work with embassies of destination countries to <P>


<a name="column_899"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 899</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>enable leaflets to be given to tourists. The Coalition on Child Prostitution and Tourism, to which church-related agencies already referred to belong, is pursuing such a programme. But central to dispelling of fantasy is the reality of the law; and it is here that the Bill is so important. The tourist who commits a sexual offence against children must be liable to trial and punishment for his offence. The law needs to have a long arm so that offenders who escape the country in which the offence was committed&#151;perhaps through corruption or in some other way&#151;may be brought to trial in their own country.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para45"></a>UK citizens form a substantial part of the tourist population; and there are some figures which indicate that they form also a substantial part of those who offend. Of 160 random cases monitored by the Coalition on Child Prostitution and Tourism, 19 were UK citizens. That is nearly one in eight. It is therefore a key part of the struggle to eradicate this appalling activity that UK nationals should be able to be committed for trial in this country for an offence committed elsewhere. That is possible at the moment, as has already been said, for the grave crimes of murder and treason. It needs to be possible for the grave and widespread crime of sexual offences against children.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para46"></a>The Government at the moment are reluctant to allow this change in legislation; and we have already heard from other noble Lords the arguments which underlie this reluctance. I should like to support the rebuttal of the argument which has already been given, in particular by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell: that child agencies and non-governmental organisations have made it clear that they are willing to provide help and support in the submission of evidence in order to bring a prosecution.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para47"></a>I understand that the Government are looking at what is happening in other countries which have introduced similar legislation&#151;perhaps in particular Australia, where such legislation is in place&#151;in order to see whether prosecutions are being brought successfully. Can the Minister tell the House what information her department has received on the matter and whether such information supports the contention that successful prosecutions are possible?
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para48"></a>It is inconceivable that this country should be a laggard in the matter. The Second Reading of the Bill in your Lordships' House gives an assurance that the House will do all it can to share in the stamping out of these shocking practices. We look for a similar assurance from Her Majesty's Government.
<P>

</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-07_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Wilberforce: </B>   My Lords, I very much welcome and support the Bill. Indeed, I spoke in favour of a similar measure which was debated during the progress of the Criminal Justice Bill. After what has been said, I can be brief. All the arguments are before the House.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para49"></a>The factual basis for the Bill is absolutely undoubted, as is the case of UK involvement. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, gave figures for the percentage of tourism from this country. There is no doubt that it is very great. Legally the noble Lord's Bill is well founded. It is <P>


<a name="column_900"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 900</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>perfectly open in English law to extend the reach of our laws in suitable cases, as we have done in relation to other crimes. The fact that a great number of other countries, including other common law countries, have done the same is a warrant for the fact that it is internationally sound and well based.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para50"></a>As stated by a number of noble Lords, the real problem regards enforcement and obtaining evidence. The only point I wish to make is that outlined by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell. There are means of bringing to the notice of English courts offences which occur in other countries. Anti-Slavery International, of which I am a joint president, has formed a coalition of bodies, including Save the Children, Christian Aid and others. It has established a co-ordinating office whose business it is to collect information on this and similar events. I wish to underline the fact that Anti-Slavery International, like other bodies, has a number of skilled and experienced officers on the spot in those countries. It is not as though we are dependent on occasional visits. On the contrary, we make continual and constant investigations into slavery and slavery-like processes which would include the specific evils addressed by the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para51"></a>Other countries have the same; Norway is particularly strong in that area. There is a branch of Anti-Slavery International there. That is underlined by the three successful prosecutions which have been brought in that country. They indicate that means exist for bringing evidence before the courts.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para52"></a>Of course not every case will be provable. Not every case that is brought into this country will culminate in a prosecution. However, the existence of a remedy is an essential complement to the two other methods of dealing with these crimes. I refer to local prosecution&#151;the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, has exposed the difficulties&#151;or extradition, which, as everyone knows, is a slow and laborious process, even supposing&#151;it is not the case&#151;that there is a treaty of extradition with the country concerned.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para53"></a>By passing the legislation, we would be giving a signal to other countries, our own people, tourist agencies and people going from this country, of our attitude towards such crimes. We would be placing the United Kingdom alongside other strong, reputably organised and legally sound countries which have passed, or are passing, legislation on the subject. We ought not to stand alone. I very much hope that we shall join them.

<P>
<A NAME="50315-07_spnew5"></A><B> Lord Milverton: </B>   My Lords, I support with great pleasure and wholeheartedly the principles, concerns and purposes underlying the Bill. I supported an amendment put forward by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell, on a similar matter in Committee on the Criminal Justice Bill.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para54"></a>I voice distaste regarding citizens from the western world going to places beyond and using their influence and power with local adults of influence to do unwholesome things (I use those words unashamedly) for filthy lucre on defenceless victims&#151;young boys and <P>


<a name="column_901"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 901</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>girls. They take advantage of them so that their persons are stripped of their dignity, beauty and wholeness. Hurt and harm comes into the equation. Those traders of young souls mislead the adults of the country of the youngsters as well as the youngsters themselves. As has been said already, it is really a form of slavery&#151;a horrible torture.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para55"></a>It is repugnant for Christians to act in that way, procuring children for commercial profit. It is repugnant for anyone from a Christian tradition to do so, even if they do not claim to be a Christian or a believer in God. It is a disgrace for any man or woman to say that they uphold the blessed and holy Trinity, God the Father, God the Son and the God the Holy Spirit, and yet to defile the body of a young boy or girl and thus to defile their own body.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para56"></a>The task is to have the courage to put those unwholesome traders in youngsters to flight by good law and legislation. I wish the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, success with his Bill and especially with the significant action being taken in certain countries which have been mentioned and the increasing support for that action. Shall we have the courage to do something for those youngsters who are shamefully ill-treated, misused and abused by those from the western world who maintain that they have such great standards of virtue? May the Bill have every success.

<P>
<A NAME="50315-07_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Ackner: </B>   My Lords, I did not speak but I voted on 14th June last in support of similar legislation proposed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell. I intervene to make only four points. First, it seems to be accepted that much of the tourism directed to this quite vile trade originates in the United Kingdom. That must impose a special obligation on the Government to take positive action.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para57"></a>Secondly, the obvious practical difficulties in securing a conviction can surely be overcome. Modern technology should be perfectly capable of producing, by video or other means, evidence to support the allegations. The suggestion has been made that the United Kingdom Government could station one or more police officers in the black spots to assist in achieving the evidence necessary.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para58"></a>Thirdly, the mere existence of the suggested extra-territorial jurisdiction would prove a valuable deterrent. Moreover, if that jurisdiction were coupled with but the threat to station a police officer or even to consider placing a police officer in the Philippines, Sri Lanka or wherever the trade flourishes most, it is bound to be affected.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para59"></a>Fourthly, to be indifferent to our fellow creatures is the essence of inhumanity. So said George Bernard Shaw. If we are not to join the ever-growing list of countries which have accepted extra-territorial <P>


<a name="column_902"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 902</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>jurisdiction, then the Government will be condemned as being indifferent, however much they protest the contrary. Accordingly, I support the Bill.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-07_spnew7"></A><B> Lord Ennals: </B>   My Lords, I am extremely glad to follow the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. We have now heard from two distinguished lawyers who have given an answer to what has seemed to me up to now to be the principal concerns of the Government in supporting this eminently sensible measure. I am no lawyer and I shall not seek to be drawn into the argument, but I was impressed by the case made today by the lawyers. I warmly welcome the initiative of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. I hope that the Government will seize the opportunity to block the undoubted gap in current legislation dealing with what has been described by noble Lords on both sides of the House, and particularly movingly by the right reverend Prelate, as a loathsome practice. All the evidence seems to be that it is growing and, if it is, we cannot simply stand idly by. We must find new ways in which to take initiatives.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para60"></a>I became aware of the abuse because of my involvement with Anti-Slavery International, like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, though I did so years after he had joined and played such an important part in it. In 1993 the organisation brought to Britain as a guest the chairperson of ECPAT (End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism). I was greatly impressed by the lady and her team and the work that they are doing. There is no doubt that their appeal was to those of us who cared enough about it to persuade the Government to climb on board and show courage in a situation in which they were trying to stand on the sidelines. I hope that they will no longer do so.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para61"></a>May I also say how pleased I was that Anti-Slavery International brought together the Coalition on Child Prostitution and Tourism which was referred to by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce. It covers all the different faiths, with CAFOD playing its part, as well as Christian Aid.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para62"></a>I am glad that so many Peers from different sides of the House have spoken in a moving way in relation to the Bill. So far, the Government have been negative in their response but I hope that the wise words of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, and my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell will convince them that they cannot stand idly by.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para63"></a>As most Members of your Lordships' House know, by the year 2000 tourism will be the world's largest industry. Its rapid growth has coincided in several poorer countries with the emergence of the disgusting child sex industry. I was impressed by the speech of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon. One major cause of the sexual exploitation of children is the promotion of tourism. No one suggests that tourism should be restrained but we must ensure that the actions associated with it are restrained. The right reverend Prelate referred to poverty and economic problems as being the underlying causes, but equally significant is the increasing demand from customers from wealthier countries such as Britain. As was said, the Reverend <P>


<a name="column_903"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 903</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Shay Cullen from the Preda Foundation believes that the demand from overseas visitors amounts to 60 per cent. of all prostituted children in the Philippines. ECPAT monitored the nationalities of a random 160 foreigners arrested for sexually abusing children over a three-year period. The fourth highest number&#151;12 per cent.&#151;were from Britain and that is unsatisfactory.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para64"></a>It is not as if it is just a question of the Philippines, Thailand and Sri Lanka. ECPAT has identified other countries, including Kenya, Gambia, Brazil, Cuba, Romania and Estonia, as the new areas of concern. Quite clearly, there is now an epidemic of this disgusting practice. Our Government should not only do something about it, but should very publicly be seen to be doing something. Of course it is difficult; that was recognised by the two lawyers who spoke. It is always difficult to be perfectly satisfied that you can get the right people when you need them. But to do nothing, to take no action, almost suggests a tone of approval. I want to see the Government respond in a very positive way.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para65"></a>Article 34 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child calls for state parties to:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para66"></a>Other tourist-sending countries have interpreted this spirit of the convention and have introduced legislation to prosecute their citizens for offences committed extra-territorially. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, listed some of the growing number of countries which have already decided that legislation is the proper way to deal with the issue. That has been widely supported by organisations such as UNICEF, the International Labour Organisation and the UN Programme of Action on Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. It is supported by Interpol and by the Council of Europe. We in the UK stand alone in rejecting such legislation. I find that sickening. I hope that the expressions of opinion that have come from all sides of the House this evening will convince the Government that they have to take action. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said how flexible he will be if the Government see better ways of doing what we know needs to be done. It is for the Government to decide how any action can best be taken and for us then to support what they bring before us.

<P>

<a name="50315-07_para67"></a>I spend a few weeks every summer working with severely disadvantaged children from London, many of whom have been sexually abused. I see the appalling trauma, the emotional and psychological damage, that this brings to their lives. If it is our intention, as I believe it must be, to continue to try to stamp out the practice of sexual abuse in this country, then surely it must be our duty also to do our best not to export the problem. <P>

<FONT SIZE=3>This Bill might have an effect not only in discouraging those who practise this curiously distressing and disgusting habit but also on those who organise it.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para68"></a>Some noble Lords will remember that great film, "The Third Man". There is something particularly repellent about someone who, for financial gain, is prepared to destroy and exploit children. This is an opportunity for your Lordships and for the Government to take action to pass a piece of legislation not for political or economic expediency but simply because it is right.

<A NAME="50315-07_spnew9"></A><B> The Viscount of Falkland: </B>   My Lords, I strongly support this Bill and I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, on his brilliant introduction of it and the coverage of the appalling and distressing aspects of the crimes that we are discussing this evening.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para69"></a>When I came in to this debate I was prepared to agree with what I expect the Government will say; namely, that a Bill such as this will be difficult to enforce. We have now heard from two distinguished lawyers in this House who have told us that not only is this legislation internationally sound and well based, but that there should be no real reason why, with all the technology that is available to us, we should not be able to proceed to get the kind of evidence that will result in the prosecution of offenders in those countries where this despicable trade takes place.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para70"></a>Since all the other points have been so well covered, perhaps I may turn straight to my concern in this matter. During my investigations before this debate, I found that in France there was indeed an admission that the difficulties of getting evidence were definitely there. In that country they took the view that this was not a problem that was entirely a dead end for them, but, interestingly, it was against the law in France for French nationals to indulge in illegal sexual activities with juveniles in other countries. Because of the people whom they had appointed in their embassies and other agencies whose job it was to look out for offenders of this kind, they had been able to make very successful inroads into the prosecution of paedophile rings who were going to those countries expressly to procure children for the making of indecent films and videos and for the dissemination of that material in Europe. It was coming through very well tried paths, usually through the Low Countries, into Europe; and a lot of that material was coming to this country. That is a further very good reason for supporting the noble Lord's Bill.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para71"></a>There can be nothing more revolting or shocking to most of us than the idea of material of this kind, as noble Lords have said, of children being degraded, debased and dehumanised&#151;whether it be still photographs, videos or films&#151;being circulated among perverted people in this country and in other countries of Europe for the satisfaction of their deviant taste. It is absolutely essential that, in common cause with other countries in Europe and elsewhere, we should seek, as we do in the war against drugs, to combat this problem, which unfortunately is growing, together.

<a name="50315-07_para72"></a>After all, the problem has been drawn to our attention by the countries themselves. It was in Thailand that enormous pressure was put on the visiting countries to do something about it. As other noble Lords have said, it is not the native citizens of those countries who use these children. It is the visitors&#151;or, as we euphemistically call them, tourists.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para73"></a>It is essential for us to support this piece of legislation. It has been so well argued, not only here but, as was mentioned, during debate on the Criminal Justice Bill in June, particularly in points made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer of Sandwell. It is not good enough for the Government to say that the legal difficulties are insurmountable and that that is a reason why we cannot join with so many other countries against what must be one of the most revolting and disgusting trades carried out in the world today. I hope that the Government will show that they have changed their mind in the months following the debate we had in June.

<P>
<A NAME="50315-07_spnew10"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, as always when dealing with Private Member's Bills I preface my remarks by saying that I speak for myself and not for my party. But that is perhaps more of a formality than usual because my inclination is so strongly in favour of this Bill that I find it difficult to believe that any of my noble friends will disagree with it. I believe that, even without our Whip, were there to be a Division on the matter, any of my noble friends who might be present would wish to support the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, in his endeavour.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para74"></a>First, as I always do in these circumstances, I shall look for common ground; matters on which all noble Lords, including the Government, agree. So far, all noble Lords who have spoken have been unanimous in supporting the Bill. Let us first agree about the sheer horror of the offence; the nauseating practice of adults of either sex abusing in any way children of either sex. A number of noble Lords attacked the issue from a Christian viewpoint and I respect that. I hope that they will understand that, as a non-Christian and a non-religious person, my horror at the offence is no less profound than theirs. Indeed, as one who is perhaps notorious in your Lordships' House for opposing many aspects of censorship for adult activity, the idea of abuse of children, whether in person or in the form of child pornography&#151;which involves personal activity&#151;is as offensive to me as it is to any of your Lordships. To that extent I hope that we shall be entirely in agreement in considering this Bill.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para75"></a>The second point on which we may all, including the Government, agree is the fact that the United Kingdom is intensely involved in this problem. Of course the offences take place in other countries and the concentration about which we have been speaking this evening has been in Asia. But we heard from the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that, in terms of arrests in Asia of people from developed countries for sexual offences against children, the United Kingdom ranks fourth. <P>


<a name="column_906"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 906</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>"Ranks" is a nasty way of expressing it; the correct way to put it is that we are the fourth worst. We are therefore deeply involved in this pernicious business, and in a particularly shameful way, in that we in the United Kingdom are supplying the offenders and the poorer countries where the offences take place are supplying the victims. That must be exceptionally shaming for us in this country.
<P>

<a name="50315-07_para76"></a>The third matter on which I believe we shall all agree&#151;certainly after hearing the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce&#151;is that there can be a power in United Kingdom law to punish offences which take place under other jurisdictions. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, referred to a number of cases where that occurs. He mentioned murder but I cannot remember his other examples&#151;certainly there were more.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-08_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Wilberforce: </B>   My Lords, slavery.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-08_spnew1"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the President of the Anti-Slavery Society for reminding me of that. Possibly the only way in which we can deal with offences of this kind is by bringing them under United Kingdom jurisdiction. There are precedents for doing that and there is no reason in principle or in legal practice why we should not take action of the sort proposed in the Bill. Again, I do not believe that the Government will wish to disagree with that aspect of the Bill.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para0"></a>The fourth matter on which I believe we shall all agree&#151;I know that the Government will agree&#151;is that the first choice must be for prosecution to take place in the country where the offence occurred. Again, the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, made that point. It is not suggested that, because the Bill would make prosecution in this country possible, prosecution here is preferable. Of course, from the point of view of seeing that the nauseating trade is reduced and abolished in those countries, it is better for the prosecution to take place where the offence is committed. It is also better because the chance of conviction will be greater in another country. I shall come on to the issue of the chance of conviction later; that is an area where there may be disagreement. But the issue of whether the first choice should be prosecution in the country of the offence is an issue on which I agree with what the Government have said in previous debates and I believe that all noble Lords who have taken part tonight share the same view.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para1"></a>Perhaps I can say a word about previous debates. When my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell moved an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill on this matter last year, I did not speak in support of it. There were two reasons why I did not speak. The first was because he made the case so much better than I could ever have made it that I felt I could add nothing of significance. Secondly, we were in the Committee stage of the Bill, where there were other matters with which we had to deal, and I did not want to prolong the proceedings unnecessarily. But, as he knows, I supported him in the Division Lobby and he will know now, if he did not before, that I supported him in principle, though in silence, when the matter was raised at that time.
<P>


<a name="column_907"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 907</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para2"></a>Let me turn to the issues where there may be disagreement between the Government and other noble Lords who have spoken. The first is whether prosecution in the country where the offence takes place is likely to be satisfactory. There are understandable and perhaps less understandable reasons why that may not be the case. The understandable reasons are that prostitution is an important economic factor in a large number of countries and it would be enormously difficult for it to be eradicated immediately.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para3"></a>The more reprehensible reason would be, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and indeed as evidenced by the submission from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, that in many countries there is corruption. It is possible to bribe the police force. It is possible for other countries to wish to brush the matter aside and not to take action for fear of damaging one part of their tourist trade. The conclusion that we must reach &#151;I hope the Government will agree&#151;is that prosecution in the countries of origin is not enough to deal with the problem of these offences.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para4"></a>The second issue on which there may be disagreement concerns the chances of success of prosecution in this country; whether there will be effective enforcement. Again, the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, gave evidence, and other noble Lords repeated it, of successful prosecutions at least in Norway and in progress in other countries. If it can be done in other countries then surely we must at least try. But, even if the number of successful prosecutions is small as a result of the passage of this Bill, surely the deterrent effect on those who go to those other countries of the fact that there have been some prosecutions and that there is a risk of prosecution, must be of some value in reducing the number of offences.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para5"></a>No one is trying to create a new offence with the object of putting a large number of people in prison in this country. What the noble Lord is trying to do in this Bill is to reduce the occurrence of the offence by showing not only that it is unacceptable in this country but that it is illegal in this country and that there are risks involved in committing it. I am comforted and confirmed in that view by the legal brains of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wilberforce, and my noble and learned friend Lord Archer of Sandwell.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para6"></a>There has been so much common ground and unanimity in this debate. Is it not possible that on this occasion the Government might modify their previous opposition and allow the Bill to proceed with their encouragement?
<P>

<a name="50315-08_time0"></a><H5>7 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-08_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Home Office   (Baroness Blatch): </B>  My Lords, I have been greatly moved by this debate; in particular, by the way in which it was introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton. Child prostitution and the sexual exploitation and abuse of children are loathsome activities wherever they occur.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para7"></a>The Government work hard in international bodies, such as the United Nations General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights, to combat child prostitution and we frequently raise the question of child prostitution in contacts with the authorities in countries <P>


<a name="column_908"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 908</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>where it is a concern. We supported the adoption by the commission in 1992 of a programme of action for the prevention of the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and have urged all countries to implement the measures it contains. We are a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and support the work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child in monitoring states' compliance with the provisions of the convention. Therefore, the Government understand the rationale for the Bill and the concern which motivates the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and other noble Lords who have spoken.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para8"></a>However, the Government are concerned that the measures proposed by the Bill would not be effective in practice. We believe that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to bring prosecutions in this country against British tourists who have committed sexual offences abroad and the measures would cease to be a deterrent once their ineffectiveness had been demonstrated. Most importantly, it would fail to tackle the real problem; that of child prostitution.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para9"></a>Concern has been expressed about countries where child prostitution is linked to the organised tourist industry. By these countries' own estimates, tourism from western countries accounts for only 10 per cent. of child prostitution. While that in no way excuses the conduct of western tourists, it demonstrates that if the sexual abuse and exploitation of children through prostitution is to be eradicated, there is the strongest possible case for the authorities in the countries where child prostitution is a problem to tackle the issue themselves.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-08_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, has the noble Baroness any reason to doubt the estimate of Father Cullen in the Philippines that 60 per cent. of the offences are committed by tourists?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-08_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I have no competence to doubt that. My information is that overall tourism from western countries accounts for 10 per cent. of child prostitution. Child prostitution is widespread in those countries and is carried on by people in those countries. I am not competent to do anything other than note what the noble and learned Lord just said.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para10"></a>At government level there are signs of a willingness to do something. The difficulty lies in translating general statements about the wickedness of child prostitution into practical action to eliminate the problem. Entrenched interests and the sheer scale of the sex industry in the countries concerned combine to hinder successful investigation and prosecution.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para11"></a>Many would argue that it is precisely because of these allegations that it would be better for our own courts to have jurisdiction. But that argument does not take account of how any system of extended jurisdiction would work in practice. If offences by British nationals in these countries were to be prosecuted in the United Kingdom, a very high level of co-operation would be needed from the foreign authorities.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para12"></a>Our police cannot simply arrest every British tourist returning to this country. Investigations could start only if there were a specific complaint against the individual concerned, most likely passed on by the authorities of <P>


<a name="column_909"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 909</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>the country involved. If those authorities are turning a blind eye to child prostitution, then no complaint would be made. Even if a complaint were made, our police could not simply fly off and launch an investigation. They have no powers abroad. They would be entirely dependent on the co-operation of the authorities in the country concerned. If indifference or even corruption of local authorities in those countries prevents prosecutions from being brought in the local courts, it is hardly likely that they would co-operate in enabling us to bring prosecutions in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para13"></a>A prosecution could be launched here only if the Crown Prosecution Service's criteria&#151;that prosecution would be in the public interest and that there was a reasonable prospect of conviction&#151;had been met. It would be necessary to show that the alleged offence was a criminal act both in the foreign country and in the United Kingdom and to have evidence to prove the age of the child involved.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para14"></a>The age of consent for sexual acts varies widely between different countries. Even within the European Community, some countries have ages of consent much lower than ours. Of course, the noble Lord's Bill makes allowance for this by requiring "double criminality", but it would be a complicating factor in attempting to try someone here for what we would consider the sexual abuse of an under-age child abroad. In many cases, it would be impossible to establish that an offence had been committed in the foreign country, especially given the absence of satisfactory records of birth in many countries where child prostitution is a major problem.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para15"></a>The victim, and any witnesses, are likely to be resident in the foreign country concerned. They may not speak English and could not be compelled to come to the United Kingdom to give evidence. The Government therefore believe that it is highly unlikely that a prosecution could be mounted here.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para16"></a>It is because of the mainly oral tradition of our courts that the assumption of extra-territorial jurisdiction presents problems for us. We know, however, that some other countries have taken such jurisdiction and we are monitoring closely the situation in those countries to see whether there are any lessons for us. The information we have received to date supports the view that it would be very difficult to mount a prosecution, let alone a successful one. Of the countries which have adopted the kind of extra-territorial jurisdiction proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, we understand that only Norway has been able to obtain sufficient evidence to mount a successful prosecution. Though convictions were obtained in that one case, it was in the absence of both victims and witnesses. As I said, our criminal courts rely substantially on the oral testimony of witnesses who are present in court to be cross-examined and they are not usually able to try cases simply on the basis of written depositions. In particular, witness statements taken abroad are of very limited value in our criminal trials and in many cases are not even admissible as evidence.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para17"></a>There may be some noble Lords who accept that an extension of our jurisdiction would not be effective in practice but who nevertheless believe that there are <P>


<a name="column_910"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 910</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>sufficient grounds for taking this action for declaratory purposes&#151;a point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, and repeated by many noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord McIntosh. That would be as a signal to the authorities in the countries concerned that child prostitution is a trade that we deplore and condemn, and as a warning to paedophiles in this country that they cannot, with impunity, travel overseas to commit acts which are offences here.
<P>

<a name="50315-08_para18"></a>Until the problem of child prostitution is addressed seriously by the authorities in the countries concerned, we do not believe that extra-territorial jurisdiction has a real contribution to make to the eradication of the trade, even when British tourists are contributing to the problem. Moreover, the Government do not believe that taking such measures would have a deterrent effect on paedophiles in this country; if the law cannot be enforced effectively, it will not serve as a deterrent to those who have no compunction about evading it.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-09_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Ennals: </B>   My Lords, all the problems outlined by the noble Baroness are real ones and they must be faced by those countries that have decided to proceed by the route of legislation.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para0"></a>Can the Minister assure the House that there is close consultation with those other countries which have reached a different conclusion from that which Ministers are apparently saying that this Government have reached?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-09_spnew1"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I can give the noble Lord an absolute assurance on that point. We are watching very carefully what is happening. We shall take any lessons to be learned from what, in the interests of all the concerns expressed tonight, we hope will be successful prosecutions. Where that takes place we shall watch what happens. As I said, there was one successful conviction but it was on the basis of the kind of evidence that would not be admissible in a United Kingdom court.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para1"></a>We shall continue to combat child prostitution through our work in international bodies and our contacts with the authorities in countries where it is a problem. But we believe that if the police overseas catch a British tourist who has abused local children it is best for them to detain him and prosecute him in their own courts. To assist in such action, we would provide considerable practical assistance to the authorities abroad under the Criminal Justice (International Co-operation) Act 1990, including the taking of witness statements from witnesses who may have returned to this country.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para2"></a>If the police do not catch the paedophile while he is in the country concerned, but only find out about him after he has returned to Britain, we are prepared to extradite him to stand trial in the place where he is alleged to have offended, subject to the usual safeguards. This is where our position differs significantly from several of those countries which have taken a wide criminal jurisdiction over their nationals when they are abroad. Such countries will not extradite their own nationals to foreign countries, and do not rely to the same extent as we do on oral testimony from witnesses who may have returned to this country.
<P>


<a name="column_911"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 911</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para3"></a>In our view, extradition is the better and more workable option. As I said, our police and our courts have no powers in foreign countries. The victim and any witnesses who are all likely to be in the foreign country concerned cannot be compelled to appear before our courts. In addition, if we were to extend our jurisdiction as proposed, the requirement for dual criminality, and hence the need to prove the age of the child, contrasts unfavourably with the position in extradition proceedings. With extradition it is only necessary to establish that the offender would, if the allegation were true, be guilty of the equivalent offence carrying at least a 12 months' prison sentence here.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para4"></a>If it is a prima facie case it is for the foreign court eventually to decide whether there is sufficient evidence for a conviction.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para5"></a>We are continuing to examine the scope for improving preventative measures. Representatives from the paedophile unit, based within the National Criminal Intelligence Service in London, are promoting international co-operation within the framework of Interpol.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-09_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Archer of Sandwell: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. At the risk of being tiresome, perhaps I may ask one further question. The noble Baroness repeated what was said on a previous occasion, that the witnesses would not be forthcoming in this country. Father Cullen is absolutely clear that they would. Will she at least arrange for one of her officials to interview him and pursue that further?

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-09_spnew3"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, without even seeking authority for that, I give that assurance. It will be important to talk to anybody who can further this debate.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para6"></a>In conclusion, the Government do not favour extending our courts' jurisdiction in the manner proposed in this Bill because we do not think that the measures would work in practice without the co-operation of the foreign authorities. If the indifference or corruption of those authorities prevents prosecutions from being brought in the local courts, it is hardly likely, as I said, that they would assist in enabling us to bring prosecutions here. Nor do we believe that laws which cannot be enforced effectively would have any deterrent effect on paedophiles in this country. That view has, so far, been borne out by experience. Lack of adequate evidence has proved to be a major obstacle in bringing cases to court in other western countries which have taken jurisdiction in this way. I hope that those noble Lords who have expressed concern will accept that however distasteful and loathsome these activities are&#151;and that they are so is not in doubt&#151;the issue of natural justice is absolutely central to our judicial system. Therefore, the quality of evidence is necessary to underpin any possible prosecution.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para7"></a>The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, claimed that the exploitation of children which takes place is attributable solely to western tourists. As I said, that is not the case because my understanding is that it is so widespread in some of these countries that even the tourism figures do <P>


<a name="column_912"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 912</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not constitute the majority of cases attributable to western tourists. The noble Viscount said "solely" and I argue with that word.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-09_spnew4"></A><B> Lord McIntosh of Haringey: </B>   My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for giving way. I wonder whether it is just a problem of understanding words. The noble Baroness used the words "western tourists" but another problem is Japanese tourists. I understand from what the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, said that Japan is considering legislation of this sort. Perhaps that is the reason for the difference in the figures.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-09_spnew5"></A><B> Baroness Blatch: </B>   My Lords, I do not argue with the point made by the noble Lord. I am simply saying that many noble Lords have mentioned the trafficking by western tourists in the child sex industry. I am simply making the point that it was not solely attributable to western tourism. It is a dreadful, loathsome problem in those countries. We are saying that they need to tackle it in any case, irrespective of western tourism.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para8"></a>The noble and learned Lord, Lord Archer, referred to voluntary organisations collecting evidence. We have said that we will consider the experience of other countries to see whether they are able to mount successful prosecutions on that basis. But well-meaning volunteers are not necessarily tried and trusted investigators with an understanding of the criminal law. It is therefore questionable whether the material which they might produce would stand up to examination or be admissible in our courts.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para9"></a>Of the countries which we know to have adopted extra-territorial jurisdiction over these sorts of offences, three have instigated proceedings; namely, Germany, Norway and Sweden. Three men were prosecuted in Germany for alleged offences against children in Thailand, but all three prosecutions failed due to a lack of sufficient evidence provided by the Thai authorities. Three men were convicted in Norway in 1990 for sexually abusing children in Thailand and the Philippines. Our courts require oral evidence and the cross-examination of witnesses. As I said earlier, I understand that the only witnesses who appeared in the Norwegian case were Norwegian medical practitioners and social workers. No affidavits were required to support the allegations, no proof of the boys' ages was provided and there was no requirement to show that the acts involved constituted offences under Thai or Filipino law. That would present a very real problem here under the United Kingdom judicial system.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para10"></a>The Swedish case continues and involves an allegation that a Swedish man abused a boy in Thailand. The case relies on videos of interviews with the victim and it is not clear whether he will attend the trial and be cross-examined, which would, as I said, be required for a trial in this country. We are awaiting the outcome of the proceedings with interest.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para11"></a>We are also carefully monitoring the position in Australia which passed its Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) (Amendment) Act 1994 in July of last year. I have noted the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that the number of arrests has risen, but we are not aware of any prosecutions as yet under this new piece of legislation. Again, we shall monitor that closely.
<P>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 913</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para12"></a>As I said, we shall keep in close touch with other administrations, discuss with them the problems which they may be encountering and in the light of their experience, consider whether our law is adequate. In the meantime, the Government believe that the most effective way of combating child prostitution and sex tourism is for the authorities in the tourist receiving countries to address the issue robustly and with conviction. We shall continue to support their efforts to tackle the problem, including providing practical assistance should they wish to bring prosecutions against British tourists caught abusing children.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para13"></a>Although I have set out in some detail the difficulties of passing this Bill into law, nevertheless the Government will follow the convention of this House by not opposing the Second Reading. However, I wish to record that I am personally deeply sympathetic.

<P>
<A NAME="50315-09_spnew6"></A><B> Lord Hylton: </B>   My Lords, I thank most warmly all noble Lords who have taken part in the debate. It seems to me that the mover of a Private Member's Bill could hardly have expected such unanimous support from all sides of the House, including my noble and learned friends on the Cross Benches and others learned in the law. I am greatly encouraged. I am encouraged too by the numerous letters of support I have received from individuals throughout England and from the very high level of media interest.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para14"></a>I am grateful also to the noble Baroness, Lady Blatch, for what she said about her personal sympathies and for being kind enough to say that she had been moved by the debate. I hope very much that she will read every word of it because some points may strike her, on reflection, with perhaps more force than they have yet.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para15"></a>The noble Baroness talked about the difficulties of mounting effective prosecutions in this country. I agree that there will have to be named individuals, and I expect that witnesses will have to be brought to Britain to take part in court proceedings. Several noble Lords have mentioned that that can be done and that it is possible to arrange, particularly through non-governmental organisations. I suggest that the passage of legislation in the United Kingdom will be an incentive to foreign governments to take much more determined and effective action in their own countries. The Australian experience is most relevant in that respect&#151;and likely to become more so.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para16"></a>What we are asking for in the Bill is a default power where local governments and local courts have failed to act. I suggest that the good name of Britain has been brought into disrepute by a minority of child molesters and rapists. That is of widespread concern and, on those and many other grounds, I ask the House to give the Bill a Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="50315-09_para17"></a>On Question, Bill read a second time, and committed to a Committee of the Whole House.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-10_spmin0"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Henley) </B>  moved Amendment No. 1:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><br>
 Leave out Clause 1 and insert the following new clause:
<center><b>Rights of second-named joint shareholders</B></center><br>
(".&#151;(1) After section 102 of the Building Societies Act 1986 there shall be inserted the following section&#151;
<center><b>"Rights of second-named joint shareholders.</B></center><br>
102A.&#151;(1) This section applies where the terms of a transfer of business by a building society to the company which is to be its successor include such provision as is mentioned in section 100(1).
<br>
(2) If&#151;
<br>
(a) a person ('A') held shares in the society throughout the requisite period;
<br>
(b) any shares in the society held by A were jointly held for any period ('the joint ownership period') constituting the whole or part of the requisite period;
<br>
(c) A was the second-named holder of the jointly held shares for the whole or part of the joint ownership period; and
<br>
(d) no person who has priority over A for the purposes of this section held shares in the society throughout the requisite period,
<br>
the jointly held shares shall be treated for the purposes of subsections (8) and (9) of section 100 as having been held by A alone.
<br>
(3) The following persons shall have priority over A for the purposes of this section, namely&#151;
<br>
(a) where A was not the first-named holder of the jointly held shares for any part of the joint ownership period&#151;
<br>
(i) any person who was the first-named holder of those shares for the whole or part of that period; and
<br>
(ii) where A was the second-named holder of those shares for part only of that period, any person who was the second-named holder of those shares for a later part of that period; and
<br>
(b) where A was the first-named holder of the jointly held shares for part of the joint ownership period, any person who was the first-named holder of those shares for a later part of that period.
<br>
(4) In this section&#151;
<br>
'the first-named holder', in relation to any shares jointly held, means that one of the joint holders who is named first in the records of the society, that is to say, the person by whom alone, apart from this section, those shares would, by virtue of paragraph 7(5) of Schedule 2, be treated as held for the purposes of section 100;

<FONT SIZE=2>'qualifying day' has the same meaning as in subsections (8) and (9) of section 100;
<br>
'the requisite period' means the period beginning two years before the end of the qualifying day and ending immediately before the vesting date;
<br>
'the second-named holder', in relation to any shares jointly held, means that one of the joint holders who is named second in the records of the society;
<br>
'the vesting date' has the same meaning as in section 100."
<br>
(2) In paragraph 7 (joint shareholders) of Schedule 2 to that Act (establishment, incorporation and constitution of building societies), after sub-paragraph (5) there shall be inserted the following sub-paragraph&#151;
<br>
"(5A) In its application to section 100, sub-paragraph (5) above shall have effect subject to the provisions of section 102A." ").
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3><P>

<a name="50315-10_para5"></a>The noble Lord said: In moving Amendment No. 1, I should like to speak also to Amendment No. 2&#151;in fact, to all the amendments! As my noble friend Lord Hayhoe explained on Second Reading, this measure has a limited purpose. It is to deal with a number of specific inequities in the Building Societies Act 1986 which affect the eligibility to receive a payment of second-named account holders&#151;such as widows and newly married couples&#151;when their society converts to a plc or is taken over by a company from outside the sector. It could not be, and is not intended to be, a comprehensive measure dealing with every possible problem, nor does it seek to address any matters affecting voting rights.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para6"></a>I should advise the Committee that any attempt to widen the scope of the Bill could put its survival at risk when it returns to another place for consideration of your Lordships' amendments. The Government support the Bill but we also accept the bounds within which it is set. In the time available it is much better to achieve a limited degree of success than to strive for much more and end up with nothing.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para7"></a>I appreciate that the two amendments, which stand in the names of my noble friend and myself, appear somewhat draconian, in that they strike out some 90 per cent. of the Bill only to replace it with a new version. If I may, I shall explain&#151;possibly at some length&#151;that the amendments are, in effect, mere drafting amendments. They are designed to ensure that the Bill achieves the stated aims of my noble friend.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para8"></a>I believe that all sides of the Committee would agree that the Bill should permit second-named (or former second-named) holders to participate in distributions following the death of the first-named holder (the so-called "widow's problem"); on the creation of a joint account (for example, on marriage); on the division of a joint account (for example, on divorce or separation); or when there has been a change in the order of names within an account. But it is not the intention of the measure to enable individuals to claim two distributions by manipulating their accounts, for example by splitting them up.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para9"></a>I should like briefly to give an outline of the amendments which stand in my name and that of my noble friend and which are spelt out in full in the wording laid before your Lordships. In brief, we propose <P>


<a name="column_916"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 916</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>to insert a new Section 102A into the Building Societies Act 1986, which will replace Clause 1 of the Bill as it came to the House.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para10"></a>Subsection (1) of the new section explains that the measures apply where a transfer or conversion involves a distribution of cash or share rights.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para11"></a>Subsection (2) then looks at someone&#151;called "A" in the text&#151;who is presently disqualified from receiving a distribution by the two-year rule in the current Act. Four conditions have to be satisfied before A can benefit in future. First, A must have held shares for what is called the "requisite period" which must always exceed two years; secondly, the shares must have been held jointly; thirdly, A must have been second-named holder; and, finally, no one who, in the words of the section, "has priority over A", may have held shares for the requisite period. I shall come back to that last requirement, from subsection (2) (d), in a moment.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para12"></a>If all those conditions are satisfied, then A will be able to qualify for a distribution. So those widows and others who are excluded by the existing legislation from receiving a distribution will, in future, be eligible for one.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para13"></a>In subsection (3), the wording may be complex but the effect is clear. First-named account holders take priority over second-named holders, and a later holder of the same degree takes priority over an earlier one. Let us take the example of a widow. As her husband will not have held shares for the requisite period, the test in subsection (2) (d) will be satisfied, and the widow will be able to benefit.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para14"></a>Let me give some other illustrations. Paragraph (a) of subsection (3) deals with situations where A has never been first-named holder of the jointly held shares. An example &#151;case 1&#151;is where A marries. She closes her sole account and opens a joint one with her husband, "H". If H is the first-named holder, he will be,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"a person who has priority over A".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para15"></a>If he holds shares throughout the requisite period, then he will get any distribution. But if he does not, then A will.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para16"></a>Let us take a different example. If another couple divorce and split their joint account, A will benefit if H takes his money away from the society, but if H retains a share account with the society for the requisite period, he will benefit from any distribution, not A. So a couple who split their account during the requisite period will not be able to obtain a double benefit. Both those examples are likely to be frequent occurrences.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para17"></a>The second case deals with a much rarer situation, but one example is where a husband, wife and son, named in that order, have a joint account. When the son reaches 18, the order of names is changed and he becomes second-named holder, with his mother becoming third-named. If the father dies and the account is split, the mother and the son will each have been second-named holder for part of the time. The rule then is that the son, as the later second-named holder, will be entitled to any distribution.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para18"></a>Paragraph (b) deals with the situation where A has been the first-named holder for part of the period. That could occur where a husband and wife change round the <P>


<a name="column_917"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 917</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>names on their account. Both will at some stage have been second-named holder, but under paragraph (b) the one who is first-named for the later part has priority.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para19"></a>Subsection (4) defines expressions used in the new section. A key definition here is "the requisite period". This runs from two years before the "qualifying day" to immediately before the "vesting date".
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para20"></a>Finally, subsection (2) of the new clause amends paragraph 7 of Schedule 2 to the Act to make sub-paragraph (5), which limits rights under Section 100 to representative joint account holders, subject to the new section.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para21"></a>Amendment No. 2 simply adds a provision to Clause 2 stating that the Bill applies in cases where the vesting date falls after it is passed. It will come into force on receiving Royal Assent.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para22"></a>I apologise for that somewhat lengthy explanation of the Bill and for the fact that it might seem somewhat complicated. I commend to noble Lords the opportunity to read it in some detail tomorrow as that might add a certain degree of sense to my explanation and make life somewhat simpler. With that, I beg to move.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_time1"></a><H5>7.30 p.m.</st></H5>
</P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-10_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Eatwell: </B>   I was somewhat taken aback when I saw the amendments, because they effectively rewrite a substantial part of the Bill. I was wondering whether, like the first cuckoo in spring, that was perhaps a record&#151;not that I was referring to the Minister as a cuckoo in spring or any other time.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para23"></a>As was said on Second Reading, we on these Benches support the Bill enthusiastically. We supported the measure introduced by my noble friend Lord Dubs, which the Bill has in many way superseded. I have a number of questions about the amendments which I should like to ask the Minister. He will be aware that on Second Reading a number of other anomalies were identified. We understand that to consider some of those anomalies in the context of this Bill would damage its progress, so it would be inappropriate to do so.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para24"></a>My first general question is to ask the Minister whether, if subsequent short Bills were brought forward to deal with some of the most obvious anomalies which were discussed on Second Reading and are not contained in the Bill, the Government would look favourably upon them or at least co-operate in their drafting and in bringing them before this place and another place.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para25"></a>I shall deal now with some of the complications. The Minister identified a number of specific cases. I wish to ask him about some other cases&#151;this is always a difficult exercise&#151;which seem to create some slight difficulties. First, we must remember that the notion of joint holding does not necessarily mean that there are just two people holding an account. As the Minister said, there could be more. He mentioned the case of a mother, father and son. Under the legislation as currently drafted, what would happen where a mother, father and son hold an account over the two-year period and the mother and father die leaving the son? As he is <P>


<a name="column_918"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 918</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>not the second-named, as mentioned in subsection (2) (c), would the son, who had previously been the third-named, qualify under the terms of the Bill?
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para26"></a>Using the term "second" to define a particular ordering is unfortunate. It should be "was a later-named holder" or should convey some notion of ordering which does not necessarily apply to the number two.
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para27"></a>My second detailed question relates to subsection (3) (a) (i) and issues of priority. That part of the amendment states that,
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"any person who was the first-named holder of those shares for the whole or part of that period",</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para28"></a>would have priority. That seems to create a complication in the following case. Let us suppose that Mr. and Mrs. Smith have held the shares for two years. During the period they become divorced, and Mrs. Smith immediately remarries Mr. Brown, and registers the shares in the names of Mr. Brown and herself&#151;Mr. Brown and Mr. Smith in both cases being the first-named holders. If Mr. Smith continues to hold other shares in the company, that seems to me to clash with any divorce settlement which assigned the shares to Mrs. Smith (now Mrs. Brown), and she would be unable to benefit. Her former husband who had happily handed over the shares in the divorce settlement, would benefit instead of her. The problem is the words "any person".
<P>

<a name="50315-10_para29"></a>I realise that the questions I have asked may be solved adequately by the drafting, but, after studying the Bill for a few moments on the train coming down from Cambridge, those two cases suggested themselves to me as anomalies which might remain in the current drafting.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-11_spnew0"></A><B> Lord Hayhoe: </B>   On Second Reading of the Bill, I said that considerable redrafting would be required. That might well be considered as something of an understatement, although I do not believe that it is unprecedented for such redrafting to have to occur when laymen, or even distinguished lawyers&#151;I think they contributed towards the drafting of the Bill's original wording&#151;are involved. I am grateful to my noble friend the Minister and to his advisers, particularly parliamentary counsel, who drafted the amendments to give legal clarity to the simple provisions and objectives of the Bill. I am grateful also to Geoffrey Fitchew, who is the chairman of the Building Societies Commission, for his helpful advice and support.
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para0"></a>I readily endorse the amendments. Both the amendments and the original drafting&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, and I made the point about the extensive redrafting that has been required&#151;illustrate clearly the drafting problems that arise when preparing legislation, or amendments to complex legislation. Perhaps I may express my feelings, as I did in the debate we had some months ago about the clarity of legislation and its drafting: what a pity it is that the drafting of legislation has become so esoteric. I am not sure whether it is an art or a science, but at least it is beyond the capabilities of ordinary mortals. But enough of the wishful thinking that we would be able to achieve simplicity in the drafting of legislation!
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para1"></a>I commend the amendment to the Committee. I entirely agree with the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, and my noble friend the Minister. I <P>


<a name="column_919"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 919</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>reaffirm what I said on Second Reading: that attempts to widen the Bill's scope could lead to difficulties in another place, and we might lose the essence of the Bill, which is a valuable and helpful reform of the law.
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para2"></a>I wonder whether the very fact of saying we should not widen the Bill's scope provides the answer to at least the first question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. He talked about the case of a husband, wife and son, with the son being the third named on the joint account. If the husband and wife were to die, he asked whether the son would benefit. Again, as a layman, I notice that the Bill's Long Title states:
<P>
<br>
<UL><FONT SIZE=2>"to secure the rights of second-named account holders".</UL><FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para3"></a>So it is difficult to see how someone who is a third-named or fourth-named holder could benefit. Again, that might be a layman's interpretation of the Bill. One relies upon my noble friend, who I hope will have received some expert advice on such questions, to be able to give an authoritative view to the Committee.
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para4"></a>I am grateful to my noble friend and to his advisers for giving legislative precision to what the Bill's sponsor in another place, my honourable friend Douglas French, and the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, were seeking to do, although this Bill goes a little further than did the Bill introduced by the noble Lord. At any rate, it is something we all agree should be done, and done quickly. I hope that it will be achieved.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-11_spnew1"></A><B> Lord Dubs: </B>   I listened with interest to the Minister's explanation. In fact, I listened with a great deal of relief because he clarified the complicated amendments&#151;so much so, that I am tempted to suggest that we might include his speech as a schedule to the Bill by way of explanation, because I suspect that in years to come people will look at the complexity of the amendments and wonder how we ever reached such drafting difficulties.
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para5"></a>I support the amendment; it is most welcome. I have only the reservation that as a piece of drafting it appears to be most inelegant. However, I fully understand the difficulties of the parliamentary draftsmen in producing the amendment. I suspect that the difficulty lies in the original wording of the Building Societies Act. Perhaps, to coin an old phrase, if we want to go where we want to be we would not have started where we were forced to start. We face the present difficulties because of the complicated drafting of the original Act and I am delighted that we are making progress.
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para6"></a>I have received many letters from people all over the country expressing the fervent wish that these proposals should become law as soon as possible. I am delighted that we are helping the legislation on its way.

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-11_spnew2"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, for his praise of my speech, implying that it might become a schedule to the Bill and that it had a degree of elegance that some legislative drafting lacks. I am advised that the rule in Pepper v. Hart deals with that matter and that one can take note of considered statements of Ministers from the Dispatch Box. I hope that what I now say will also be considered as the considered statement of a Minister from the Dispatch Box.
<P>


<a name="column_920"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 920</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para7"></a>I said on Second Reading that I should require considerable help from parliamentary counsel in order to get these clauses right. My noble friend Lord Hayhoe referred to that. I hope that all Members of the Committee will agree that I have received that considerable help. Certainly, I should not have been able to draft the clauses myself. I hope that all Members will accept that we have considered, and provided for, a reasonable range of possible situations within the scope of the Bill and that the position of key groups&#151;such as widows and the newly married&#151;will be safeguarded. But, as I emphasised earlier, while the amendments cannot deal with every possible anomaly, they will cure the great majority of the inequities that have been identified.
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para8"></a>Perhaps I may deal with the two points dreamt up by the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell. The first related to joint accounts of more than three people&#151;that is, mother, father and son, but the mother and father then died. I am advised that we cannot extend to them in this case simply because the Long Title of the Bill deals only with second-named account holders. Dealing with third and subsequent account holders would lie outside that and would add complications which, for the reasons I gave earlier, would not be welcome in this small Bill.
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para9"></a>The same is true in the case of the divorce settlement described by the noble Lord. The Bill does not address a series of different joint accounts and it would make it even more complex. Therefore, I hope that the noble Lord will accept that we cannot deal with that matter on this occasion.
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para10"></a>Perhaps I may deal generally with the question of further anomalies raised by the noble Lords, Lord Eatwell and Lord Dubs, on Second Reading and today. On Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, dealt with the difficulties faced by those who switch funds between, for example, share and deposit accounts. As I explained on Second Reading and today, that cannot be covered in this Bill because the Long Title deals only with the rights of second-named joint shareholders. Widening the Bill's scope would jeopardise its passage. I can tell both noble Lords that, as part of his wider review of the 1986 Act, my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Treasury has now proposed that in future all retail investors in building societies should be shareholding members. Legislation to bring this change about will be introduced as soon as an opportunity arises. Obviously, I can go no further than that. As regards other short Bills that may be introduced by noble Lords or Members of another place, I can say only that I am sure that my right honourable and honourable friends in Her Majesty's Treasury will give them the appropriate consideration.
<P>

<a name="50315-11_para11"></a>I hope that, having given the assurance about the review to be carried out by my honourable friend the Minister of State at the Treasury and that legislation will be brought forward to bring about the change to which I have referred, some of the problems described by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, will have been dealt with.

<a name="column_921"></a>

<B>15 Mar 1995 : Column 921</B></P>
<FONT SIZE=3>extraordinary and exceptional cases, which is why drafting becomes so difficult. Will the Minister ask his advisers and colleagues to consider between now and Report whether the reference to "second named" in the Long Title of the Bill is a slip? There is a confusion with respect to the notion of joint account holders. When something is jointly held, we tend to think of two people, but I understand that in the Building Societies Act the term "joint" applies to multiple holdings. Perhaps account can be taken of multiple holdings and we can refer to that on Report. It may be the case that one has naturally gone on to "second" because of the use of the word "joint".

<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315-11_spnew4"></A><B> Lord Henley: </B>   Perhaps I may refer that matter to those who advise me. I shall write to the noble Lord before the Report stage. If something can be done without jeopardising the Bill, I am prepared to consider <P>

<P>
<A NAME="50315w01_wqn0"></A><B> Lord Brougham and Vaux </B>  asked Her Majesty's Government:
<P>
<UL>How much ODA spent on contracted external professional services in 1992&#150;93 and 1993&#150;94; what types of services were provided; and how much expenditure related to (a) ODA's internal administration and (b) the aid programme.
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="50315w01_spmin0"></A><B>The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office   (Baroness Chalker of Wallasey): </B>  Total expenditure on contracted professional services for 1992&#150;93 and 1993&#150;94 was &#163;204 million and &#163;256 million respectively. Less than 1 per cent. of this related to consultancy advice to assist our internal management of the aid programme.

<A NAME="50315w01_spmin2"></A><B>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence   (Lord Henley): </B>  We have always said that with Trident we will continue our policy of deploying only the minimum nuclear capability necessary for deterrence purposes. Our nuclear forces make a continuing contribution to maintaining stability in Europe.

<A NAME="50315w01_spmin4"></A><B>The Minister of State, Scottish Office   (Lord Fraser of Carmyllie): </B>  There does not appear to be any decision of the Scottish courts in which they have held that the European Convention of Human Rights can or cannot be relied upon, in appropriate cases, as an aid to construction of domestic legislation. It is a matter for the Scottish courts, and ultimately for the House of Lords, to decide whether Scots law adopts the same rules of statutory interpretation which have been acknowledged to exist in an English case by the House of Lords.
