The Government set the Monetary Policy Committee&#146;s operational target and the fiscal rules. In addition, there is a regular exchange of information between the Treasury and the Bank of England.</p>

Is it not painfully obvious that giving the Bank of England independence and a target to control inflation with only short-term interest rates as a weapon cannot work unless fiscal policy is used as well? If we are to continue with the charade of the Governor having to write to the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say why he has failed, should there not also be letters to the Governor of the Bank of England from the Chancellor explaining why he has made the Governor&#146;s task impossible? Is not fiscal policy out of control, with massive increases in borrowing, subsequent to the Budget, due to changes in tax and expenditure policy? How much has borrowing increased above the amount projected at the time of the Budget, and will this be funded from the public, not the banks?</p>

Importantly, the Bank of England has the responsibility for inflation. That is very difficult task, given the pressure of world prices at present, and we will go through a period&#151;a short period&#151;in which inflation will be above the target rate. However, it is quite clear from our predictions and those of independent forecasters that in 2009 the policies being pursued will return inflation to within the framework, where it has been for a decade under this Government.</p>

Would it not be better and easier to co-ordinate fiscal and monetary policy if there were either a cut in public expenditure and/or a tax increase? I am not sure that that is what the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, or the Opposition Front Bench are suggesting, but no doubt they will tell us.</p>

The difference is that the British economy is almost uniquely well placed to meet this challenge. We start off with a low inflation rate. I note that one or two noble Lords opposite are regarding these comments with less than the approval I would seek. Let me make it clear that our inflation rates both now and predicted are below those in Germany, France and the United States, and historically, even at their highest, they are only half of what was the norm under the previous Administration in the 1980s.</p>

On their current policies, the Government are set to break their own fiscal rules. Do they intend to follow the advice of the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, by raising taxes or reducing expenditure elsewhere, or do they accept that they simply have to break the rules?</p>

He will have to wait to see what our solutions to these difficulties are. We will again look at these matters and comment further on them in the Pre-Budget Report, which is not asking the noble Lord to wait a great deal of time in parliamentary terms. There are challenges to the public finances at this stage, but the noble Lord will recognise the mass of contradictions that could emerge from all sides. One side will suggest, as he does, a substantial cut in government revenues, while the other will suggest that there are windfall benefits from the higher oil price. The Government will reach a judicious position in due course.</p>

He will be all too well aware of the extent to which the United States Government have been greatly concerned to increase liquidity for their banking structure as well. I recognise that the noble Lord is very much in favour of transparency &#151;probably more so when this Government are in office than when his own side might be. Let me emphasise on the issue of transparency that the concern is to preserve confidence in the banking structure when we all recognise that there are significant shocks both internally and externally. He will know the magnitude of the problems that the American economy is wrestling with. I am not sure that his preferred remedy of complete transparency meets the seriousness of the situation.</p>

The strength of the British economy means that the methods that we have to adopt will be considerably less drastic than they would be if we were operating with significant deficits and high unemployment. My noble friend will have to join the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and the whole House in awaiting the Pre-Budget Report, which is not too far distant.</p>

The Home Office, BERR and the Information Commissioner were not aware of the two tests conducted by BT, which was not good. I know that the Information Commissioner&#146;s Office and BERR are now investigating that very issue, which is very appropriate. Since then, BT has approached all three authorities about a trial with around 10,000 broadband subscribers.</p>

If it is not, we will need to think about how we will deal with it. I was aware that the Americans have an issue with it.

Providers are finding it difficult to make the profit margins they want and wish to charge advertisers more. They can do this by promising that they will target precise adverts to people. That is the driver to it. There are concerns about individual privacy and so on. The noble Baroness is right: it is a worldwide system. Internet service providers have access to such details, but they have to put safety measures in place; and that is what the ICO is meant to ensure happens.</p>

The much vaunted system of Criminal Records Bureau checks seems to have descended into farce and chaos.

Obviously our foremost priority is to help to protect children and vulnerable adults by assisting organisations in doing these checks. We understand all the difficulties and the effect that they can have on people but, over the past 12 months, 3.4 million record checks have been carried out, of which 680 were slightly wrong. There is a clear method for resolving disputes. Compared with the old system, where no one knew what was being said about them, one of the benefits of the new system is that people who had been refused jobs for years were suddenly able to find out, because they had sight of their record, the reason why they were being refused. They were able to challenge it and, on a couple of occasions, they have been able to resolve it. This has been a good move. On timescales, we would like to do better. I think that we are down to 21 days now rather than the figure that was quoted, but obviously we would like to make it less. Overall, however, what has been achieved has been very impressive.</p>

What is good is that we do this with no charge, as it is important to encourage and help people going voluntarily into a number of areas, such as the cadet forces. I do not have detailed answers on timescales and problems. I know that one of the problems with getting volunteers into this area is that some of them feel that the checks that are made on them are rather more than they feel that they should have when they are volunteering. That is a difficult issue, but we have to conduct these checks. I will get back to the noble Lord in writing on the specifics of timings and any details of exactly what we are doing on that.</p>

I think that the answer is probably yes. Of course there is a variation between standard disclosure and enhanced disclosure. For enhanced disclosure, where somebody is going to have personal one-on-one contact with a child or with someone who is vulnerable, we go into more detailed information with local police forces. That clearly takes longer, so the time does vary between cases.</p>

I referred to the cadet forces because I know about them. I have dealt with a lot of volunteers in these areas and I understand that sometimes they can feel a bit offended that they are being checked so carefully, but it is incumbent on us to make sure. We cannot put volunteers in these positions if there is a risk of them being a danger to people. It is difficult, but we have to do it. I understand from both sides what the issue is.

This got distorted somehow over the weekend. It is not something that we would do. It would be extremely counterproductive and might lead to rather more violence. It would not be a good thing to do. However, in certain targeted ways, there is sometimes merit&#151;depending on the person involved; let us say that he is under 16 and has not actually used the weapon&#151;in the person being able to talk to people who are experts on these things so that he can see what the impact is when a knife is used. There is a benefit in that in some cases. It is part of a whole package of measures. One noble Baroness asked why we did not put them in a mortuary and padlock them to the body overnight. That is probably more than we need to do, but we need to consider all possibilities, some of which may fade away and some of which will be of great use.</p>

This has to involve all the groups that the right reverend Prelate talked about, and although I cannot easily say exactly how that will be done, it is the intention.

Although the amendment refers specifically only to the needs of older and disabled people, I am sure that by catering for the needs of these groups, everyone will benefit. We will be looking to the sorts of design that will enable, for example, young families to enjoy easier access with their buggies, and will aid those with short-term health conditions. The whole community will benefit.

<p><a name="stpa_7"></a><a name="08071786000075"></a>This amendment, which addresses the needs of the elderly so usefully, encourages us to think that the Government will indeed achieve their targets of ensuring that publicly funded housing matches lifetime home standards by 2011, and that they are serious about the target to ensure that those standards are attained with new developments in the private housing market by 2013. However, that will undoubtedly be much more difficult. I was pleased that the Minister insisted, in her letter, that she would expect the HCA to use its leverage on the private and public sectors. How will the issue of minimum space standards, which some of the relevant agencies and professional bodies are examining, intertwine with the question of achieving lifetime home standards?</p>

<a name="80717-0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_8"></a><a name="08071786000076"></a>Will the Minister also comment on building regulations? In her letter, she mentioned that the current review of those is focused on reducing burdens and costs on businesses. That is, indeed, a good thing: we do not want businesses to be faced with any unnecessary burdens and costs, but in building homes we also need to be focused on the needs of those who will dwell in them. Will she confirm that that review is intended to ensure that building regulations themselves support good design?</p>

<a name="80717-0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_9"></a><a name="08071786000077"></a>Where the needs of disabled people are concerned, ensuring that new build matches the best design standards is one thing; ensuring that we are able to refurbish or adapt existing homes to make their design appropriate for disabled people is much more difficult. The Minister has told us how the requirement on local authorities to provide match funding of 40 per cent for disabled facilities grants has been relaxed, and expressed optimism that local authorities would none the less continue to prioritise adaptation of homes in their communities. She argued that they would, rationally, realise that they would be saving costs on social services budgets and other budgets. Yet we cannot always be entirely confident either that local authorities will act rationally and far-sightedly or that they will, by any means, have the resources to do all that a rational and far-sighted authority would want. Will she assure us again that

<a name="80717-0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_10"></a><a name="08071786000078"></a>Disabled facilities grants are, of course, only part of the story, as the Minister&#146;s letter reminded us. Will she ensure that an adequate share of the &#163;1 billion in the regional housing pot is indeed made available for adaptations, and move to clarify the respective responsibilities for disabled facilities grants of housing associations and local authorities? I ask my litany of questions again only because it is extremely important&#151;and I know that the Minister agrees with me here&#151;that we push these good intentions through into a really worthwhile, practical reality. I have no doubt whatsoever that my noble friend is determined that we should.</p>

I hope that it means that the Homes and Communities Agency will be able to lend its support not just to hastening us towards the day when the lifetime home standards of accessibility and adaptability can be applied to all private homes as well as to housing association homes, but that that powerful HCA may be able to play its part in ensuring that building regulations are actually enforced as well as simply being amended to good effect. I greatly welcome and appreciate this amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_11"></a><a name="08071786000081"></a>In response to the detailed questions from the noble Lord, I am afraid that our correspondence is not yet over. Space standards are a complex issue; he will understand that. The ebb and flow of space standards and regulation go back over many years, and that is not something I can address at the Dispatch Box. I will update him in a letter on how we are thinking about it with regard to all these other things.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"></a><a name="08071786000082"></a>We have to strike a balance between simplifying building regulations&#151;making them easier to enforce, frankly&#151;and updating them. With regard to lifetime homes we are working with a team&#151;a BRAC review, in fact&#151;on considering building regulations and how they might accommodate different changes. The noble Lord is quite right when he talks about our ambition that all housing should meet lifetime homes standards by 2013. That is assisted by the changes we have made in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_13"></a><a name="08071786000083"></a>On the noble Lord&#146;s specific questions about the disabled facilities grant, I think removing the 40:60 split is a positive move because it will give extra flexibility to local authorities to borrow across funding and policy boundaries. It is a mandatory grant. I have worked with local authorities; I go out sometimes with the DFG teams to see how these adaptations are being designed and implemented, and I know the seriousness with which those local authorities look at the need for DFG. They will make good use of that flexibility.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="08071786000084"></a>We will be vigilant in ensuring that we secure, in a tight spending round, a significant increase for the disabled facilities grant. In our ageing strategy we

It is one of the best things we do to help keep people independent in their own homes. I assure the noble Lord of my commitment to that.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="08071786000085"></a>All that will be assisted by our debates. When it comes to the regional housing pot, we advise the regions that they must care for these particular priorities of vulnerable people.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5"></a><a name="08071786000308"></a> Clause 2, page 2, line 34, leave out &#147;section&#148; and insert &#147;sections 19(4A) (financial assistance), 44 (local government involvement) and&#148;</p>
</ul>
<a name="80717-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="08071786000088"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this group of amendments covers a number of different issues. I will start with Amendment No. 2 because I hope it will bring particular joy&#151;I put it as highly as that&#151;to the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, who was anxious that, having achieved the serious ambition to flag up the partnership, the principle and the psychology of a relationship with local authorities, we should put it in a place in the Bill where everyone would see it. Unfortunately, because of the logic of the architecture, it is stuck at Clause 44. However, the creativity of my officials knows no bounds, and they came up with a linking mechanism: Amendment No. 2 amends Clause 2, which will draw attention to Clause 44&#151;so it is right at the front of the Bill. Any reader of the Bill will understand that the clauses that are mentioned, including Clause 44, relate to the objects of the agency and give them added prominence.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="08071786000089"></a>The amendment also draws attention to new subsection (4)(a) to Clause 19, concerning financial assistance. We shall discuss that amendment in more depth shortly. A reference to that appears here, as a new subsection could modify the objects of the agency in certain limited circumstances relating to the provision of financial assistance.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="08071786000090"></a>Although there are more than five amendments here, they cover five separate issues that were raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, to which we have given further consideration. On the first set of issues, I still dispute the noble Baroness&#146;s assertion that the Secretary of State&#146;s powers to designate an area and confer planning functions upon it are now centre stage in the Government&#146;s proposals for the HCA. We have had many debates about the relative prominence of the designation powers. They are no more central to our plans for the HCA than they were for English Partnerships, and the noble Baroness herself described them as being there in the background for that organisation. However, I have accepted her reasoning that any situation in which such powers are likely to be used will be capable of being analysed, broken down, defined and articulated, and their relative purpose and functions and the kinds of development could and would be spelt out in a designation order. I have tabled Amendments Nos. 3 to 9 to reflect that.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1333"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1333</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80717-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="08071786000091"></a>Amendments Nos. 3 to 7 restrict the ability of the Secretary of State to determine that the HCA should be the local planning authority for all permitted purposes under the Act, for all kinds of development, and in respect of all relevant functions. The amendments restrict the Secretary of State from making the blanket statement that all should apply.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="08071786000092"></a>It would still be open to the Secretary of State to provide that, for example, the HCA should be the local planning authority for all permitted purposes, but she could do so only by an explicit reference to each permitted purpose. The changes made at Report ensure that these are properly consulted on&#151;that is in the Bill&#151;and that the Secretary of State&#146;s thinking is clear and understood for each case. I am content with that because the noble Baroness persuaded me&#151;she is very persuasive&#151;that this is a useful provision. It may make the act of designating an area somewhat more complex, but we have repeatedly said that this will be an exceptional occurrence. Much debate has focused on the ability to confer plan-making powers on the HCA. This amendment ensures that, should we ever propose to do so, full and fair consideration will be given to each of the powers transferred to the HCA.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_22"></a><a name="08071786000093"></a>As regards the second issue, Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 also respond to the noble Baroness&#146;s concerns. Amendment No. 8 provides that where the HCA has powers and functions conferred on it in relation to permitted purposes and kinds of development, enactments relating to local planning authorities and functions will apply to it. The amendment will remove the power to disapply any enactment. Amendment No. 9 removes the ability of the Secretary of State to amend definitions of &#147;planning related provisions&#148; or &#147;relevant functions&#148; in relation to the HCA.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_23"></a><a name="08071786000094"></a>In respect of Amendments Nos. 8 and 9, on Report the noble Baroness argued that Sections 14(6) and 14(8) were a step too far in relation to recognising the unusual circumstances of the HCA becoming a planning authority. She stated that applying enactments and modifying them to reflect particular circumstances might be acceptable, but that disapplying them was of a different order and therefore excessive, and that any consequential amendments should be made by the appropriate primary legislative vehicle. On reflection, we think that making these amendments will be compatible with our overall premise that the HCA as a planning authority should not be especially advantaged or disadvantaged when exercising the role, so I am happy to bring them forward, and consider that they are proportionate.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="08071786000095"></a>As regards the third issue, the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, asked whether sufficient parliamentary scrutiny would be afforded to any designation order by the negative resolution procedure. As noble Lords know, Clauses 13 and 14 in this Bill were initially modelled on the similar provisions in the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Act. Section 170 of that Act stated that a designation order,</p>
<ul><a name="08071786000370"></a>&#147;shall be made by statutory instrument which shall be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament&#148;.</ul>



<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1334"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1334</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<p><a name="08071786000293"></a>Because of those origins, and in the interests of consistency, we felt it was appropriate that the same parliamentary procedure should be used to make any designation orders under the powers in this Bill. However, having thought about the exceptional nature of the case if there were to be a designation order, I believe she is right that we should justify each order on those rare occasions that we make them. Therefore, Amendments Nos. 16 and 19 require any order to be made by the affirmative procedure.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="08071786000096"></a>On the fourth issue, in Amendment No. 18 we have also sought to prevent any designation order from being treated as a hybrid instrument. The potential for hybridity arises from the fact that designating an area and conferring planning functions on the HCA, although of general interest, would have the potential to affect the interests of specific individuals and organisations. If a designation order were to be subject to the hybrid procedure, this could add significant delay to any designation. It is, for example, possible to petition against hybrid instruments. Accepted petitions are considered by a Select Committee. We did not want to make that additional complication. We also thought that delays would be unwarranted because we made explicit and extensive changes to the consultation procedures. Those requirements are now in the Bill. We hope that we have dealt with that.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="08071786000097"></a>Finally, on Amendment No. 21, the noble Baroness spotted that this important area had not been previously covered in our legislation. It was always our intention that the HCA, when exercising functions conferred in a designation order, would be under the same requirements as any local planning authority in giving access to papers and meetings. Yet that was not provided, hence the amendment. This means that, in the event of an HCA acting as a local planning authority, its meetings would be open to the public, in the same way as for the local planning authority normally.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="08071786000098"></a>I hope that the noble Baroness will feel she has made a significant difference to the Bill in these respects. I am pleased to move these amendments and think they improve the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

I am grateful to her not just for bringing forward the amendments but also for her willingness to discuss the issues.

<p><a name="stpa_28"></a><a name="08071786000100"></a>I can hardly object to most of these amendments. They are in language I used at the last stage, though I would never have spotted the hybridity point. My only comment, as the noble Baroness anticipated, is on the amendment to apply the arrangements for local government access to information and meetings. When I moved an amendment that was one or two lines

<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="08071786000115"></a>Amendments Nos. 10 and 12 will ensure that the HCA deals with a limited but important set of circumstances relating to Welsh tenants of English registered social landlords. Certain elements of housing legislation follow the location of the registered landlord rather than the property and, with the objects of the HCA related firmly to England, there are a few places where this can cause cross-boundary difficulties.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="08071786000116"></a>As an example, Section 450A of the Housing Act 1985 provides that where a tenant of a registered social landlord has exercised the right to buy, they have a right to a loan in respect of service charges. Currently, this means that the Housing Corporation would have a duty to give a loan to a Welsh tenant of an RSL registered in England. Logically, the position after this Bill becomes an Act would be that the duty to provide a loan will pass to the HCA. However, the HCA&#146;s objects are strictly limited to England and to the needs of people living in England. Giving such a loan might therefore require the agency to act outside of its objects.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="08071786000117"></a>These are rare occurrences&#151;there have been only 20 or so loans in both England and Wales combined in the past 16 years&#151;and we do not expect this provision to have any great effect. However, we do not want to remove rights that tenants currently enjoy, particularly in times when loans may be becoming increasingly difficult to obtain. These amendments will ensure that in some very rare cross-boundary cases, the HCA will be able to act to assist Welsh tenants of English RSLs.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="08071786000118"></a>I turn to perhaps the more important amendment in this group, Amendment No. 11. This is a direct response to the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, in Grand Committee and at Report about Clause 30, which relates to the HCA&#146;s ability to provide community services. She rightly raised concerns about the ambiguity of some of the language in this clause. Our amendment will delete the &#147;list&#148; of activities that caused concern and replace it with a new clause, which gives a general power to the HCA to provide such services for communities as it considers appropriate or facilitate the provision of those services. This is largely based on an excellent suggestion put forward by the noble Baroness in an amendment at Report.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="08071786000119"></a>I now turn to Amendments Nos. 23 and 24, which are minor and technical amendments to Schedule 11 and which deal with tolerated trespassers. They amend the definition of &#147;commencement date&#148; in paragraphs 14 and 25. The effect is to exclude from the definition the order-making powers in Part 2 of Schedule 11. These amendments are necessary to allow for the order-making powers to be exercised before the main tolerated trespasser provisions in Schedule 11 are brought into force.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1337"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1337</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80717-0003.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="08071786000120"></a>There is one important instance where it will be necessary to do this. The main provisions in Part 2 restore tenancies on commencement to all tolerated trespassers where the landlord has not changed since they became tolerated. On Report, we introduced an order-making power that allows us to restore tenancies in the same way to those tolerated trespassers whose landlord has changed. This will be done by secondary legislation, rather than by the Bill, since we propose to consult on the issue before final decisions are made. However, our intention is that the secondary legislation would come into force at the same time as commencement of the tolerated trespasser provisions in the Bill. To do otherwise would leave a period when there was only one class of tolerated trespassers. The House will accept that this would be unsatisfactory and unfair. We therefore need to exercise the order-making power before the rest of the provisions come into force. This amendment ensures that we can do that.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="08071786000121"></a>Finally, I look in more detail at Amendments Nos. 22 and 25, which are very minor. Amendment No. 22 amends Schedule 5 to the Housing Act 1985. It ensures that financial assistance to a housing association given under Clause 19 of the Bill will not cause the right to buy to arise in respect of property it owns. Amendment No. 25 is an extremely minor amendment. Noble Lords may be aware that Schedule 9(10)(3) already provides for the repeal of Section 10(2)(e) of the Housing Associations Act 1985. This section of the Act deals with exceptions to the requirement for unregistered housing associations to obtain the Housing Corporation&#146;s consent to dispose of grant-aided land. Amendment No. 25 merely adds the reference to Schedule 16, which lists all the repeals of existing legislation that are made by this Bill.</p>

<a name="80717-0003.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="08071786000122"></a>I hope that these amendments will find your Lordships&#146; favour, and in particular the favour of the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who I think has much to be delighted with. I beg to move.</p>

</ul>&#147;(ca) a community land trust which owns land in England,&#148;
<a name="80717-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_53"></a><a name="08071786000133"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are an important move forward in defining community land trusts as English bodies in Part 2 of the Bill. I am sure that later generations of students of <I>Hansard</I><I></I>will be able to decipher what that means with ease. However, to assist them, I will take us through the story.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="08071786000134"></a>The Government have been clear from the outset that we are committed to helping the development of community land trusts that are well managed and financially robust. We have supported 14 pilot projects across the country through the Housing Corporation, which has also offered funding to community land trusts to deliver affordable housing for both sale and rent. In April, we also committed to consulting on how barriers to the development of community land trusts could be removed. At that stage, the intention was to consult on whether there should be a legal definition of &#147;community land trusts&#148;. However, in view of the concerns raised by Members of your Lordships&#146; House, and the support for taking advantage of this opportunity, we have brought forward this amendment to give a definition of community land trusts. It is accepted by the community land trust movement that a legal definition would bring clarity and certainty to stakeholders and partners about the nature of the CLT sector.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="08071786000135"></a>In drafting the amendment, we have worked closely with the community land trust movement. We have gone for a broad definition, which captures the aims and distinctive characteristics of the community land trust sector. In particular, we have tried to ensure that the definition is robust enough to ensure that community-led projects benefit the wider community in the community land trust&#146;s area.</p>
<a name="time_6"></a>
<a name="80717-0004.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="08071786000385"></a>12.15 pm</h5>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="08071786000136"></a>The definition does not of itself bring access to funding or support, nor does it set in stone government policy about how this sector can best develop or about the framework within which that should happen. As I said last week, we would have preferred to wait until after our planned consultation this year to give all stakeholders the opportunity to contribute to the debate, including on some of these wider issues.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="08071786000137"></a>However, in taking forward the CLT debate, we will want to consider some important questions, such as what the criteria for financial support might be and how to maximise the chances of the development of a viable and well managed sector. Another factor in the debate is that the regulator will need to consider the criteria for the registration of community land trusts. We will also wish to consider the role that the trusts might play in both the urban and rural contexts and how perpetuity of community benefit can be ensured for the benefit of future generations. There is still much work to be done.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="08071786000138"></a>We have a consensus that community land trusts offer potential for communities to put their weight and energy behind housing development. In Committee

I hope that we can draw a line under where we have got to at present and that noble Lords will continue to support the Government in their efforts to transform the innovative ideas and exciting prospects and opportunities of the community land trust movement into practical results. I look forward to support for the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_64"></a>
<a name="08071786000139"></a><a name="80717-0004.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80717-0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08071786000670"></a>Lord Graham of Edmonton:</b> My Lords, I rise with deep gratitude to my noble friend Lady Andrews, and especially to her advisers, for having listened, reflected and produced an answer to the basic issue, which was the need for a definition. That gratitude is unalloyed; it is clear and I am very grateful indeed. The Minister has demonstrated over recent weeks that she listens carefully and that, when there is a proposition that needs her reflection and advice, she takes it away. Today, we have the product of that. I warmly congratulate her and her colleagues.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_59"></a><a name="08071786000140"></a>As with everything else, there is a &#147;but&#148;, an &#147;if&#148; and an &#147;if only&#148;. I understand that the amendments are as far as the department and the Minister can go. I echo the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, who said some minutes ago that she knew how far she could go and that this was it. I accept the same; there is no question of muddying the water. We have gone as far as we can go.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="08071786000141"></a>However, there has been intense discussion, particularly about defining who should be members of the trust. Amendment No. 14 defines a local community as,</p>
<ul><a name="08071786000371"></a>&#147;the individuals who live or work, or want to live or work, in a specific area&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071786000294"></a>There is no objection to that, but everyone understands that a community is more than individuals; a range of other bodies is part of the community. I want the Minister to reflect on that and, I hope, to say that she and her advisers share my understanding. When amendments refer to &#147;members&#148; and &#147;individuals&#148;, there may well be a legal reason for those words&#151;I do not quibble with that&#151;but how wide should the interpretation of those terms be? For instance, a community includes voluntary organisations, parish councils, local councils, civic society organisations, schools, local health service organisations, key local employers and local shops. I understand the difficulty in putting something in the Bill that is all-embracing, so I seek an understanding that, when a trust is established, the beneficiaries from the product of the trust&#146;s work can include the examples that I have given. I simply want an understanding.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="08071786000142"></a>Perhaps I may help the Minister with the following illustration as a practical example. The local community land trust for one of the 14 national pilot projects supported by the Government is on the former Cashes Green Hospital site in David Drew&#146;s constituency in Stroud, Gloucestershire. He is a personal friend and is sponsored by the Co-operative movement, in which I declare an interest. The CLT would like to encourage a local GP to provide health services to the village of Cashes Green by using some of its land to facilitate the provision of a health centre. Although it is part of the National Health Service, a GP practice is technically a privately run business owned by the doctors who are partners in the practice. Another local community  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1340"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1340</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>land trust might want to provide premises for a local shop that is also run as a commercial enterprise. Such uses of a CLT&#146;s assets benefit,</p>
<ul><a name="08071786000372"></a>&#147;individuals who live or work, or want to live or work, in a specified area&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08071786000295"></a>but that is an indirect, rather than a direct, benefit.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="08071786000143"></a>I am not nitpicking and I am not being too pedantic, but such provision would enormously put the icing on the cake of what we have achieved. The main benefit of a CLT, as the Minister knows, is,</p>
<ul><a name="08071786000373"></a>&#147;furthering the social, economic and environmental interests of a local community&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08071786000296"></a>through working with or benefiting organisations,</p>
<ul><a name="08071786000374"></a>&#147;by acquiring and managing land and other assets&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071786000297"></a>It would be satisfactory if my noble friend were able to say&#151;I am not putting words into his mouth&#151;that his understanding is that the bodies that I have listed could be embraced by that definition.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="08071786000144"></a>I take this last opportunity to thank Members of all parties around the House. The Minister took on board the fact that this was not a party matter but a House matter, a housing matter and a community matter, which has been reflected in the Minister&#146;s willingness to act. I am grateful for what has been achieved and, with the possibility of clarification, I am delighted with the amendments.</p>

I am pleased about that. Like the noble Lord, I am a firm &#147;co-operator&#148; and I suppose that I should declare that interest. I see the establishment of community land trusts as an important part of that movement.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="08071786000146"></a>The noble Lord seeks some clarification. It comes down to this: how can the community land trust use its assets and make use of its profits and surplus and, in doing so, how can it benefit community organisations, even if such organisations have a private interest as well? Of course local people can be members of the community land trust, but that does not mean that only local people are eligible for membership. Others may become members, which will depend very much on how the community land trust defines its own rules of governance. These rules of governance can extend to cover local organisations&#151;those listed by my noble friend would certainly be covered. As long as there is a benefit to those individuals who are members, I do not think that there will be a difficulty with the understanding that my noble friend has. That is certainly how we envisaged it working when we came back with this definition.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="08071786000147"></a>I hope that that helps my noble friend Lord Graham. It is certainly intended to. This will enable community land trusts to have that broader social community role that noble Lords have argued for in our debates. I hope that we can agree to the amendments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="08071786000153"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I agreed on Report that we should table an enabling power to allow us to deliver the provisions necessary to support cross-domain regulation through secondary legislation. We had a wide-ranging debate on this at every stage of the Bill, and given the widespread support across the House for doing it in this way, our offer was well received. I am very pleased about that.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="08071786000154"></a>As I pointed out in the debate, we need a broad power that is flexible enough to allow us to make the necessary changes to legislation. It would be extremely unfortunate, as I think everyone would agree, if we were to forgo the opportunity of a Bill in the next Session only to find that we had drafted an enabling power too tightly to allow us to proceed as we ideally would. We would very much regret that, and I believe that the House is happy with the breadth of the amendment.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="08071786000155"></a>That is why we seek to introduce a power that allows the Secretary of State to amend or modify as necessary or desirable Part 2 of this Bill or any other relevant legislation so as to enable the Tenant Services Authority to regulate local authorities. I have not sensed a significant degree of concern at taking this broad approach. I trust that the enthusiastic support is such that noble Lords certainly accept that it is fit for purpose.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="08071786000156"></a>In taking a broad power, our intention is that it would be used sensibly and only where there is a clear rationale for making a change in support of effective cross-domain regulation. I have already committed to offering a full public consultation on regulations made under the power, which is obviously right. The work of the Cole advisory panel has shown that much can be achieved from engaging in an open and inclusive process. Everyone around the House has paid tribute to the work of Professor Ian Cole. In our eagerness to consult in terms of ongoing dialogue and a more formal consultative process I hope that we will satisfy those noble Lords, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Dixon-Smith, who had expressed a preference for super-affirmative procedures.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_72"></a><a name="08071786000157"></a>The enabling clause is fairly simple. In addition to allowing us to amend, modify or not apply any piece of legislation as required, it also allows for the registration of local authorities. It allows the Secretary of State to register, by order, a specified local authority or a class of authority. In so doing, the order may make provision about how the registration should operate; that is, the process on which we will consult as part of the wider regulations.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_73"></a><a name="08071786000158"></a>Having debated the complex nature of these regulations, it is something of an anti-climax to be discussing a clause which is rather simple in its description. We can now make a welcome shift to considering the substance rather than the process of delivering a cross-domain regulator, and to doing those things that will meet the social concerns recognised by the noble Lord, Lord

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_74"></a><a name="08071786000159"></a>This is the last group of amendments and very kind things have been said about my ability to find time in my diary for meetings. It has been a great pleasure to work with noble Lords across the House and not just a necessity. I believe that we should have an open process and debate on this Bill. It was a good Bill when we introduced it, but it is much better now, which is to the huge credit of noble Lords who have taken part. It would be invidious to single out anyone, but I have been gratified to have the authority and support of my noble friends Lady Ford and Lady Dean on my side, as well as the assiduous nagging of my noble friends Lord Howarth, Lord Graham and Lady Whitaker. They have put in sterling work, as have my noble friends Lord Filkin and Lady Jones.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_75"></a><a name="08071786000160"></a>I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Best, who has been a real sheepdog on the Bill and has ensured that we have made the position of the tenant very clear. He has played an excellent role, as have noble Lords on both Front Benches. The noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, has kept us up to the mark on the management of the Bill. On behalf of all noble Lords, I thank the Bill team for their extraordinary talent. They have been exceptional in their creativity as well as in their assiduous response to the will of this House, which was shown in the expert way in which they have come back with voluminous correspondence and the sensitive way in which they have interpreted what the House has wanted. With that, I hope that we can bless the Bill in its form. I beg to move.</p>

I also thank all colleagues on all Benches in supporting a potentially lonely Cross-Bencher who alone can do very little. I know that this amendment will be much appreciated by the organisations representing tenants and landlords, including the Local Government Association, the Chartered Institute of Housing, the National Federation of ALMOs, the Tenant Participation Advisory Service and the National Consumer Council. It means that council tenants can enjoy the same protections and support from the regulator as housing association tenants without the need for another Act of Parliament. It will prevent anomalies and complexities as tenants move between council housing and housing association homes. All will have a similar service. It will ensure that council tenants will not be treated as second-class citizens. It will also enable the new Tenant Services Authority to establish a coherent culture, as the noble Baroness has said, to recruit a board and to engage staff on the basis of certainty that 4 million, not 2 million, tenants will be covered without waiting for a new Bill.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="08071786000162"></a>If the Minister could give an idea of timetabling for consultation and action in taking forward the extension of the Tenant Services Authority&#146;s role to cover council tenants, that would be appreciated. But that can await another day. I know that things will move forward as expeditiously as possible. I thank the Minister for this amendment, which I heartily support.</p>

I, too, should like to add my thanks.</p>

<a name="80717-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="08071786000165"></a>I apologise for lowering the tone, but I have a question. Under the new clause proposed in Amendment No. 15, subsection (2) allows registration of,</p>
<ul><a name="08071786000375"></a>&#147;a specified local authority, or ... a specified class of local authority&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071786000298"></a>That puzzles me. I had not anticipated that it might be necessary to differentiate between authorities. I gave the noble Baroness almost no notice of this question and I do not know whether she is able to explain why that is necessary.</p>

We have yet to publish Professor Cole&#146;s report, but, given that it has been circulated, I am not breaking any confidences in relating that it will recommend that only those local authorities which own stock should be subject to consultation. Specifying the local authorities gives us flexibility. The clause allows us to register such a class and gives us the ability to specify a particular authority. We will of course have to consult on this, along with the way in which we propose to handle registration of local authorities, when we bring forward draft regulations.</p>

I need to add my thanks, first, to everyone in the House who has taken part in this Bill. There is no question that the Bill will leave this House in a far better state than it arrived, which is the result of the work of so many people besides ourselves. I owe thanks to all those who have briefed us. They sometimes swamp us with information, but, as a consequence of that, we are much better informed when we study these Bills and are able to bring improvements forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="08071786000168"></a>I am particularly grateful to the noble Baroness who has been remarkably resistant to change and yet remarkably flexible at the same time, which is quite an achievement. If I have one regret, I have one only. The Bill was 32 pages longer this morning than when it arrived here. As a result of this morning&#146;s work, it is probably 35 pages longer. Those out in the field who have to study the Bill in order to work will have to dig even further and mine even longer shafts in order to receive the nuggets they need on which their work is based.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_89"></a><a name="08071786000185"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, the international terrorist threat to the United Kingdom and its interests abroad, and to our international partners, remains severe and sustained. The Government are determined to do all they can to minimise the threat, including using proscription to prevent terrorist organisations from operating in the United Kingdom by inviting support, raising funds or otherwise furthering their objectives.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_90"></a><a name="08071786000186"></a>The purpose of the order, if this House and the other place so approve, is to add to the list of 45 international terrorist organisations that are already proscribed. We propose to do so by substituting the existing proscription of the Hezbollah External Security Organisation with a new listing covering its entire military wing. This is the seventh proscription order made under the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="08071786000187"></a>Section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2000 provides a power for the Home Secretary to proscribe an organisation if she believes it is concerned in terrorism. This is achieved by adding the organisation to Schedule 2 to the Terrorism Act 2000, which lists the proscribed terrorist organisations. The Act specifies that an organisation is concerned in terrorism if it: commits or participates in acts of terrorism; prepares for terrorism; promotes or encourages terrorism, including the unlawful glorification of terrorism; or is otherwise concerned in terrorism.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="08071786000188"></a>The Home Secretary may proscribe an organisation only if she believes it is concerned in terrorism. If the test is met, she may then exercise her discretion to proscribe the organisation. When considering whether to exercise this discretion, a number of factors are taken into account, which were first announced to Parliament in 2001. They are: the nature and scale of an organisation&#146;s activities; the specific threat that it poses to the United Kingdom; the specific threat that it poses to British nationals overseas; the organisation&#146;s presence in the United Kingdom; and the need to support other members of the international community in tackling terrorism.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="08071786000189"></a>Proscription is a tough but necessary power, and its effect is that the proscribed organisation is outlawed and is unable to operate in the United Kingdom. The consequence of proscription is that specific criminal offences apply in relation to a proscribed organisation. These include membership of the organisation, the provision of various forms of support, including organising or addressing a meeting, and wearing or displaying an article indicating membership of the organisation. Further criminal offences exist in relation to fundraising and various uses of money and property for the purposes of terrorism.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="08071786000190"></a>Given the wide-ranging impact of proscription, the Home Secretary exercises her power to proscribe an organisation only after thoroughly reviewing all the available relevant information on it. This includes open-source material as well as intelligence material, legal advice and advice reflecting consultations across government, including with the intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Decisions on proscription are taken with great care by the Home Secretary, and it is also right that both Houses must consider the case for proscribing new organisations.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="08071786000191"></a>The Hezbollah External Security Organisation, a unit of the military wing, was proscribed in 2001 because of its involvement in terrorism outside Lebanon. We now have evidence that further parts of the organisation are directly concerned in terrorism, and this is why the entire military wing, including the External Security Organisation, is specified in this order. I am sure that noble Lords will appreciate that I am limited in what I can say about the evidence in support of this belief, as much of it is intelligence material and of a sensitive nature. I can, however, say unequivocally that Hezbollah&#146;s military wing is providing active support to Shia militant groups in Iraq, including Jaish al-Mahdi (JAM), which has been responsible for attacks on both Iraqi civilians and coalition forces. This includes providing training in the use of deadly, explosively formed projectiles used in roadside bombs.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="08071786000192"></a>Although I am unable to go into the detail of the evidence, I can inform noble Lords that Hezbollah&#146;s support for insurgent groups in Iraq was confirmed when coalition forces captured a senior Hezbollah operative, Ali Musa Daqduq, in Iraq on 20 March 2007. Daqduq is a Lebanese national who served for 24 years in Hezbollah. In 2005, he was directed by senior Lebanese Hezbollah military commanders to train Shia groups in Iraq. Hezbollah&#146;s military wing is also providing support to Palestinian rejectionist groups in the occupied Palestinian territories, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="08071786000193"></a>The proscription of Hezbollah&#146;s military wing will contribute to making the United Kingdom a hostile environment for terrorists and their supporters. It will signal our condemnation of the support that Hezbollah provides to those who attack British and other coalition forces in Iraq, as well as Iraqi civilians. It will support our international partners in disrupting terrorist activity in the occupied Palestinian territories, and it will also send a strong message that the United Kingdom is not willing to tolerate terrorism either here or anywhere else in the world.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="08071786000194"></a>Noble Lords will be aware that, alongside its military operations, Hezbollah performs a legitimate political, social and humanitarian role in Lebanon. Proscription is not targeted at, and will not affect, these legitimate activities, but it sends a clear message that we condemn Hezbollah&#146;s violence and support for terrorism. We continue to call on Hezbollah to end terrorist activity, abandon its status as an armed group and participate in the democratic process on the same terms as other Lebanese political parties.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="08071786000195"></a>As a final point, I have already said that the Government recognise that proscription is a tough power that can have a wide-ranging impact. Because of this, there is an appeal mechanism in the legislation. Any organisation that is proscribed, or anyone affected by the proscription of an organisation, can apply to the Home Secretary for the organisation to be deproscribed. If this is refused, the applicant can appeal to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission, POAC, a special tribunal which reviews whether the Home Secretary has properly exercised her powers to refuse to deproscribe the organisation. POAC is able to consider the sensitive material that often underpins proscription decisions, and a special advocate can be appointed to represent the interests of the applicant in closed sessions of the commission.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="08071786000196"></a>Given the evidence of the military wing of Hezbollah&#146;s direct support for terrorism in Iraq and the occupied Palestinian territories, it is right that we extend the existing proscription of the External Security Organisation to cover Hezbollah&#146;s entire military wing. I commend the order to the House. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="08071786000200"></a>On 2 July, the Government laid before Parliament this order seeking to proscribe the military wing of Hezbollah in its entirety, including the jihad council and all units reporting to it. If the order is approved by Parliament, it will be a criminal offence to belong to, fundraise and encourage support for the military wing of the organisation.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="08071786000201"></a>The Explanatory Memorandum to the order states inter alia:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56"></a><a name="08071786000358"></a>&#147;Hizballah is actively involved in terrorist related activities. These activities include, but are not limited to, the provision of training and logistical and financial support to terrorist groups in Iraq and Palestine. The military wing of Hizballah is involved in supporting Shia insurgent groups in Iraq to carry out attacks, including against Coalition forces&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071786000300"></a>During Prime Minister&#146;s Questions on 2 July, the right honourable gentleman the Prime Minister told the House:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57"></a><a name="08071786000359"></a>&#147;To help bring about more general peace in the Middle East, we have been considering what we can do. We have today laid an order before Parliament extending proscription to cover Hezbollah&#146;s entire military wing, solely on the grounds of new evidence of its involvement in terrorism in Iraq and the occupied Palestinian territories. Proscription will not affect Hezbollah&#146;s legitimate political and social wings, but we continue to call on Hezbollah to end its status as an armed group, to participate in the Lebanese democratic process, and to do so on the same terms as other political parties&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 2/7/08; col. 860.]</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="08071786000202"></a>The Government have emphasised that this order will not affect Hezbollah&#146;s political, social and humanitarian activities. Introducing the order, the Home Office Minister, the right honourable Tony McNulty, said that proscription of Hezbollah&#146;s military wing would not affect the legitimate political, social and humanitarian role Hezbollah plays in the Lebanon but would send out a clear message that the Government condemn Hezbollah&#146;s violence and support for terrorism.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="08071786000203"></a>With respect to that observation, can the Minister explain how this distinction will work in practice? Can the group be simultaneously legitimate and a terrorist organisation? This suggests two entirely separate wings of Hezbollah that operate independently from each other. Is the Minister confident that this is really the case? In particular, to what extent does Sheikh Nasrallah, Hezbollah&#146;s recognised leader and in overall charge of Hezbollah&#146;s military activities, have control over Hezbollah politicians within the Lebanese Cabinet?</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="08071786000204"></a>Will the United Kingdom seek the proscription of Hezbollah&#146;s military wing by the European Union? Does the Minister not agree that if the United Kingdom designation is to have any real effect, it needs to be extended to the Union as a whole?</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="08071786000205"></a>Does the Minister not agree that this move to ban the military wing must be linked to steps to achieve the group&#146;s disarmament, without which it will remain an unacceptable threat to Israel and to the security of the region?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="08071786000206"></a>What evidence does the Minister have of Hezbollah&#146;s fundraising activities in the United Kingdom, and if none, what measures are being taken to identify such  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1350"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1350</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>activity? The Government&#146;s measure falls short of proscribing the whole organisation. Will that not increase the risk of fundraising, supposedly for political and humanitarian purposes, being diverted to Hezbollah&#146;s military activities?</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="08071786000207"></a>In announcing the decision to proscribe the whole military wing of Hezbollah, the Prime Minister said the move was based,</p>
<ul><a name="08071786000377"></a>&#147;solely on the grounds of new evidence of its involvement in terrorism in Iraq and the occupied Palestinian territories&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 2/7/08; col. 860.]</ul>
<p><a name="08071786000301"></a>Does the reference to terrorism in Iraq include any specific threat to United Kingdom personnel?</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="08071786000208"></a>The proposed policy towards Hezbollah contrasts with the Government&#146;s approach towards the Tamil Tigers and the Kurdish PKK, both of which are fully proscribed. The right answer, surely, is for the order to impose a complete ban on Hezbollah in the United Kingdom; otherwise, it will continue to be able to raise funds which, and recruit members who, can then be diverted for terrorist purposes.</p>

We have spent many years, all of us involved in United Kingdom politics, accepting the rather artificial distinction between Sinn Fein as a political movement and the Irish Republican Army as a military operation. We recognised at the time that it was important to maintain that there was a distinction, even though that distinction was never entirely clear.</p>

<a name="80717-0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="08071786000210"></a>We all accept that the threat from terrorist organisations in the United Kingdom and elsewhere is real but that, as an open and democratic country, political movements operating in and outside Britain have legitimate functions to fulfil and, furthermore, in our very diverse society, that charitable activities in the United Kingdom to support suffering in other countries are legitimate. I do much of my politics in Yorkshire and I am conscious that the issue of charitable activities to support humanitarian projects in other countries can on occasions be quite controversial. Nevertheless, we have to maintain those clear distinctions. We also recognise that one man&#146;s terrorist activity outside Britain is another person&#146;s armed resistance.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="08071786000211"></a>One of the questions one has to ask about the proscription of the political wing of Hezbollah is whether this is primarily about Iraq or the Palestinian territories. As the Minister is well aware, my party has never supported the full weight of western intervention in Iraq. Armed resistance in Iraq is not always necessarily legitimate. Hezbollah is now a political actor in the Lebanon and a member of the Government&#151;not entirely an attractive member of that Government, but we all have to deal with movements of which we disapprove. Hamas, similarly, is a very unattractive body in many ways but a necessary partner in negotiating to move away from the Israel/Palestine conflict. Many of us intensely disliked negotiating with Sinn Fein but, again, recognised that it was necessary.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="08071786000212"></a>I ask the Minister how the additional criteria come in. The specific threat posed to the UK seems thin. As I understand it, Hezbollah does not intend under any

We are talking about activities in the occupied Palestinian territories and in Iraq. It is probably difficult for the Minister to outline the extent of the organisation&#146;s presence in the UK, but, as I understand from the order, this is not itself a major issue. The two primary justifications among the additional criteria are: the specific threat posed to British nationals overseas&#151;by which we mean British troops still in Iraq so long as they are there&#151;and the need to support international partners in the fight against terrorism. Some of us wish to distinguish between the British definition of the fight against terrorism and the Bush Administration&#146;s definition of it, and are not sure that the Government should always support 100 per cent the latter. However, would the Minister confirm that the need to support international partners is one of the major motivations for this order?</p>

As someone who is concerned about the use of terrorism in various parts of the world, I have viewed with interest and encouragement, albeit with some impatience, the moves by Hezbollah towards the democratic process.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="08071786000214"></a>Some years ago, I was asked to start meetings with Hezbollah on the development of a peace process in the Middle East and specifically how it could address the question of its weapons, which at that stage was a major international issue for it. I had a series of meetings with it at that time. There are a few requirements when dealing with weapons and the decommissioning of weapons. First, there is an alternative political process for dealing with difference and political disagreement. Secondly, those who are being invited to decommission must not feel that they are under a threat that requires them to retain their weapons. Thirdly, there should be a mechanism for them to do this.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="08071786000215"></a>The great difficulty that arose in those conversations was the increasingly obvious move that led eventually to the south Lebanon war. There was no prospect of persuading people to deal with their weapons if they felt that they might be invaded, and indeed when there was clear evidence that they had been invaded. The question of dealing with the weapons has therefore had to be postponed. The question of a peace process in the Middle East is fraught and difficult. Nevertheless, there have been a number of interesting developments in the last little while, almost none of them involving the United Kingdom or the United States. I am thinking of the discussions involving Syria and Israel, assisted by Turkey; the discussions between Israel and Hamas, facilitated by Egypt; and the recent agreement, facilitated by the Germans, for Hezbollah to hand over the two IDF soldiers and, in return, for Hezbollah operatives to be returned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="08071786000216"></a>In all these situations, it is clear that negotiations are possible. Indeed, there have already been some negotiations. As I say, there has been an indication in the past few days that Israel is prepared to enter into talks with Hezbollah and with those in Hezbollah who have military responsibility, and with Hamas using the

It is therefore a puzzling time to send the message, whatever the legalities of the thing&#151;other noble Lords have already questioned the clarity of the order in this regard&#151;not so much that we are hostile to terrorism, because frankly there is nothing new there, but that we are hostile to and do not welcome the opportunity to win people over to the democratic process and encourage them in that regard, and that we want simply to appear antagonistic to them and all that they stand for.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="08071786000217"></a>I am puzzled to know how a political development of that kind assists those of us who are trying to persuade people in Hezbollah that there are alternative ways of dealing with difference and political difficulty. The West in general, of which we are a part, is eager to facilitate that, but at the point at which there are moves towards discussion of these very issues, there seems on every occasion to be some kind of military or security development that sends the message that such discussion is not very welcome. That is absolutely how it is perceived. When there are talks about decommissioning weapons, next there is a war that makes that impossible, and when people start to become involved in the democratic process by being elected, in the case of Hamas and Hezbollah, the message is not, &#147;Now we can start to engage you and persuade you to go the full way in committing yourself to democracy&#148;, but, &#147;We have to isolate the whole community that has voted for you&#148;, because we do not particularly welcome the result of their election.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="08071786000218"></a>The timing is puzzling, and I would be interested to hear the Minister say how he believes the order will facilitate the political process to persuade people to give up military force and instead follow a fully democratic path, and whether this development makes life more difficult practically, legally and politically for those of us who do not believe that there is a military solution to the difficulties in the Middle East. There is a military role, but there is no military solution to any of them. How will the order facilitate moves toward political dialogue and political exchange, and how far do Her Majesty&#146;s Government feel that a development of this kind and at this time makes a difference to terrorism and in any way facilitates political progress?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="08071786000221"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, articulated very clearly our reason for going down this route. He asked how confident one might be about differentiating between

I agree that this is extremely difficult. The police and the Charity Commission will have to look at the arrangements that cover money flowing out of the country. Generally, it is incumbent on the person who gives money to something to check exactly whom it is going to, but I accept that this is difficult. The police and the Charity Commission will have to look very carefully at this, which is not easy to do. Will we ask the EU to proscribe this? We will take this to the EU and see how that goes with the committee that reviews this.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="08071786000222"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Russell-Johnston, asked why our position on the PMOI has not changed. I will touch on this in the context of the EU. The EU addressed this, but I am afraid that some of the other nations in the EU did not feel the same way as we did. Therefore, the issue is slightly in limbo at the moment and is still on the EU&#146;s list. I am not sure how this will go forward, but that is where it stands at the moment.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="08071786000223"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, talked about disarmament. We would like to link this to disarmament, but it is extremely difficult to do so. Again, we will have to see how this can be done. It is not easy, but it is extremely important that we show that we differentiate between these two things. The issues that made us change our mind and review all this have been going on for many months, and we have had to have a lot of discussions with a lot of people, sift all the intelligence and look at all the evidence. The end result was that we were very clear that this was having an impact on our troops in Iraq. There was also the issue of the Palestinian territories. The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, asked whether we could differentiate between the two. The answer is no. The threat to coalition forces, which inevitably include our own troops, is very great. We have lost 136 of our people there, and it is very important that we show that this is totally unacceptable not only so far as terrorism is concerned but unacceptable full stop. We have reached that position, which is the reason for the timing of the order.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="08071786000224"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, asked about the timing of the order. He has great experience of conflict resolution, and we all think very highly of it. He knows a lot about it, and he made some very important points. I touched on the issue of disarmament. It is absolutely true that it is almost impossible to get anyone to disarm if they feel that they will be attacked, and that is quite understandable. One has to get beyond that before anything can be done. In an ideal world, the timing, as with so many things in this area, might not be quite like this. As I said, however, there is a very real threat to our people&#151;136 have been killed, many of them by these very clever improvised explosive devices. We know now that Hezbollah is linked to this as terrorists. We had to move on this to give a signal.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="08071786000225"></a>Is this absolutely the best moment to do that? It is important to show that we understand the good things that Hezbollah is doing within Lebanon. Our ambassador in Lebanon has talked to the various people involved there. We think that it would be wonderful if Hezbollah became a proper political party. It is rather important to show that we differentiate between the two. That is why the timing might seem a little strange. I am afraid  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1354"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1354</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>that it takes a long time for these things to flow through and to do all the checks. We have arrived at that stage now. There is no nefarious plan. It has not been done as a clever move to send a particular message. I agree that it might not be the best moment, but it is important to make it absolutely clear that we are unwilling to let terrorists act in the way that they do, particularly when they injure and kill our people who are operating in Iraq. A number of speakers have rehearsed the possibility of going further than we have. I believe that there is a difference between the two wings, and have already touched on the issue of how easy it is to differentiate them in the UK. It is difficult to do that, but we should try because it is important.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="08071786000226"></a>I hope that I have touched on most of the points raised. If I have not, I will, if I may, write to noble Lords afterwards. As I said, this is an issue of great importance. A number of noble Lords asked whether the threat from this group is specifically within the UK. I have to say that it is not; it is within Iraq and the Occupied Territories. The threat is not to the UK but to our interests abroad and to those who are serving us abroad. It is therefore important that we do this. It will contribute to our efforts to make the United Kingdom a hostile environment to those who support terrorism. It will send a clear message of our condemnation of Hezbollah&#146;s support for terrorism while at the same time showing it that there is a way forward by becoming a proper member of the community and doing all the good things that it does in supporting its own community. As such, I commend this instrument to the House.</p>

Those few noble Lords who have taken an occasional interest in this Bill may well have wondered what was going on yesterday. It was rather like a pugilistic event between the two Front Benches for most of the time. We had hoped that, following our debate on Monday, the Minister would have withdrawn this amendment, but he chose not to do so. As was noticed yesterday, we spent some considerable time in Committee debating further what could have been transferred to the more productive environment of the DWP consulting in earnest with those who have briefed us. On consultation, I, like my noble friend Lord Lucas, was delighted by the Minister&#146;s response to the previous amendment.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="08071786000239"></a>We accept the Minister&#146;s assurances that the department will now consult further and hope that that consultation will be broadly based, and not simply with those who agree, wholly or in part, with what the Minister certainly gave me the impression were the Government&#146;s settled views. I also hope that the Minister will brief us and colleagues on the Liberal Democrat Benches in good time before Report stage commences. That is shortly after the Summer Recess. My noble friend Lady Noakes said on Monday that the consultation document did not make it clear that the Government were consulting on such a sweeping power as the one contained in Amendment No. 130EW. The word &#147;draconian&#148; springs to mind. In response, the Minister said that,</p>
<ul><a name="08071786000378"></a>&#147;it is pretty explicit in paragraph 1.38 of the consultation document&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/7/08; col. 1087.]</ul>
<a name="80717-0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_134"></a><a name="08071786000240"></a>That confused me, for one. I think the Minister intended to refer to paragraph 1.40, not 1.38. That paragraph says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_59"></a><a name="08071786000361"></a>&#147;The Government ... proposes to take a regulation-making power which is sufficiently broad-based to enable amendments to be made to ensure that the Regulator has effective powers to deal with ... innovation in the market, and to make sure that the effect of the powers is clear to all the parties in the market&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80717-0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_135"></a><a name="08071786000241"></a>The consultees would, in my view, have concluded rightly that what the Government would legislate for bore some relation to the specific issues discussed in the remaining 40 pages of the consultation document. Instead, Amendment No. 130EW takes the widest possible power to make the largest possible number of changes, potentially with infinite retrospective effect. This is part of the problem with the consultation, and one that the Government simply must address. The power needs to be much more tightly drawn.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_136"></a><a name="08071786000242"></a>The Bill depends crucially on consensus that the contents of Part 1 are the right way forward. The amendment that we have been debating for, it seems, days&#151;although I suppose it is hours&#151;is not, strictly,  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1356"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1356</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>part of that consensus. The high-handed way that the Government are handling their own amendments to this Bill is not conducive to consensus holding on the wide range of concerns that we still have about Part 1. In particular, we are far from satisfied that the personal accounts project can be delivered on time at an acceptable cost to members and without taxpayer subsidy. We will return to those issues on Report. Our enthusiasm for consensus at that stage will bear a direct relationship to the way that the Government are prepared to address the outstanding issues. It would have been an act of good government for the Minister to have withdrawn his amendment so that his department could commence discussions on an open basis with all&#151;I repeat, all&#151;the interested parties. Instead, by pressing their amendment, the Government seek to go into any such discussions with the whip hand of having the amendment as part of the Bill. That, as I have said before, is a disgraceful way to legislate, especially as Ministers know in their heart of hearts&#151;in fact, rather more than that, because the noble Lord has just said that he will consider favourably some of my noble friend&#146;s amendments&#151;that what is being bludgeoned into the Bill today will be amended before it reaches the statute book.</p>

<a name="80717-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_137"></a><a name="08071786000243"></a>We have thought long and hard about this. If we were to press Amendment No. 130EW to a Division today, we would run the risk of failing to achieve a satisfactory resolution during the remaining stages of the Bill. Whoever won the Division, the House would have expressed an opinion that would make later changes more difficult or perhaps even impossible. We on these Benches are committed to responsible opposition. In the interests of achieving the right result in the end, we believe that we should not erect procedural barriers to amendments on Report. On that basis, and with a very heavy heart indeed, I shall not be seeking to divide the Committee on this amendment.</p>

I hope also that I have been able to reassure noble Lords on a number of issues. It is fair to say that as a result of these debates we are all largely heading towards the same place. I detect that there is broad agreement that the Government need to take action to address emerging issues. I have made it clear that over the summer we will have discussions with those noble Lords, in good time as the noble Lord requests, who have shown a keen interest in these issues to ensure that we can develop the legislation in a way that strikes the right balance. We will engage with stakeholders, including the CBI and the BBCA, to work closely with us on these very important issues. We need to use the relatively short period of the summer to work on how we can best achieve the policy intent set out in April.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"></a><a name="08071786000245"></a>The risks are real and there is a need for the Government to act on them. Our amendment sets out our intention to make changes to anti-avoidance legislation to tackle these risks. On that basis, I urge noble Lords to accept the amendment. Having said that, I am grateful to the noble Lord for indicating that he will not resist it, and I understand his comments on how this has come about.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="08071786000249"></a>The noble Lord said: This amendment, which would insert a new clause into the Bill, hides for me a real dilemma. For many years we have had annual uprating orders whereby the state pension has been increased by the rate of inflation pertaining in the previous October. The noble Lord has done several, and I did many more. Section 5 of last year&#146;s Bill, now enacted, states that the Secretary of State would introduce an order for state pensions to be increased instead by the increase in the average wage. This concept was intrinsically linked in the Pensions Commission&#146;s report with the introduction of what we now call personal accounts. The Government have said that they will be introduced in 2012, though recent statements by the chief executive of PADA have thrown some doubt on this. It seems to be merely an objective, not a promise. Furthermore, we do not yet know whether the Government regard the tying of this to the introduction of personal accounts as essential or not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="08071786000250"></a>The Government have been extremely vague about great chunks of the Bill. It is in essence a framework Bill, and the Minister&#146;s attitude, as I said on Amendment No. 130EW, has been one of, &#147;Let&#146;s have it in the Bill, and if necessary we&#146;ll change it by order&#148;. That is no way to legislate. If the Government are unsure of the final format for a particular clause in Committee, they should allow themselves time to think and bring the subject back on Report. As for this amendment, I believe that the Government need to be pinned down on the start date of restoring the link with earnings. For us on these Benches, to allow flexibility is one thing, but it does not extend to a vague promise to change things by the end of the next Parliament. Six months after the passing of this Bill, the Government should know when restoring the link will be possible. Indeed, if my great party had won the 2005 election it would have already happened, as we promised in our election manifesto. So it is time, or rather will be in eight or so months, for the Government to stop their dithering and come to a decision. On this matter at least, it is time for the Government to govern. I beg to move.</p>

Let me begin by stating, as I have done already in earlier debates in Committee, that the Government have clearly set out their commitment to introduce earnings uprating. We gave this commitment in the May 2006 White Paper, which first set out our proposals for pensions reform. I assure noble Lords that we will honour that commitment.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1358"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1358</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>

<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="08071786000252"></a>Restoring the earnings link is fundamental to our forward plans for the pension system. It is the bedrock on which our reforms are built and we recognise that there is interest in finding out when it will happen. Our objective is to do this from 2012, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, or in any event by the end of the next Parliament at the latest. This timing strikes a balance between maintaining affordability of our overall package of reforms, yet tackling the challenges identified by the Pensions Commission. We have said that we will make a statement on the precise date at the beginning of the next Parliament.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="08071786000253"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s amendment would require the Secretary of State to make an announcement regarding the timing of the earnings link within six months of the provisions of the Bill coming into force. That would be at least three years before 2012. It would not allow the Secretary of State further time to take account of affordability and the fiscal position before announcing when earnings uprating will start. It is sensible to retain the current arrangements to review the timing of the earnings link with due regard to affordability if the prevailing economic conditions closer to the time look uncertain.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_145"></a><a name="08071786000254"></a>We will make an announcement early in the next Parliament, and the Pensions Act 2007 commits us to making an order before 1 April 2011. Section 5 of the Pensions Act 2007 requires the Secretary of State to make an order identifying the designated tax year&#151;the first tax year in which a review with regard to earnings will take place&#151;and earnings uprating will start the following year. We have legislated to restore the earnings link to the basic state pension to ensure that it happens. We have put that commitment on the face of the 2007 Pensions Act to provide certainty. We do not think that stipulating the timing of an announcement to be made to Parliament about our intention to restore the earnings link in the way proposed by this amendment is necessary. We have given as much commitment on this as is reasonable and prudent, and therefore I ask the noble Lord to withdraw this amendment.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_146"></a><a name="08071786000255"></a>I will say in reply to the noble Lord&#146;s assertion that if his party was in Government at the moment, the earnings link would be restored, that I can presume he will give us a precise date as to when in the event, in my view unlikely, that his party returns to Government, they would restore the link. Can we have certainty from the noble Lord, if he is seeking to press us on the issue? However, we have made our commitments very clear and I would ask him to withdraw the amendment.</p>

That is why, despite all the assurances and the long timescale of those assurances, I do not think that what the noble Lord has been telling us, not once but several times during the course of our deliberations because the matter has been raised on other amendments, is sufficient. It is one thing to be reasonable and prudent, but it is quite another to be as vague as the noble Lord has been over this.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1361"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1361</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80717-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_152"></a><a name="08071786000265"></a>I had intended, but time does not permit it, to raise other interconnected issues such as risk, means-tested benefits and trivial commutation and, in particular, to press my noble friend on the issue of stranded pots. In brief, the risk is that older, poorer women may not have a big enough pot to float them off means-tested benefits. For them, as the PPI has identified, it may not pay to save. The best way to overcome that risk is to help her to increase the size of her pot, ideally to cover her earnings below &#163;5,000, but also to consider increasing the annual or lifetime sum so that it can go into personal accounts. One other option, the purpose of today&#146;s amendment, is to allow the transfer of small pots into personal accounts or, if the personal account is the small pot because there are only a few years of savings in it, to allow a transfer out into a larger alternative existing pot.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_153"></a><a name="08071786000266"></a>I know that the industry is concerned about destabilising the existing annuity market, but the effect on it would be trivial and would overcome the very real injustice&#151;I might go so far as to say &#147;theft&#148;&#151;of small stranded pots. Take the hairdresser who has been self-employed and more recently employed, perhaps over the past decade, in a larger salon, who, along with her employer, is now paying into a personal account. She ends up with a personal account pot of, let us say, &#163;18,000. That is too large to trivially commute because it is above the &#163;16,500 limit, so she must annuitise.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_154"></a><a name="08071786000267"></a>However, that hairdresser also has three small personal pensions of &#163;2,000 each, with different providers from different times in her life when she was self-employed and thought that she had enough resources to build up some modest savings for retirement. If she acquired those three small pots as an employee working in a salon for another employer, and therefore with an employer&#146;s contribution so that she had paid in only half, she would be able to cash them in; since last year&#146;s Budget, such pots are going to be ignored by HMRC, which is a sensible and generous provision.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_155"></a><a name="08071786000268"></a>If, instead, those three little &#163;2,000 pots are personal pensions, then although she has paid for every penny in those pots without an employer contribution, she cannot trivially commute them because her personal account is above the trivial commutation limit. They are too small to be annuitised, as pots below &#163;5,000 are too small for the industry to bother with. I am told that the industry will not normally bundle them up if they are from different providers. She is not allowed, for at least five years and maybe not even then, to transfer them into her personal account and build her pot. So what happens? She cannot access those three &#163;2,000 pots at all. They are stranded. They are in limbo. One-quarter of her lifetime savings is completely lost to her.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_156"></a><a name="08071786000269"></a>Why are those pots not ignored, like small occupational pots with an employer contribution? Because of HMRC&#146;s fear that large personal pots could then be fragmented and the system manipulated. We could avoid that by capping the total sums. I get fed up sometimes with our apparent willingness to accept that in order to avoid one rich person&#146;s theoretical manipulation of the system, 100 people will lose their savings, like our hairdresser. That money is lost: &#163;6,000 of &#163;24,000 is gone; it is inaccessible. That is shocking and unacceptable.  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1362"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1362</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Incidentally, that &#163;6,000 in the little stranded pots might have been the extra personal savings that sprang her clear of means-testing. Instead, the money that she has saved goes not to her but to other members in her scheme and she might perhaps fall back on the taxpayer instead. So it is not only shocking but stupid.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="08071786000270"></a>I hope that my noble friend will get agreement from the industry that in this situation, where the industry does not want to annuitise, it will raise no objections to the transfer in of those small pots to personal accounts and that, likewise, if the personal account is the smaller pot, it could be transferred out so that the PA pot is not lost. That might take place at retirement only, although it would be more attractive if it could be done earlier when the pot might seem more worth while. I hope that my noble friend can come back, either today or on Report if we need amendments&#151;perhaps he could tell me if that is the case&#151;with a way forward on this. If he does not, I shall&#151;with your Lordships&#146; support, I hope&#151;return to the matter.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="08071786000271"></a>I had been proposing on this amendment to raise the issue of trivial commutation. If the cap were raised from &#163;16,000 to &#163;25,000, that would also help the problem of stranded pots by providing more headspace for trivial commutation. All such proposals have implications for pension credit, however, and, given the pressures of time, I do not propose to explore those issues today. If, instead, we could move forward to resolve the issue of the hairdresser&#146;s stranded pots, I would be content and I suspect that your Lordships would be as well. I beg to move.</p>

It is a small but important change that would be helpful to a number of low-paid, low-income women. When I was listening to the example that was given, the words &#147;daylight robbery&#148; came to mind. We have people on low income who, at a time in their lives when they feel that they may be able to save for a pension, put money into a pensions pot but then, due to lifestyle changes, cannot continue to pay and never feel the benefit of that hard-earned money. As it stands, that is extremely discriminatory. It is discriminatory in another way, too: if the individual had been an employee in an occupational pension scheme, they would have been in an entirely different position and would have felt the full benefit of their contribution into the fund.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="08071786000273"></a>The amendment impacts on some of the poorest people in our community who want to do the right thing. They do not want to fall on the state. When they have been able to afford to pay something into a pot for retirement, they have done so. Yet in that process, because of their life circumstances, they could lose hard-earned money. They would have been better off putting it in the bank, for instance, than into a pensions pot.</p>

The key thing that she said is that there are pots of money that the industry wants nothing to do with. She has done the Committee a great service in reminding us of that, as the problem is getting worse. It affects the lowest-paid households in our community and it needs to be addressed. It cannot be beyond the wit of man for the Government to come to some accommodation with the industry, which self-confessedly does not want to get involved in de minimis&#151;so far as it is concerned&#151;levels of money that are none the less hugely important to the people who have these stranded hairdressers&#146; pots, as was so eloquently argued by the noble Baroness. For the life of me, I cannot see any reason why, with a bit of effort and good will, we could not get some kind of solution along the lines that the noble Baroness has suggested.</p>

Giving pensioners more control over their retirement would add an incentive for them to save more over their lifetime and would benefit many as the concept of working life becomes less clearly defined, especially as one approaches retirement age, whenever that is.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="08071786000277"></a>The Committee may remember that the Minister answered a Question on that subject on Monday. The Pensions Act 2004 allows anyone over state pension age to continue paying national insurance contributions up to the age of 70 and thereafter to commute this extra sum into a lump sum as an alternative to an increased weekly pension. I am sure that the noble Baroness remembers discussing that. Therefore, for the noble Lord to say, as he did at Question Time on Monday, that the Government encourage people to work beyond 70 is somewhat erroneous. Be that as it may, the interesting thing about commuting a full five years of the end-of-life state pension is that it amounts to about &#163;25,000. I wonder whether that is why &#163;25,000 is mentioned in the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="08071786000278"></a>We have discussed numerous times the impact of a more fragmented working life on people&#146;s pension pots. The inconvenience and unnecessary administration costs of multiple small pots rather than fewer large pots are, I am sure, fully appreciated by the Government. If they are not, they jolly well ought to be. The changes over the past few years to increase the portability of small pensions were very welcome and I see the possibility of raising the commutation limit in much the same spirit. However, I would have preferred it if the noble Baroness and the noble Lord had not mentioned hairdressers&#146; small pots in connection with &#163;25,000; I think that they would rarely have such a large pot.</p>

I was attracted by the idea when it was raised earlier. Given that more and more people of both sexes now take jobs for short periods and then move on, this would be a fitting measure. If a female hairdresser manages to put aside a quarter of her pension savings, even before she has children or has to look after a grandparent or a parent, that is even more reason to think of all the money that the state saves through

Like the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, I prefer not to cap the total funds, particularly as we are talking about relatively small sums. I also like the possibility of moving the sum&#151;whatever it is&#151;the other way into a different, and no doubt existing, pension scheme that is already in the hands of insurance companies. That way, the companies might not feel quite so threatened as apparently they do by some of the plans that are being put forward.</p>

I shall confine my remarks to stranded pots, which is the substance of the issue to which she spoke.</p>

<a name="80717-0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="08071786000281"></a>We have made clear our commitment to banning pension transfers into and out of personal accounts. As the Committee will be aware, this prohibition is designed to minimise the impact on the market caused by the scheme&#146;s introduction in 2012 and to ensure that the scheme remains focused on the target market of low to moderate earners. The transfer ban is designed to promote simplicity for employers, individuals and the personal account scheme, as transfers can involve complex financial decisions and processes for all parties. We recognise, however, that some personal account members at the point of retirement may wish to consolidate their pension savings into a single vehicle and that the transfer ban could complicate their arrangements.</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="08071786000282"></a>I am sympathetic to my noble friend&#146;s concerns that the personal account scheme should facilitate ways to maximise retirement incomes. I should like to examine our approach to those individuals with stranded pots that are too small to be economically attractive to annuity providers but when combined with the value of other pension funds are not eligible for trivial commutation. Allowing individuals in this scenario to transfer their personal accounts funds to and from the scheme could promote the consolidation of pension saving while keeping with our commitment to focus the scheme on the target market.</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="08071786000283"></a>I assure my noble friend that the scheme order with regard to transfers in and Clause 111 with regard to transfers out provide us with sufficient flexibility to legislate if we decide that these exceptions should apply. We would like to discuss this issue with stakeholders over the summer in advance of developing the likely content and approach for the secondary legislation, the scheme order and the non-legislative scheme rules for a public consultation in March 2009. I am therefore confident that we can make progress on this issue. With those assurances, I hope that my noble friend will not press her amendment.</p>

However, does he expect, or wish for, the trigger of a probing amendment on Report so that he can tell the House what the arrangements will be? I realise that the Summer Recess is approaching and that he will be exploring a lot of other issues, but I am sure that he has no intention of allowing this to be lost in the short, long or distant grass. None the less, I hope that before I withdraw the amendment he can advise me whether he would welcome a probing amendment on Report so that we would all know whether the Government have managed to move the debate forward over the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="08071794000005"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall also speak to Amendment No. 134ZBB. Amendment No. 134ZBA would encourage the regulator to be more open about his determinations than he has been hitherto. Although he published the clearances given by the determinations panel, he has not published anything about those given by staff. Given the context of the broader discretion that he is likely to have as a result of the forthcoming regulations, it is important that he should be encouraged to build up in public a body of precedent which will guide people who might be subject to his ire in the future as to what his attitude is likely to be. It could only assist if he was more helpful than at present.</p>

This is not a clear and proper basis for natural justice; both sides ought to know. There ought to be full disclosure in principle.

This issue was discussed by the Public Accounts Committee in another place recently, and the Government and the regulator recognise that there is an important balance to be struck.</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="08071794000008"></a>The power to publish reports in Section 89 is a permissive power. It is for the regulator to consider when and in what circumstances to publish reports. When Parliament discussed this during the passage of the 2004 Act it agreed that this provision should be widely drawn to ensure that there are no restrictions on what the regulator is able to publish following an investigation. The regulator originally considered that, given the issues of confidentiality, it was better to approach this on a &#147;publish by exception&#148; basis.</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="08071794000009"></a>The Public Accounts Committee recently considered transparency in reporting as part of its scrutiny of the Pensions Regulator. It found that the regulator should publish determinations to bring clarity and transparency to regulator decisions. There was no question that this process necessitated changes to statute. In response to the PAC hearing, since December 2007 it has been the regulator&#146;s policy to publish determinations on issues reserved to the Pensions Regulator&#146;s determination panel unless there is a good reason not to. It has published detailed determinations in some high profile cases such as the Sea Containers and Telent cases. This publication policy is in the public domain. The regulator recognises the educative value in publishing reports and now has a firm policy that it should publish in all cases other than by exception. All past determinations were recently published on the Pensions Regulator&#146;s web pages.</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="08071794000010"></a>I appreciate the intention behind the noble Lord&#146;s amendment: providing as much transparency as possible in regulatory decision-making. However, it would make publication of reports mandatory and remove any exercise of judgment by the regulator on whether publication was appropriate. This additional administrative duty upon the regulator would not materially enhance its performance in the exercise of its statutory functions. It could constrain a regulator&#146;s ability to depart from its published policy on the exercise of its functions even where justice and circumstances would otherwise require it, for example where there is a criminal investigation.</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="08071794000011"></a>It would also require the regulator to publish even when it considered that the circumstances of the case made the parties affected identifiable, even with anonymisation. In the regulator&#146;s experience, employers and the pensions industry would have serious concerns  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1367"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1367</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>with this proposal. The information would be of a commercial nature and usually sensitive. Even in an anonymised form there is a serious question of whether corporates would want to share this with other parties. Many clearance applications relate to future corporate transactions, and, as such, parties often require stringent confidentiality on the facts of the case. In some cases clearance will be sought for transactions that subsequently do not take place. It is important that parties feel able to share all relevant facts with the regulator without concern that details of their business position or potential strategic moves will be published.</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_174"></a><a name="08071794000012"></a>Such a mandatory requirement would undermine the industry&#146;s trust in the regulator to maintain confidences, deterring potential approaches and interaction and generating uncertainty within the industry. This amendment would run counter to the regulator&#146;s efforts to maintain the confidence of the pensions industry in maintaining confidential and commercially sensitive information. There is already transparency under the regulator&#146;s current regime. The regulator provides both advisers and their clients&#151;the applicants or trustees&#151;with the detailed determination notices. These set out the reasons for the regulator&#146;s intervention and provide advisers with a frame of reference about how the regulator operates.</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="08071794000013"></a>On the second amendment, the Pension Regulator&#146;s determinations panel procedures give the panel a power to direct how a hearing will take place, potentially including what documents should be shared. The amendment would go wider in scope than is intended. It would make that apply to all determinations, even those not made by the panel. This would make the clearance process virtually unworkable given the number of documents involved. It could result in clearance applications undergoing investigations taking several months and raise questions about which documents corporates would want to share.</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="08071794000014"></a>I understand the noble Lord&#146;s intentions, but there is a risk that such an approach could divert focus and resources from other areas that require regulatory action. As established and also under the Hampton principles, the regulator is risk-based, with the freedom to focus its resources on those issues that place members&#146; benefits or the PPF at the greatest risk. If accepted, the amendment could stifle the regulator&#146;s ability to react quickly in clearance applications. Introducing these requirements on the regulator would simply constrain its flexibility to focus resources on key risks. It would be unnecessary unless the regulator considers the relevant information when making its decisions. Then such decisions could be open to challenge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="08071794000015"></a>If it would help the noble Lord, I would be happy to facilitate the opportunity for him to meet with the Pensions Regulator to discuss his concerns in greater detail. Perhaps, with his colleagues and other noble Lords, he might find this a fruitful way of getting further into these issues.</p>

There was, however, an exemption from this rule for administrative and certain other payments, allowing the trustees to make them without reference to the surplus rules. Unfortunately, this exemption was inadvertently not carried forward when Section 37 was substantially revised by the Pensions Act 2004. It was not our intention to remove this exemption, and an equivalent provision should have been carried forward.</p>

Compared with the extensive powers proposed in the Government&#146;s new clause before Clause 107, the extension of the powers of the regulator in Clause 109 is much less significant, but we should still debate the need for the alterations proposed in that clause. Under the Pensions Act 1995, the Pensions Regulator can remove trustees when it thinks that it is &#147;necessary&#148; to do so. Clause 109 changes that test to one that is &#147;reasonable&#148;; my amendment deletes that change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"></a><a name="08071794000040"></a>I acknowledge that there can be difficulties with boards of trustees in practice, if only because trustees are human and their abilities and knowledge can vary hugely. The average trustee&#151;this includes professionals as well as non-professionals&#151;can struggle to cope with the complexities of modern investment strategies and the strength of the employer covenant when corporate restructuring is proposed. They are also severely tested when issues such as buyouts confront them; we have debated that subject extensively over the past few days. That is why we can see that the Pensions Regulator should have a reserve power to change the trustees when it is necessary. To extend that power to where the regulator thinks that it is &#147;reasonable&#148; risks undermining the whole model. Why does the 1995 Act need to be changed?</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"></a><a name="08071794000041"></a>The existing power was perfectly adequate, for example, to allow the regulator to appoint independent trustees in the case of Telent and the Pensions Corporation. The regulator has the power conferred by Section 33 of the 2004 Act to issue prohibition orders in respect of trustees who are not considered to be &#147;fit and proper&#148;. Furthermore, Clause 109(1)(d) extends the circumstances in which the regulator may appoint trustees for the protection of the interests of the generality of the members. Can the Minister describe the circumstances in which a combination of the existing powers and those in paragraph (d) would not be adequate? As I said, the powers were used effectively, and even upheld on challenge, in the Telent case. What could be more challenging than that?</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_194"></a><a name="08071794000042"></a>We do not believe that it is appropriate to confer powers on the regulator unless there is a clear need for them. Using the criterion of reasonableness could allow the regulator to start to impose his own judgment on the abilities and competence of trustees. That would go in the wrong direction from a regulatory standpoint.</p>

<a name="80717-0008.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_195"></a><a name="08071794000043"></a>The appointment of trustees goes to the heart of the operation of pension schemes. A power based only on reasonableness would be a step on the road to making our defined benefits system almost state-controlled rather than state-regulated, which is an enormous difference. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_196"></a><a name="08071794000045"></a>The Pensions Act 1995 provides the Pensions Regulator with a power that enables it to install trustees. These trustees may be existing members of the scheme or, where appropriate, independent trustees who are professional trustees and fully independent of the employer or any other interest in the scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_197"></a><a name="08071794000046"></a>In another place, Clause 109 amended the Bill to replace the &#147;necessary&#148; test in Section 7(3) of the Pensions Act 1995 with one of reasonableness so that the Pensions Regulator could take action to appoint trustees where it is reasonable to do so. The noble Lord&#146;s amendment, as he outlined, would reverse that amendment and retain the present &#147;necessary&#148; test.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_198"></a><a name="08071794000047"></a>The &#147;necessary&#148; test was introduced in the context of a different regulator and a different market environment. As we have discussed a number of times, particularly this week, developments in the pensions market are fast moving and the &#147;necessary&#148; test requires a burden of proof that is inappropriately weighted against regulatory intervention, even where that intervention may be the right and the most reasonable course of action.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_199"></a><a name="08071794000048"></a>We have seen recently how the regulator used this power to install independent trustees in a scheme whose employer had been taken over by a new organisation that sought to install its own senior staff as trustees and to manage the scheme&#146;s assets in order to achieve returns to shareholders of the new organisation that appeared to place these new employer-appointed trustees in the position of an acute conflict of interest. This case is one example of the way that developments in the pensions market can be fast moving, and risks in the pensions environment can change quickly. It has become clear that the &#147;necessary&#148; test constrains the regulator, who may only appoint a trustee if he is satisfied that there is no other option available, and must act almost as a last resort. If regulation is to be effective, it must be sufficiently agile to enable swift intervention where there is justification. A &#147;reasonable&#148; test will deliver this. The test is well known in law and will provide the regulator with a less fettered power, while remaining transparent and proportionate. When using this power, the regulator will have to seek the approval of the determinations panel, and its decision in turn will be subject to appeal to the Pensions Regulator Tribunal, and subsequently to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_200"></a><a name="08071794000049"></a>The noble Lord raised the issue of trustees and the Telent case. This has now been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties, and is an example of how developments in the pensions market can be fast moving, and risks in the pension environment can change quickly. In that case, the regulator was able to use existing powers to install independent trustees. However, it has become clear that the &#147;necessary&#148; test constrains the regulator, who may only appoint a trustee if he is satisfied that there is no other option available, and must act almost as a last resort, as I said earlier.</p>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77"></a><a name="08071794000594"></a>&#147;These additional powers were deemed necessary to ensure the regulator can effectively regulate against the new business models that have been developed in the non-insured pensions buyout market. The 2004 Pensions Act, which established the regulator, has been largely successful and any new powers must be used for the intended purpose only and not affect the majority of schemes and legitimate business activity&#148;.</p>

Alas, she had another appointment.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="08071794000059"></a>My noble friend and I gave notice that we wished to debate this clause because of concerns that had been expressed about the way in which the regulator is potentially usurping the proper role of trustees when valuing the assets and liabilities of a scheme. It takes the regulator into areas of judgment that are properly those of trustees. The Government have described the need for this clause in the Explanatory Notes. Paragraph 306 on page 46 states that,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000738"></a>&#147;doubt has arisen as to whether the Pensions Regulator can make use of the powers in section 231(2) if the sole ground of concern is that the actuarial methods or assumptions used in the calculation of the technical provisions do not appear to have been chosen prudently&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000555"></a>Stated thus, Clause 110 seems unobjectionable. However, as is so often the case, what you read on the label does not fairly describe the contents. The amendment says nothing about prudence in the selection of actuarial assumptions. The regulator&#146;s powers in Section 231 of the Pensions Act 2004, which are being amended by Clause 110, relate to the failure of the trustees and others to do certain things. The powers were not designed to be attached to judgmental issues such as pitching the regulator&#146;s judgment about particular actuarial assumptions against those of trustees. The Government&#146;s explanation of Clause 110&#146;s amendment to this section does not tell the whole story.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="08071794000060"></a>I agree that the regulator should have appropriate powers. However, given the extensive parliamentary consideration given to the Pensions Act 2004, we should be wary of further extension without good evidence of need. The regulator has been consulting on guidance on actuarial assumptions, and this has  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1373"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1373</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>sent shockwaves through those who still struggle to support defined benefit schemes. The regulator has signalled that he will &#147;scrutinise&#148;&#151;this is code for something tougher&#151;those schemes that do not use the long cohort for mortality improvement, or use underpinning improvement assumptions tending towards zero. I believe that I am correct in saying that most schemes at present use the medium cohort rather than the long cohort. This is a significant move, and one that has generated much controversy among pension providers; hence the need for this clarifying clause. The confusion that it is designed to clear up was the natural confusion felt by those who had no idea that the regulator should have the right to pronounce on judgments at this level, and who strongly resist such a move.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="08071794000061"></a>The decision on whether a long or medium cohort should be used is one of many that the trustees must make on the advice of their actuary. It would be wrong if the regulator was able to impose the choice of a long cohort, with no evidence that a risk-based approach will be used. The long cohort may or may not be the right route to follow, but the concern is that this will be imposed on a big-bang basis and produce huge shocks to the funding assumptions of employers. We know that the Government believe in a risk-based approach. The Pension Protection Fund is predicated on just such an assumption. However, there is no evidence that the regulator will apply a risk-based approach to forcing changes. The evidence from the consultation document suggests the reverse. Furthermore, the regulator intends to go back to March 2007, and could potentially unpick hard-fought agreements about recovery plans between trustees and employing firms.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="08071794000062"></a>This is the background to the additional power in Clause 110. The regulator has already moved beyond the basic approach that it is for the trustees to decide their actuarial assumptions on a prudent basis, and on the basis of actuarial advice. The regulator has various powers to back that up if the trustees are behaving improperly, including the power to appoint new trustees, which we have debated from time to time. Now the Government are seeking to give the regulator the power to overturn the trustees&#146; assumptions, even if they have been arrived at prudently on the basis of actuarial advice. It will be the regulator imposing the judgment over the trustees.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="08071794000063"></a>We fear that this is another nail being hammered into the coffin of the trust-based foundation of defined benefit provision. I shall listen with interest to hear whether the Minister can allay the fears that have been expressed by the CBI and some individual, large, defined benefit scheme employers. If this is another nail in the coffin of DB schemes, it cannot be the right thing to be doing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="08071794000065"></a>Clause 110 addresses an issue which has arisen about the circumstances in which the Pensions Regulator can use its powers to regulate the scheme funding requirements for private sector defined benefit schemes.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1374"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1374</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80717-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="08071794000066"></a>Section 231 of the Pensions Act 2004 provides the regulator with a wide range of powers relating to the scheme funding requirements. They enable the regulator to take action, for example, where there has been a breach of the legislation, or where the trustees and the sponsoring employer cannot reach agreement on a key aspect of their scheme&#146;s funding arrangements. Those powers include a power to specify the actuarial assumptions to be used in a valuation of a pension scheme&#146;s assets and liabilities.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="08071794000067"></a>One of the key responsibilities of a pension scheme&#146;s trustees is to decide what actuarial assumptions are to be used in an actuarial valuation of their scheme. Legislation specifically requires the trustees to choose those assumptions prudently. The regulator has recently faced resistance in cases where it has queried the extent to which the trustees have complied with the requirement to choose actuarial valuations prudently, and its power to act in those circumstances has been challenged.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="08071794000068"></a>The actuarial assumptions used in a valuation are absolutely critical in establishing a scheme&#146;s correct funding position and in determining an appropriate level of employer and, if appropriate, employee contributions to the scheme. In short, the purpose of the clause is to ensure that the regulator can use its existing scheme funding powers where the assumptions chosen by the trustees do not appear to be prudent. It is necessary to ensure that the regulator can take appropriate action to prevent increased risks to the security of scheme members&#146; benefits.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="08071794000069"></a>The noble Lord referred to the regulator consulting on longevity assumptions. That is an important issue, and the regulator&#146;s consultation has provided the opportunity for a serious discussion of the issues. The regulator has undertaken a full consultation and is taking seriously the views raised. It would not be appropriate to comment on the outcome, because that would prejudge the consultation, but it is clearly in all our interests that longevity issues are tackled effectively and that we do not store up ever bigger problems for another day. Equally, we are clearly committed to ensuring that actions across the system are appropriate and proportionate. I understand that the regulator expects to publish its response shortly.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="08071794000070"></a>The noble Lord also raised issues around whether the regulator would use this power to impose long cohort assumptions. There are no standard assumptions to impose. The regulator will ensure that a scheme-specific approach is taken, as should all trustees as part of ensuring prudent technical provisions. It will not impose a long cohort assumption.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="08071794000071"></a>The noble Lord referred to the Association of Pension Lawyers, and he will be aware that it has written to DWP officials about the effect of this clause. The association was concerned that the clause gives the regulator new, wide powers and that it introduces subjective considerations by the regulator for the first time. The APL is also concerned that the clause is being introduced without sufficient consultation. As I said earlier, the power for the regulator to direct the actuarial assumptions to be used in calculating a pension scheme valuation already exists. The clause   


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1375"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1375</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>simply ensures that the existing power can actually be used where the actuarial assumptions do not appear to have been chosen prudently by the trustees.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="08071794000072"></a>We do not agree with the suggestion that the clause introduces subjective consideration by the regulator for the first time. The regulator&#146;s scheme funding powers can be used only where it appears to the regulator that there has been a breach of the legislation. The regulator must therefore already decide in each case whether it considers that such a breach has occurred. Similar powers also already exist in respect of scheme funding recovery plans. The regulator can intervene if it considers that the trustees have not taken account of matters such as their scheme&#146;s asset and liability structure, its risk profile, its liquidity requirements and the age profile of its members.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="08071794000073"></a>The noble Lord also referred to the description of the clause in the Explanatory Notes. He may be aware that we acknowledge that the description of the clause in the notes that accompanied the Bill on its introduction could have been better expressed. There is an intention to update those notes in subsequent versions of the Bill. I hope that the noble Lord will be reassured by what I have said.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="08071794000078"></a>When defending the regulator&#146;s decision to insist on long cohorts, the Minister talks as if the more prudence that is used in deciding actuarial assumptions, the better. That is at least a familiar argument. The Pension Protection Fund, which I mentioned in my opening speech in the clause-stand-part debate, insists that pension schemes are overfunded to 140 per cent before they can be let off the major part of the levy, regardless of the possibility that overpaying into a fund by that margin might actively harm the future prospects of a company. The same applies in this case. An overly prudent set of assumptions will mean that the company and the contributors will have to pay higher contributions than is necessary.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="08071794000079"></a>With no clear understanding of how a surplus is to be repaid, overpayment is most certainly not to the advantage of those involved. The question remains: who is the right person to look at each scheme individually

<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="08071794000087"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to government Amendments Nos. 141 and 141D. These amendments relate to the regulator&#146;s ability to contract out its functions. The Government are committed to ensuring value for money when planning and delivering large-scale public sector projects and to using the skills, expertise and capacity of the private sector where appropriate. The regulator currently has the ability to contract out functions under the Pensions Act 2004, which states that the Secretary of State may make regulations for the regulator to delegate prescribed functions to prescribed persons.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="08071794000088"></a>The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that the Pensions Regulator has the flexibility to secure the best value for money if it decides to contract out any compliance functions. As the legislation currently stands,  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1377"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1377</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the regulator would have to identify preferred suppliers&#151;the prescribed persons&#151;to include in regulations before finalising contracts. In reality, the process of choosing the best functions to contract out, exploring the market for suppliers, identifying preferred bidders and then making a choice of supplier, requires careful planning. Amendments Nos. 134C and 141D will therefore place the emphasis on the prescribed functions that the regulator can contract out and remove the need to name the provider in the regulations.</p>

<a name="80717-0009.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="08071794000089"></a>In practice, that will mean that the regulator can undertake a more flexible procurement process with potential suppliers, and therefore be better placed to identify the best value-for-money approach. Over time, it will also make it easier and simpler for the regulator to change suppliers, again making it more likely that the regulator will secure the best value for money. In addition, under Section 6 of the 2004 Act, the Pensions Regulator currently has the power to do anything which is,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000739"></a>&#147;calculated to facilitate the exercise of its functions&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000556"></a>or is,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000740"></a>&#147;incidental or conducive to their exercise&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000557"></a>That is subject to the provisions of Schedule 1 to the Act. Paragraph 28 of the schedule makes specific provision for the regulator to make payments for expenses and fees for advice, as the Secretary of State may determine.</p>

This power has never been used.

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="08071794000098"></a>Parliament passes Bill after Bill on pensions. Since 1997, we have had the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill, the State Pension Credit Bill, the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Bill, the Pensions Bill of 2003, the Armed Forces (Pensions and Compensation) Bill of 2003, the Pensions Bill of 2006 and the Pensions Bill that we are discussing today. As I think that list establishes, we are very willing to place obligations on other people and on outside schemes. Indeed, in an earlier intervention, the Minister talked on the vital role of trustees and the obligations that we place on them. But when it comes to the Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund, we do not follow the rules laid down for others or for schemes in the outside world.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="08071794000099"></a>I concede immediately that my mind and the minds of others have been concentrated by errors that the parliamentary fund has made concerning many members of the fund and their pensions. However, I do not want to detail all that in this debate. Suffice it to say that the pension fund made an error and that pensions have been paid incorrectly for several years to about 50 or 60 members. There has been an overpayment and a mistake concerning the guaranteed minimum pension. There is no dispute whatever that the parliamentary fund made the mistake. There is also no doubt that the error has led to financial demands to pay back and new reduced pensions.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="08071794000100"></a>Although those errors are not insignificant factors, they have simply spurred this amendment. They are a part of that case, which will be decided in other ways, and I do not want to go into individual cases at this point. But I am told that the fund made the error because it relied on the advice of HM Revenue and Customs. One might think that the fund must have had its own skilled pensions advice available to it, but the truth is that it did not. I am told that, until very recently, the fund employed no professional pensions expertise. As extraordinary as it might seem, the fund was run by the Fees Office. As the Treasury took the view that the cost of professional pensions expertise was unnecessary, no such expertise was available. It is to the credit of the pension fund chairman and the other trustees that that position has changed. However, it has changed only recently.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="08071794000101"></a>It is impossible not to come across further anomalies in the detail of the arrangements for the fund, including the arrangements for trustees, to which this amendment relates. As the Minister knows, the rules that generally apply mean that pension schemes have to ensure that at least one-third of trustees are nominated by the members. The trustees must make arrangements for  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1379"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1379</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the selection of member-nominated trustees, and there are a couple of stages to that appointment process. First, the trustees must ask at least the active and pensioner members for nominations. A member can nominate any other scheme member whom he believes is fit to act as a trustee of his scheme, and the nominated person must obviously give his consent. Next, the trustees have to decide on the selection process. Either a selection committee decides or, if a ballot is arranged, details of the nominated persons are put to all eligible scheme members. The members are asked to vote for whoever they believe is fit to act as a trustee. Those with the highest number of votes are thereby elected as member trustees.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="08071794000102"></a>That is the general view. The Parliamentary Contributory Pension Fund, however, is one of a number of funds to which an exemption has been given. That should come as no surprise, because it relates to the purpose of my amendment. This fund is exempt from the trustee requirements of a normal pension scheme. No pension trustee is nominated, let alone elected, by the members. Trustees are, in effect, appointed by the House of Commons Whips&#151;I was going to say the usual channels&#151;whose pensions knowledge is encyclopaedic and renowned; it is only their vow of silence that prevents them holding forth on the technicalities of the guaranteed minimum pension and other such subjects. In so far as the trustees answer to anyone, they seem to answer to the Leader of the House, who may or may not have some knowledge of pension matters.</p>

First, when I was appointed as a trustee in your Lordships&#146; House, I was, to the best of my knowledge, appointed by the usual channels in this House, not the usual channels in the other place. Secondly, those who have most recently been appointed as trustees have had the most experience of pension funds. So although my noble friend is correct to say that such experience did not previously seem to be a requisite, the position has changed more recently.</p>

He is indeed a trustee, and he is one of the exceptions among the 10 members of the trustee board. All the others, with the exception of Sir Graham Bright, are Members of the House of Commons. I exempt my noble friend from what I said about appointment through the usual channels in the House of Commons; he has obviously been appointed through the usual channels in the House of Lords. If that satisfies him, I am very happy to make the correction. But the point is that he was appointed. The point that I am making is that the conditions that apply to other pension schemes should apply also to our own pension fund.</p>

Although one of my noble friends shakes his head&#151;he was, of course, at the Welsh Office when the Welsh Development Agency ran into trouble&#151;that experience seemed relevant.</p>

If I may advise him, I would say that that is not necessarily totally in his interests. He may well have been a trustee of another pension scheme; it is not exactly a unique qualification in this House. I am taking it from the point of view of members of the scheme. The trustees are there to represent the members, so they should have the right to choose a certain proportion of them. I am not making a case against the present trustees; I have been careful not to do so. I strongly advise my noble friend not to provoke me or I may go down a rather different road.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="08071794000107"></a>My amendment proposes that at least one-third of the trustees should be not only nominated by the members but elected by them. If they were able only to nominate them, that would bring us back to the current position. Election is the proper way of doing it. The current position is that eight of the 10 trustees are serving Members of Parliament, appointed by the Whips; one, as we heard, is a Member of this House, appointed by the Whips here; and one has been nominated by the association representing former Members of Parliament&#151;a step taken only recently, though it is a step. All of them are members of the scheme; there is no independent member of any kind on the trustee board. In other words, there is no truly independent member and no independent chairman. I emphasise that this is not a criticism of the current chairman, who has done a great deal to try to rectify some of the faults in the present system. I pay tribute to Sir John Butterfill for that. However, there is no independence.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="08071794000108"></a>I simply do not believe that anyone can seriously claim that this is a perfect position for a pension fund to be in, let alone a parliamentary pension fund, given all the requirements and conditions that we place on other pension funds. We debate and enact Bill after Bill to place conditions, restrictions and rules on outside pension schemes, yet we have a parliamentary pension scheme system that is antiquated and unreformed. I cannot imagine why we think that reform is right for outside schemes but not applicable to our inside parliamentary scheme. Why do we think it right to enact Bill after Bill that applies outside but not to us?</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="08071794000109"></a>I should be grateful for the Minister&#146;s guidance, because we are in a pretty technical area and I do not want to table an amendment that does not bring into effect the purpose behind it. I have tried to remove the exemption for the parliamentary pension fund which exists under current law, and impose the requirement that at least one-third of pension trustees should be elected by members of the pension fund. That is my case, which is exploratory at this stage. I am anxious to find out whether the amendment serves the purpose that I have set out. If it does not, we have time to change it before Report stage. The Treasury is at the centre of these arrangements; it rules rather than the trustees. I would like to find out how it sees or defends a position that many in this country regard as out of date. I beg to move.</p>

It was extraordinary that the Fees Office had no professional expertise, that the advice received from both the National Insurance Contributions Office and HMRC was wrong and that the errors were not spotted by the Government Actuary or the National Audit Office.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="08071794000111"></a>One of the consequences is that the 177 pensioners who were overpaid and the 100 who were underpaid have probably been dealt with less generously than they would have been in a private pension scheme. I feel pretty sure that, in the days when I was a trustee of private pension schemes, with an error of this kind, whose net cost was not substantial after taking account of tax implications and so on and which had occurred because of the lack of professional expertise provided by the employer and the actuary not having done his job properly, most employers would have covered the costs rather than expecting pensioners to repay overpayments at a time that was extremely painful for them to do so.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="08071794000112"></a>I need not go further on those matters, except to take up some of the lessons that I think were learnt from what happened after the errors had been discovered. The trouble was that there was no representative group of pensioners to whom advice could be sought or with whom consultations could take place. There were consultations involving the Leader of the House of Commons and an effort was made to bring in the Association of Former Members of Parliament. However, the association was set up relatively recently, after these errors occurred, and I have to confess that I did not know of its existence. It certainly has no specific pension role and cannot be taken to be representative of pensioners.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="08071794000113"></a>When I was last a pension trustee in a firm of which I was a director, we had elected pension trustees and we made a point of having an annual meeting to which pensioners could come to cross-examine the trustees and to receive advice about the way in which their pension fund was being managed, the investments were being made and so on. There was always a good attendance at those meetings.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="08071794000114"></a>When this episode occurred, no such meeting was convened. I first heard about it when I received a letter saying that my pension would be reduced the following month and that I would be asked to repay a quite substantial sum over the next five years. There were no detailed discussions to explain what had gone on. We then had to seek advice. I sought advice from, among others, the Pensions Advisory Service; my noble friend has read out from the advice the normal way of dealing with these things in private schemes.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="08071794000115"></a>It is entirely wrong that the parliamentary scheme should be living in the dark ages of pensions representation and administration in this way. It should set an example and give a lead; it should not have to defend the indefensible. Surely pensioners receiving benefits from the parliamentary pension scheme are entitled to be fully and adequately represented by people whom they have helped to choose. They should have the opportunity to nominate and, preferably, to vote on those people;

<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="08071794000116"></a>I warmly welcome the proposals made by my noble friend to bring the parliamentary pension scheme into the modern age. They would make sure that the scheme is properly run and that the representatives of the pensioners are chosen in the way that is considered appropriate for all other pension schemes today. Anything else is indefensible. If the Minister has to say that there is a fault in the detailed proposals that my noble friend has put forward, I hope that he will come up with a solution that offers the members of the parliamentary pension scheme the kind of representation that they should have and which they probably could have if they were members of any other scheme operating under normal rules.</p>

I do not have any details in my brief about the background to the errors, how they arose and what was entailed, but I can see that there may be a way of taking this matter forward.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="08071794000118"></a>The Pensions Act 2004 requires occupational pension schemes established under a trust to have arrangements in place that provide for at least one-third of its trustees to be member nominated. However, as I am sure Members of the Committee will be aware, and as has been explained, the parliamentary pension scheme is covered by separate statutory provisions in the Parliamentary Pensions (Consolidation and Amendment) Regulations 1993. Therefore, the parliamentary pension scheme is exempt from the 2004 requirements.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="08071794000119"></a>As the noble Lord explained, his amendment would revoke this exemption and modify the requirement so that member-nominated trustees of the parliamentary pension scheme would be selected by a ballot of scheme members, rather than selected as a result of a process that involves some or all of the members as per the Pensions Act requirement. The existing provisions in the parliamentary pensions regulations arguably provide for greater involvement by members of the parliamentary pension scheme than those provided under the Pensions Act 2004. The parliamentary pensions regulations require all the trustees to be either Members of another place or former Members who are entitled to a pension from the scheme.</p>

<a name="80717-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="08071794000120"></a>The particular point raised was that nominations are usually made through the usual channels. Last year, an appointment was made following a nomination by the Association of Former Members of Parliament. Sir Graham Bright was my old adversary in Luton South; he saw me off twice, regrettably, in 1987 and 1992, but I do not hold that against him. Appointments are made by order of the House of Commons. Members of another place may therefore effectively veto any appointments. I think that Members of the Committee will agree that, because there are separate statutory provisions, it serves no particular purpose to seek to apply the member-nominated trustee requirements in the Pensions Act 2004, which could create an unnecessary legislative complication.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="08071794000121"></a>If the noble Lord believes, as he clearly does, that aspects of the member-nominated provisions should be reflected in the parliamentary scheme regulations, perhaps the route forward is to seek to take them up first by making representations to the Leader of the House of Commons, who is responsible for those regulations. I am sure that the noble Lord, with his experience and standing, would be able to effect those arrangements and I would be very happy to work alongside him to do that.</p>

Apart from anything else, if the new regulations came before this House, we would have no scope for amending them. We would have to take them as they stand. There are some difficulties in proceeding by that route.</p>

The noble Lord may be aware that a review of the parliamentary pension arrangements is in hand. The Leader in another place announced in a Written Ministerial Statement on 17 June&#151;this was particularly because of the anticipated increase in the cost of benefits accruing under the parliamentary pension arrangements&#151;that the Government would shortly be asking the Senior Salaries Review Body to undertake a major review of those arrangements. The review will need to consider among other things the findings of the Government Actuary&#146;s valuation of the parliamentary contributory pension fund, which is to be completed in March 2009. It will perhaps be spring 2010 before the SSRB reports.</p>

While that route may or may not be appropriate, the speed of response is not acceptable. The Minister mentioned the Government Actuary&#146;s assessment of the value of the fund, which is quite right. But it is now July 2008 and, as I understand it, the assessment will not be completed until March 2009 at best. Those time spans are detrimental to the trustees taking forward decisions. Perhaps my noble friend who tabled the amendments will remember that the current foundations were passed in 1993 when, if I remember correctly, a Conservative Government were in power. I am not sure whether both my noble friends were members of the Government at that time.</p>

I went out of my way, I hope, in my opening remarks to pay tribute particularly to the chairman. What my noble friend and I have been saying on the individual case is exactly the initial position of the trustees themselves. We are not concerned about individuals; we are concerned about the structure and about Parliament setting down regulations, rules and restrictions that apply to everyone else but, when it comes to its own scheme, saying that that would be going far too far. The answer to whether it was 1993, 1983 or 1973 is that the whole thing has moved on and we are getting into a much more modern and sensible pension structure.

<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="08071794000136"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendment No. 141E. Amendment No. 136A would allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to share data on pension credit recipients with energy suppliers. It also allows energy suppliers to share customer data in order to identify people to whom they can provide assistance with the cost of their fuel bills. These powers would come into force on Royal Assent so that the required regulations can be introduced soon after. These regulations will be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="08071794000137"></a>Energy supply companies have, for some time, been asking for the Government to provide them with benefits data to enable them to target their social offerings on the people who most need them. Recently, Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, said in an Energy Select Committee debate on 24 June:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_101"></a><a name="08071794000618"></a>&#147;What we have been keen to do with DWP is match our computer systems with their computer systems, to ensure that we really have good targeting&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="08071794000558"></a>The Government have been keen to respond to that call.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="08071794000138"></a>We recognise that this is an important new step in the use of government information. The amendment would legitimise for the first time the supply of DWP information to multiple private commercial bodies. The Government recognise that this naturally gives rise to concern and I can assure noble Lords that we have not acted hastily. We have involved all the major stakeholders and have their support. The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group has strongly advocated the sharing of government data with energy suppliers. We have also gained support for a beneficial data share from organisations representing older people such as Help the Aged, Age Concern and the CAB, and from those representing energy consumers such as energywatch, National Energy Action and uSwitch. They recognise that the sharing of government data is not to be taken lightly but, on balance, welcome this as an important development in getting to people direct help with their fuel bills.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="08071794000139"></a>In addition to the legal safeguards already available through the Data Protection Act 1998, the amendment allows the Secretary of State to provide in regulations for a new criminal offence to penalise anyone who unlawfully discloses these data. We have also involved the Information Commissioner in our proposals and we will continue to work closely with his office on the detail to ensure that all practices are fully compliant with the highest standards of data handling, including their security.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="08071794000140"></a>We will be working closely with energy suppliers, BERR and Defra over the coming months to ensure the detail of the use of the data and to make sure these agreements are sound and enforceable. We say to energy suppliers that it is up to them to make this work and we have started discussions with them on the detail of their offer of assistance to pension credit recipients. It may reassure noble Lords that we will share our customers&#146; information only when we are satisfied that what is on offer from the energy suppliers is good enough to warrant data-sharing. The offer must be proportionate and customers must be offered a guaranteed benefit. We recognise there may be some concerns that once the suppliers have the information, they may use it for purposes other than awarding help with fuel costs, but each supplier will receive data only on their existing customers and these data may be used only for purposes in connection with enabling the provision of assistance to persons in receipt of state pension credit. Noble Lords will remember that last year the Government secured, by voluntary agreement, extra spending from energy suppliers to help vulnerable groups. This amendment builds on that and allows energy suppliers to identify and offer help with fuel bills to some of the poorest pensioners. I beg to move.</p>

The Minister has explained the predicament. In

He noted the legitimate privacy and data protection concerns and pointed out:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_102"></a><a name="08071794000619"></a>&#147;We must be sure that any sensitive information being shared can deliver the outcomes that we are looking for, is appropriately protected because the safeguards are in place and can be delivered in a way that is consistent with data protection and human rights legislation&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000559"></a>All of this I fully agree with. The information we are talking about sharing is intensely personal. To hand over private financial information without the proper safeguards would be worse than irresponsible. That the information is a marker of poverty makes it yet more sensitive. How many more pensioners&#151;the whole exercise is not about pensioners per se&#151;would choose to suffer rather than accept state handouts if they were not completely confident that such a step would remain confidential? The Minister might incidentally balk at the word &#147;handouts&#148; but I have used it and I will stick by it.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="08071794000142"></a>The Government&#146;s promise two weeks ago that they,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000741"></a>&#147;will continue to keep the case for large-scale legislative data-sharing provision under close consideration&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000560"></a>would be more reassuring if it was not clear that pension credit information is being used as a pilot test for all this. The noble Lord, Lord Bach, stated:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103"></a><a name="08071794000620"></a>&#147;The precise details of future arrangements are still being considered and discussed with supplier companies&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000561"></a>He continued:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_104"></a><a name="08071794000621"></a>&#147;The amendment to the Pensions Bill is an important start, and we will learn lessons from it to help inform further work&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, 1/7/08; col. GC 43-45.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000562"></a>We cannot accept that pensioners are going to be made guinea pigs in this exercise. Can the Minister explain why the Government have decided to treat pensioners like what one of my noble friends recently described as a canary down a coal mine? They are proceeding with this amendment and have announced their intention to implement a policy of sharing sensitive information when they have admitted that the entire process has not been fully thought through and the safeguards they know are necessary have not been finalised. Either the Government have done the necessary groundwork and my noble friend&#146;s amendment is perfectly reasonable and proportionate&#151;although clearly the noble Lord&#146;s colleague thought not&#151;or much more work must be done before any data-sharing can be thought of.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="08071794000143"></a>The noble Lord said that the information of fuel companies must be &#147;good enough&#148;. I should be extremely grateful if he could expand on that rather remarkable statement. In the way that he said it, I found it not exactly readily explicable. Does the Minister not consider a more responsible way forward would be to establish how a power was going to be used before coming to Parliament and demanding it? Before he responds, I suggest to him that using the word &#147;flexible&#148; when talking about what he considers to be acceptable standards of safety would not be appropriate.</p>

First, I assume from the way in which the Minister introduced the amendment that the regulations that will flow as a consequence will be affirmative and not negative. I see him nodding, which is a comfort, because it is important for Parliament to be careful about how this power is used. I am in favour of data-sharing, and very much in favour of using the technology sensitively to produce better services for our most financially disadvantaged families.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="08071794000145"></a>There is an issue of consent here, which slightly troubles me, because I know from previous experience that a number of pensioner householders in this country do not want to apply for pension credit. They do not want to become involved in the system at all as a matter of principle. Those who do want to become involved in it still consider it, rightly or wrongly, to have a stigma attached to it. When the Government and the electricity and gas-supplying authorities get together to share this information, they must be very careful about how they use it, because they are using it without consent. I guess it is impossible to acquire the consent of everyone involved and to be able to take advantage of some of the consequences that might flow from it. However, we must be very careful about consent as we go down this route.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="08071794000146"></a>This issue will probably expand, rather than contract, in the way in which the Government interface with financially disadvantaged households. I am keen to hear more about how the Government will handle informed consent, and I will certainly raise the matter in proceedings on any affirmative regulations that come before the House as a result of this amendment to the primary legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="08071794000147"></a>The issue of fuel poverty is hugely important now. We are living at a time when energy prices will stay high. They may not all be in the $150-per-barrel league, but we are far removed from $30 a barrel and are not going back to it&#151;of that I am absolutely certain. The Government must therefore do everything that they can to anticipate the hardship that is an inevitable consequence for disadvantaged households in this country. Fuel poverty will become even worse because the economy will, at least in the immediate future, see something of a downturn. For all these reasons, urgent action needs to be taken.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="08071794000148"></a>If this all works, and if everything that can go right does go right, we may end up with a two-way dialogue that gives information back to the DWP and that informs it, perhaps for the first time, that things are much worse in some of these households than it currently imagines. The Government cannot simply say that it is for the electricity and gas-supply industries to deal with the consequences, although there are lots of important things that can be addressed, such as metering and the unfair treatment of people who pay cash and do not have debit cards or pay by direct debit. We all know about this. Some issues have been on the stocks for many years that need actively to be resolved. Surely the DWP must accept some responsibility if the flow of information that starts as a result of this amendment throws up new situations. It should be big enough to stand behind that change, recognise that it

<a name="08071794000149"></a><a name="80717-0011.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80717-0011.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08071794000821"></a>Lord Mogg:</b> It may be a little surprising that I enter for the first time into such a dramatic Bill as this, but declaring my interest as the chairman of Ofgem, the energy regulator, may explain my interest in the debate. It might be useful to give notably the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, a little of the background to this welcome proposal, introduced by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="08071794000150"></a>The authority, which I chair, is under statutory guidance, issued by Parliament, to pay particular attention to fuel poverty. That measure was introduced several years ago. The problem is now reaching crisis proportions because of existing and anticipated price rises; the newspapers speak of very high percentage increases over the next few months. My concern as the authority chair, and as an individual, is to act under the authority&#146;s responsibilities. Fuel poverty is of profound importance in dealing with such a large population in their day-to-day activities. I should draw the attention of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, to the fact that pensioners over the age of 60 represent 50 per cent of those in fuel poverty in this country.</p>

<p><a name="st_150"></a>
<a name="08071794000152"></a><a name="80717-0011.htm_spnew18"></a><b><a name="80717-0011.htm_spnew19"></a><a name="08071794000823"></a>Lord Mogg:</b> I am grateful for that intervention and will come to it at the end of my contribution. What will the Government do for people in fuel poverty? It is such a huge problem; we estimate that 3.5 million to 4 million households are already affected, and the figure could go up to 5 million. Among those affected are single occupancy households and really quite poor pensioners, and I do not forget single mothers, the disabled and the disadvantaged. My question to the Minister is: what do the Government intend doing to make similar provisions? This assumes a satisfactory negotiation of the regulations, which we will come to in relation to this Bill. Can the Minister give a clear indication that all the extra money provided &#147;voluntarily&#148; during the last Budget will not be absorbed by this particular group, important though it is?</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="08071794000153"></a>I now give some background. It was interesting that the Minister did not mention my own organisation, Ofgem, the gas and electricity markets authority. In April it held a fuel poverty summit, which I chaired. The important point is not that I chaired it but that there were five Ministers present, including one from Wales, two Secretaries of State and five of the six major energy suppliers. Of even greater significance, the front-line agencies that deal with this issue face to face were present. They had seen the worst of the issue and the breadth of the problems. All sides of the argument were in the room. The purpose of the summit was, not to tell the Government to supply more money, although my authority has been among those saying that, because fuel poverty is of such importance; rather, it was to say, crudely, let us try to get the best bang for the bucks, and to ensure that the money already in the  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1390"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1390</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>system&#151;both from the Government and others&#151;is best used and targeted, and that the people who need it most are identified.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="08071794000154"></a>From the summit, a few weeks later, a fuel action plan, involving all parties, was produced to try to tackle this&#151;I will not burden your Lordships with the range of issues raised. I underline with passion&#151;if I may use the word in this House&#151;that it is important that this is dealt with now and in the future. What came very clearly out of the discussions was the need for government help in this area. While I understand the concern of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale over the remaining half, it was vital that for the first time the Government were willing to address the problem of using the resources and information they have properly protected&#151;an important point, again, to which I will come&#151;for dealing with this.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="08071794000155"></a>I draw noble Lords&#146; attention to Age Concern&#146;s analysis; it gives a cautious welcome to the measure, precisely because of the DWP data that will help energy suppliers to identify those most in need, rather than the scattergun approach that tends to be taken. I hope all sides supported rapid progress with the measure. I pay tribute to Mr O&#146;Brien for the measure he took and the speed with which he seized the opportunity to use this, if I may say so, slow-moving legislation to open a door that had been bolted as a policy issue and a methodology. What we need, of course, are regulations, hence the Bill. These are of central importance to identify who will be targeted&#151;I understand that it is to be the over-70s on benefits, or perhaps an even older group. The figures are large even on that basis. Moreover, the data security will be protected not only from the Government&#146;s point of view, but also from that of suppliers, because they will use the information to identify their customers in order that the two sides can meet.</p>

<a name="80717-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="08071794000156"></a>Thirdly, on how this system would operate in practice, I understand very well the concerns of noble Lords opposite about possible abuses. Indeed, in the past the Government have had one or two problems in this area. I am grateful for the confidence shown in my own organisation when it was suggested that it should be the intermediary between the two&#151;the trusted third party to manage the process. I think I have convinced the Government that we are not the right body because we are not experienced in large data manipulation, but it is important that there should be a trusted intermediary capable of managing large amounts of data. That is not unusual; many organisations have such experience.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="08071794000157"></a>The other aspect referred to by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, in moving the amendment is how suppliers will use this information. Perhaps I may deal with one or two of the points made earlier by other noble Lords. It is thought that everyone will somehow have their privacy invaded without their knowledge. That is not the intention; rather it is that individuals will have an opportunity to pursue the issue. They will be identified for the energy company if they agree to that; they will not be forced into it. The Age Concern data I have referred to emphasises that that should be of prime concern, and I agree. Elderly people need an explanation of what they are letting themselves in for.  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1391"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1391</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>They need to be able to trust these companies, and in turn the companies need to be well aware that they must maintain the data properly. So it is not a scatter-gun approach that takes in everybody over a certain amount. It concerns only pensioners in receipt of pension credit who wish to benefit from this provision. Furthermore, the data will be handled carefully. However, the detail set out in regulations will be vital. There can be no confidence in a system that does not meet data privacy concerns, and it is essential that both the Government and companies have an agree on data privacy not only on the part of the companies but also by Government is essential and should be of reassurance to earlier contributors to the debate.</p>

<a name="80717-0012.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="08071794000158"></a>I turn now to the other 50 per cent of people whom my noble friend was concerned about. To think that only old people face problems is quite wrong; there are dreadful problems if you have to use 10 per cent of your income to pay for heat and other appliances. This is clearly of grave concern; hence, my question to the Minister to encourage clarity on these issues: what next? If a satisfactory arrangement is worked out and a fuel company clearly identifies what it intends to do with the information, we must ensure that those not included in the Bill are still dealt with.</p>

<a name="80717-0012.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="08071794000159"></a>The agreement announced recently in the Budget indicated that there would be an extra &#163;225 million from the fuel suppliers over the next three years, an increase from &#163;50 million a year to &#163;150 million a year on social measures. That is to be welcomed, although almost all of it has probably been absorbed by recent price increases, while the anticipated further price rises make the problem even more difficult to deal with, and even more important. Perhaps the Minister could indicate, as I will, that fuel companies are not constrained by the &#163;225 million. It is not a cap but an opportunity to develop still further. Their record is good, in my view, and they have tended to receive less credit than they deserve. Appeals to them to be more targeted in their advice have now also been honoured, and the challenge is also to the energy companies. If we have a problem that is not solved by further, long consideration of this Bill, I think that it will be regretted.</p>

<a name="80717-0012.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="08071794000160"></a>I have one final, small point on the proposed new clause. A figure in its subsection (5)(b) refers to costs. Your Lordships may think it so particular that it need not be mentioned. The Secretary of State is, understandably, given the power to recover the costs. In fact, although as a non-lawyer I hesitate to enter this fray, the words could also be construed as implying that suppliers could, in some way, have their costs introduced. I mention that because, while the Government understandably need to finance their activities, the last thing that an elderly or disabled person in fuel poverty would want to read is that the sum of money devoted to social initiatives will drain away into costs. Some clear indication at a later stage, perhaps on Report, that this measure will be as cost-constrained and developed as it can be would be helpful. I support the amendment.</p>

I should place on record our thanks for his engagement in the fuel poverty agenda and for working with fellow Ministers. He made it clear, as others have, that pensioners in fuel poverty is just part of the issue. There are many others whom we need to support and help as well. The noble Lord referred to the process as slow-moving, but I am pleased that my colleague Mike O&#146;Brien has fully engaged with it and really helped to move it on: he is extremely committed to that.</p>

<a name="80717-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="08071794000162"></a>It is my understanding that the noble Lord is also right on the fuel companies not being constrained by the figure of &#163;225 million. If they wish to double it, or even do a bit more, the Government and those in fuel poverty would be delighted. He also makes an important point about the costs: we need to be clear on them. I think that the costs referred to here are those of dealing with the information exchange, but the noble Lord is absolutely right that we need to be clear who will bear those. We do not want those in fuel poverty to have to bear those costs.</p>

<a name="80717-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="08071794000163"></a>Regarding those other than pensioners, the noble Lord asked &#147;What next?&#148;. I will probably write with more detail on that, as today I have before me the issues on pensions and pensioner credit. A point that arose from discussing the Energy Bill is that, unless data-sharing measures are quite targeted, you run the risk of falling foul of data-sharing legislation, which is why there is a clear nexus between outcomes for those on pension credit and fuel poverty. Applying that to other groups needs more thought and discussion.</p>

<a name="80717-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="08071794000164"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked what I meant by, as I think he said it, information from energy suppliers being good enough to warrant data sharing. We need to be satisfied that what is on offer from energy suppliers is good enough to warrant data sharing. Obviously, how energy companies deploy the resources that they have voluntarily agreed to make available is, ultimately, up to them. If they chose to make only a portion of that available through this process, we would need to judge whether it is therefore right in those circumstances still to share information and go forward with these provisions. I was trying to make that point.</p>

<a name="80717-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_282"></a><a name="08071794000165"></a>The noble Lord rather unfairly asked why we were treating pensioners as guinea pigs. That is not the case at all. We are taking powers now as we have a legislative opportunity to do so. A lot more work is needed to put them into effect, but there is a clearly identifiable group of people whom we can support if they are fuel poor, and it is right that we should do so.</p>

What lay behind my thought was that there will be a welfare Bill next year, as he well knows. Given that there is a lot of discussion going on in all this, when the data-sharing measure is introduced, for this specific, correct and reasonable reason, it should be applied to everyone in fuel poverty, not just pensioners.</p>

Those in receipt of pension credit aged 70 are a clearly identifiable group of people. It is much more difficult to so readily identify a range of other people who are in fuel poverty. That is work in progress, and discussions are proceeding on it. That should not prevent us from moving ahead where we can, and we need to do so quickly, as the noble Lord, Lord Mogg, said.</p>

The mention of that Bill suggests that it is a useful vehicle for those remaining, to the extent that they are covered, but perhaps the Minister will agree that this means the regulations to bring this measure forward even faster can be got on to the statute book. As it is, if your Lordships agree and the Bill passes, it will still be another year before the Bill can be applied, so the noble Lord is correct in his implied conclusion.</p>

I want to be clear with regard to data sharing, about which there was some difficulty in the Energy Bill. Essentially, data sharing needs to be proportionate; that is, there needs to be a beneficial outcome for the great majority of those whose data are shared, and one that as far as possible is awarded automatically. That is why we can proceed with this&#151;we have the opportunity to do so. If we have a welfare reform Bill next year, we will have another opportunity to do more.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"></a><a name="08071794000171"></a>The noble Lord also touched upon the important issue of consent. A potential opt-out is being considered and worked through, and it would help to address that issue.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"></a><a name="08071794000176"></a>The noble Lord said: I wish to speak also to government Amendments Nos. 136AB, 141F, 141G, 142CA and 142CB. The purpose of these amendments is to remove an anomaly that has arisen as a result of the interaction between the pre-Beveridge UK pension arrangements, European Community law and German pension provision. These amendments seek to help individuals who came to the UK as children to escape the Nazi persecution in their home countries between 2 December 1938 and 31 May 1940. This operation became known as Kindertransport.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"></a><a name="08071794000177"></a>There is no question but that coming to Britain was the best outcome for these children, but there was a tremendous variation in the fortunes of those who came. Some had benefactors who ensured that they received an excellent education and every advantage. Others were less lucky and were obliged to work in manual jobs straightaway, or as soon as they reached minimum school leaving age. Only the latter group would have been insured under the social insurance scheme as it existed before Beveridge&#146;s reforms took effect in 1948. People insured under the old scheme were credited into the new national insurance scheme at that time and thereby have rights in the present UK state pension scheme.</p>

<a name="80717-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_290"></a><a name="08071794000178"></a>For most people this made little or no difference; for a minority it was advantageous. However, uniquely for certain of the Kindertransportees it transpired to be disadvantageous. When Germany opened its state pension schemes to the Kindertransportees in the early 1990s, some of them opted to take back their German nationality and to pay a voluntary contribution to join one of the schemes. These people were credited with German contributions for the period from 1939 to 1949. Those in manual occupations found that, under European Community regulations designed to prevent duplication of provision in the case of cross-border workers, their pre-1948 UK credits took precedence over the German credits, resulting in a reduced or, depending on their age, significantly reduced German pension. By way of comparison, those Kindertransportees who were not insured under the pre-1948 arrangement in the UK because they were in education or salaried non-insured occupations at the time were able to gain the full value of their German credits for this period. Understandably, the Kindertransportees were, and remain, much aggrieved by this disparity of treatment.</p>

<a name="80717-0012.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_291"></a><a name="08071794000179"></a>These amendments enable a Kindertransportee who has a German pension entitlement that is reduced or extinguished by a period of pre-1948 insurance to request that they are deemed not to have had such insurance. I believe that it is right that we should seek to remedy this unfairness. I beg to move.</p>

For a Pensions Bill, this and the previous amendment are extremely interesting. However, I should like to probe the Minister a little on whether the pension entitlement that is being given up will be amalgamated back into the general fund. Although we all know that NICs&#151;in those days, pension credits applied&#151;are not held in a bank account waiting for the contributor to retire, these pensioners paid money to the Government in the expectation that they would be recompensed. What sums are we talking about? What is the average pot that is being given up? How many pensioners&#151;the so-called Kindertransportees&#151;are involved in this exercise?</p>

This is a cost on the German pension scheme. Nothing will happen at the UK end other than there being a record of people being credited into a system.

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="08071794000182"></a>In a minority of cases it is possible that removing the pre-1948 insurance record could reduce a Kindertransportee&#146;s entitlement to UK state pension. That is not the intended effect of these provisions, so we propose that the Secretary of State should have discretion to maintain an individual&#146;s UK contributory benefits at their existing level should he wish to. They will not lose out on current UK entitlement. We simply wipe the record and create the opportunity for an increased German provision. I hope that that helps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"></a><a name="08071794000188"></a>The point is that post-legislative scrutiny is just as important as pre-legislative scrutiny. You could make an argument, particularly in relation to pensions legislation, that post-legislative scrutiny is rather more important, because all the mistakes appear to take place afterwards in the administration of the scheme. Things are missed out. Mistakes rarely occur because the legislation was set out badly. In my experience, they have often been the result of administrative error. Errors of this kind take place and no one should be totally surprised about them. The only trouble is that, if errors take place in pensions, the costs are substantial.</p>

<a name="80717-0012.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_297"></a><a name="08071794000189"></a>That is basically the case. I will not set it out again, because the Minister has heard all my arguments previously. He has only to look them up and read them from 12 months ago and he will see the case all set out. I am basically asking for some kind of checking mechanism that the purposes of the Bill amount to the reality in the later Act and how it goes into effect.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"></a><a name="08071794000190"></a>As I am sure the Minister has discovered, the words in this amendment are taken exactly from the words of the last Pensions Act. The Minister was enthusiastic at the time in accepting that clause and those exact words. One would think, therefore, that the argument is fairly strong. This pensions legislation is a twin measure of two Bills: one Act already, another Act to come. It would be odd to have a post-legislative scrutiny clause in one part of it but not in the other. As the Minister so obligingly agreed last time to the detail of and exact way in which this amendment is formulated, for once the case that I am putting is totally unanswerable. I beg to move.</p>

I am happy to support my noble friend Lord Fowler&#146;s campaign for post-legislative scrutiny, which he introduced to your Lordships&#146; House in his maiden speech in 2001. In last year&#146;s Pensions Bill, after what I would regard as a tiny bit of argy-bargy with another place, my noble friend managed to get the Government to accept post-legislative scrutiny of that legislation in 2014. The provision is in Section 24 of that Act. Amendment No. 136AC would produce the same result for this Bill.</p>

<a name="80717-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_299"></a><a name="08071794000192"></a>I found it rather ironic that, today of all days, my noble friend Lord Fowler spoke about the expense of errors in social security and, especially, pensions law&#151;an underestimate if ever I heard one. We have knowledge today of the ombudsman&#146;s report on Equitable Life, which we on these Benches welcome. My party&#146;s pressure forced the Government to allow the ombudsman to investigate the regulation of Equitable Life in the first place. The ombudsman highlights significant regulatory failings, including those that occurred when the present Prime Minister, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, was responsible. He cannot escape the blame.</p>

<a name="80717-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_300"></a><a name="08071794000193"></a>The Government must now issue an apology and create a repayment scheme for those who lost out. The scheme must be consistent with sound public finances.

<p><a name="stpa_301"></a><a name="08071794000194"></a>I have a little trouble, as the Minister no doubt does, with the date that my noble friend has chosen. The Government intend to consider changes to personal accounts&#151;a good example is transfers in and out&#151;in 2017. In order to achieve this, they will need to undertake at least a partial review the year before&#151;that is, 2016&#151;and consult on that review. Given that the Government have now conceded that pensions Acts need periodic review, I cannot imagine that the Minister will defy my noble friend Lord Fowler&#151;at least, I jolly well hope not&#151;in his endeavour on this Bill. Otherwise, I would add power to my noble friend&#146;s elbow to pursue his course, if necessary in the same way as was done last year. So, not today.</p>

He is absolutely right: we had some discussion of this issue during the passage of the previous Pensions Bill. I do not have a totally shared recollection of the enthusiasm with which we accepted it; my arm is still hurting. I shall come back to changes since then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"></a><a name="08071794000196"></a>Before doing so, I turn to Equitable Life, which the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, touched on. The Parliamentary Ombudsman has invited the Government to consider issues raised in her report and to reflect on what their response should be. The Government recognise that the ombudsman&#146;s report raises issues that are of concern to all interested parties. The length and complexity of the report mean that the Government will need to consider it carefully before giving their response to the House of Commons in the autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"></a><a name="08071794000197"></a>Last year, we were awaiting the Government&#146;s response to the Law Commission&#146;s report on post-legislative scrutiny. In March this year, my right honourable friend the Leader of the House of Commons published a Command Paper setting out our response to this report and establishing a systematic approach for the post-legislative scrutiny of Bills that achieved Royal Assent from 2005 onwards.</p>

<a name="80717-0013.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_304"></a><a name="08071794000198"></a>This has, for the first time, put a system in place that will ensure that post-legislative scrutiny is the norm. Departments will have to publish a memorandum&#151;it should be submitted in the first instance to the relevant committee in the other place but will be available to Parliament as a whole&#151;on the provisions of an Act within three to five years of Royal Assent. This memorandum will allow Parliament to make an informed decision on whether full scrutiny is necessary.</p>

Due to the variety of measures in this Bill, it is highly likely that we will need to publish more than one memorandum. For example, the noble Lord&#146;s amendment to the Pensions Act 2007 resulted in a requirement for the Secretary of State to report on the  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1399"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1399</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>operation of provisions of that Act in 2014. It may be prudent to cover some provisions in the Bill that relate to the 2007 Act, such as simplification of a second state pension, in the same report. However, we may identify measures in the Bill that can be reviewed before 2014. We have already agreed with the Select Committee that the position on contribution limits and transfers in and out of personal accounts will be reviewed in 2017. We will have further discussions, but it may not be sensible to submit a memorandum on the operation of the employer duty provisions before then, not least because the phased implementation of these duties will continue until 2015.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="08071794000200"></a>We are in a very different position from when we considered the noble Lord&#146;s similar amendment to the Bill of last Session. The Government are now committed to a systematic approach to post-legislative scrutiny that is thorough and proportionate. Alongside existing plans to monitor and evaluate progress, we will ensure that Parliament has adequate opportunities to review all the provisions of the Bill. I hope that this satisfies the noble Lord.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="08071794000221"></a>The noble Lord said: I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 140B and 142D. The amendment will help to facilitate the consolidation of private pensions legislation. Work is in progress, in conjunction with the Law Commission, to consolidate that legislation, which is currently contained in six different Acts. Presuming Royal Assent to this Bill, that number will rise to seven. As noble Lords will no doubt be aware, strict rules on consolidation mean that no changes can be made, even to correct clear unintended errors, to omit spent or unnecessary provisions, or to remove anomalies or ambiguities. The existing law must be reproduced &#147;warts and all&#148;.</p>

<a name="80717-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="08071794000222"></a>Such issues can, however, be addressed by way of a pre-consolidation order, provided that no change is made to the policy enacted by the legislation. Section 321 of the Pensions Act 2004 provides the power to make a pre-consolidation order. However, as currently drafted, the power extends only to legislation that was in force at the time that the 2004 Act was passed. That means that an order made under the power in Section 321 cannot include any amendments that may be needed in respect of subsequent legislation, specifically the Pensions Act 2007 or the Bill, when enacted.</p>

<a name="80717-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="08071794000223"></a>The amendment will ensure that any changes needed in respect of the more recent primary legislation can be addressed though a pre-consolidation order in the same way as for the earlier pensions legislation. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"></a><a name="08071794000255"></a>The noble Lord said: The technical amendments in this group will, on Royal Assent, bring into force powers to make secondary legislation and it will be unnecessary to make a commencement order just to bring those powers into force. This has no effect on the coming into force of the substantive provisions of the Bill. The new employer duties, for example, will still come into force in the way that we have previously considered. It will mean, however, that the technical complexity of orders under the Bill can be reduced. That must be a good thing, not least for better regulation. More important is that we will also be able to give proper notice of the detailed requirements that will apply under the Bill before they take formal effect.</p>

Amendment No. 124 is a simple attempt to state in the Bill what might constitute a reasonable excuse. This duty, no matter how well intentioned, must not fall unreasonably on those young people who simply do not have the means or ability to fulfil it. The list of circumstances in the amendment is not exhaustive, but it includes a number of situations that could make full participation difficult, such as if a person is homeless, has health or addiction problems, caring responsibilities or learning difficulties. Those are circumstances in which it could be argued that the state is failing young people. It is a double blow then to place them on notice for their failure to participate in education. These are circumstances in which the local authority&#146;s obligations should be considered greater than the young person&#146;s.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_365"></a><a name="08071794000276"></a>The Minister may say that all these circumstances would fall within the meaning of &#147;reasonable excuse&#148;. If that is so, there should be no problem in accepting the amendment. Placing an indicative list in the Bill can only assist in explaining the position to the parties involved.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_366"></a><a name="08071794000277"></a>Amendments Nos. 125 to 127 are designed to emphasise that enforcement is purely a last resort. Clause 40 currently does not require local authorities to have taken all reasonable steps to secure voluntary participation in education and training before an attendance notice is issued. Our amendment would clarify the position and ensure that young people are helped through the most appropriate education and training before any formal sanctions are used. There should be a well understood and transparent process that lays down the action that the local authority can take. However, there should also an absolute requirement to avoid a formal enforcement process until such time as all other options have been exhausted. This is a safeguard measure to ensure that local authorities are diligent in upholding their obligations.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_367"></a><a name="08071794000278"></a>The Liberal Democrats also have an amendment in this group that would explicitly make enforcement a last resort, and sensible amendments to limit any potential fines. We must never forget that the young people who find themselves in this sort of circumstance will not have money to spend on fines.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="08071794000279"></a>I had a most interesting meeting with the Reverend Paul Nicholson of the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, which helps young people who face fines. He made it clear that punitive fines can be disastrous&#151;a tipping point where desperate young men turn to theft and young women to prostitution. Those are extreme cases, but the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Garden, are absolutely right to draw attention to this potentially destructive issue. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="08071794000281"></a>We support the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, in seeking a more explicit definition of &#147;reasonable excuse&#148;, and also in the notion that the court should be very

The letter clearly sets out the circumstances that will constitute a reasonable excuse, such as having health problems, being a young carer, giving birth and so forth, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, and stated in the amendment. It also makes it clear that guidance will be issued to local authorities on how to interpret that concept. I do not know when the Government are likely to issue the guidance or whether we shall have sight of it before we come to the next stages of the Bill after the Recess.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="08071794000282"></a>All of these amendments relate to the possible penalties that might be imposed on young people as a result of their failing to respond to any of the encouragements or sanctions from the local authority that is trying to get them to participate in education and training. They were proposed to us by the Zacchaeus trust, which works extensively with young people and knows very well how little money most of them have. It agues that a failure to recognise the depth of poverty experienced by the 10 per cent of young people who need help most will undermine all the good intentions of this legislation.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="08071794000283"></a>Unemployment pay for a 16 to 18 year-old is &#163;47.95 a week. Most do not get that. They are eligible only if they are in severe hardship. But if they are in this category&#151;if they have broken up with their parents and are homeless&#151;&#163;47 a week is still a totally inadequate amount to live on. If they participate in education and training, they are eligible for the education maintenance allowance of &#163;30 a week, but only if their parents apply. Many parents do not apply, partly because they are often poor and illiterate and find it impossible to understand the forms they would have to complete.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="08071794000284"></a>Clause 43 includes appeal arrangements, but on these occasions most of these young people and their parents need help in formulating such appeals. If they do not participate, under the proposals they could be hit in a youth court with a class 1 fine, the maximum of which is &#163;200. Amendment No. 150A suggests that such sanction should be used only as the last resort and asks the Secretary of State to define the circumstances constituting a last resort. Amendment No. 146 suggests that any fine must not take the form of deductions from unemployment. If a young person is receiving only &#163;47.95 a week, he cannot afford to lose any of it. Amendment No. 153 suggests that the issue should always be dealt with in a youth court. I seem to recall that we have already had assurances from the Minister that all of these young people will be dealt with in a youth court, even if they are over 18 when they are brought to court. If the issue has arisen as a result of behaviour before they were 18, it should nevertheless be dealt with by a youth court. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in response to these amendments.</p>

These issues were raised in the final remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. Important points were raised which have prompted me to look into the issue in more detail. It might be helpful if I clarified that my department is working with the Ministry of Justice to develop proposals, possibly involving use of the County Courts, so that a young person could not in any circumstances, whatever their age, be imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a fine for not complying with an attendance notice without a reasonable excuse. The details of how to achieve this greater certainty are being worked on and I shall bring forward amendments on Report if necessary. I reiterate that fines are, in any case, the ultimate sanction for non-participation in education and training. They would arise in only a small number of cases where all other avenues, including the option suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, had been exhausted. These further options are set out in Clauses 39 to 48, which we are continuing to debate today.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="08071794000287"></a>Amendment No. 146, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, relates to fine enforcement methods and the attachment of benefits. It is very rare for young people below the age of 18 to be able to claim jobseeker&#146;s allowance. In the unlikely event that a young person is claiming jobseeker&#146;s allowance and they are found guilty of the offence under Clause 45, they will be liable to a maximum level 1 fine on the standard scale, which is the lowest category available. The maximum level 1 fine is currently &#163;200, but the actual amount in each case is decided and fixed by the courts in the light of individual circumstances. A youth court would take a person&#146;s earnings into account when deciding the level of the penalty and set it at a rate which it believes the young person can pay. Once a fine is determined, it is up to the court to decide how to enforce it. It would not be appropriate to constrain its flexibility in this area. However, I can reassure the Committee that a deduction from benefits order cannot be taken out against a young person who is below the age of 18.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_374"></a><a name="08071794000288"></a>I turn now to the amendments on what must happen before sanctions can be considered. Amendment No. 124, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, would specify in primary legislation what would count as a reasonable excuse. The now much-quoted letter of 13 February from Jim Knight to David Laws outlines in more detail the thinking behind the concept of a reasonable excuse for not participating. I note that the examples given in the letter of what might constitute a reasonable excuse are precisely those which now appear in the noble Baroness&#146;s amendments. However, it was made very clear in the letter that those examples should not be taken to be an exhaustive list. Their purpose was to illustrate the range of ways in which a young person&#146;s circumstances could prevent them participating.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_375"></a><a name="08071794000289"></a>It was also made clear that listing those examples was not meant to suggest that all young people in these situations would always be unable to participate.  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1408"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1408</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>I refer specifically to the position of teenage mothers, which is a particular concern of the noble Baronesses. Teenage mothers will be entitled to reasonable time off around their pregnancy, as are young people who are in compulsory schooling. There will be a range of ways in which they can re-engage in learning when they are ready and they will receive support to do so. In particular, the Government have committed to building a Sure Start children&#146;s centre in every community where teenage parents can access in one place a broad range of support, including childcare, education and training, parenting support and health-related information, advice and treatments.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="08071794000290"></a>In a number of these centres, training in parenting skills, provision to address the mother&#146;s other educational needs and childcare are all integrated, enabling the young person to combine learning and caring for their child. For example, Newcastle-under-Lyme college in Staffordshire runs a learning programme for teenage parents at a local children&#146;s centre where childcare is also provided. As well as working on literacy, numeracy and IT skills, the programme helps participants access other support services for themselves and their children, such as health visitor services. Most participants later progress on to further learning at the college&#146;s main site.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="08071794000291"></a>Similarly, the Pinnacle project in Kent is an area-wide initiative to bring young parents back into education and training. Groups are located in children&#146;s centres, offering multi-agency services as well as childcare, and providing an informal route into education and training through fun and interactive short courses aiming to build confidence and self-esteem along with practical skills. The gradual addition of accredited structured courses leads to the eventual inclusion of formal programmes, including literacy and numeracy work.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="08071794000292"></a>I give these examples to emphasise the importance of putting the appropriate provision in place. If appropriate provision of the kind I have described is put in place, it could be in the best interests of young mothers to engage in education and training alongside their caring responsibilities, and the work of children&#146;s centres could facilitate this in highly positive ways. Teenage mothers often do not achieve the qualifications they need to progress into further education. About 40 per cent of teenage mothers at the moment leave school with no qualifications at all, and those who achieve better long-term outcomes for themselves and their children are, of course, those who gain employment and acquire qualifications at school. Therefore, we believe it is right to encourage, as appropriate, the participation of teenage mothers in education and training.</p>

<a name="80717-0014.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="08071794000293"></a>We will issue detailed guidance to local authorities on how to interpret their responsibilities and how to exercise appropriately their duties in relation to support and powers regarding enforcement action. I cannot say precisely when that guidance will be available. If I am in a position to say more before Report I will certainly do so, but we would not wish to specify the arrangements inflexibly in primary legislation.</p>

A disengaged young person is an indication not just that they have failed but also that we have failed. Reasonable steps are set out under the Bill. Clause 40 makes it clear that a local authority cannot issue an attendance notice until it has taken the initial steps in the enforcement process provided for in Clause 39; namely, giving 15 days&#146; notice in writing of its intention to issue the attendance notice. Under Clause 39 a local authority cannot take those initial steps in the enforcement process until it has ensured that the person has been offered suitable provision and the right support.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="08071794000295"></a>On Amendments Nos. 126 and 127, also in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, we have made it clear that there can be no enforcement where a young person has unaddressed needs or until an appropriate learning opportunity and suitable support have been provided. Clause 39(5) makes it explicit that before a local authority can even give notice of its intention to issue an attendance notice, it must have already ensured that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure that relevant support has been offered to the young person and that the young person has had the opportunity to take advantage of it. As the local authority cannot issue an attendance notice until it has given notice of its intention to do so, and the authority cannot give that notice until the right support has been provided, it follows that an attendance notice cannot be issued until the right support has been provided.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="08071794000296"></a>I can be similarly positive about Amendment No. 150A, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, which seeks to insert &#147;last resort&#148; into the sanctions regime. As I have said repeatedly, the use of any sanctions would indeed be a last resort and should be a stage that is rarely reached. The point of including enforcement provisions in the Bill is to make it clear that the requirement to engage in education and training is real and serious, and for it to have the effect we want in terms of changing public expectations. The Bill already ensures, however, that enforcement action would in reality be a last resort.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="08071794000297"></a>Clause 39 states that the local authority cannot take enforcement action unless it has provided the right support for the young person and enabled him to take advantage of that support. It already states that the authority cannot take action unless the young person is failing to participate without a reasonable excuse. The need for there to be a reasonable excuse is reiterated at every subsequent stage of the process.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="08071794000298"></a>In addition, before taking even the first step in the process, the authority must give the young person the opportunity to make representations. The next step is in essence a final written warning to ensure that the young person can be in no doubt about what is required of them and is given a clear last chance to engage voluntarily. The independent attendance panel provides a route of appeal for young people and an extra safeguard to check that the local authority&#146;s decisions

In effect, therefore, all those provisions together mean that action can be taken only as the last resort.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="08071794000299"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 153, which was moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, seeks to link penalties to the level of educational maintenance allowance. We will consider the amount of the fixed penalty notice closer to implementation to ensure that it is appropriate. As part of this consideration, we will look carefully at the circumstances that many young people are in, including their income, to fix the appropriate level of financial penalty. This will include consideration of the level of financial support provided to young people. However, it does not make sense to link the penalty directly to the current EMA payment levels, as we do not yet know how the future system of financial support will work and it would be inappropriate to link the penalties to it in the way that the amendment suggests. As I say, however, the level that we set will take full account of the level of financial support provided to those under 18 when this comes into force.</p>

I was careful to say at the end that this follows directly from the further work that we have done on the specific issue of those over 18 who have unpaid fines. This eventuality was discussed in previous debates. The further work that we have done on this has led us to conclude that we may need to table amendments to make it categorically clear that in no circumstances whatever could a young person going through the fine enforcement system, which is the last stage of the last stage, be subject to imprisonment. That is probably one part of what the noble Baroness wanted to hear, because linking the regime to the civil courts has been one of her concerns. However, she did not hear absolutely everything that she wanted to hear, I am afraid.</p>

I would feel more comfortable knowing that a definition of a reasonable excuse was somewhere in the Bill, so that these broad categories were universal and it was not perhaps just a postcode lottery. I accept that there will be guidance, but as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, we may not see that guidance before this Bill is passed, although the Minister said that he may be able to do something by Report stage.

I want to say something about having 15 days&#146; notice; this concerns me somewhat. Many of the young people we are talking about may not be living with their parents. They often live with friends, moving around from place to place; it is called sofa surfing. Quite where the letter will go and how they will be able to comply within 15 days causes us some concern.

The intention behind Amendment No. 128 is not, as we have sometimes previously debated, to exclude any category of young person from the provisions of the Bill, but rather to extend the description of accredited education and training to one small and important group of young people. Once or twice in Committee we heard reference to the Rose project. Some of us were privileged to meet the young people who were being helped by the project, thanks to the efforts of my noble friend Lady Verma. We met three quite amazing young people and their dedicated guides and mentors from Havering College of Further and Higher Education.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_394"></a><a name="08071794000316"></a>The Rose project has taken young people who were, because of their mental capacity, absolutely incapable of learning to read and write. These were people at the very lowest range of mental competence. One young woman, moving in her vivacity and enjoyment of life, was described by her father as having been completely withdrawn before she became involved in the project, her head permanently hanging down, incapable of more than minimal speech and totally uninterested in life. What had made that difference? The project had given her well-structured support in a job. Starting with only four hours a week, and with someone permanently at her side in the early stages, she had gradually moved up so that the next thing she wanted&#151;she told us with a great giggle&#151;was to work full-time in Sainsbury&#146;s. I pay full tribute to Sainsbury&#146;s because it has taken on several of these young people. The manager of the store in which Alexandra worked told us that no allowance was made for her and that she was doing a proper job. However, what was crucial was the structured job support she was being given by the lecturers from the college of education.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_395"></a><a name="08071794000317"></a>Alexandra and the two young men we met from the project are never going to follow an accredited course in the formal sense or pass an exam, but their lives have been turned around by this project. Surely we should be able to incorporate such projects into the description of what is acceptable and would meet the requirements of the Bill. We should not exclude these young people and refuse to include them as part of the 16 to 18 group who are to have provision made for them; rather we should say that the kind of structured job support they are receiving could be included. Such young people would themselves feel included, and crucially funding would become available to allow wonderful schemes such as the Rose project to be rolled out more widely in further education colleges in order to support many more young people in this category.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="08071794000318"></a>Alexandra&#146;s father later told us&#151;I use his phrase&#151;that she would literally have no life if this project had not come about. We could help hundreds or even more young people in this extreme category of low mental capacity to turn their lives around and thus become productive members of society. That is such a wonderful dream and is a perfectly proper definition to include in this clause which describes the nature of education and training. The Rose project does not meet any of the provisions in Clause 41, but to me seems to meet entirely what the Government are trying to do. I beg to move.</p>

Those of us who were privileged to attend the meeting arranged by my noble friend Lady Verma with representatives of the Rose project were incredibly touched by the dedication of those running the charity, by the support of the local council and businesses, and most of all by the courage and determination of the young people themselves. It was clear that just to work out which bus to catch to go to work was a major achievement and that it would take more than two years for these young people to work up to the required hours of education or training. We should value what such young people can achieve rather than be too prescriptive. For these reasons, I fully support my noble friend&#146;s amendment.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="08071794000320"></a>Clause 42 establishes attendance panels in each local authority to hear appeals by young people who have been issued with attendance notices. Amendments Nos. 131 and 132 are probing amendments intended to elicit information on how the Government envisage the composition of these panels, while Amendments Nos. 134 and 135 ask how independent they will be. It might be perceived as a conflict of interest if such panels involve members of the LEA against whom the appeal was being made. Can the Minister give the Committee some reassurance on this point.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="08071794000321"></a>Amendment No. 136 would prevent Clause 42 coming into force until the Secretary of State produces an estimate of the cost of these panels. The Bill will place an increasing burden of responsibility on local authorities, but will not necessarily provide the requisite extra funding. If panels turn out to be overly cumbersome and difficult to fund, that may have the undesirable effect of slowing up appeals. Amendment No. 137 probes what the grounds of appeal might be, and whether they include the availability of suitable training provision. Amendment No. 140 seeks to ensure that there is no undue delay for a young person to make their case before an attendance panel. Given the short time during which the duty to participate applies, it seems sensible to make the bureaucracy as expeditious as possible, if that is not a contradiction in terms.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="08071794000322"></a>The purpose of Amendment No. 157 is to ensure that regulations are introduced to direct both the procedure of making appeals and the hearing of such appeals. As drafted, the clause states that the Secretary of State may make regulations about both the procedures for appeals and,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000742"></a>&#147;the powers of an attendance panel&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000563"></a>in hearing appeals. The Secretary of State could, therefore, decide not to publish such regulations, nor to lay them before Parliament for scrutiny and debate. On matters that are clearly judicial or quasi-judicial, there should be clear rules which Parliament scrutinises in some form. The amendment simply replaces the word &#147;may&#148; with &#147;must&#148;, to turn a power into a duty. I hope that the Minister can assist with these points.</p>

My noble friend was, this afternoon, to have been putting the skills that she learnt in coxing to good effect in leading the Lords eight, but I gather that it has been rough and that they did not wish to have an inexperienced cox at the helm. I think that she was replaced there and became a mere bystander, which was a shame.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="08071794000325"></a>Amendments Nos. 129 and 130 both relate to Clause 41, which sets out the description of the education and training that is regarded as being necessary. Clause 41(5) states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_177"></a><a name="08071794000694"></a>&#147;The education or training must&#151;</p>

</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_181"></a><a name="08071794000698"></a>(ii) to any learning difficulty which the person may have&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000564"></a>That is fine in setting it out clearly, but who will judge what is &#147;appropriate&#148; and &#147;suitable&#148;? Local authorities have experts at their disposal on these issues, whom they employ either directly or under contract. Those people are called careers advisers, and go though a relatively long period of training in order to learn those things.</p>

<a name="80717-0015.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="08071794000326"></a>Amendment No. 129 suggests that it would seem appropriate that what is suitable should be,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000743"></a>&#147;in the opinion of a qualified careers adviser&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000565"></a>while Amendment No. 130 gives us a definition of a careers adviser. However, that refers to an earlier definition. I should like to take the opportunity to read out the definition of the careers adviser in Clause 44 of the Education Act 1997. It states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_182"></a><a name="08071794000699"></a>&#147;For the purposes of this section,</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_183"></a><a name="08071794000700"></a>(a) &#145;careers adviser&#146; means a person who is employed by a body providing services in pursuance of arrangements made or directions given under section 10 of the Employment and Training Act 1973 and who is acting, in the course of his employment by that body, for the purposes of the provision of any such services; and</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_184"></a><a name="08071794000701"></a>(b) a careers adviser has responsibilities for any persons if his employment by that body includes the provision of any such services for them&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000566"></a>I do not want to delay the Committee by reading out the lengthy piece from the Employment and Training Act 1973 defining what local authorities should do to provide a careers service, but I hope that your Lordships will take it from me that it is spelt out at some length. If there are people who are trained in these things, it is appropriate that they are employed to give advice about them. I hope the Minister will look kindly on my amendment.</p>

On neither occasion is any mention made of consulting local authorities, yet if they are going to be required to do all these things it is appropriate that in developing these regulations the local authorities should be consulted about setting them up. I am sure the Minister has every intention of doing so, but it would be good if he could give us reassurances that that is the case.</p>

It is not generic learning, it is specific.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="08071794000333"></a>Amendment No. 128, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry, seeks to highlight the whole range of options needed to meet the full range of circumstances faced by 16 to 18 year-olds. I reiterate that young people in full-time education or training will not necessarily have to follow a course that leads to an accredited qualification in order to fulfil the duty to participate. It will already be possible for an attendance notice to specify some form of full-time education or training that does not lead to a qualification, if that is the appropriate thing for the young person. It will also already be possible for an attendance notice to specify part-time accredited education or training if the young

Furthermore, if the young person has a mental health condition, as set out in the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment, that may constitute a reasonable excuse for not participating where Clause 39 prevents an attendance notice from being issued in any case. There will be no question of enforcement action being taken against those who have valid mental health reasons for not participating.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="08071794000334"></a>Amendments Nos. 129 and 130, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, concern the role of careers advisers in advising on the appropriateness of courses. I assure her that no young person should get to the stage of receiving an attendance notice unless suitable learning provision has already been identified for them, and offered to them, along with the right support to take up the opportunity. We believe that a Connexions personal adviser would be the most appropriate person to make judgments on these issues, given their experience and knowledge of the system, the area and the young people within it.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="08071794000335"></a>Amendments Nos. 131, 134 and 135, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, concern attendance panels. I assure her that it is intended that attendance panels will be independent. She asked specifically whether councillors and local authority employees would be members of those panels. We will clarify in regulations that someone employed by the local authority or the education institution in question should not serve on a panel. We will ensure that there is sufficient diversity among panel members and that they reflect the area in which the authority is based. Her Amendment No. 132 stipulates that panels should have three members. We intend that they should in most cases have three members, but we want to consult on whether they should be bigger in more complex cases. It would not make sense to introduce this inflexibility in primary legislation by fixing the number at three.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="08071794000336"></a>As regards the noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment No. 137, Clause 43 requires that local authorities must make arrangements for a young person to appeal to an attendance panel against the attendance notice itself; the description of education or training that they must attend; and any variation in the notice. No grounds are specified so, as drafted, the provision already allows for the young person to appeal against the description on the ground of its suitability or, indeed, for any other reason.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="08071794000337"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment No. 140 concerns the timing of attendance panel hearings. I assure her that we wish appeals to be heard quickly. However, we do not believe it is appropriate to specify in primary legislation precisely how quickly they should be heard. We believe this matter is more appropriately dealt with in guidance, which we will provide to panels to assist them in carrying out their functions. These will be developed by my department in full consultation with local authorities, children&#146;s charities and young people themselves. Similarly, I assure the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, that, as regards her Amendments Nos. 135A and 140A, we will take time in the lead-up to implementation to discuss with local authorities and other stakeholders how panels should be set up and how they should work. We will consult fully on our proposals before drawing up regulations under this  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1417"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1417</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>clause, as well as under Clauses 42(1) and 48(3), as is routine. It is not necessary to put this requirement to consult in primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="08071794000338"></a>Amendment No. 157, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, would change Clause 48 to state that regulations must be made by the Secretary of State. As I mentioned previously, attendance panels are a vital part of the process to enable young people&#146;s cases to be heard by an independent panel. We intend to make regulations, as they are important to define the detail of the process as regards the procedure of panels and their powers in relation to appeals. We state that regulations &#147;may&#148; be made by the Secretary of State, in case they are not necessary and do not have to be made. Changing the text to make the Secretary of State responsible for all these regulations would make no difference to the current situation, as the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families is already responsible.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="08071794000339"></a>On Amendment No. 136, in the name of the noble Baroness, I repeat that the attendance panel is crucial to the effectiveness and fairness of the enforcement system. It will be put in place to ensure that attendance notices are always issued fairly, and that sufficient opportunity and support are given. It provides an additional safeguard to ensure that no young person can enter the enforcement system inappropriately. We will ensure that it is effective and not overly bureaucratic. The impact assessment we published with the Bill estimates the cost of those elements of the enforcement system in which attendance panels would be involved. As I mentioned, we want to consult widely on the composition and operation of attendance panels. In doing so, we will take careful account of the likely costs of their establishment and ongoing functions, which we have committed to funding. It is therefore not necessary to have this requirement written into primary legislation.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="08071794000340"></a>Finally, Amendment No. 141 is a small, technical amendment to make clear for the avoidance of doubt that, where a variation to an attendance notice is provided for under this clause, all the requirements about the description of education or training in the notice still apply as they did to the original notice. The education or training must satisfy the central duty to participate, it must be suitable for the young person and so on.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="08071794000341"></a>I was looking for my note on the Rose project to answer the specific issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. We strongly support its work. Ministers from my department have met with it several times. The Rose project is an example of just the type of best practice we will be looking to expand when ensuring that the system set out in the Bill is fully prepared for learners in all circumstances by 2013.</p>

The Connexions services has been doing quite a good job with a limited number of young people, but if we are to implement this Bill, Connexions will probably need to serve more young people. Is he confident that they will be properly trained, that they will have at their fingertips information on the career and educational training paths for these young people, and be able to provide the necessary advice?</p>

She is right that their responsibilities will be enhanced under the Bill. Part of the reason for the five-year run-in period is to ensure that a sufficient number of suitably trained advisers can fulfil the additional functions under the Bill.</p>

I had not been reassured by his earlier answer, from his brief, to Amendment No. 128. I thought at that point that he or his officials had rather missed the purpose of my amendment&#151;no doubt that is my fault. It was specifically not to exclude from a requirement this category of young person. They do not want to be excluded; they want to be included.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="08071794000346"></a>The point of my amendment was to find a way to include what they need&#151;structured job support&#151;in the definition of fundable education and training. The Rose project is not cost-free. At present it is supported by charitable and local authority donations and so on. If it is to be rolled out on a wider scale for this tiny minority of young people&#151;it is not going to be hugely expensive&#151;it will need to be funded properly. It will need to be caught up within the definition of education and training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_414"></a><a name="08071794000347"></a>Of course I know that severely mentally disabled or mentally ill young people will be excluded from the provision. Reassuringly the Minister has made that clear on many occasions. Yet this is a category that could be rescued. They do not need to be excluded; they want to be included. Anybody who had met them after their experience would know how tremendously valuable it is. I hope that on Report the Minister and his officials will have had another look at the Rose project and that we find some way of including this in the definition of recognisable education and training. In the mean time I beg leave to withdraw my amendment.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_421"></a><a name="08071794000355"></a>These amendments are supported by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. They refer to the constitution of the attendance panel, which we have been discussing, and the young person's interaction with it. We cannot overlook the need for a young person to have the right to be involved at all stages of the enforcement process and to have the chance to present their case to an attendance panel, either in person or through a nominated representative. The young people in question may well have difficulty in expressing themselves, they may not be on good terms with their parents and they may not have ready access to informed, impartial advice. This could make them particularly vulnerable and disadvantaged when facing the prospect of an attendance panel.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_422"></a><a name="08071794000356"></a>Currently, the attendance panel can consider a young person's case at three points in time: first, on appeal against the attendance notice, as set out in Clause 43; secondly, on appeal against the penalty notice, in Clause 48; and, thirdly, at the decision whether the local authority can begin proceedings against the young person for failure to comply with the attendance notice, as set out in Clause 46. It is only at the third stage that the young person has the right to attend the attendance panel to put their case. The amendments would address that anomaly and send a clear message that the young person should be included in the full process.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_423"></a><a name="08071794000357"></a>Barnardo's, which supports these amendments, points out that communication rights are set down in law and in the UN convention; but it also points out that young people are more likely to co-operate if they feel part of the process and have a chance to express their concerns. Being involved may also help them to gain confidence and to develop other interpersonal and practical skills.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_424"></a><a name="08071794000358"></a>On independent advocacy, in Clause 48, it would be highly beneficial to young people and the Government if there were stronger advocacy powers in the Bill. A skilled independent advocate would empower the young person to make the right decision and help them to understand the requirements placed on them and to communicate their views. An advocate would also have the advantage of overcoming the formality of procedures, which may be daunting, and to make sense of language that may be confusing.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_425"></a><a name="08071794000359"></a>This would not involve opening up an enormous process. These young people will form only a small group, and finding positive routes for them at the earliest stage will be of long-term benefit to them and society. We on these Benches strongly support these amendments. I beg to move.</p>

Common to both is a background document, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was open for signature in 1989 and came into force on 2 September 1990. Article 12 has two paragraphs, which I should read into the record. The first paragraph states:</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_426"></a><a name="08071794000361"></a>The second paragraph, concerning advocacy, states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_188"></a><a name="08071794000705"></a>&#147;For this purpose, the child shall in particular be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly, or through a representative or an appropriate body, in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of national law&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000567"></a>The question is not whether we should respond to that article in the way we draft the Bill but at what stage in the process affecting the child it should be brought into effect.</p>

I agree with the noble Baroness that it should be of the utmost importance for a young person, his advocate or his representative to be present at all relevant hearings.

We are also talking about a new set of compulsions&#151;I will not call them more than that. There are concerns about creating a criminal record. We are trying to avoid that and to make certain that it does not happen. Nevertheless, this is a new form of compulsion and it is essential that the child not only has the right to be heard but also the right to have an advocate to help them to express their views. That will be even more important when the child has a learning difficulty. I hope that we will have positive reassurances from the Minister.</p>

Amendments Nos. 133, 138, 139, 151, 158 and 159 would add detail to the attendance panel process. When the attendance panel considers whether it is appropriate for a local authority to begin proceedings against a young person in the youth court, Clause 46 states that regulations must ensure that the young person is invited to make representations to the panel. Clause 46(5) says that the regulations,</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"></a><a name="08071794000366"></a>The noble Baroness&#146;s Amendment No. 133 calls for the provision of independent advocacy to be made available by the local authority for attendance panel hearings. I have described how the young person will be invited to bring someone with them or to send someone in their place. The attendance panel will not be set up like a court; it is not intended to be overly formal or intimidating. Its main role will be to review the circumstances of the case and the steps taken by the local authority and others to ensure that everything possible has been done to offer the young person an appropriate learning place and the right support to re-engage them in learning. Committing to advocacy for all would be unnecessarily bureaucratic and burdensome. However, if the case were to continue to the youth court, the young person would, of course, be entitled to legal representation.</p>

<a name="80717-0016.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_429"></a><a name="08071794000367"></a>We have also committed to consider carefully whether the guidance given to local authorities should indicate that, where young people have specific needs such as problems with communication, there should be an expectation that they will have access to independent advocacy services. I hope that these reassurances go some way towards meeting the concerns raised by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="80717-0017.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_448"></a><a name="08071794000391"></a>The noble Baroness said: The amendment suggests that no penalty can be issued unless the local authority has agreed on a learning support contract with the young person concerned. It goes back to some of the earlier amendments that we proposed relating to personalised learning programmes. I confess that I was slightly surprised to find that we had tabled this amendment right at the end of Chapter 5. The amendment relates particularly to Clause 39.</p>

<a name="80717-0017.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_449"></a><a name="08071794000392"></a>Clause 39 proposes the procedures necessary for a local authority to go through initially if a young person fails to comply with Clause 2, which is on participating in education and training, or work-based learning with sufficient hours of training attached. The young person should either attend school or college full time or find himself or herself work or training with the required off-the-job learning hours. Clause 39(2) states that an attendance notice must be issued and explained to the young person. Subsection (5) states that the local authority must take all reasonable steps to provide support to the young person and give time for that support to get up and running. In Clause 54, which we have not yet considered, the local authority is put under a duty to make available to the young person and to the young adults for whom it is responsible,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000746"></a>&#147;such services as it considers appropriate to encourage, enable or assist the effective participation of those persons in education&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000570"></a>We know from our discussions in Committee that these services comprise the Connexions support and mentoring services that have been developed to help these young people into education and training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_450"></a><a name="08071794000393"></a>Why, therefore, table an amendment that asks for precisely that? The key word is &#147;contract&#148;. The difference between what we are asking for and what is already being offered in the Bill is that we want a formal commitment on the part of the authority to meet the specific needs of the young person in question. We accept that the Bill already places a duty on local authorities to provide this support and that in Clause 55 the Secretary of State will specify in considerable detail what sort of services are to be provided. However, the crucial word &#147;contract&#148; is not there. Just as the Government think it useful to persuade parents to buy into the procedures via parenting contracts, we think that on occasions such as this it would be helpful if the young person concerned were also to recognise that he or she has rights and responsibilities under these procedures. That also means that the local authority cannot duck its duties or responsibilities.</p>

<a name="80717-0017.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_451"></a><a name="08071794000394"></a>As we learnt during the passage of the Children and Young Persons Bill earlier this year, there are perhaps too many occasions when, faced with having to meet the complex needs of highly disadvantaged young people, local authorities or their employees ignore, or just fail to deliver on, the duties of support. A formal contract has advantages in giving both sides clear guidelines as to what is expected. I beg to move.</p>

We are grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, Barnardo&#146;s and Rainer for highlighting this approach and its benefits. We know that an agreement that a young person has signed up to, where they understand their obligations and the consequences of not fulfilling them, can be very effective. We would like to encourage local authorities to pursue this approach or similar successful measures that have been developed locally before considering taking any more formal enforcement action against a young person. We could specify that in our guidance to local authorities.</p>

<a name="80717-0017.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_452"></a><a name="08071794000397"></a>However, while we very much support the idea and the approach, we need to consider further whether it would be desirable to go further and set them out in primary legislation in the way that the noble Baroness suggests. That could risk making learning and support contracts too inflexible and prescriptive to respond to the specific needs of individuals, but I am happy to reflect on this issue further before Report stage.</p>

Nevertheless, I shall leave it to the Minister to speak to them as he sees fit. The amendments are probing. Clause 50 refers to Crown employment and how Crown employees are treated in relation to the duties in the Bill. Amendment No. 160 is designed to find out why there are regulations that institute exceptions and special rules for civil servants that do not apply to 16 and 17 year-olds in other employment. I understand that special modifications to the regulations will be necessary for those serving in the Armed Forces. The amendment has been drafted to keep the regulation-making powers in place but to take out reference to Crown employment. Clause 51 and my Amendment No. 162 deal similarly with parliamentary staff. These are simple points and, as I said, I think that the Minister will be able to deal with them. I beg to move.</p>

We want this kind of work to count for the purposes of the duty to participate, of course, and Clause 50 makes that clear. The definition of &#147;normal weekly working hours&#148; in Clause 5 will need to be modified in relation to Crown employees, as they do not have a contract of employment as such. Regulations made under subsection (2) will enable us to do that. It is appropriate that such technical detail is dealt with in secondary legislation.</p>

<a name="80717-0017.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_461"></a><a name="08071794000409"></a>Government Amendments Nos. 161 and 163 in this group clarify that the duties on employers in Chapter 3 apply to employment in this House and in another place. It is right that this employment should count for the purposes of the duty to participate&#151;and the duties to check that a young person is in educational training and to release them to attend&#151;to ensure that these young people can participate in the necessary learning. However, it would not be appropriate for local authorities to have powers of enforcement against this House or another place. The amendment clarifies that those provisions in Chapter 3 do not apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_462"></a><a name="08071794000410"></a>Government Amendment No. 164 is a consequence of the new clause that we are introducing in relation to House of Lords staff. The relevant definition is included in the proposed new clause and can therefore be deleted from this one. Government Amendments Nos. 165 and 166 are minor and technical. Amendment No. 165 replaces the definition currently in the Bill of a member of House of Commons staff with a reference to an existing definition in the Employment Rights Act.

If a body benefits from the proceeds of its own fines and penalties, there is an inbuilt incentive and pressure to impose those penalties, which removes impartiality from the process.

<p><a name="stpa_472"></a><a name="08071794000426"></a>My colleague Nick Gibb in another place, when making this point, made a comparison with parking fines, which is apt. Parking fines collected by local authorities give them a strong incentive to issue fines. I think the Minister will agree that there is a considerable public perception&#151;accurate or not&#151;that such fines are seen by local authorities as a cash cow. Will the Minister assure the House that the same would not be true of financial penalties levied under this Bill? I beg to move.</p>

As a general principle, it is appropriate for the local authority which receives payments to have control over those sums and to use them for relevant local purposes. Any transfer of the sums to the Secretary of State surely would require additional administration and bureaucracy. It is difficult to see quite what benefit would arise from that. The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, has said that the sums could bring about a conflict of interests, but, realistically, the sums in question under Clause 52 would be payable by employers under Clauses 22 and 28 or by a young person under Clause 47. The likelihood that the local authority will consider these to be useful streams of income is not great. In the case of young people, the sums payable will be small, and recovering them may not be simple. As employers will play a crucial part in delivering work experience for young people, local authorities are more inclined to encourage them to participate, rather than discourage them by issuing penalty notices with a free hand. These safeguards make it unlikely that these powers, if granted, would be misused by local authorities.</p>

Should the financial penalties we have provided for in the Bill be used, it is important that the money received from them can be used to cover the costs of administering the notices so that funding for that is not diverted from other services. It is usual practice for money received by government from the payment of fines to be used in this way. It is also important that it can be used only to administer the process and that income accumulated from fines cannot be used to raise money for the local authority.</p>

However, before the Treasury gets too enthusiastic, I should stress that we do not expect those sums to be great because by 2013 virtually all young people will be engaging successfully in education and training&#151;so successfully, we hope, that they may not even have time to take their driving tests, and the income from parking fines might be accordingly reduced.</p>

It has become government policy not to enforce the requirement that receipts from parking regulations are used only on parking control functions, so they have become a cash cow for local authorities. I encourage the Minister to ensure that when he writes the regulations he gives the Audit Commission, the district auditor or whoever is appropriate a power to inquire into whether a local authority is acting in accordance with the regulations. That is a deficiency in the parking regulations that the local authorities walk through.</p>

First, I draw to the House&#146;s attention my interests as president of the National Training Federation for Wales and as an adviser to a Merthyr charity, Tydfil Training.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_481"></a><a name="08071794000441"></a>Born as I was in 1940, I belong to the first generation of young working class children who were the beneficiaries of compulsory education under the great Education Act 1944. My mother, who was the brightest of us all, had been forced to leave school at the age of 14, as had almost all her generation. Through the Act, we were instilled with the value of and a passion for education, a means by which we could climb out of the pile and avoid going down the pits. It provided opportunities well beyond the expectations of the generation that preceded me.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_482"></a><a name="08071794000442"></a>I reread some of the debates in both Houses on the 1944 Bill. I was pleasantly surprised&#151;although the amount of time it has now taken has shaken me&#151;that Rab Butler and the architects of that Act had aspirations for compulsory education beyond the age of 16 even then. In the debate about continuing education, even as far back as 1944, full-time compulsory education beyond the age of 16 was aspired to. It has taken us more than a generation to reach this stage, and I support the principles of a Bill that is a worthy successor to the Education Act 1944.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_483"></a><a name="08071794000443"></a>I was frankly disappointed that the Welsh Assembly Government have decided not to share the enthusiasm held by many of us from that generation for the principles of this Bill. They make a sincere and powerful case: they believe that they will be able to create in Wales, through an innovative 14-to-19 agenda, an education system that is so attractive that everybody will want to take full advantage of it. I have to suppress my doubting Thomas instincts but I understand the aspirations behind it. To buttress that attractive menu of options, the Welsh Assembly Government are promoting a draft measure to increase learning entitlement for young people aged 16 to 18. They have taken the rather unusual step of publishing the draft measure before bringing forward a legislative competence order so that we can see the thinking behind it as a kind of alternative to accepting the measures in this Bill.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_484"></a><a name="08071794000444"></a>The Welsh Assembly Government have drafted this entitlement measure and put it out for consultation. Unfortunately, some of us have found considerable deficiencies in it. Most are matters which should be debated internally, as they belong to the Welsh debate, but a fundamental one does not: the proposed legislation for a learning entitlement does not cover people aged 16 to 19 who are in employment and not receiving any  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1429"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1429</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>learning or training. We need to reach out to this group who leave school at 16 and enter employment but have no entitlement to further educational training, and this Bill will reach out to them eventually through its obligation.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_485"></a><a name="08071794000445"></a>My Amendment No. 232 seeks to bring one aspect of the Welsh scene within the Bill: people aged 16 to 18 should have an obligation and a right to a form of learning or training in and around the place of work. This is where the growth will and should occur. Where people are already employed is where one hopes to see the greatest opportunities, not only for young people but, I hope, for adults as well. My amendment seeks to cover 16 to 18 year-olds in employment but not in any education or training in Wales, because the proposed draft measures in Wales do not offer a similar entitlement.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_486"></a><a name="08071794000446"></a>Since I tabled my amendment, the Government have come forward with their own. I welcome particularly the linking of the employment measure with the draft measure that might be promoted at some future date by a Welsh Assembly Government. It is important that there is provision in this Bill, as now proposed in my noble friend&#146;s amendment, to allow young people in employment and employers to be covered. Employment law is not devolved, so it could not be promoted as a learning measure in Wales. It must be promoted here. My noble friend&#146;s amendments are very important, as they will entitle and eventually oblige young people from 16 to 18 who are in work to undertake some form of learning in work. I hope that the Welsh Assembly Government will seize the opportunity provided by my noble friend in the Bill and pursue these principles and policies.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_487"></a><a name="08071794000447"></a>In the mean time, what should happen? What should we do to assist and promote learning entitlement for young people who are, or will be, in employment but who do not necessarily receive any training? My noble friend kindly responded to my representations to him and others by sending me an English consultation document on the right to request training. I read it with considerable interest. I understand that it applies to adults and is supposed to complement the provisions in the Bill, but the principles and the model that my noble friend is promoting&#151;the equivalent of the right to educational training and to flexible hours&#151;are very good, and I hope and pray that he will help me to promote that concept to the Welsh Assembly and Welsh Assembly Government so that it can become an extension of learning entitlement for young people who are in work.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_488"></a><a name="08071794000448"></a>Having said that, I sound a cautionary note. There is already provision in law entitling young people in work to educational training. As I understand it, Section 63A of the Employment Rights Act 1996 and a 2001 directive on time off for training are in place. The trouble is&#151;this is anecdotally true of Wales; I do not know whether my noble friend has any figures for England&#151;that this opportunity, this right, has scarcely been exercised. That is why this combination of right and obligation is important. We have bestowed rights on young people in work, but they have not been able to exercise them or they have not done so. Therefore, there is a requirement to combine this obligation and right in the Bill.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_495"></a><a name="08071794000458"></a>I am concerned that Connexions is not the best means of providing the range of advice necessary to assist young people. I do not want unfairly to criticise Connexions; it does very good work. However, it is asked to do too much good work. I addressed the issue when I moved Amendment No. 111, so I do not need to repeat every point I made then. The gist of what I said was that Connexions is now almost too universal. It is not equipped to provide specialist careers advice. An all-age careers service that sat alongside Connexions, dedicated to advising on career choices, as the amendment labels them, would be a much better way of providing the advice and guidance required.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_496"></a><a name="08071794000459"></a>Amendment No. 170 attempts to refine that further, so that young people with special educational needs have services tailored to their needs. Again, we have previously discussed the importance of helping young people with special needs. They should not be allowed to fall through the net because we have not done enough to help them. Amendment No. 176 reflects our desire to support high-quality careers advice and a highly professional careers service. By tying in the various strands of careers advice, we hope to create a strong interconnected system which provides high-quality advice for everyone who needs it. I beg to move.</p>

Amendment No. 171 picks up the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, about special educational needs. We discussed these at some length. The evidence from authorities such as the Prince&#146;s Trust and Barnardo&#146;s which was given in another place before its detailed consideration of the Bill in Committee makes it clear that, given the right guidance, those with learning and behavioural difficulties can be brought back into the learning process, but it can take a great deal of time and patience. Amendment No. 171 picks up the need for support for these young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"></a><a name="08071794000461"></a>The heading given to Part 2 is:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_209"></a><a name="08071794000726"></a>&#147;Support for participation in education or training: young adults with learning difficulties and young people in England&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000462"></a>As the Committee knows, we are specifically considering some of the young people who have learning and behavioural difficulties. Provision for them should go through to the age of 25, as it does for those who ask for statements of their special educational needs. That should be done unless the young people themselves make it clear that they do not wish to pursue such a programme of support over that period. I should also say at this point that we have a good deal of sympathy for Amendments Nos. 169, 170 and 173, all of which make the duty on local authorities more specific and spell out the need to clarify precisely what sort of services are to be provided.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_498"></a><a name="08071794000463"></a>Amendments Nos. 174 and 175 apply to Clause 55, which is concerned with the directions given to local education authorities on the support services they will provide. Amendment No. 174 suggests that rather than giving the Secretary of State discretion in whether to issue directions to local education authorities, he will have to do so, while Amendment No. 175 suggests that those who deliver these services should be properly qualified. It provides that,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000750"></a>&#147;such services must comply with the duties placed on local authorities by sections 8 to 10 of the Employment and Training Act 1973&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000573"></a>To clarify that, Section 44(1) of the Education Act 1997 makes it clear that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_210"></a><a name="08071794000727"></a>&#147;All registered pupils at a school to which the section applies must be provided during the relevant phase of their education, with a programme of careers education&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000574"></a>That means education to prepare pupils to take decisions about their careers and help them to implement such decisions. The same section makes it clear that schools and colleges should co-operate with careers advisers when they are responsible for providing information, advice and guidance and defines the careers adviser as someone employed by the body providing these services in pursuance of these arrangements. That is the definition that I read out on a previous occasion.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_499"></a><a name="08071794000464"></a>Amendment No. 175 makes it clear that the services to be provided under Clause 54 should conform to the pre-existing requirements placed on local authorities to provide proper information, advice and guidance within schools in order to meet their obligations to provide careers advice, and that this should be delivered by a qualified careers adviser as defined in the 1997 Act. These two pieces of pre-existing legislation should assure young people that they will have access to independent and impartial specialist careers advisers. We would like to see this provision in the Bill because there are serious concerns that these duties are not being fulfilled. We want a reassurance from Ministers that the directions to be issued by the Secretary of State will embody the principle and intention that this route to independent advice will be maintained and strengthened.</p>

We should remind ourselves that young people with special educational needs form a high proportion of those who drop off the edge of the world, so to speak, at the age of 16. They end up as NEETs, living rough and in the courts, and generally they form a specific group in need of special support and encouragement which I hope a revivified Connexions service can give. When the Minister responds, I hope that he will address particularly the issue of young people with SEN because as they get older they also form a very high proportion of the prison population and exhibit many other severe social problems.</p>

As I read Clause 55(1), unless the Secretary of State chooses to make directions, the duty is almost empty. A local education authority &#147;must&#148; make available this, that and the other such as it considers appropriate.

<a name="08071794000467"></a><a name="80717-0018.htm_spnew14"></a><b><a name="80717-0018.htm_spnew15"></a><a name="08071794000908"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, wishes to probe on the range of advice and guidance to be provided. I can give her a full description by pointing her toward the comprehensive new quality standards for information, advice and guidance which, over 17 pages, set out in detail the information, advice and guidance that all young people should expect to receive. These new standards will form a key part of the statutory guidance made under Clause 54. I am happy to circulate copies for Members of the Committee to examine. Amendment No. 172 would make it explicit that the local authority must provide,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000751"></a>&#147;generic information, advice and guidance, and ... targeted support&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000575"></a>for individuals. That is set out in the quality standards. We also intend to emphasise their position as a core function of Connexions services through the directions that we propose to issue under Clause 55.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_500"></a><a name="08071794000468"></a>Amendment No. 170 would require that Connexions services should be,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000752"></a>&#147;appropriate to the needs of the young person, including those ... with special educational needs&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000576"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Perry, also raised that issue. Clause 63 provides that,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000753"></a>&#147;a local education authority is responsible for any young person&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000577"></a>who needs a service in that area. That includes those with special needs, and for those young people the duty extends up to age 25. Transferring the responsibility for Connexions to local authorities will enable them to better join up services that support young people with learning difficulties and to share knowledge and specialist resources. In addition, standard 4.8 of the new quality standards to which I referred a moment ago says that,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000754"></a>&#147;additional and sustained guidance and support is provided to those young people who have specific needs (e.g. those with special needs/learning difficulties and/or disabilities, Looked After Children, those with caring responsibilities)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000578"></a>The group of particular concern to the noble Baronesses is therefore specifically highlighted in the new <I>Quality Standards for Young People's Information, Advice and Guidance</I>.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_501"></a><a name="08071794000469"></a>Amendment No. 171, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, would require that young people who need it receive,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000755"></a>&#147;individual support and guidance in order to comply with section 2&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000579"></a>As we have discussed before, it is essential to the success of the Bill that this support is available, and I can reassure the noble Baroness that a number of clauses already provide for it. Clause 10 requires authorities to &#147;promote the effective participation&#148; of young people &#147;in education or training&#148;, while Clause 39(5) requires them to take,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000756"></a>&#147;all reasonable steps to secure that relevant support is offered&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000580"></a>to the young person before an attendance notice can be issued. Clause 54 requires them to &#147;encourage, enable or assist&#148; their,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000757"></a>&#147;effective participation in education or training&#148;.</ul>
<a name="80717-0018.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_502"></a><a name="08071794000470"></a>We realise the importance of that support, which is why we have published the new quality standards and doubled the investment in the Connexions services to &#163;468 million in 2008-09, compared with the level that  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1434"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1434</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the former Careers Service received. We are therefore transferring the service to local authorities, which are best placed to join up and integrate all local services supporting young people, as that will ensure better targeting of individuals&#146; needs and should provide greater efficiencies and free up more resources for the front-line.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_503"></a><a name="08071794000471"></a>Amendment No. 171 goes on to require that &#147;support and guidance&#148; are available to all young people until age 25 or until the person,</p>
<ul><a name="08071794000758"></a>&#147;makes it clear that they no longer wish&#148;</ul>
<p><a name="08071794000581"></a>to receive the service. Connexions services, as Clause 63 states, already provide such support to people with learning difficulties up to their 25th birthday, but apart from those who require an extended transition period because of a learning difficulty, we are unconvinced that most young people, as they approach 20, want the same service as a teenager. We believe that they want an adult service, and that is what the Bill provides. The adult Careers Service is available for all people aged 20 and over and, as we discussed in the previous Committee sitting, the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills has announced that it will introduce a new adult advancement and careers service from 2010-11, which will merge the existing adult Careers Service and work closely with Jobcentre Plus.</p>

<a name="80717-0018.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_504"></a><a name="08071794000472"></a>In addition, Jobcentre Plus provides the New Deal for Young People for 18 to 24 year-olds, which offers support and helps them take stock of their skills and experience and then build on those to create better opportunities for work. The service is available to all young people with a history of being not in employment, education or training. With the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, the Department for Children, Schools and Families will be developing an all-age strategy for career advice to ensure that transitions between services are joined up.</p>

I shall take those references one by one. Section 10 of the Education and Training Act 1973 allows the Secretary of State to make arrangements with local authorities to carry out careers service functions and gives him the power to direct authorities in such matters. I can confirm that the power to make arrangements with local authorities for the delivery of careers service functions was used by the Secretary of State on 25 March this year. The relevant letter was sent to members of the Public Bill Committee prior to Report in another place and copied to Front-Bench spokespeople in both Houses. In addition, we already have a power to issue directions on this matter and will use it if it is deemed necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_508"></a><a name="08071794000477"></a>I am interested in the new quality standards. Again, I would be grateful if the Minister could send us a copy. It would be interesting to see them; as he and others have made clear, the quality of information, advice and guidance services available to these young people is important. There have been some lapses in quality over the past few years. The Connexions service has faced problems by having two different duties cast upon it and insufficient resources to meet those double duties of, on the one hand, providing particular support for the NEET group we have been talking about a great deal and, on the other hand, continuing to provide general advice on careers to all young people in schools. That has been difficult for the service, and there have been occasions when in particular the general advice to young people in schools has been lacking.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_509"></a><a name="08071794000478"></a>I am delighted that the Government have increased resources. It is extremely important that they do so. A great many new developments are in hand, including the web-based advice service which is being set up, and I welcome them all. As we discussed, with the development of the new diplomas and the enhancement of the apprenticeship service, it is extremely important that young people get proper advice and guidance about potential careers. Therefore, it is important that the services should be high quality, and that the Government should make clear the standards they expect to be provided.</p>

I originally tabled Amendment No. 175A to draw attention to the micro-management element of Clause 55. Clause 54 makes it clear that it is the duty of local authorities to provide all-round support, including information, advice and guidance, to vulnerable and ordinary young adults in their care. It is reasonable that, as stated in Clause 54, in fulfilling this duty they should have regard to the directions and guidance issued by the Secretary of State. However, the degree of detail which Clause 55 suggests will be laid down by these directions seems unreasonable. It is symptomatic of the extent to which central government are now micro-managing local government services and removing any discretion from local government. It is no wonder that local democracy is in such a parlous state and that it is difficult to recruit people to stand as councillors and to recruit high-calibre people to work in local government.</p>

<a name="80717-0019.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_518"></a><a name="08071794000489"></a>Having said that my original motivation for tabling Amendment No. 175A was to draw attention to micro-management, the more I look at Clause 55(2), the less I understand it. Therefore, I ask the Minister to explain what it means. Amendments Nos. 176A and 181A are tabled to highlight the fact that all these directions are being wished on local authorities and that these same local authorities and their service providers often have more expertise in these matters than central government because they provide these services on the ground, and therefore should be consulted about the directions that are issued.</p>

<a name="80717-0019.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_519"></a><a name="08071794000490"></a>Amendment No 181A deals with the provision of information, advice and guidance via the internet. As I have mentioned already, I am all in favour of developing these web-based services which, along with others, I see as the future for the information-based services. We must always bear in mind that, besides information, advice and guidance need to be personalised. If local authorities and their service providers are to be the mainstream providers of advice services, they need to play a part in the commissioning of these other services. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_520"></a><a name="08071794000492"></a>The Bill has created a range of duties between various parties in Clause 54. The duty falls on local education authorities to provide services to support young people or young adults with learning difficulties so that they may participate in education or training. These are serious demands to make of a local education authority. We hope that they can be satisfactorily met but that will inevitably cost money and the prioritising of certain goals. At a time when local authorities are being asked to make more and more services available on tightening budgets, each education authority will have to make its own decisions as to how the needs of young people can be catered for.</p>

<a name="80717-0019.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_521"></a><a name="08071794000493"></a>I hope the Government can accept that the nature of a local education authority means that different authorities will have different problems and must be allowed to find individual solutions to those problems. More centrally imposed rules and targets would be unhelpful to furthering the goal of providing support services. If the need arises for the Secretary of State to step in and issue directions, he or she is far more likely to achieve a satisfactory result if he or she has first consulted the local authority, found out what its problems are and worked through with the people on the ground how best to solve them. Any directions he or she gives have then been tailored to fit the needs of that local education authority and the people it serves.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_522"></a><a name="08071794000495"></a>The answer is that he is looking at a picture of himself. It is exactly that sort of circular argument I find in this subsection. Of course I am wrong but the noble Lord will be hard put to prove it.</p>

I also welcome back to the Committee the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, from her great triumph this afternoon, to which reference has already been made in the debate. I had hoped that the race would take so long that the noble Baroness might not be able to join us. I see that she is in fighting form.</p>

<a name="80717-0019.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_523"></a><a name="08071794000497"></a>Clause 55(2) is concerned with the effective delivery of a range of important services for young people. The subsection as drafted makes it clear that directions can require a local education authority to ensure that whoever carries out Connexions functions under Clause 54 also provides other services specified in the direction. According to subsection (3), those services need not relate to education but may relate to social security. For example, it is intended that, if necessary, the  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1438"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1438</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>power could be used to ensure that local authorities and others providing Connexions services are also responsible for conducting a work-focused interview with young people using powers in social security legislation. That ensures that a range of activities that are aimed at helping young people into education, training and employment can be brought together in one place.</p>

<a name="80717-0019.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_524"></a><a name="08071794000498"></a>Let me explain why this is important. We believe that it is very much to the advantage of the young people concerned that the Connexions service, which best understands the needs of young people and how best to support them, also conducts work-focused interviews and other relevant social security functions. It is therefore important that we have the power to direct to ensure that that does indeed take place. The practice over the past few years is that the Connexions service carries out those social security functions for the small number of 16 and 17 year-olds who claim benefits. We want to ensure that that sensible practice can continue. Carrying out those functions will take full account of the actual needs of the young people in question as they are carried out local authority by local authority.</p>

<a name="80717-0019.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_525"></a><a name="08071794000499"></a>Amendment No. 176A would require that, before issuing any directions concerning the Connexions service, the Secretary of State would consult the relevant local authorities and have regard to their views. We are committed to consulting local authorities on the detail of the draft directions and we will do so formally after the Bill receives Royal Assent. We consulted the Local Government Association and the Association of Directors of Children&#146;s Services before issuing the current specifications for Connexions, to which authorities are currently directed to adhere under the Learning and Skills Act and which are identical to the proposed directions under the clause. The organisations raised no objections about authorities being directed in that way. I do not anticipate new objections being forthcoming but we will, as I say, consult them.</p>

<a name="80717-0019.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_526"></a><a name="08071794000500"></a>Amendment No. 181A concerns Clause 59. That clause&#151;subsection (3) in particular&#151;provides the power for the department to contract with an appropriate body to deliver national services, such as the present Connexions Direct service. The noble Baroness&#146;s amendment would require the department to make such arrangements in conjunction with relevant local authorities and their Connexions providers. I am glad to tell the noble Baroness that the department already consults local authorities as part of the procurement process and that an authority representative sits on the project board. In addition, the contractor is required to work with stakeholders in particular authorities and their Connexions providers. It is therefore already our practice to make arrangements for the services in conjunction with authorities and Connexions providers. I hope that that meets the noble Baroness&#146;s concern.</p>

The Minister said that the direction will say that the local authority or the person exercising functions under Clause 54 must be a person who also exercises other prescribed functions; I understand that.

The functions could be exercised by someone entirely inappropriate. There is not anything in the clause, so far as I can see, that says that a local authority has a right to transfer those functions that must be exercised together to someone whom its considers appropriate. The Minister gave the illustration of workplace interviews. Has it got the right to transfer that function to someone whom it considers appropriate? Is there a freedom under that legislation to move the functions that must be exercised together to the person whom it really wants to exercise the functions under Clause 54(1)? This provision simply describes the nature of the person to whom the powers can be transferred and assumes that that person is therefore appropriate to perform the functions under Clause 54(1). I remain confused by the wording.</p>

The functions on which the Secretary of State may make directions under subsection (2) refer to functions that are set out in subsection (1). Those are services of a kind that need to be provided by properly trained and qualified people. I do not think that the services in question could be carried out by, for example, a caretaker; they would need to be carried out by properly trained and qualified people who are employed by the local authority.</p>

Those things set out in Clause 54(1) that must be done by someone properly qualified must be done by someone who exercises other functions. They must be transferred to somebody who is already exercising those other functions. There is something in the legislation concerning those other functions that allows them to be transferred back to someone who is appropriate to exercise those functions under Clause 54(1). I understand what the Minister is saying, but I do not know that the wording of the clause achieves what he says it does.</p>

I am grateful to the Minister also for his reassurances in relation to consultation with both service providers and local authorities over these other functions. Although he says that it is normal practice, these points were raised by the LGA in its briefing on the Bill, and therefore it seemed to me appropriate that we should get from the Minister some reassurance that local authorities would be consulted in this way.

<p><a name="stpa_530"></a><a name="08071794000510"></a>The noble Lord said: With diffidence and apprehension, I broach a subject that is even larger than I realised when I approached it. At Second Reading, I expressed my concern about the extent and consequences of dyslexia and related conditions in schoolchildren and young adults. I start by explaining why I am concerned at, and surprised by, this extent.</p>

<a name="80717-0019.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_531"></a><a name="08071794000511"></a>Official SEN census figures show that only 78,000 children are either statemented or are on school action plans for dyslexia. A recent government-funded study, the <I>No to Failure</I> interim report, has shown that 55 per cent of pupils failing SATs at key stage 1 and 2 are at risk of dyslexia. That equates to around one in five pupils, or 2 million children. These children, on the whole, are not developing as they should. They are a reservoir of potential unrealised and talent unfulfilled. We have touched on the proportion of them who finish up in prison. They will also come under the umbrella of this legislation and as such point to a large hole in my amendment, which does not cover them at all. On Report, when we have the information that the Minister will give us about the situation as he sees it and the Government&#146;s attitude to it, it will be possible to bring that in. I recognise that this approach is in a way tangential to the approach of the amendments that have just been debated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_532"></a><a name="08071794000512"></a>I cannot leave prisons there. If we go down the road towards them, there are pupil referral units. A recent study by Xtraordinary People&#151;a well named organisation&#151;found that 65 per cent of pupils at a particular London PRU were dyslexic. It is established, under the school census figures from the department,

Assuming that only half that number are there for that reason, it still amounts to a colossal amount of money.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_533"></a><a name="08071794000513"></a>The KPMG Foundation, an independent body, reported in 2006 in its Every Child A Reader programme that literacy difficulties cost the nation &#163;2.05 billion a year. I say that slowly and with emphasis, because I hope that it will remain in the Minister&#146;s mind and in that of my noble friend on the Front Bench when the cry goes up that this is all very expensive. It would be amazingly cheap, and even cost-positive, if we got it right.</p>

<a name="80717-0019.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_534"></a><a name="08071794000514"></a>To accelerate things a little, I shall pass over the prison question. I have a whole mass of briefing, which, if I am forced to, I shall deploy on Report. I shall just refer to the Bromley Briefings Prison Factfile. Almost 80 per cent of prison staff state that information accompanying people into prison is unlikely to show that the presence of learning difficulties or learning disabilities had been identified prior to their arrival in prison. Such people are more likely to be victimised than others; they are unable to access prison information routinely; they are likely to receive inadequate levels of support, although I hope that the Bill will put that right; and, because of their impairments, they are excluded from certain activities and opportunities.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/80717-0020.htm"/>


<a name="80717-0020.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_535"></a><a name="08071794000515"></a>Some 20 per cent to 30 per cent of offenders have learning difficulties or learning disabilities that interfere with their ability to cope with the criminal justice system. There is a mismatch between literacy demands, offending behaviour programmes and the skill level of offenders. This is rather like the days before the Plain English Campaign had its effect on government publications, when literature was addressed to people with a reading age of 12 or 14 in the language of someone with an adult reading age. It is no good providing help to people in language that they cannot follow. Prisoners with learning difficulties and disabilities are excluded from elements of the prison regime, including opportunities to address their offending behaviour; the one possible approach to redemption and rehabilitation that they have. That may breach the Disability Discrimination Act.</p>

<a name="80717-0020.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_536"></a><a name="08071794000516"></a>There are legions of these people and they should not be there. A great many of them are there because of failure earlier in their lives, which is why we need to put a system in place in primary and secondary schools that catches them. It is not good enough just to do it at the beginning, because these things can often only be caught later on.</p>

<a name="80717-0020.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_537"></a><a name="08071794000517"></a>What I have in mind is not altogether clear from the amendment, but the amendment, or something like it, would be central to it. In every school, there should be someone sufficiently qualified to identify those who are at risk of dyslexia, dyscalculia, dyspraxia, dysgraphia, Asperger&#146;s syndrome, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, Meares-Irlen syndrome, or a high level of co-morbidity of two or more of any of those conditions. There should be someone in every school who is able to say, &#147;That looks like a possible case&#148;. That should discount at least 57 per cent of the school population. The remainder would be referred  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_1442"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column 1442</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to a central resource&#151;a visiting specialist, or whatever means the Secretary of State devises&#151;who can go through the remainder and identify those at acute risk. Finally, the most highly paid person should be brought in, a specialist for the local authority, to provide the final diagnosis, resulting in a statement or whatever is appropriate.</p>

<a name="80717-0020.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_538"></a><a name="08071794000518"></a>For that to happen, children have to be assessed at appropriate stages. The stages that I have chosen are before his sixth birthday, thereby giving the child time to be established in a school and for the teachers to get to know him or her; in the second year after completion of key stage 1, thereby allowing two years before the next stage, so that the whole programme is not reversed just before the key stage is reached; and in the first year after key stage 2, for the same reason. The way in which this should be done would be prescribed by the Secretary of State. He could say who was to do it and, more important, he would prescribe the qualifications necessary to do it.</p>

<a name="80717-0020.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_539"></a><a name="08071794000519"></a>That brings me to training. The Government have training modules available for awareness of dyslexia and so on, but they are not mandatory. I suggest that there should be a mandatory element of awareness of dyslexia incorporated into initial teacher training programmes. I further suggest that every school inspector should be required to be thoroughly trained in this specialism, so that inspection in this area is properly carried out. I hope that I have made what I intend clear but, if I have not, this is Committee stage and I am very happy to return to my feet. I beg to move.</p>

Noble Lords will know that I have spoken on the matter previously and that I firmly believe, as do many Members of the Committee, that too many children have learning difficulties that go undiagnosed.

I pointed out that spending &#163;2,000 per child at the age of six was infinitely better than spending &#163;60,000 at the age of 16. That remains the case.

<p><a name="stpa_542"></a><a name="08071794000524"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Elton, talked about the need for every school to have someone capable of making that assessment. A great deal of work is going on in training a special educational needs co-ordinator in schools and there is a great deal of CPD training for teachers in this area. In the primary school that I talked about, we have a talented SENCO, who has done and continues to do a great deal. Clearly, the amount of support from local authorities varies enormously from one to another and, in particular, there is a great shortage of educational psychologists. It is extremely difficult in some areas to get any consistent support from educational psychologists. Frequently you get one person, then another and then another. To be classed as requiring school action or school action plus, an educational psychologist must be present.</p>

We get visits from educational psychologists two half days a term, which is just not enough. There are needs and a long waiting list of children to see the educational psychologist for assessment. It is vital that sufficient educational psychologists are trained to support the sorts of services that children need.</p>

There is a huge cost in not addressing this issue much earlier. The postcode lottery aspect, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, said, makes it crucial that more thought is given to how much more attention we can give to dealing with and supporting as far as we can young people with these problems. As has been mentioned, a huge percentage of young offenders in prison suffers from these sorts of problems. If anybody thinks that that is not costly, they have another think coming.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_544"></a><a name="08071794000527"></a>I am glad to hear that teacher training is going on in some areas. A worried teacher&#146;s basic knowledge of when a child needs to be assessed is crucial, but I suggest that there is also a need to have, particularly in larger schools, a governor with training and experience. Training for school governors is not as compulsory as it should be. It takes place in some areas, but by no means all.</p>

I am grateful to the noble Lord for raising it. In support of this amendment, I should say that, yes, to have early diagnosis is immensely valuable, but it must result in the allocation of resources. One knows that local authorities strapped for cash are reluctant to provide the resources required, and one has to be satisfied that the head will use those resources for the purpose for which they are provided; that is, to assist those young people. Perhaps there should be a Bill on this issue in its own right.</p>

I am glad to say that a lot of schools take this issue seriously, pick up early on the conditions that children start school with, and take appropriate action. That is a pretty good formula for being a good school. All the needs of all the children are looked after and they are filled with the enthusiasm for learning which they need, particularly when they start secondary school, which can be a bit of a leap for many. It is just good practice, but it has not spread as it should have done. Perhaps that is because the connection between spending money up front and saving it later has been allowed to loosen. Given best practice, it should save us a lot of money, although it involves spending money now rather than waiting until there is a crisis later.</p>

Planned local authority expenditure on special educational needs has increased from &#163;2.8 billion in 2000-01 to &#163;4.9 billion in 2007-08. Of course, the issue is to see that the money is spent wisely and that it is dedicated to special educational needs once it goes into the general budgets of schools. To ensure that that takes place, we need the eternal vigilance of governors, notably those with particular responsibility for special educational needs, such as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp. The role that she performs on her governing body is essential to ensure that the interests of students with special educational needs are properly safeguarded.</p>

<a name="80717-0020.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_545"></a><a name="08071794000533"></a>The issue, as ever, is how far we prescribe from the centre, which we need to keep under review. Elsewhere in our debates we are criticised for unduly prescribing to local authorities, let alone to schools, what they should do. Having earmarked this funding and seen that it is provided to local authorities, and making the requirements that we do in terms of the duties on governing bodies, we depend on them to take their responsibilities with the seriousness that I know the

I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, in her role as president of the National Governors&#146; Association seeks to reinforce with governors the acute importance of their responsibilities in respect of special educational needs. We support the NGA and governors in advice and guidance that we provide. Most local authorities provide training in this regard, but we need all local authorities to rise to the standards of the best.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_546"></a><a name="08071794000534"></a>As Minister with responsibility for special educational needs, I completely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Elton, on the importance of early identification and intervention. All maintained schools have an ongoing statutory duty to identify and make suitable provision for children with special educational needs. As the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, said, the special educational needs code of practice highlights early identification and intervention as an important feature of effective provision for SEN.</p>

<a name="80717-0020.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_547"></a><a name="08071794000535"></a>We are promoting greater awareness and improved confidence in recognising and addressing children&#146;s special educational needs through our inclusion development programme. The first phase of that, which is a systematic programme of training for teachers, includes resource materials for early education providers, schools and initial teacher training institutions on dyslexia and speech, language and communications needs. Subsequent phases will produce similar materials for autism and behavioural, emotional and social difficulties.</p>

However, we are introducing new units into initial teacher training in respect of the undergraduate course followed by a large proportion of primary teachers. Of course, it is at the primary level particularly that early identification is needed. Those units within the undergraduate teacher training course have been piloted successfully. A few weeks ago I attended a launch event with all undergraduate providers of teacher training courses to make those units available to them and strongly to urge that all providers include them within their undergraduate courses. I did so alongside Sir Jackie Stewart, a tireless champion of improvements in teacher training in this area. He made an impassioned case for all providers to ensure that they embed these units within their courses.</p>

The pilots were successful and the universities that were engaged in them have strongly urged other university departments to take up these new units. I shall keep the noble Lord informed about progress in the take-up. But, as I said, we have not gone to the final stage of making them mandatory because I am conscious of the balance that we need to keep between urging good practice on local authorities, schools and university departments, and making effective provision available to them, but not seeking overly to prescribe precisely what they should do in respect of their own provision.</p>

<a name="80717-0020.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_550"></a><a name="08071794000540"></a>However, we have gone that stage further in mandatory training for special educational needs co-ordinators in schools, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, referred. Every school must have a special educational needs co-ordinator. We reviewed the position of SENCOs long and hard and we decided two years ago that we would make their training mandatory and accredited nationally. We are in the process of introducing that training and discussing with the teacher associations how we can do so in a way that meets the needs of SENCOs and leads to a significant improvement in the competence with which they carry out their functions.</p>

<a name="80717-0020.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_551"></a><a name="08071794000541"></a>We are prepared to consider mandatory measures where we believe they are critical to improvements in schools. No one is more important to the overall provision of special educational needs services in a school than a SENCO. It is essential that there is one senior teacher who has a thorough grasp of the school&#146;s responsibilities in this area, and that is why we have taken the step of requiring mandatory training for SENCOs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_552"></a><a name="08071794000542"></a>The Children&#146;s Plan, which we published last December, announced funding of &#163;18 million further to improve school workforce knowledge, skills and understanding of special educational needs through initial teacher training and continuing professional development. That &#163;18 million is funding, among others, the developments that I outlined to the Committee a moment ago.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_553"></a><a name="08071794000543"></a>Furthermore, in May this year, the Government asked Jim Rose, who conducted the 2005 review of the teaching of reading in primary schools, to make further recommendations on the identification and teaching of children with dyslexia. We expect to receive Sir Jim&#146;s recommendations early next year. He will look in particular at the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Elton, as to the provision of more specialist teachers able to carry out functions, including assessments. He will take account of developments since 2005, including the Every Child a Reader programme referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, which we introduced in conjunction with KPMG. It is a great example of the Government working in partnership with charitable and other agencies to bring about change.</p>

Reading recovery is an intervention programme targeted at five and six year-olds who are experiencing difficulty with learning to read; we are significantly expanding it over the next three

Sir Jim Rose played a crucial part in our decision to allocate substantial government funding to the Every Child a Reader programme, which is taking forward reading recovery. For all the reasons set out by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, we believe that every penny of this is well spent in promoting the capacity of children to engage properly in learning at a later stage and avoiding all the dangers of young children falling into patterns of unproductive behaviour, as the noble Lord, Lord Elton, set out. We are doing a great deal in this area, and I believe it is leading to a sustained improvement in provision for children with special educational needs, but I fully accept that there is always more to be done.</p>

The Minister can comfort himself with not only KPMG&#146;s figures but also the Prince&#146;s Trust&#146;s figures. It reports that &#163;70 million is lost to the economy per week due to educational underachievement in terms of productivity resulting in foregone income. The amounts of money to be saved are enormous. As I said to start with, we are looking at a great pool of potential unrealised and talent unqualified. I conclude by saying:</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000010"></a>The noble Lord said: Healthcare-associated infections affect approximately 9 per cent of in-patients, cause at least 5,000 deaths per year and contribute to a further 15,000 deaths a year. Furthermore, 300,000 or more patients acquire non-fatal infections that prolong their stay in hospital. In England alone, this leads to a loss of 3.6 million bed days, at an estimated cost of &#163;1 billion per year.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000011"></a>Regular headlines in the media such as:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071785000168"></a>&#147;How dare we let these dirty hospitals kill 8,000 a year?&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071785000155"></a>cause a great deal of public concern. It is not surprising, therefore, that patients are concerned about going into hospital for treatment for fear of catching these infections, which may prove fatal.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000012"></a>There are several infective agents responsible for healthcare-associated infections. The two that are currently of major concern are meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus&#151;MRSA&#151;and Clostridium difficile, or C. diff. Others are glycopeptide-resistant enterococcus&#151;GRE&#151;which can cause blood poisoning; norovirus, which causes mild, short-lived gastroenteritis, the so-called winter bug; and various pseudomonas species, which cause a range of illness, mainly in the elderly. I have no doubt that unless we have a successful strategy for controlling healthcare-acquired infections, there will be other infective agents in the future, possibly even more deadly than the ones we have now.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000013"></a>Government policy currently focuses on infections due chiefly to MRSA and, to a lesser degree, C. diff. Staphylococcus aureus is a common bacterium, found in skin or mucosa. MRSA is a variety resistant to antibiotics, including meticillin. About 3 per cent of people are carriers. Infections occur when bacteria enter the body or bloodstream, usually via a cut or catheter, commonly during surgery via wounds or

They can also do so via intravenous catheters or breathing tubes. They cause deep abscesses or septicaemia.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000014"></a>Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, a bacterium found in the gut of 3 per cent of adults and nearly two-thirds of babies, is harmless in healthy people, but in ill, elderly patients, and in conjunction with antibiotic therapy, can cause severe colitis, perforation of the bowel and death. It is highly infectious and, importantly, spores shed in faeces are hardy and survive for long periods on surfaces such as toilets, sheets, beds and floors. Both MRSA and C. diff are transmitted from person to person and may be picked up from environmental contamination.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000015"></a>From what I have just said about the nature of transmission of infection by these organisms, it is clear that simple measures of cleanliness&#151;personal and environmental&#151;judicious use of antibiotics, and a stringent policy of &#147;search and destroy&#148; can drastically reduce the incidence of such infections from 9 per cent of in-patients to as low as 1 per cent.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000016"></a>The UK is one of the worst countries in western Europe for the incidence of MRSA and C. diff infections. So do we have a policy that will change that? To know whether we have an effective policy, we first need good surveillance. Since the introduction of mandatory reporting of MRSA and now C. diff infections acquired in hospitals, the surveillance of hospital-acquired infection is now reasonably good but not accurate. On the other hand, for healthcare-acquired infections acquired in the community setting, surveillance data are poor. That is particularly important, as more healthcare is now delivered in the community, so I ask what plans the Government have to collect information on community-acquired healthcare infections.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000017"></a>Healthcare-associated infection as a cause of or associated with death is also poorly recorded on death certificates, as was the case in the Clostridium difficile outbreak in the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust. The death certificates did not indicate that the patients had died of C. diff infections.</p>

For MRSA blood-stream infections&#151;so-called bacteraemia&#151;in the financial year 2006-07 the numbers were 6,381. Data from 2007-08 are not yet available, unless the Minister has them today. The trend has been downwards except for the last quarter, October to December 2007, which showed an increase of 0.6 per cent on the previous quarter. The Government have a target of halving MRSA blood-stream infections from 7,700 in 2003-04 to 3,850 or fewer in 2007-08, unless how the target was to be measured was not as I understood it. Will the Government meet that target? Maybe halving the rate of 2003-04 was ambitious, but it is important to maintain the pressure to drive down the rate.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000019"></a>For C. diff, the surveillance data are difficult to interpret due to changes introduced over time. Between 2004 and 2006, the numbers of C. diff infections rose from 44,000 to 55,000. Quarterly data for October to December 2007 compared to the same period in 2006 showed a 26 per cent reduction. The Government introduced a target for C. diff in 2007 of reducing the number by 30 per cent by March 2011&#151;nearly three

Again it is unclear how the target would be measured. I seek clarification from the Minister.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000020"></a>Have we got the policies to achieve the targets and beyond? In 2002, we had the CMO&#146;s <I>Getting Ahead of the Curve</I> strategy, and many other follows. In 2003 there was <I>Winning Ways</I>, in 2004 <I>Towards Cleaner Hospitals</I>, in 2005 <I>Saving Lives</I>, in 2006 <I>Essential Steps to Safe, Clean Care</I>, in 2007 <I>Saving Lives: Reducing Infection, Delivering Clean and Safe Care</I>, and in 2008 <I>Clean, Safe Care: Reducing Infections and Saving Lives</I>. They outline plans to introduce MRSA screening for patients but not staff, deep cleaning and additional specialist staff to tackle infection. In addition, we have the Health Act 2006, requiring NHS trusts to follow recommendations and the Healthcare Commission&#146;s annual checks. There are also financial penalties and incentives. Certainly, there is no lack of commitment to tackle the problem of healthcare-acquired infections.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000021"></a>So are the policies and strategies effective? Despite lack of strong evidence of environmental contamination and infection rates, the policy related to hospital cleanliness and deep cleaning is right. Clean hospitals instil public confidence and a culture of the importance of hygiene in staff. If there are any concerns, it is about whether deep cleaning is carried out in all areas of hospitals, how often it is and should be carried out, and what agents are used.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000022"></a>Countries that have very low levels of healthcare-acquired infections have stringent policies for monitoring levels of environmental contamination and decontamination. While there might be contrasting views of deep cleaning as an effective strategy, there is no doubt that hand hygiene is the single most effective measure for controlling the transmission of infection in all healthcare settings. I declare an interest as chair of the National Patient Safety Agency, which is responsible for the cleanyourhands campaign.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000023"></a>Hand washing with soap and water and use of alcohol gel after each and every patient contact have to be more actively enforced in healthcare, as they are in the food-handling industry. In my view, to cause a death by transmission of infection is in the same category as death caused by wrong diagnosis, treatment or bad surgery. The clinical professions need to accept greater responsibility.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000024"></a>The policy of &#147;bare below the elbows&#148; may facilitate hand washing, but the removal of clean, hospital-provided white coats and nurses&#146; uniforms on a daily basis is a retrograde step. On the other hand, the wearing of operating-theatre and ward clothing in cafeterias and other public areas in hospitals should be prohibited with sanctions.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000025"></a>The most recent government policy relates to the introduction of patient screening for MRSA for elective admissions in 2008&#151;I do not know when in 2008&#151;and for emergency admissions during the next three years. Countries that have low levels of infection have not only policies of screening all patients and staff but also low bed occupancy, low levels of workload for nursing staff and a strict policy of isolation of infected patients.</p>

<p><a name="08071785000026"></a>Strategies that we are slowly beginning to adopt have still some way to go. The public are rightly anxious about healthcare-associated infections. Patients fear going into hospitals. Any Government who deliver clean hospitals, healthcare in a clean and safe environment and effective infection control policies, followed and adhered to by all, will remove healthcare and the NHS from politics. Would that not be a prize worth having?</p>

He chairs the National Patient Safety Agency, which campaigns to improve patient safety. What can be more important? One of its projects was cleanyourhands, a national campaign to promote better hand hygiene in hospitals that began in 2005. In 2007, the programme was extended to other providers such as care homes and community clinics. If the campaign does not exist in schools, it should. Children should grow up realising how dangerous it is not to wash their hands, especially when handling food after going to the lavatory. People from eastern Europe whom I employ at home seem to wash their hands much more than British people.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000028"></a>Washing one&#146;s hands with soap and water is the best way of protecting patients, as the gel does not work on the highly infectious Clostridium difficile. I have heard of nurses who have gone from patient to patient while not washing their gloved hands. They think that washing is not necessary if they wear gloves.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000029"></a>The wife of a severely disabled man in Yorkshire who had had MRSA and is fed by a peg in his stomach asked a nurse whether her husband had had a check to see whether he still had MRSA. The nurse said, &#147;Well, if he does have a check and it is positive, it will give us a lot more trouble as he will have to be barrier nursed&#148;. I wonder how many such cases there are across hospital trusts. Infection control nurses should be able to take responsibility and have great support in stopping such dangerous attitudes among such lazy nurses.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000030"></a>Much has been done in the past few years and the Government have tried hard to reduce hospital-acquired infections, but there is much more to be done. One still hears of sloppy practices such as that described to me by the wife of a high-lesion tetraplegic man. Her husband had a chest infection and had gone into hospital. On the Friday, when he went home for the weekend, his sputum jar was sitting on a shelf by his bed, but when he returned on Monday morning it was still there and had not been emptied. In the old days, a sister on the ward would have seen that such things were done and jars not left unclean.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000031"></a>The grandson of one of my friends was admitted to the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle for a serious heart condition, aged one. The operation took many hours and was a success, but unfortunately he contracted MRSA. The family cannot praise the hospital team enough and, after many critical days, little George pulled through. Hospital infections put extra strain on everybody. In this case, a dedicated skilful hospital team and the family had much more anxiety due to MRSA. Does the Minister agree that prevention of hospital-acquired infection should be at the top of the agenda?</p>

<p><a name="08071785000032"></a>It is said that patients should be screened when they come into hospitals or care homes, but should not the medical and nursing staff be screened as well? If they are working with vulnerable patients, how many might become carriers and put patients at risk?</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000033"></a>One often hears of bad practice such as clean laundry being brought in and left beside dirty laundry. Surely it is possible with such a large staff to put in a manager who could take responsibility for seeing that good practice takes place.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000034"></a>I am pleased to be associated with the National Concern for Healthcare Infections, which aims to raise awareness, and give support, on patient safety. It asked me to be its patron, and I accepted. Does the Minister agree with the guidelines to tackle hospital-acquired pneumonia? This is the most common hospital-acquired infection in intubated patients, increasing mortality by up to 75 per cent. When hospital-acquired pneumonia is caused by bacteria, treatment will always be with antibiotics. However, the increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance, largely due to inappropriate use of antibiotics, has made its management more complicated and has led to a rise in hospital-acquired infections as a whole.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000035"></a>A key driver in developing the guidelines was to minimise the number of preventable deaths from HAP due to any cause. The new guidelines set out the importance of prevention, diagnosis and early treatment and ensuring the right antibiotic is used at the right time. There should be fast-track testing and results, otherwise wide-spectrum antibiotics will continue to be used. What chance is there of this action happening?</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000036"></a>Consideration needs to be given not only to acute NHS trusts which provide general facilities for the public, but to specialist hospitals which treat patients who are susceptible to many other infections, including campylobacter&#151;with almost 50,000 patients affected in 2006.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000037"></a>Many impaired people are susceptible to the development of pressure sores. This presents another avenue for bacteria, such as MRSA, to enter the bloodstream or infect the skin around the lesion. As president of the Spinal Injuries Association, I know the terrible problems pressure sores can have for vulnerable patients treated in hospitals which do not have the correct equipment, such as turning beds and pressure-relieving mattresses. I hope that the new Care Quality Commission will include precautions being taken by healthcare establishments to prevent pressure sores in its assessment and inspection regime.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000038"></a>The terrible problems of the virulent strain of 027 Clostridium difficile have been highlighted by the Healthcare Commission&#146;s reports on Stoke Mandeville Hospital, and Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells. Is C. difficile a notifiable condition? There is some confusion over whether notification is voluntary or statutory. Can the Minister make this clear?</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000039"></a>Many infections put patients at risk, such as E. coli, Klebsiella, wound infections other than MRSA and many others. If infection prevention and control measures in hospitals are to be successful, this area of the budget should be ring-fenced, in terms of staff employed in infection control, developing general staff awareness and training in good practice for all staff who directly  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC144"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC144</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>or indirectly come into contact with vulnerable people. Without adequate finance to support measures identified as the result of professional research, these initiatives will flounder.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000040"></a>Many projects need looking at. I have recently had correspondence with Dartex Coating about the product Silver 3, a coating for hospital mattresses for which it is claimed that tests have shown that it kills 99.9 per cent of MRSA within 24 hours. Dartex believes that Silver 3 can play a major role in combating hospital-acquired infections. I hope that more research will be done on these matters.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000041"></a>MRSA does not like cold conditions. Should hospital floors be washed with iced water? The elimination of hospital-acquired infections would improve the dignity of life for vulnerable patients as well as their quality of life, which can be shattered if they get an infection such as Clostridium difficile. The Darzi report stresses the quality of care. If this is to be taken seriously, infection control must be the top priority.</p>

<p><a name="08071785000042"></a><a name="80717-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80717-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08071785000196"></a>Lord Teverson:</b> I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Patel, for giving me the opportunity to get involved in this subject, which I do not normally do. I come from a medical family; my father was a GP, my mother was a midwife and my brother is a GP. I was the black sheep of the family who went into commerce and then, even worse, into politics. At least I now have a chance to make a contribution to the area.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000043"></a>We are all aware as citizens of the astounding statistics, of which the noble Lord, Lord Patel, has mentioned a number: the 300,000 cases of hospital-acquired infection per annum; an estimated 5,000 deaths; the UK&#146;s performance being the fifth worst of 29 European nations; and a potential cost of &#163;1 billion to the NHS. Even more important, as the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, said, is the movement of resources and skilled people into coping with those areas rather than those with which they would rather be dealing. Statistics that came out today include some 10,000 C. difficile cases over a quarter year and, over the past four years, 200,000 cases of C. difficile and 20,000 cases of MRSA.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000044"></a>Although those statistics are staggering and abrupt in their own way, the issue is more important than that. These infections, in particular, bring real fear to those who must deal with the NHS and are not well. Over the past couple of years, people have, for the first time, hesitated about being admitted to hospital. We cite the statistics, but there are people who have decided not to have hospital treatment because of their concern about this area.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000045"></a>As people in politics and Parliament, we must ask ourselves whether that is because of the tabloid press scares, like the scare over street crime, which is a real issue in certain areas but does not necessarily affect where we are and our lives. Is people&#146;s fear greater than the risk? I do not think it is, because even I know a person who died and other people who have been affected by these diseases. It is far less remote than many other things that we get involved in.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000046"></a>What are the issues here? One of the causes is the problem with cleanliness, but I have been aware for some time of the abuse and overuse of antibiotics.  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC145"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC145</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>When I was a youngster, I was put on tetracycline&#151;I can still remember its name and think it is an antibiotic, but perhaps it is not&#151;for some three years, just in case I reacquired an infection that I had had earlier. I am sure that practice would not now be acceptable. We used antibiotics regularly in veterinary care. We fed animals antibiotics to make sure that they did not stand a chance of getting infections. Clearly, the mismanagement has meant, as the BMA put it in one of its documents, that life-saving technology has become life-threatening. Is the Minister confident that the management and use of antibiotics for humans and animals means that that is no longer a problem? We have that problem with malaria, in particular.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000047"></a>I am sure that my mother would have been concerned by the way that cleanliness got decoupled from medical care in hospitals and similar establishments. I am sure that the focus on that is much better because we have seen the improving figures on these infections over the past year. However, I question whether cleanliness is at the heart of medical as well as administrative practice. Having been in hospitals a number of times over the past year because of a family member, I was struck by how little the washes, which we do not think are completely effective, were used by visitors and medical staff when moving around hospitals.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000048"></a>Does the Minister believe that screening patients as they come in and isolating them if necessary is successful? Does it need to be applied more? Where are we on that?</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000049"></a>My other concern, which comes from my management career, is about judging people against targets. It is right in principle, but there are unintended consequences of keeping targets in place for too long and managing people&#146;s performance too carefully. One aspect of that is the bed occupancy rate. What are the Minister&#146;s views on the correlation between hospital-acquired infections and bed occupancy rates? The evidence seems to show that where the rate is above 85 per cent there is a positive correlation with cases of infection. I should like to know whether the Government accept that correlation. If so, surely that means that we have to manage the whole area of bed occupancy, which in every other way is clearly a measure of a hospital management&#146;s efficiency. It can be fantastic but, if patients are killed on the way, that is not quite so good. It is a question of how we should look at those sorts of targets.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0001.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000050"></a>A final area on which I should be interested in hearing from the Government is nursing homes and homes for the elderly. Those come outside the hospital arena and therefore may go slightly beyond the subject of the debate, but they carry the same importance in that they have many vulnerable people facing similar threats. What actions are the Government taking and what plans do they have to deal with the problem in that area, which is not highlighted much, or perhaps greatly understood, in the media? Does the Minister see that as a threat to the reputation of healthcare more generally in this country? Most of all, we all want to see hospitals where patients&#151;you and I&#151;can be confident that they are going to be healed and will not feel that they are risking their lives even more by engaging in their services.</p>

It is a question of the first importance for healthcare in our country. If we want a comparison to put the matter into proportion, almost three times as many people are killed by hospital-acquired infections every year as are killed on our roads. The figures look as though they may be on a downward trend and some encouraging statistics have been released today, which no doubt the Minister will be able to refer us to in detail. However, over the 15 years from 1990, the graph showed a massive rise. The increase in C. difficile infections was fiftyfold, and looking simply at the five years to 2006, deaths from C. difficile went up by more than 400 per cent.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000052"></a>It would be unfair to accuse Ministers of having done nothing. They have actually done an enormous amount. The problem has been that the various levers that they have pulled to try to stem the tide have had only a minimal effect so far. In 2002, as the noble Lord, Lord Patel, said, we had <I>Getting Ahead of the Curve</I>&#151;the first of a whole swathe of strategies and action plans to improve hospital cleanliness, all of them with wonderful, optimistic-sounding titles. There was <I>Winning Ways&#151;Working Together to Reduce Healthcare Associated Infection in England</I> in 2003; <I>Towards Cleaner Hospitals and Lower Rates of Infection</I> in 2004; <I>Saving </I><I>Lives: A Delivery Programme to Reduce H</I><I>ealthcare </I><I>A</I><I>ssociated </I><I>I</I><I>nfections including MRSA</I> in 2005; <I>Essential </I><I>Steps to </I><I>Safe</I><I>, Clean</I><I> Care</I> in 2006; and, this year, <I>Clean, Safe Care: Reducing Infections and Saving Lives</I>. On top of all that, we have had national guidelines, sanctions and targets. Each of these in its own way has been of unimpeachable worthiness, yet last year&#146;s annual health check by the Healthcare Commission found a lower level of compliance with the three main standards in the hygiene code than in the previous year.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000053"></a>The noble Lord mentioned the cleanyourhands campaign. Good hand hygiene has been described as the single most important measure for controlling transmission in healthcare settings. Contrary to all the sound and fury generated on the subject of ward cleanliness, it now seems that there is not a simple or direct association between the visible cleanliness of a hospital and its infection rates. Of course, that is not to say that cleanliness should count for nothing&#151;of course, it should&#151;but it is not the most significant driver, so it appears, in the direction of travel.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000054"></a>Still less is it the case that a hospital&#146;s infection rates can be linked to whether it contracts out its cleaning, or indeed how much its cleaning budget amounts to. Despite that, we recently had the deep clean initiative. There is no evidence that the deep cleaning of hospitals is a cost-effective use of funds. To be quite brutal about it, it is a populist gimmick. Dr Stephanie Dancer, an expert in microbiology, warned last year that deep cleaning would have only a very short-term impact. She was right. The Countess of Chester Hospital, which spent &#163;300,000 on a deep clean, suffered a C. difficile outbreak four days later, when 26 people became infected. When he made the announcement  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC147"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC147</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>last year, the Prime Minister promised that deep cleaning would be repeated at least every 18 months, but we now know from Written Answers that there are no plans to repeat the first deep clean exercise and no plans to assess how effective the first deep clean actually was. Perhaps that is understandable, because it turns out that the majority of hospitals did not use the key products recommended by the Health Protection Agency, such as hydrogen peroxide vapour. No one should think that deep cleaning of itself will make more than a tiny dent in the statistics.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000055"></a>One real criticism that I have of Ministers is that at intervals they have been guilty of instilling false hope and false expectations in the minds of the general public. I know that at party conferences hyperbole tends to intrude, but last year, when the Prime Minister launched the deep clean programme, he said that it was intended to,</p>
<ul><a name="08071785000178"></a>&#147;make sure every hospital is clean and safe&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071785000156"></a>He should not have said that. Not only was there no evidence base for saying it, but no work had been done to assess how the &#163;62 million that it cost to carry out the deep clean might have been more effectively spent.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000056"></a>In January, the Prime Minister went on the &#147;Andrew Marr Show&#148; and made an impressive-sounding promise. He said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071785000169"></a>&#147;If you go to hospital, you will get screened by next year for MRSA or C. difficile&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071785000157"></a>There was no correction of that story from any government source, but two days later the Health Secretary's infection control strategy reported on C. difficile and said this:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071785000170"></a>&#147;Screening for colonised patients is inappropriate. (Most potential cases would not be identified ...)&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071785000158"></a>In other words, screening for C. difficile is not going to happen, because it is pointless. Mr Brown should not have said what he did.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000057"></a>By contrast, screening for MRSA in high-risk patients is potentially very worth while. The Government have proposed that MRSA screening should be introduced for all elective admissions in 2008, and all emergency admissions as soon as possible after that. The problem here is that screening in a hospital setting is logistically complicated. For a start, you need enough space in which to isolate the carriers. Many hospitals do not have that, in part because they are constantly chasing the 18-week target for referral to treatment and the four-hour A&amp;E waiting time target. Beds get full. Again, we have had extravagant promises about isolation facilities, first of all in <I>Winning Ways</I>, and then from John Reid in 2004, who assured us that new hospitals being built had more isolation rooms than ever before. But what do we now find? Last November the Health Protection Agency reported as follows:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071785000171"></a>&#147;Three quarters of trusts indicated that they had problems implementing isolation policies due to inadequacies in the number and fitness for purpose of isolation rooms&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000058"></a>Isolation cannot just happen at the wave of a wand. As the MRSA working group pointed out, conventional screening takes three to five days. There are rapid screening techniques, but they are expensive and difficult to perform in large numbers. Reducing rates of MRSA by screening is going to be an uphill battle.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000059"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, referred to bed occupancy rates. I do not think that one can cite them as the prime or only contributor to rates of MRSA infection. But what high bed occupancy often means is that hospitals are left short-staffed and pushed for time, so that hand hygiene is not always maintained. Increasingly, hospitals have had to resort to hiring temporary staff, whose knowledge may be more limited and whose access to sufficient training may be constrained by lack of time and resources. Significant or not&#151;I leave the matter open&#151;it is a fact that the Netherlands, which has a low incidence of MRSA infection, has a bed occupancy rate of only 64 per cent.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000060"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, spoke of the need for good management and leadership in hospitals. She is right but, as she knows, the issue goes deeper than that. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, was kind enough to give me an article from the recent <I>Bulletin of the Royal College of Surgeons</I><I> of England</I>, which is called &#147;Changing the Mindset on Hospital Infections&#148;. That title encapsulates it. If we are to crack the problem properly, everyone, from the ward to the board, has to buy into it and see it as their problem, not someone else's. I hope that we will hear from the Minister about some of the ways in which hospitals are moving towards the sea-change in attitudes that is needed if patients are once again to feel confident&#151;as they have a right to do&#151;that hospital is a safe place to be.</p>

<p><a name="08071785000061"></a><a name="80717-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><b><a name="80717-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="08071785000198"></a>Baroness Thornton:</b> I congratulate the noble Lord on securing today&#146;s timely debate. As demonstrated by the passionate and well informed contributions, the topic is of great concern to many, particularly to him in his work as chair of the National Patient Safety Agency&#151;and rightly so, as tackling healthcare-associated infections is a challenge for health services around the world and a priority for our NHS. The noble Earl is completely correct about the need for ownership of the problem.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000062"></a>I would like to make the case that we are making good progress towards clean, safe care for patients in the NHS. That is evident in the latest Health Protection Agency data for January to March 2008, published today. Those figures show that MRSA blood-stream infections are down 33 per cent, and that C. difficile infections in the most vulnerable group&#151;those aged 65-plus&#151;are down 32 per cent compared to the same quarter last year. That is significant progress.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000063"></a>The noble Lord&#146;s work as chair of the National Patient Safety Agency has contributed significantly to that progress. The NPSA&#146;s cleanyourhands campaign is a key element in preventing the spread of infections. It has been shown to make a real difference to hand hygiene, therefore making a real difference to patient care and literally saving lives. The NPSA also announced the 2008 hospital patient environment action team scores last Thursday. Thanks to the hard work of the NHS, 98.5 per cent of hospitals are now rated acceptable or above. But we cannot stop there. Trusts are required to deliver a 30 per cent reduction in the number of C. difficile infections by March 2011. The NHS is on course to hit the target to halve MRSA blood-stream infections by the end of March. We will know the  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC149"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC149</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>result when the HPA publishes the data in October. However, the latest figures were over 49 per cent lower than the quarterly average in 2003-04, so we are fairly sure that the NHS will meet the target.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000064"></a>However, there is no single solution for reducing healthcare-acquired infections, so we have introduced a range of measures. Our Clean, Safe Care strategy builds on comprehensive clinical guidance and gives an overview of all measures. Good hand hygiene, high standards of cleanliness, effective patient screening and sensible use of antibiotics are vital in the fight against infection, as noble Lords have mentioned. In the last year, we have introduced a &#147;bare below the elbows&#148; dress code to support hand hygiene, increased the number of matrons to over 5,000 and launched a new antibiotics campaign. All acute hospitals have been deep cleaned and we have doubled the department&#146;s tailored support team for infections. We are now in the process of introducing MRSA screening across the country. I shall refer to that again when I answer specific questions.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000065"></a>Those measures are backed by significant additional investment. On top of investment in recent years of over &#163;100 million, the Comprehensive Spending Review settlement for future years includes &#163;270 million a year by 2010-11 to tackle healthcare-acquired infections. That all supports the legal requirement for NHS bodies to maintain proper infection control. The new regulator, the Care Quality Commission, will have tough powers to investigate and intervene, strengthening the regulator&#146;s role in ensuring the NHS meets the required standard. In the mean time, specialist teams from the Healthcare Commission continue to inspect all acute trusts every year.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000066"></a>We are fighting infections on all fronts, but we should not lose sight of the fact that, for all the media hype, the probability of dying from a healthcare-associated infection is relatively low. As the <I>Observer</I> pointed out last Sunday in its feature on &#147;25 things you need to know for a healthy life&#148;, people should not fear hospitals. I suspect that my civil servants would advise me not to use this statistic because I do not know what it is based on. However, that article stated that,</p>
<ul><a name="08071785000179"></a>&#147;for people under 65 at least, you've got more chance of dying from a lightning strike than MRSA&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071785000159"></a>The NHS treats around 1 million patients every 36 hours and admits 14 million people to hospital each year. If someone is admitted to an NHS hospital, his chance of acquiring an MRSA blood-stream infection or a C. difficile infection is less than half of 1 per cent.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000067"></a>I now turn to specific points raised by noble Lords. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, asked about the plans we have to collect information on community infections. We have set the latest C. difficile targets across health communities to encourage an approach that encompasses primary care trusts, although we have no current plans to collect information about community-acquired infections. However, we will continue to consider that as we update our surveillance systems.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Patel, suggested that the trend had slowed and we were not going to hit the target. We think the trend has now reversed and that we are on track to hit the MRSA target. The latest  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC150"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC150</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>statistics show a 49 per cent decease compared with the 2003-04 baseline. However, his statistics were correct, which is why we take this issue so seriously. We are pleased that the action taken to date is having an impact and infection rates are falling. We focused on MRSA and C. difficile, but the measures introduced and promoted, such as good hand hygiene, will have an impact on other infections. The focus that we have encouraged on infection control should have an impact right across the NHS.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000069"></a>The noble Lord asked why we were not screening staff for MRSA and other noble Lords may have mentioned that. The key point is that staff are usually healthy, so they are at less risk of getting or carrying an infection. The problem is not screening the staff, but is the practice&#151;making people behave in a way that means that infections are not carried from patient to patient. He asked when we would introduce MRSA screening for elective care in 2008. We will introduce it by the end of March 2009. Hospitals are now working on how to deliver it.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000070"></a>The noble Lord asked what we were doing to ensure accurate reporting on death certificates. In July 2005, the CMO issued advice to doctors reminding them to record infections accurately on death certificates. The number of death certificates mentioning C. difficile rose significantly the next year, as shown by the latest Office for National Statistics report.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000071"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Masham, made a good point about the need to make sure that children in schools were taught about the importance of hygiene. She is also right to point to the importance of combating sloppy practices. The key point about healthcare workers is their practice.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000072"></a>The Health and Social Care Bill, which I think became an Act yesterday, makes the prevention of MRSA a priority. We must ensure that specialist hospitals are as rigorous as the best of the rest.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000073"></a>The noble Baroness asked about guidelines on pneumonia. I am not sure which guidelines she referred to, but the suggestion sounded very sensible. We launched a new campaign about antibiotic prescribing in February this year and have highlighted it in department guidelines.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000074"></a>C. difficile is not notifiable in England, but all cases have to be reported on the mandatory surveillance system, which gives real data to the Health Protection Agency and to trusts.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000075"></a>The noble Baroness raised the issue of new ideas, and mentioned mattresses and so on. That is extremely important. We are always looking for new ideas. The Rapid Review Panel was set up in 2004 to review new healthcare-related infection technologies and to provide a prompt assessment of novel equipment and materials and other products or protocols which might be of value to the NHS in improving infection prevention and control, the idea being that you need to look at these things quickly and, if they are effective, roll them out across the piece. We are very much aware that we need to be on top of technology.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000076"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, asked about antibiotic prescribing. Unfortunately, we are not yet at the stage where antibiotic prescribing across England represents what we recognise is the best practice in the best  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC151"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC151</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>hospitals. However, we are working very hard to raise awareness. For instance, we are launching an extension of our antibiotic campaign with a poster competition in schools. So far as we are aware there is no read-across to animals. That was not in my brief, as they say.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000077"></a>The noble Lord is right that the logistics of screening are significant. There is no question about that, as mentioned also by the noble Earl. Where are we now on screening? As I mentioned, all elective admissions will be screened by March 2009 and all emergency admissions by 2011. The reason for the time is because we know that the logistics of this need to be right.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000078"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Teverson, mentioned bed occupancy. There used to be a correlation. However, we have issued guidance to infection control teams to talk to bed managers. Now we think there is no correlation. Trusts with high bed occupancy rates have reduced infection numbers as much as those with low bed occupancy rates.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000079"></a>The noble Lord asked what we were doing to ensure that those in nursing homes were as protected as those in hospitals. We will produce guidance shortly for infection control in care homes. This consultation is due to start this summer. With the creation of the new regulator, it will be much easier to roll that out because we will have one regulator looking across the piece from healthcare to social care.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000080"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, asked about deep cleaning and whether it was a gimmick. We need to be clear that the cleanliness of our hospitals is a matter of utmost importance. Clean, tidy and safe hospitals and staff are very important to patients, and are what they expect. Deep cleaning is not different cleaning, but it was a way of galvanising hospitals. It is a concentrated programme, often using new equipment and specialist skills. We are not repeating the national deep clean, but the Healthcare Commission will be looking at this when it inspects.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000081"></a>The noble Earl asked why we were screening for MRSA and not C. difficile. We have considered whether universal screening of patients for C. difficile was the best way forward. It would not have the same clinical benefits as MRSA screening, which is why we only target patients over 65 who have diarrhoea. We are keeping this clinical evidence under review and will act quickly to respond if there is any new and emerging evidence.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000082"></a>Will MRSA screening be cost effective? Available evidence indicates that it can be cost effective due to reduced morbidity and lower NHS treatment costs, but there will be an inevitable start-up cost in the introduction of the service.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000083"></a>I thank noble Lords for the many points they have raised. I apologise if I have missed anything. I will look at the record and certainly write to people. I hope I have demonstrated that the NHS is working very hard and making good progress. I assure noble Lords that we will continue to support and encourage the NHS to ensure that patients receive the clean, safe care that they deserve.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000086"></a>The noble Lord said: As a former journalist, it pains me to say that the number of occasions on which I am able to pay genuine tribute to the work of the press are sadly limited. However, this afternoon is a rare exception. I make no bones about saying that I have taken an interest in the subject before Members of the Committee this afternoon&#151;well off my usual beat, as some people will realise&#151;wholly and solely because of the <I>Daily Mirror</I>&#146;s splendid campaign on behalf of our troops.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000087"></a>The <I>Daily Mirror</I>&#146;s work has been in the best traditions of popular journalism: passionate, yet scrupulously researched. I remember the remark of the great Harry Evans, under whom I briefly served when he was editor of the <I>Sunday Times</I>, who said, &#147;Your campaign is only working when your readers start to get bored with it&#148;, in reference to a <I>Sunday Times</I> campaign on cones in roads. The <I>Daily Mirror</I> has been willing to run that risk by persevering with this campaign when others have been satisfied to fill their columns with gossip and girls. That persistence has been most admirable. I also pay tribute to Colonel Richard Kemp CBE, who once led our forces in Afghanistan and who has been as gutsy in this campaign for recognition as he was in that one.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000088"></a>They have been not only admirable and gutsy, but successful. My third tribute is to the Government: Ministers have listened. When I first tabled my Question, it called for medals for the killed as well as for the wounded. That is no longer necessary, as the Government have now agreed that Britons who lose their lives in the tragic conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan should be recognised with an appropriate medal. It therefore only remains to push the door open a little wider, and extend that recognition, as my Question asks, to the seriously wounded.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000089"></a>Of course, anybody who joins our Armed Forces does so in full knowledge of the potential personal costs they may pay for their patriotism. However, it is my contention that the wars we are considering here are different from those we fought in the past in a way that makes recognition more desirable. The fact is that our nation has been divided over these conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Not only have the men and women involved had to face enemy fire, but they have suffered the ricochets of friendly fire from those in Britain who believe these wars to have been misjudged. Are they risking their lives in a good cause?</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000090"></a>That is not a situation that troops in most conflicts have had to face. Generally, wars fought by Britain have been those where the nation stood behind its Government&#146;s course. At a time when surveys are showing some problems with service morale&#151;not of the individuals involved but their feelings about how the services as a whole are keeping their morale up&#151;we need to do the right thing. Let us show our soldiers, our airmen and our sailors&#151;let us let their families, their sons and daughters, and their sons' sons and  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC153"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC153</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>daughters&#146; daughters know&#151;that we as a nation understand and empathise with what they are going through: a life which few of us have had the experience to appreciate. Whatever our views on the cause&#151;and I think there are different views within this Room&#151;we are, as we have always been, united in our admiration for their professionalism and our sympathy for their sacrifices. We need to show that we care.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000091"></a>I am not sure that the opposition to what is proposed comes from Ministers. Reading the words, I fear that others stand behind the Ministers; namely, some of our senior servicemen. Without making too much of it, I find it slightly ironic that top brass&#151;many of whom like nothing better than to parade with a chest bedecked with medals of all kinds&#151;should be resistant to granting any similar recognition to the men and women who serve under them.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000092"></a>One of the arguments to be heard thundering round the corridors of power is that such an award would be unprecedented. When you come to think of it, so was the first ever Victoria Cross&#151;so is every medal when it is first awarded&#151;and so, very relevantly, was the first Purple Cross, awarded more than 200 years ago, which our American cousins and allies across the Atlantic award to their servicepeople in similar circumstances.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000093"></a>Another argument is that it is difficult to draw a distinction between seriously injured people and others, wounded or not. However, that is implicit in the awarding of any medal. One has to decide what deserves a VC, an MC or any other medal. It requires very fine judgments, which are hard to make. At least this medal would have an objective justification&#151;namely, a serious injury&#151;and I do not believe that that is beyond the power of humankind to resolve. I cannot help observing that very few serious injuries are suffered by those sitting behind large desks in the Ministry of Defence.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000094"></a>In another place, an Early Day Motion arguing for these medals became the most popular in this Session of Parliament, with over half the House signing it. Of course, Ministers cannot sign EDMs but a very clear majority of Back-Benchers did so. I regret that this House does not have an EDM system, more&#146;s the pity. According to the Procedure Committee, to which I put this proposal the other week, that is because Members have other ways of drawing ministerial attention to worthy causes. I hope that that purpose will be served by my Question today and that noble Lords&#151;both those who are here to discuss it and those who are absent for one reason or another but support my proposal&#151;will make their point. Of those who have to be absent, my noble friend Lady Symons has asked me to signify her very strong support&#151;she is at an important international conference on defence&#151;and so has my noble friend Lady Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde, who is currently busily engaged on the Pensions Bill.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000095"></a>I wanted to draw this matter to the Minister&#146;s attention and I hope that it will be given serious consideration. I greatly look forward to the debate. I thank all noble Lords who are taking part in it and await the Minister&#146;s answer with keen interest.</p>

I remind the Committee of my interest as a serving TA officer.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000097"></a>The British Armed Forces have a tradition of being very parsimonious with the issuing of medals. That is partly because we do not want to look like US servicepeople, among whom sometimes very junior soldiers with very limited experience have a chestful of medals. For our Armed Forces, that is a source of amusement, and I suggest that the Minister exercises great caution when responding to the debate.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000098"></a>The noble Lord skilfully explained his proposal. He made an attractive proposition and prayed in aid the media campaign. However, the first problem is that some casualties are unnecessary. Let us suppose that in an operational theatre there are two mine incidents causing casualties. In the first, a soldier is seriously injured by a mine. His comrades do exactly and precisely what they are trained to do: they do not move, if at all possible, and they wait for the Royal Engineers Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit. If they have to move, they do so very slowly, clearing the path in front of them. They may take 30 minutes to move 40 feet, and all the time they will be able to hear the cries of their comrade, injured and needing help, but if they do that, there will be only one casualty.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000099"></a>In the second incident, instead of adhering to their training, they run across the minefield to aid their comrade. It is completely understandable and very courageous, but they set off another mine, thus causing a completely unnecessary casualty. If the Minister follows the suggestion of her noble friend, she will have to explain why the serviceperson who adheres to their training and minimises casualties does not get a medal, while the one who ignores their training, causes additional casualties and exposes others to greater risk does.</p>

<p><a name="08071785000100"></a>The Minister will also have to explain how suicides in operational theatres will be treated&#151;a very sensitive issue, I know. A related issue is psychological and mental injuries. Some may not be apparent for some considerable time after the end of the operation. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the work of the charity Combat Stress.</p>

<p><a name="08071785000101"></a>The third problem is road traffic accidents&#151;still possibly the biggest killer of members of our Armed Forces. When would an RTA death or serious injury attract a medal? What if someone has a road traffic accident while off duty in the UK? I do not think so. How about a road traffic accident that takes place when someone is on exercise in the UK, when the cause of the accident is the victim&#146;s error, or worse? Probably not. These are very difficult judgments of blame and responsibility.</p>

<p><a name="08071785000103"></a>Some time ago I raised with the Minister&#146;s predecessor, the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, the very poor performance of the Army Medal Office. It is now being operated on a tri-service basis, which is perfectly sensible. My information is that the performance of the Defence Medal Office, as I presume it is now called, is vastly improved. That is very important for morale. The prompt issuing of medals makes servicemen feel that their efforts are appreciated. I am extremely grateful to the Government for making progress on that.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>

Part of that Statement says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071785000172"></a>&#147;I understand that no amount of money can ever make up for the pain and sacrifice that these brave people have endured. However, we need to recognise the special nature of their sacrifice&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071785000160"></a>I very much welcome the Command Paper and the overall improvements in the financial package and similar that are set out today. That phrase from the Secretary of State gives me encouragement and I await with interest the Minister&#146;s reply to the debate. We will keep our fingers crossed.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000108"></a>I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, on inaugurating this debate and on his comprehensive and persuasive speech. I also pay similar tribute to the <I>Daily Mirror</I> for its Honour the Brave campaign, and to Colonel Kemp.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000109"></a>The noble Lord referred to the Early Day Motion in November, which had no less than 330 signatures. The EDM says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071785000173"></a>&#147;That this House&#148;&#151;</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000110"></a>As has been said, the Government have gone some way towards answering and acknowledging the EDM. Once again the precedent of the American Purple Heart, which was first awarded in 1917, was referred to. In Britain, in the two world wars, wound stripes were sewn on to a soldier&#146;s uniform. Sadly, the practice then fell into disuse. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, a former Chief of the Defence Staff, has gone on record as acknowledging his pride in wearing the wound stripes himself.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000111"></a>I fully accept that a service man or woman who was injured would appreciate financial compensation more than anything else, which is why we appreciate what was announced today. But all the evidence is that wounded military personnel would appreciate an extra medal&#151;and I use the word &#147;medal&#148; metaphorically, rather than in an exact literal sense. At a time when our service men and women feel unappreciated, when recruiting is difficult and tours of duty are longer and more frequent, and when, as the Secretary of State and defence chiefs have acknowledged, there is considerable stress on our forces and overstretch, I believe, as does my party, that it is more important than ever to do all we can to acknowledge the debt that we owe our service personnel and honour the covenant. I believe, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, believes, that a medal for the seriously wounded would help and would play a part. I accept, as he accepted, that there are some problems with definitions&#151;with someone&#146;s mental as compared with their physical condition and with those who are wounded and killed in the normal course of combat or by friendly fire. These are possible difficulties, but they could be overcome, given the will, and the balance is very much in favour of awarding the medals to which the noble Lord referred.</p>

The noble Earl refers to the final section of my speech, in which I acknowledged that there are some difficulties. There is no argument about that. But the arguments that I have put in favour of awarding a medal far outweigh some of those negative and more difficult points that we would have to deal with. I accept that that type of definition is a problem.</p>

He made some very interesting points. I am in complete agreement with him about the bravery and dedication of our Armed Forces and their work in dangerous and challenging circumstances.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000115"></a>I also agree with the noble Lord about the <I>Daily Mirror</I> campaign and with what he said about Colonel Kemp, whom I saw speaking eloquently on the &#147;Breakfast&#148; programme this morning. The noble Lord is quite right that it is essential for the Government and Parliament to do all they can to ensure that military personnel are properly rewarded for their work. Medals are an important tool in their being given recognition by this country.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC157"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC157</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000116"></a>My noble friend Lord Attlee spoke eloquently. I agree with him that the Government should move cautiously on this issue. I have spoken to a number of service men and women from my former regiment&#151;I am honorary colonel of a TA regiment&#151;and almost to a man and a woman they agree with what my noble friend Lord Attlee said. I also congratulate my noble friend on setting such a good example yesterday by coming to work in his uniform.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000117"></a>My party has promised that when we are in government we will review the rules set out by the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals. We will set up an honours and decorations committee to ensure that they are consistent and appropriate. We can in this way ensure that the awarding of a medal is consistent and appropriate. Although, as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said, there is a precedent of a medal for the wounded in this country&#146;s military history, new medals should not be awarded on an ad hoc basis.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000118"></a>Meanwhile, we must remember the number of military personnel who have been wounded or killed. No medal will ever make up for the lack of, for instance, body armour that led to the injury in the first place. Death and injury are a tragic but unavoidable part of war; death and injury as a result of inadequate equipment are most certainly not. Two weeks ago, I drew attention at Question Time to the Government&#146;s decision in 2004 to cut the helicopter budget by &#163;1.4 billion, thus necessitating the use of ground vehicles, which are more vulnerable to attack in evacuating the wounded. My concerns are widely shared. A recent Ministry of Defence survey showed that more than 50 per cent of service men and women were dissatisfied with the equipment provided. When reports reach the media that front-line troops have on occasion run out of ammunition, it is clear that the situation needs drastic improvement. The Minister will no doubt claim that the Government have learnt from their mistakes and are now taking the supply of front-line troops more seriously. I hope that that is the case&#151;I think that it is.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000119"></a>I also freely acknowledge another area where the Government have finally listened to my party and say how pleased I am that a new military ward has been opened at Birmingham hospital. I hope that many more will follow. Proper medical facilities for the wounded should not be an optional extra. Like the noble Lord, Lord Lee of Trafford, we on these Benches welcome measures set out in today&#146;s service personnel Command Paper increasing the compensation payments for personnel suffering injuries due to their service.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000120"></a>I have wandered a little from the original topic of the debate, but recognition of the work that our Armed Forces are undertaking and appreciation of the dangers to which they are exposed do not rest on fine words and ceremony. Speeches in Parliament must be backed up by proper support in the field.</p>

There are divisions of opinion on this, but we can all agree that we as a country are greatly indebted to those who serve in Iraq, Afghanistan or elsewhere in the world. We should bear their professionalism and dedication in mind at all times. What relatively young men and women are able to do in service of their country is extremely impressive, and it is right that we should give due recognition to the service they give.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000122"></a>I stress what one or two noble Lords have mentioned: medals are just one aspect of the recognition that we need to give to those who serve. I was glad to hear the welcome from noble Lords opposite for the Command Paper <I>The Nation&#146;s Commitment: Cross-Government Support to our Armed Force</I><I>s</I><I>, their Families and Veteran</I><I>s</I>¸ which was published today. The fact that we mention families and veterans should be borne in mind at all times. I am sure we will come back to the report and will have an opportunity to debate it because it has some significant elements that should be well known and welcomed, whether they relate to health, housing or the opportunities that we are increasingly going to be able to give to people once they have completed six years in the Armed Forces. All those things will make a difference and will make it clear that we appreciate and want to make a long-term investment in the people who put their lives on the line in the Armed Forces.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000123"></a>As the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, said, the United Kingdom has a well established system for awarding medals. I was pleased that he thinks that the service provided has improved. I am sure that people in the Medal Office will appreciate those comments. Since September 2001, it has issued more than 54,000 Afghanistan medals and more than 115,000 Iraq medals. It has been busy, and I am glad that the noble Earl&#146;s information is that it now deals with these issues more swiftly. That is important, and we should always bear that in mind.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000124"></a>The military chiefs&#151;the people who Ministers listen to on issues such as this&#151;believe that their way of keeping this issue under constant review is the way forward and that decisions should be relevant to the circumstances in which our Armed Forces are operating. Everyone here will know that for every significant campaign or operation, a medal is struck when it is deemed that there has been sufficient risk and rigour for those involved. Service men and women deployed today in Afghanistan and Iraq will receive their appropriate medals once they have completed the qualifying criterion, which is generally 30 days of continuous service in theatre.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000125"></a>This debate has focused on how we recognise those who not only serve but, sadly, are killed or injured in the line of duty. I am sure that everyone has heard of the difficulties and concerns of the families of those who have been killed or wounded. Those who are killed receive their medals quickly. We have a new procedure, which I think will be welcomed, as my noble friend Lord Lipsey said, by those who mounted the campaign in the <I>Daily Mirror</I>. It has helped to ensure that people focus on this issue. However, I stress that our service chiefs have always kept such issues under review and have been keen to ensure that they take the appropriate action.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000126"></a>The changes that were made a short time ago&#151;after my noble friend secured this debate, which I think is why he widened his approach&#151;have been welcomed. It is right to do what has been done. As the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, pointed out, it is extremely difficult to deal with some of the practical issues that arise. He mentioned several difficult situations in which a judgment had to be made about what was appropriate. My noble friend intervened to ask whether these judgments would also apply to those who had been injured. We have not yet been able to finalise all the details regarding the medals for those who were killed on operations because of the complexities involved. There are many others as well, to which the noble Earl referred. We should not regard this as a simple and straightforward issue.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000127"></a>We should always take account of the views of those who are serving. My noble friend said that the opposition to this proposal was from senior servicemen&#151;the top brass bedecked with medals who refuse to allow those who serve under them to get recognition. That was somewhat disparaging; many of the people referred to as the top brass have very distinguished records. We should listen to them and learn from their experience.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000128"></a>It is not just the military chiefs who believe that we should move on this with caution. The overwhelming view among the Armed Forces is that the current medal system is fair and that what service personnel consider most important is that the injured should be properly cared for and supported, and receive the treatment they need. That is one reason why today&#146;s Command Paper is so important&#151;it brings home some of the things that have already been done to improve the situation of those who have been injured in service. It is very important to do that.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000129"></a>Awarding medals is not the only way that we recognise the contribution of our service men and women. There have been lots of developments over recent years. The Armed Forces Memorial at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire provides appropriate recognition for those who have been killed in action since the end of World War II. Families who have unfortunately lost someone in action find it of some comfort to see their name engraved on that memorial and think it appropriate that that kind of recognition should be made. We have to consider all these issues extremely carefully.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000130"></a>Mention was made by the noble Lord, Lord Lee, of wound stripes, which were introduced in the First World War and, to a certain extent, were in evidence in the Second World War, although I am told that they were not universally popular as a means of recognising people who had been injured. Therefore, these issues are complex and we must, as much as anything else, bear in mind the feelings of those who serve in our Armed Forces. It is true that it is the top brass who report back, but perhaps I may remind your Lordships of the comments of the Chief of the Defence Staff, Air Chief Marshall Sir Jock Stirrup:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071785000174"></a>&#147;I know that there has been considerable debate about recognition for those wounded on operations. The Service Chiefs and I have thought hard about this, having sounded opinion amongst our people. The overwhelming view is that the current medal system is fair and sufficient, recognising as it does both risk and rigour. What our people consider most important is that the injured be properly cared for and supported&#148;.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="08071785000162"></a>The two elements are there: they have consulted other people&#151;they have not simply made this decision sitting in the MoD&#151;and they think that what happens by way of care and support is the predominant concern. The Command Paper has been widely welcomed. Indeed, the Royal British Legion said today:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071785000175"></a>&#147;The Covenant is being brought back into balance&#148;,</p>
</ul>

<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071785000176"></a>&#147;The Prime Minister, the Defence Secretary and the Government all deserve credit for listening to our concerns and recommendations&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071785000164"></a>Therefore, I think that we are moving a whole step forward in what we are doing for our servicemen, both while they are in the services and after they leave. This is a very positive and constructive way forward.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000131"></a>I wish to say a final word about the dangers of allowing this decision to be made solely by Ministers. Ministers could very easily be tempted into giving medals or recognition on a whole range of issues because it would always lead to a degree of popularity for them. I think that the present system, in which we take Ministers out of the equation, is probably worth protecting.</p>

<p><a name="08071785000135"></a>In the UK and internationally, there is an increasing realisation that parliaments have a significant role to play in development. In DfID&#146;s 2006 White Paper, for example, the UK committed to work more closely with parliamentarians in an effort to,</p>

<p><a name="08071785000165"></a>Much of this new attention is focused on African parliaments, which have slowly begun to exert the new constitutional powers that have come with the transition away from dictatorships to multiparty politics.

Gradually, parliaments are becoming more assertive in overseeing financial governance.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000136"></a>African parliaments face acute challenges. Many lack formal powers and agreed clear procedures. They lack institutional capacity. Parliaments, as opposed to governing Executives, lack basic facilities, resources and administrative and specialist support, needed to effectively hold the Executive to account. The reality of African parliaments reflects African politics, history and society. The events in Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe, since this inquiry was initiated in 2007, each in their way bear witness to the challenges still facing many African parliaments.</p>

<p><a name="08071785000137"></a>The group&#146;s report, <I>Strengthening Parliaments</I><I> in Africa</I><I>: I</I><I>mproving </I><I>S</I><I>upport</I>, looks at the difficulties encountered in African parliaments and at what the United Kingdom, through aid and other channels, is doing to address these difficulties. The aim is that the report will contribute to and inform current debates over the most effective approaches to parliamentary strengthening. The group was particularly keen to hear at first hand the views of counterpart parliamentarians and their staff in a selection of African countries. Members visited Malawi, Uganda and Kenya and, in addition, 20 submissions were received in response to our call for evidence. I place on record our thanks to my noble friend Lord Steel of Aikwood for his participation in the inquiry and in due course, I hope, for his contribution to this debate. Further evidence came from members' discussions in South Africa on parliamentary strengthening, organised by World Bank affiliates, and at Westminster in collaboration with the ODI.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000138"></a>African parliaments are based on western parliaments and have similar roles. The social, cultural and political contexts in which they operate, however, are contrasting and varied. Informal patronage networks are very influential, coexisting with, overlapping with and sometimes conflicting with institutions and parliaments in the formal political sphere. Only two of Africa's 53 states, Botswana and Mauritius, have a record of unbroken multiparty democracy. In an environment of presidential regimes, one-party states and military rule, scrutiny of the Executive and representation of the electorate was rare.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000139"></a>Development partners have been slow to support parliaments in the democratisation revival that started in the 1990s. Appreciation of the significance of governance for development and poverty reduction is only gradually extending to the contribution of parliaments. Yet many donors, discouraged by mixed results of project-based support and conditional lending, are increasingly opting to transfer aid money directly to Governments of recipient countries. This direct budget support makes it essential that these funds are overseen by in-country institutions, such as parliaments.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000140"></a>Development partners are coming to recognise parliaments as allies in the monitoring of the use and impact of aid money as part of their overall role in the scrutiny of the use of public resources. African parliaments are increasingly becoming assertive institutions that have leverage over legislation, monitor and challenge the Executive and represent citizens&#146; views.</p>

<p><a name="08071785000141"></a>Although surveys show that there is widespread support across southern Africa for the parliaments&#146; legislative prerogative, deep-seated challenges remain. Not the least of these are: first, the rules, powers and arrangements that define parliament&#146;s leverage; secondly, parliament&#146;s resources and institutional capacity; and, thirdly, the relationship between parliament and international players.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000142"></a>A recurring theme in the material gathered by the Africa All-Party Group was the limited popular understanding of MPs&#146; responsibilities and powers. MPs were expected to deliver on solving a wide range of collective local problems and individual needs and bring development in health, education and water, while legislative and scrutiny responsibilities were hardly mentioned. The MPs&#146; functions in parliament such as legislation and holding the Executive to account were not seen as important. The financial independence of parliament is crucial in this regard. Submissions from Zambia, Tanzania and Malawi underlined that their parliaments were unable to determine and approve even their own budgets.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000143"></a>Our findings demonstrate that African parliaments have begun to exert greater influence on how their countries are governed, but that huge challenges remain. There is insufficient constitutional and other provisions. Problems with institutional capacity continue to constrain parliaments. Even if they enjoy robust powers on paper, the political realities inside and outside parliaments mean that they often fail to exercise effective scrutiny over Executives.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000144"></a>Our inquiry has resulted in close to 50 recommendations in five overarching groups. Broadly, the groups are that: first, development partners understand better the parliaments in their political context; secondly, they must engage in local demand and encourage broad-based ownership, pulled by local participants and not just pushed by the donors; thirdly, co-ordination is essential with development partners working in step with one another, because too many times there are too many partners stirring the broth, so to speak; fourthly, development partners need to learn from evidence-based lessons and apply those results; and fifthly and finally, greater account needs to be taken of parliament in development work, encouraging a full role and avoiding acts that would undermine or marginalise the parliaments that are supposedly being nurtured.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000145"></a>There is a dilemma. While some might say, or admit, that dictatorial Governments can sometimes bring real development to their people through sound policies, it should perhaps be a prerequisite for British development aid that the recipient Government are democratically elected through the expressed will of the people.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000146"></a>We were very pleased to received DfID&#146;s fulsome response to our report in the general sense. It points out that it has already commissioned studies on parliamentary strength. It acknowledges, however, that where a parliament has already been marginalised, there is little point in promoting parliamentary strengthening.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000147"></a>Where a dictatorial or even repressive Government fulfil DfID&#146;s overall development criteria, it could be argued that development delivered now is jeopardised  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC163"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC163</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>in the long term by the political instability created by this repression. DfID&#146;s rejection of the proposal that it should present an annual report to the parliaments of recipient countries on the grounds that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071785000177"></a>&#147;Aid donors are accountable to the recipient governments who themselves have the responsibility to report to parliament&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071785000167"></a>counts for little when the parliament is already marginalised.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000148"></a>In these instances there surely is a case for the Government to adopt a process similar to the extractive industries transparencies initiative&#151;making public aid agreements, so as to enable parliamentarians, both here and in the recipient countries, to hold their Governments to account.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000149"></a>Finally, since the field work and evidence-taking and analysis began almost a year ago, there have been some significant changes in political development in several of the countries studied. I should be very grateful if the Minister could update noble Lords on the Government&#146;s current position reflecting the outcome of perhaps the Kenyan and Zimbabwean elections and the situation in that regard.</p>

I declare an interest as the chair of the Royal African Society, which provides the secretariat to the All-Party Group.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000151"></a>This report is important in tackling engagement between citizens and their Governments and the role that parliaments can play in ensuring greater accountability and transparency. I am pleased that the Department for International Development has welcomed the five overarching recommendations. In the time available, I shall make some general comments about the progress of democracy building in Africa and, in particular, the equation of elections with democracy.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000152"></a>We have seen huge democratic gains in sub-Saharan Africa in the past two decades, although we still have too many leaders who have been there too long. Our recent focus has been on Zimbabwe, but there are other countries too. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation governance index for 2000 showed that 24 elections in 48 African countries were judged not free and fair. By 2005, that figure had dropped to 15. In 2000, six African countries passed the free and fair criteria; that figure rose to eight by 2005. That is slow progress, but it is movement in the right direction.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000153"></a>For me, democracy is not just about elections, although they are important. It is about accountability and transparency, citizens feeling that they have a right to have a say and to be heard, and Members of Parliament holding their Governments to account and putting the interests of the electors first. That requires maturity and stability. Too often, we have seen the effect of the lack of political stability and basic rights in African countries where political breakdown has been followed by conflict and insecurity. Greater stability and participation are achievable through multiparty democracy, but it will take time to take root and mistakes will be made. Strengthening parliamentary democracy and improving parliamentary scrutiny is crucial to the process of building confidence in political processes.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08071785000154"></a>I agree with the thrust of the argument in the report that it is essential to understand the politics of African countries in order to work with them for sustainable development. Local ownership is essential. It is not just about what donor Governments want. One of the potential problems with the development aid agenda is the focus on Government-to-Government relations. Some African Governments see themselves as being more accountable to donors than to their own people because, through the process of accountability to donor Governments, they know that they will receive aid. It is vital that African parliamentarians and civil society play a greater role. This can partly be achieved through greater transparency in the relationship between donors and recipient Governments, but we also need consultation between donors and recipient Governments and their citizens as well as with business and NGOs. There is an opportunity at the High-Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Ghana in September to explore these issues in more detail and, in particular, to look at the need for better analysis and co-ordination between donor and recipient Governments and other actors. This report gives important insight into what needs to be done, and I hope that all of us, including my Government, treat the recommendations with the seriousness they deserve.</p>

I had intended to discuss many issues, but there is not time. However, I was struck particularly by DfID&#146;s recognition that:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071787000016"></a>&#147;Bringing politics squarely into the aid equation takes many development professionals outside their zones of comfort. It also takes us to the outer edges of what some development agencies are equipped, even mandated, to do&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071787000015"></a>Parliaments are not aid projects; they are important political entities, especially in fragile states, and I hope that one result of this admirable report will be much greater FCO involvement through our missions abroad, which are best placed to provide an analysis of the political terrain. We should not rely too much on the UNDP, which has its own political agenda. That is particularly true in the case of Zimbabwe for reasons beyond DfID&#146;s control.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000002"></a>However, what is happening to parliamentary government in Zimbabwe is both relevant and urgent. Parliamentarians everywhere must surely do whatever they can&#151;I think that we all agree on this&#151;to protect the MDC MPs who were duly elected in March this year and should be taking their seats today. That includes the handful of MPs elected in the rerun last month despite the violence and intimidation recognised and condemned by all the observer missions&#151;the AU mission, the Pan-African Parliament election observer mission and the SADC mission. No date has been announced for Parliament to sit. At present, one MDC MP is in hospital fighting for his life after a beating on 29 June, two are in jail, one has been abducted and is missing, seven have fled to South Africa, and an unknown number are in hiding in Zimbabwe. One is to be &#147;dealt with&#148; immediately on release. His lawyer is therefore not applying for bail: he is safer in prison. I say nothing of the many MDC supporters and electors,

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000003"></a>Mugabe is ensuring a ZANU-PF majority by delaying the swearing-in of MPs until he can wipe out the MDC majority by abducting, arresting, detaining and hospitalising enough MDC MPs to ensure it. Some 10 MDC/Tsvangirai MPs have been arrested in recent weeks and seven more are said to be on a police &#147;wanted&#148; list. Mugabe is also able to pack the Senate. Finally, under Zimbabwe law, any parliamentarian can be dismissed for failing to attend for two days.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000004"></a>Cannot the group urge the parliaments in Africa with which it has many links to make representations through their Governments and Commonwealth Governments to protect the MPs of Zimbabwe and enable them, elected as they were by the people despite every threat during the elections, to enter Parliament and represent those who have no other voice? Some will say that for us to do this is to play into Mugabe&#146;s hands, because he can say that the MPs now being prevented taking their seats are British puppets or that we should not speak for them. We should not allow him to set the agenda. We did not take that view when we spoke out for Hungary in 1956. No one thought that the ANC in South Africa was a British puppet when we spoke for it in the Commonwealth and in rallies everywhere. We should not allow Mugabe to call the tune. We should speak out against oppression. Those MPs risked their lives to stand and be elected, and the people risked theirs in electing them. If we believe in parliamentary government, we should urge all parliamentarians everywhere to do all they can to protect the MPs in Zimbabwe, and the world should condemn the tyrant.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000005"></a>I was in the Congo in 1960 when the new African Government assembled their first parliament. I remember the delegations from Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria and Kenya bringing ceremonial gifts. Lumumba&#146;s Ministers had to take office in a country where the Belgians had left no professional infrastructure, civil servants, lawyers or doctors. They had none of the skilled professional indigenous infrastructure and civil society which Zimbabwe has had. The Congo has never recovered from that bad beginning. It is cruel that that infrastructure in Zimbabwe is being wasted by a reversion to what the report called &#147;big man&#148; politics&#151;to dictatorship, in fact. Kenya, Uganda and Malawi have in their different ways solved their problems. Zimbabwe could be restored very quickly to a viable free society if the people whom it elected with such courage could be enabled to exercise their powers of governance legitimately. It is in any case impossible to think how any of the proposals for a political solution to the crisis by negotiation can be effected if those whom the people have chosen to represent them are excluded from the process.</p>

This report should reinforce HMG&#146;s new country-governance analysis, which, rather surprisingly, has tended to neglect parliaments up till now, as he said. The donor&#146;s relationship has also largely been with the Executive, but that is now changing.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000007"></a>The report is inevitably UK-centred and I feel that the African dimension still needs strengthening, although there are good case studies. I have long been wary of spreading Westminster democracy for its own sake. Political philosophy from Machiavelli suggests that a form of tyranny can be appropriate in pulling up a failing state. Examples abound in Africa. I pass over Zimbabwe but where would Uganda be without President Museveni? This is one President we do not seem to mind re-electing himself three times.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000008"></a>We tend to become oversentimental about the Westminster model, and I think that the report agrees in recommendation 6. I expect the CPA manual, which I have not seen, to have dos and don&#146;ts such as &#147;Try not to lose your temper&#148;, &#147;Don&#146;t strike an MP from another party, only from your own&#148;, and &#147;Where possible, do not fire guns or attempt to blow up parliament&#148;. These things happen every now and then, and they have happened here. I have visited the Mozambican, Ugandan and, briefly, South African parliaments and have been impressed by their procedures. Some of them are copied. The Ugandan Parliament website shows some remarkable similarities to our own. I clicked on <I>Hansard</I> and found a debate on the inadequacy of the sickle cell anaemia unit in Mulago Hospital, with the PM responding directly to a petition. The Speaker had an endearing quality of engaging directly in the debate, as well as seeking clarification. Our Speaker in another place would enjoy that.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000009"></a>Four of our Clerks have attended parliamentary seminars in Africa based on an exchange of experience and skills, and Edward Ollard says that these are not one-way exercises. The South African Parliament, for example, is keen on outreach to the people and consultative exercises, such as have been advocated here by the Hansard Society.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000010"></a>I agree with much that the report says about the bypassing and even undermining of Governments by development partners, including indigenous NGOs. This is a fact of life in a developing country. NGOs will follow all options that help the poor, knowing that things often do not get done through parliament but by a combination of influences in and outside government. Parliaments must be strengthened but we can expect only gradual change. What happened to NePAD, which is now seven years old? Parliaments were once seen as a vital means of implementing the NePAD peer-review mechanism. Clearly, it is now on the back burner.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000011"></a>My CPA visit to the Mozambican parliament in 2002, led by Andrew Pearson, included a fascinating session with MPs. I congratulate the CPA on all such visits and on involving NGOs as fully as possible in meetings so that MPs and civil society can see that they are mutually valued.</p>

<p><a name="08071787000012"></a>In a post-conflict state, it is hardly surprising that fighters recently turned MPs should still distrust one another, and visitors sometimes help to restore confidence. All noble Lords will know of the partnership between the Westminster Foundation for Democracy and DfID

There is now to be a special focus on the training of trainers in Uganda and Mozambique, and there will be a university link through a parliamentary study centre. The foundation aims to work closely with individual parties and is naturally uneasy with the situation in some countries where there is a tendency towards one dominant party.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000013"></a>In Mozambique, Frelimo has been so powerful that I remember embassies and donors almost trying to nurse the Renamo MPs into a stronger role, in spite of the bloodthirsty reputation that they still carried from the civil war. The same will be true of northern Uganda if and when the LRA ex-combatants try to stand for elections. Opposition parties are still weak. Let us not forget that when Museveni&#146;s main rival, Kizza Besigye, returned to Uganda from exile to run for the presidency, he was arrested and charged with rape and treason, and was later snatched from a courtroom at gunpoint. The world just watched.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08071787000014"></a>Finally, Sierra Leone is another post-conflict case where a lot of quiet cajoling and encouraging has helped to restore the democratic processes. All those in DfID and other organisations deserve congratulations, for the new Administration is frail and continues to need support in its efforts to secure democracy, attract investment and restore confidence in the economy.</p>

I also congratulate the All-Party Group on this valuable and timely report, in which it took advice from real African experts from the ODI, the NDI and, particularly, the Royal African Society. It is timely, as the recommendations are in tune with the new government policy of recognising the importance of good governance in avoiding waste and misdirection of development aid.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000006"></a>Kenya is a good example of where the politics have destroyed much of the good development that has been done&#151;at least, in part. Traditionally in Africa there has been a lack of questioning of autocrats, even before some countries descended into the Bokassa or Amin regimes. I was pleased with the government response of a litany of the phrase &#147;We agree&#148; to the various recommendations. I am impressed with the belated DfID White Paper of 2006, <I>Governance, Development and Development Politics</I>, which drew on the valuable ODI report commissioned in February.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000007"></a>DfID has traditionally been wary of politics and parliaments. Its aim was to train specialists in the executive branch: tax inspectors and so on. It essentially worked only with departments. The Foreign Office has in many ways been slightly better equipped in reporting on parliaments, but it has its own drawbacks. It has relatively few African specialists, and its personnel tend to spend two-thirds of their careers aboard and are often out of touch with what happens in our own Parliament because there is a relatively limited interface with it.</p>

<p><a name="08071793000008"></a>Both DfID and FCO officials need increased training on parliaments, and that is not touched on in the report. Perhaps there is a contradiction, in that DfID  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC168"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC168</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has more money to disperse as a result of moving towards the 0.7 per cent target, whereas another arm of government policy is reducing the number of officials to monitor that. As a result of the reduction in DfID officials, the onus is on parliaments to make those officials accountable. I note that recommendation 34 encourages DfID to progress the idea of producing guidance for country officers. Country officers including a portion of their reports on the dispersing of aid might well be a useful tool for African parliaments in holding their Executives to account.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000009"></a>Recommendation 12 stresses that the FCO and DfID should recognise that political parties are a vital component of a democracy and should encourage their development separate from the tribe, region or the &#147;big man&#148;. I shall not go into detail but there is an excellent case study in Sierra Leone, where DfID passed &#163;400,000 to the Westminster Foundation for Democracy to train the various parties nationally. I understand that they even had an &#147;Any Questions&#148;-style session, where the parties had to say what they would do if they were in government; they even trained President Kabbah&#146;s party on adjusting to a time out of office before its defeat.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000010"></a>Recommendation 3 on co-ordination is vital. There are many other players on the field. I have had the honour of being in Somaliland with AWEPA with money from the European Union; of being in Togo with the Parliamentarians for Global Action; and of working with the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung in Ghana. We should seek to co-ordinate the work being done, which was perhaps insufficiently covered in the report. I also had the honour of doing some election monitoring for the IPU and CPA. It is also important to work with France. President Sarkozy has given a clear signal that he wishes to work with us.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000011"></a>My final point is that we are not starting from zero. Much work has already been done in the field. I stress the valuable work done by the CPA in Malawi, for example, where all the parliamentarians were defeated in one election. I was there with others running a seminar. The CPA runs seminars on governance, including a very helpful one in June this year on international parliamentary governance. They include clerks, which is very important not only for Commonwealth countries but for Rwanda, as well as inward and outward delegations. Most significant is its membership of the new Westminster Consortium, which was awarded &#163;5 million over five years from DfID&#146;s transparency fund for a sustained intervention, rather than brief encounters, in the countries selected. I welcome these bold initiatives. In brief, the CPA and others are there already. This is a valuable report and I hope that it will reinforce valuable change.</p>

I will refer back to his contribution in a moment. First, I join in the congratulations to my noble friend Lord Chidgey on initiating this very useful debate.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000013"></a>My mind goes back to when I first entered Parliament in the mid-1960s. It was the era of transition from colonialism to independence. My noble friend  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC169"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC169</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Lord Anderson will remember that in those days a lot of people in the House of Commons knew about Africa. They were either in the Movement for Colonial Freedom and tended to be on the Labour side, or they were in commerce or agriculture and sat largely on the Conservative side. A lot of people had an interest in Africa. Gradually that faded away as the years went by. As my noble friend Lord Anderson will remember, we reached a point where very few knew anything about Africa or took any interest. We used to scrabble around to get names on Early Day Motions, and it was the usual suspects&#151;him, me and about four or five others.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000014"></a>I am very glad to say&#151;and this is the point I want to make&#151;that the situation has now completely changed again. The All-Party Group&#151;ably chaired by Hugh Bayley, the Member for York&#151;which produced this report, has a large number of supporters in both Houses of Parliament. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, how much we appreciate the support that the Royal African Society gives to that group. It makes a tremendous difference to the impact it has on this Parliament and the interest that we now again take in Africa.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000015"></a>There are 46 recommendations, but in a short speech of five minutes I propose to deal with just one. It is the one that has already been mentioned, recommendation 12. I quote it exactly:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="08071793000196"></a>&#147;The importance of political parties to the strength of parliament was a consistent and acutely felt concern throughout this inquiry. DFID should consider working with organisations, such as leading political party institutes/foundations as well as International IDEA, to support the development of political parties&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="08071793000192"></a>In my experience, this is basically the weakness of the parliamentary institutions in Africa. The party-political system has not developed properly, and we need to do a lot more to encourage it. I agree with my noble friend Lord Anderson: we cannot expect FCO officials, or even DfID officials, to be expert in political matters. That is why the Westminster Foundation for Democracy is crucial. It could do with a bigger budget, and it could do with giving a bigger budget to the political parties in this country to enable them to nurture sister parties. Let us be blunt: the political parties in this country&#151;all of them&#151;are naturally using most of their resources for their own purposes. The amount that they put aside for international work is, in each case, relatively limited. Therefore any support that can be given to the Westminster Foundation for Democracy is to be welcomed.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000016"></a>Too many of the political parties in Africa are either personal fiefdoms of an individual or tribal institutions. We really must get away from that. A lot of work needs to be done. I was a founding board member of International IDEA. It was set up largely on the initiative of the Swedish parliament. It is scandalous&#151;and I say this to the Minister with great respect&#151;that the previous Government decided not to be a member of International IDEA. That was a terrible shame. I hope that this Government will eventually join the institution and help it to develop an international concept of standards of democracy. By producing an annual audit on corruption, institutions such as Transparency International have helped to put pressure  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC170"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC170</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>on that issue, just as Amnesty International has kept up pressure on human rights. However, we have no international democracy audit, and it is time we did so that we can range through the effectiveness of African parliaments&#151;indeed, the parliaments of the whole world. That could be done if a body such as International IDEA had more resources to produce a democracy audit. That would help to increase the pressure for political parties and parliaments to be much more effective.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000017"></a>I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, that we have exported some of the appurtenances of Parliament&#151;the wigs and the gowns are there in Zimbabwe&#151;but not, sadly, the basis of democracy. A few years ago, the high commissioner in Lesotho, who happened to be a Scotsman&#151;there is a little bit of prejudice here&#151;thought, rightly, that the Scottish Parliament was a better format than the Westminster Parliament for a country such as Lesotho, which was moving from a single-party to a multiparty system. He asked me to go out and conduct a series of seminars, which I did. I made some recommendations, which were followed, to get away from the imposition of opposing Benches, which is not really appropriate in struggling democracies. I think the Scottish model could be followed elsewhere. My plea is to look carefully at recommendation 12, and I urge the Government to implement it fully.</p>
<h5><a name="08071793000204"></a>4.36 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08071793000018"></a><a name="80717-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80717-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08071793000223"></a>Lord Avebury:</b> I join in the congratulations that have been expressed to my noble friend and his colleagues in the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Africa for attracting such a star cast to this debate on what is in some ways a rather depressing report. It highlights the weakness of parliaments in almost every African country, although its three examples are by no means the worst. Parliaments exist on paper in many states without making any practical impact on governance or on the scrutiny of the Executive. The report might have focused more on the connection between authoritarian presidential constitutions and systems of government and the absence of effective parliaments. It does not mention Zimbabwe, which was raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Park, where Mugabe has ruined the Parliament, or Sudan, where, under the comprehensive peace agreement, the National Assembly is an entirely appointed body.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000019"></a>I was particularly interested in the recommendation that a biannual report of the state of parliaments should be produced. From the references, it seems that UNDP would be the right body to initiate the project, initially defining the benchmarks, norms and standards to be used in assessing performance with the aid of the CPA and the IPU, and possibly the SADC parliamentary forum.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000020"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, mentioned NePAD's African peer review mechanism, which includes democracy and good political governance in its remit, but only 26 of the 42 AU states participate in the APRM, and it is a desultory process that produces very few reports. In the case of Ghana, which probably has one of the best parliamentary systems in Africa, the APRM was nevertheless told that Parliament is neither effective nor independent of the Executive branch. Can the  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC171"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC171</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Minister tell us whether the Government still think of NePAD as the best mechanism for promoting effective parliaments, which is one of the goals of objective 4 of the APRM?</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000021"></a>One of the witnesses told the APPG that strengthening parliaments is not simply an issue of capacity, and the report quotes former DfID Secretary of State, Hilary Benn, as suggesting that we should try to work to the plans of a country's people. However, the Government's plans may not accord with the wishes of the people in the absence of free and fair elections. In Cameroon, for example, rigged elections have allowed President Biya to stay in power since 1982, and the tame parliament has recently passed a resolution allowing him to stand for yet another seven-year term in 2010. If he is re-elected, that will allow him to remain in office until the age of 85. How does the Paris declaration on aid effectiveness, which is seen by DfID as needing to be applied more rigorously to parliamentary strengthening work, apply in that situation?</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000022"></a>One criticism of the aid programmes in this area, which has been mentioned by my noble friend and by the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, is familiar. It is that multiple development partners with multiple fund management mechanisms overload the recipients. Are we certain that even within our own agencies, and more widely among our EU partners, there is well managed co-ordination, so that all are working to a common strategy? Should there be a formal mechanism for developing common strategies and minimising the burden on African parliaments of dealing with a great many donors with different agendas?</p>
<h5><a name="08071793000205"></a>4.40 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08071793000023"></a><a name="80717-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><b><a name="80717-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="08071793000224"></a>Baroness Rawlings:</b> I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, for initiating this debate. I read with interest the report, which suggests a number of recommendations aimed at improving the effectiveness of African parliaments in their role of representing their people by holding the Executive to account.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000024"></a>On a continent with an unfortunate history of strong leaders or &#147;big men&#148;, I applaud efforts to encourage the confidence of legislatures and the proficiency of parliaments. The report makes recommendations which encourage an unobtrusive form of engagement, so that parliaments in Africa feel that they are &#147;pulling in&#148; changes rather than having them pushed by outsiders, and that development partners learn lessons from evidence and information that they have gathered. That seems sensible to us.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000025"></a>We were, however, disappointed by the Government&#146;s response to the report. They have agreed in the most general way with its recommendations, but while there is plenty of dense jargon, there are rather fewer hard, cold facts. For example, we are told that,</p>
<ul><a name="08071793000198"></a>&#147;in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we are contributing &#163;62 million to a five year multi-donor governance programme, led by the UNDP, which includes a DFID contribution of &#163;5.8 million to a &#163;10 million parliaments and political parties strengthening component&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="08071793000193"></a>That sounds very worthy, but what does it mean? Where exactly is the money going? In that example, where is the other &#163;56.8 million going? What outcome is expected and by what measure will it be judged a success or failure?</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC172"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC172</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000026"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Steel, said, we would like the Government to be much clearer about how this multi-million pound budget is being spent. How is DfID&#146;s outlay for strengthening parliaments in Africa audited? It is one thing to say that it may be a long process&#151;I accept that there will be no immediate result and that our aim is to build up parliaments over time so that they can learn to exercise their roles by evolving their own distinctive legislative personalities&#151;but there must be some way of assessing whether we are spending taxpayers&#146; money wisely. What outcomes are being tracked? In which countries does the tracking take place, and what exactly is being tracked to assess those outcomes? Will the Minister tell the Committee whether DfID helps to establish transparency within the parliaments which receive direct funding? As well as allowing us to follow as accurately as possible where our money is going, I hope that such a scheme, if presented sensitively, would help engender a culture of accountability and probity in countries where elected office is sadly sometimes regarded as a path to riches.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000027"></a>I am not criticising the goal of strengthening parliaments&#151;quite the opposite. I hope that by building up contacts and support we will be able to achieve a lasting improvement in those institutions. I had the pleasure of the company of His Excellency the Ambassador of Senegal this week. I was very interested to hear that Senegal, one of the most stable, prosperous and democratic countries in West Africa, spends 40 per cent of its GDP on education and has recently added an upper House to its parliament.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000028"></a>In east Africa, there are examples of aid towards education through the Aga Khan Development Network and grants made to civil society organisations. They monitor their own spending very rigorously. If private organisations are able to do that, one might hope that government can follow suit and be much clearer on where and how money is being spent.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000029"></a>Are funds being diverted from embassies towards DfID? The United Kingdom has no direct representation in 23 of the 53 African states. In a Westminster Hall debate on 20 May, the noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown, was quoted as saying that the Government were,</p>
<ul><a name="08071793000199"></a>&#147;trying to grow our diplomatic footprint in Africa&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 20/5/08; col. 55WH.]</ul>
<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000030"></a>Will the Minister indicate how those efforts are coming along?</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000031"></a>One country which has expanded its footprint in Africa is China. It appears that it is interested more in trade than aid and is less likely to champion parliamentary democracy in those countries where it is expanding its influence. Is the Minister at all concerned that the softly-softly approach espoused by DfID may get drowned out by the din of Chinese construction teams building roads from mines to ports across Africa? I am not suggesting that we are in any competition for influence with the Chinese, but it is another reason why I would like to be reassured about the efficiency of the schemes that we are supporting.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000032"></a>In February, my colleague, the honourable Andrew Mitchell MP, called for 5 per cent of Britain&#146;s budgetary support for developing countries to be earmarked for tracking where our development money is going. Does the Minister support devoting just a small amount to safeguard our overall investment?</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC173"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC173</b><br /> <br /></columnNum><h5><a name="08071793000215"></a>4.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="08071793000117"></a><a name="80717-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><b><a name="80717-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="08071793000235"></a>Lord Bach:</b> I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, for raising this important subject today. The Government very much welcomed the report that he and his distinguished colleagues on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Africa prepared. We congratulate them on that report. The star cast that we have in Grand Committee in the Moses Room this afternoon is worth much more than a rather hurried one-hour debate on this subject. Although noble Lords have been fantastically self-disciplined in keeping to their small five-minute blocks, I will have to be pretty disciplined to keep to the 12 minutes that I am permitted and will not be able to answer all the valid points asked of me by various noble Lords. However, I shall do my best to explain to the Committee where the Government stand on this important issue.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000118"></a>First, we believe that this is exactly the right time to discuss parliaments in Africa. Nine out of 10 Africans say they want to live in a democracy. According to Freedom House, half of the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa may now be classed as democracies. I heard, of course, what my noble friend Lady Amos said about elections. However, frankly, all is not well. The ongoing situation in Zimbabwe, on which the noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, concentrated, has shown starkly that the trappings of democracy are not enough. Election results must reflect the will of the people, and robust institutions must represent citizens and provide a check on how power is exercised.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000119"></a>I hope that our position on Zimbabwe is absolutely clear. We condemn the violence and do not recognise the outcome of the second round of the sham presidential election. We call for a new transitional Government who reflect the will of the Zimbabwean people as shown on 29 March, and we call on all members of the international community to work towards the restoration of democracy in that country.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000120"></a>Parliaments must be able to play a full role in democratic governance. Where they need it, the UK should support parliaments. We have made many significant investments; for example, since 2001 we have provided nearly &#163;4.5 million to the Malawian Parliament in support of its five-year strategic plan. African parliaments are holding their executives to account, in high-profile ways, such as in Tanzania, where the Prime Minister resigned because of parliamentary pressure over corruption allegations, and in smaller, everyday ways, such as in Zambia, where in 2007 the Government withdrew an unsuitable Bill on NGOs at parliament&#146;s request. We want to see more of this, and will continue to invest in strengthening the institutions that make this possible. The question is how best we can do that, and it is to that matter that noble Lords have set their minds today.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000121"></a>The report makes some helpful recommendations. It emphasises the need to base support on a thorough understanding of the political context, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, said, can be very varied. It mentions the importance of broad-based local ownership and the need for donor co-ordination. It highlights the need to use evidence, learn and share lessons, assess parliamentary performance and evaluate the impact   


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC174"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC174</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>of our support. It urges donors not to marginalise parliaments, but to encourage them to play a full part in development relationships.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000122"></a>Of course, it is almost a statement of the obvious that parliaments are inherently political, as the report clearly points out, and as Members of this House are well aware, whether or not they were Members of another place earlier in their career. Recent events in Africa have reinforced the group&#146;s observation about the importance of the wider political context. We should base our work on an analysis of the political context and focus our efforts accordingly. For example, where a parliament is unable to exercise a check on the Executive, we should encourage the development of civil society and political parties.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000123"></a>However, where parliament plays an important role, or has the potential to do so, support can be beneficial if it is designed to suit the political context. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, through its network of posts around Africa, makes it its business to understand the political context in individual African countries. DfID&#146;s country governance analysis is helping to improve its understanding of political contexts and to identify where we can support democratisation. FCO political expertise feeds into that process as well.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000124"></a>Understanding the political context also means focusing on how parliaments engage with their public and civil society. In Nigeria, we helped set up a civil society office at the Nigerian parliament to improve interaction between parliament and civil society. Increasingly, the UK&#146;s support to parliaments is through integrated programmes to promote accountability more broadly. For example, our Deepening Democracy programmes in Uganda, Malawi and the DRC support a range of oversight and accountability institutions to help provide the checks and balances vital for democracy. Wherever DfID missions are present in Africa, we encourage joint political reporting from the head of mission and the head of the DfID office and close co-operation on political and developmental issues. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, we have committed &#163;62 million over a five-year period for strengthening democracy and government accountability, including support to the legislatures, political parties and the electoral commission.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000125"></a>My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary recently said that democracy has to be &#147;home-grown&#148;. Our experience here in Westminster may be valuable, but that does not mean that it can be transferred elsewhere. That is in line with what the noble Lord, Lord Steel, was talking about when he supported recommendation 12 of the report. When we support parliaments, we look to the parliament itself for direction. In Malawi, Uganda and Zambia, we have rooted our support in the parliaments&#146; own strategic plans. We have learnt that our assistance achieves more if it is based on demand from parliamentarians themselves.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000126"></a>Donor co-ordination has been referred to. Many of our projects are carried out jointly with other donors and other organisations. We have recently awarded &#163;5 million over five years to the Westminster Consortium for Parliaments and Democracy, a joint venture between the much-praised Westminster Foundation for Democracy, the Overseas Office of the House of Commons, the  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC175"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC175</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>National Audit Office and the UK branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The consortium will support a range of demand-led strategies for strengthening parliaments.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000127"></a>DfID is at the forefront of donor co-ordination on support to parliaments. With partners, we are holding a conference in October at Wilton Park on parliamentary strengthening. DfID will then host a meeting of the donor co-ordination group on parliamentary development to discuss how to strengthen collaboration and increase impact. We agree with the All-Party Group that it is important to assess the effectiveness of our support to parliaments. We are helping to fund the Africa Legislatures Project, which aims to enhance understanding of the ability of 18 case-study legislatures to represent the people, make laws and oversee the Executive. We think that this will also help us to develop a better basis for evaluating the impact of parliamentary strengthening programmes and deciding where such programmes are most needed.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000128"></a>Development assistance should not undermine the role of parliaments but should seek, where appropriate, to strengthen it. Managing development assistance is, for the most part, the responsibility of the Executive. Parliament&#146;s role is to hold that Executive accountable. We believe that it is better to strengthen such domestic accountability arrangements rather than to establish special arrangements for donors to report directly to parliaments. That is where I think we disagree with one of the report&#146;s recommendations.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000129"></a>Our direct budget support already provides a basis for parliamentary scrutiny: it forms part of the country&#146;s government budget, which should be approved by Parliament and subsequently reported on. Where we provide direct budget support, we generally also support public financial management. In Zambia, DfID gives budget support and acts as lead donor for support to the parliament and for a financial management programme, which involves the Public Accounts Committee.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000130"></a>This has been an excellent, if too short, debate, covering many important issues. If I try to deal with the questions that have been asked, that will take me, and the debate, much over the allotted time.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000131"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, raised a point about democratic Governments and aid to those Governments. We do not believe that we should confine aid to countries with democratic Governments because, frankly, poor people are not confined to such countries, and a lot of poor people live in countries with poor Governments. Therefore, although it is not easy, we have to see how we can best make an impact, despite the problems. Where a Government are simply not committed to helping their own citizens, we will still use our aid to help poor people and promote better governance, but we will do so by working outside government with the civil societies and with international agencies such as the UN.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000132"></a>DfID&#146;s policy is to make information on conditions attaching to individual programmes available on its website. Putting this into practice requires changes to DfID&#146;s system, and we are working to introduce those changes. As to making public our aid agreements, I am advised that under the Freedom of Information

<p><a name="08071793000133"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, raised the issue of Uganda, where corruption, weak accountability across government and a lack of respect for the independence of the judiciary all need to be addressed. We want to continue working with that Government to ensure that those do not become problematic issues, and through our aid programme, we are helping to establish the institutions required to fight corruption.</p>

<p><a name="08071793000134"></a>I have not answered other questions. My time has run out, so, if it is acceptable to the Committee, I shall write with answers to the various points that I have been asked during the debate. I end by saying that the success, or otherwise, of the democratic process in Africa captures the attention of a watching world. A point made well by the noble Lord, Lord Steel, was that in Parliament Africa is now once again very high up on the interest list of many Members of another place and, clearly from this debate, of this House as well.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000135"></a>In Zimbabwe and Kenya&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and I were guests at a lunch held by the Lord Speaker for Kenyan parliamentarians just a few weeks ago&#151;we have seen what happens when things go badly wrong. We have seen that African citizens are not willing to tolerate rigged elections and authoritarian rule. That is why we include support for democracy in UK international development programmes. Elections are one part of that democratic process but, for a functioning democracy&#151;as perhaps we know in this country too&#151;states need structures and institutions that hold Governments accountable not just some of the time, but all the time. Parliaments are vital in this, and our support can help them to fulfil their role. Once again, I thank the All-Party Group for producing such an excellent report.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000034"></a>The noble Lord said: I thank noble Lords who have put their names down to speak in this short debate. I must make a small confession about this scheme. I discovered it properly when it was finished and did not pay enough attention to it when it was building up, so I have a bit of the zealousness of a convert about it. I did not realise how revolutionary its approach was: it attracted adults back into participation. We have often spoken about sport, and there are a series of clich&#233;s about it. Everybody talks about children, school sport or school-age sport and then says that we must enhance the club link. However, until now, there has not been a scheme that addresses the primary problem of the huge drop-off in participation between the age of 16 to 18 and adult life. There are other drop-off points when people change their lifestyles; for example, between  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC177"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC177</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>the end of college or university and the first job. It is clear that people&#146;s lives are organised so that there are points where they break the contacts and the habit of sport.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000035"></a>We then tend to fall into the trap of having schemes where we have lots of children running around a politician and a sports star standing in the middle of a field&#151;at a junior level, I have been that politician&#151;and then the politician goes to another event. I got the feeling that the children might even be bussed from event to event&#151;fresh faced kids who do not know whether they are holding a cricket bat, a rugby ball or squash racket that afternoon. There were a lot of them. It is true that school sport has gone through something of a transformation and more energy has been pumped into it, but we always seem to miss the fact that getting adults taking part in sport is the most important thing.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000036"></a>There are other good schemes that try to maintain the good practice of keeping people involved from the transfer on, but changes in lifestyle mean that those who are casual participants and not natural first-teamers tend to be lost. That is why this scheme is so important, because it went out to recruit those who had stopped playing the game but were basically sport-literate and brought them back in.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000037"></a>Noble Lords may think that this is not rocket science, and that is its beauty. It is a targeted approach to bring people back. It was done round the greatest spike of attention that Rugby Union would get: the world cup. It comes once every four years, England were defending champions and it was expected that they would do fairly well. True, the expectations may not have been quite as high at one time in the tournament as they were by the time it ended, but nevertheless the team had a rollercoaster ride, lots of attention and the situation was transformed and was well used.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000038"></a>A scheme that was designed to get 6,000 players involved and coming back into the game got 9,500 people. It also inspired a considerable number of volunteers to get back involved with the game, in terms of organisation, support work, referees and coaches. The cross-section included people who had been away from the game predominantly for at least one season. Would the Minister not agree that that was something that many of the government targets aim towards? It fulfils virtually every single government goal; it ticks the boxes; it gets people back involved. Why is this so important to the sport? Because these are amateur sports clubs whose greatest asset is their players&#151;their asset in terms not only of playing the game but also their financial stability. There was an investment of about &#163;1 million and they got 9,000 players, so it was just over &#163;100 each player. That is a conservative estimate for a normal rugby club. True, these are institutions with bars&#151;although I am not sure that the relationship between Rugby Union and beer should be acknowledged, at least at the traditional amateur level. But those are clubs where those people come and spend money and use the leisure facilities. They will probably purchase some of the merchandise and take part in the social events; they will be socially integrated and interacting with a group of like-minded people. That is why this scheme is important.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC178"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC178</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000039"></a>Having got the ideology in full swing, I turn to the scheme, about which there was one particularly attractive thing. At the previous world cup, which England won, people who did not know how many players there were on the pitch in a Rugby Union game suddenly became rugby fans and there was a great spike&#151;or was that just my feeling as an old hack in the sport myself? According to the first page of the document, there was great attention and lots of activity but in the junior ranks; it did not attract the people who will support the clubs and ultimately support those juniors to go on. There was an admission and acknowledgement that something had not been maximised.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000040"></a>Then there was a pilot scheme in Surrey in 2006. It took a little digging, but I got the RFU to admit that there were problems with it and that it did not get it right first time. It always makes me feel better about a scheme when I realise that someone had to adapt it slightly. Indeed, certain things surprised me on reading the document through; for example, the phone lines did not work for giving out information about where people could go and find a club, which is a very important part of this. The text services did&#151;but possibly my age shows. Also, there was the fact that advertising on buses was a total waste of time. Small things like that meant that it was a targeted audience. Then it was backed up by other forms of advertising later, which were targeted. We can go through what worked and what did not; if the club did not invest in getting people to receive people at the right time and help people as they turned up, it would probably lose them.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000041"></a>Messages of that type were taken into the scheme around the time of the world cup. Once again, it was not a universal success but it was a success across the board. There was a targeted advertising campaign and a better services website that allowed people to know where the nearest clubs to them were, and it was combined with preparing the ground properly and making sure that there were packs and people at the clubs. That apparently encountered resistance from certain clubs that wanted to have their name up, as opposed to rugby. Why people play for amateur clubs is usually down to accidents of geography and who their friends are. The scheme tried to ensure that those things meshed together and gave incentives to get friends to come to the rugby club for a social function and to play so getting people involved in the whole activity.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000042"></a>Another very important factor about this is that it brought people together. In certain cases, small rugby clubs that were in danger of folding found themselves with teams. Remember that most rugby clubs will now have other sports attached to them. Cricket and rugby are an old pairing; one summer, one winter. Rugby League and Rugby Union now coexist on many sites. The fact that you are taking part in one sport, a social activity at a set time, means that you are often prepared to do so for another sport.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000043"></a>A more recent example, closer to home, is that four members of the Commons and Lords Rugby Club were in the House of Lords boat that today beat the Commons in a race outside; I did not count the Commons team. There is interaction; these sports feed  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC179"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC179</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>off each other. What steps has the Minister taken to encourage this model being adopted by other sports? Rugby itself will probably benefit indirectly if it is, but the agenda of getting people involved and supporting the social function of sports clubs will be enhanced and reinforced by this process. To adopt something where somebody from outside has taken on board the Government&#146;s aims in this way, largely for selfish reasons, is effectively a no-brainer. How do the Government propose to enhance this position and the transfer of information?</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000044"></a>I have not given universal praise to my own sport in this House, but this is one time when Rugby Union has got it right. It has something to teach the rest of the sporting world.</p>

I was sitting in the Chamber wondering where the noble Lord, Lord Addington, was. Anyway, he is here now. I thank and congratulate the noble Lord on initiating this debate on rugby, and for highlighting the wonderful achievements of the Go Play Rugby programme. As a player of the game himself, it is close to his heart. His contribution showed that clearly. The noble Lord can always be relied upon to take part in any debate on sport in this House and his contributions are always based on a knowledge of sport in general.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000046"></a>I must confess that rugby was not a sport in which I excelled at school myself. I found it a bit brutal, so I reverted to the more gentle sport of boxing under the protection of the Marquess of Queensberry rules. Having said that, I congratulate Sport England for its involvement in the Rugby Football Union&#146;s Go Play Rugby scheme&#151;one of the first funders to do so. Sport England has invested &#163;55 million in Rugby Union since 2002. The campaign aimed to attract 6,000 adult players back to the sport but has in fact actually attracted 9,500 players back to the game. I was given these impressive statistics by Alexandra Russell, the regional PR manager of Sport England.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000047"></a>Only this week, I spoke at the opening of a memorial recreation ground in Newham, east London. As part of a &#163;15 million scheme to improve leisure and parks by next spring, they will have a state-of-the-art facility focusing on two of our country&#146;s national sports, football and rugby. The East End of London is not as well known as the West End for Rugby Union teams, so it was most pleasing to learn of the developments taking place in Newham. Newham School&#146;s tag rugby world cup competition for primary schools was held, and 20 primary schools took part and 200 children participated. Also, Newham Schools world cup rugby competition was held at Memorial Park, where 10 secondary schools took part and 100 children participated. Newham is definitely on the move as far as rugby is concerned.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000048"></a>I last raised the important subject of sport and physical activity in this House on 5 June. It was therefore with great pleasure that I learned of the Government&#146;s announcement the following day&#151;this was nothing to do with my debating skills&#151;on free swimming for the over 60s. Swimming is the most  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC180"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC180</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>popular participatory sport in the UK. Removing the cost barrier to swimming is an important step forward. After reading the Government&#146;s Olympic legacy strategy at length, it is clear that it was not the only measure to be applauded. For example, I was particularly pleased to note the Government&#146;s pledge to inspire 2 million people to take up sport and physical recreation by the 2012 Olympics.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000049"></a>There is considerable evidence to prove that exercise is the most effective way of reducing the risks of more than 20 diseases at least&#151;diseases which, as a nation, we are all aware of, including stroke, diabetes, obesity and heart disease. I have made the financial case before in this House, and make no apology for doing so again. More than two-thirds of the British public do not reach the minimum level of physical activity. That affects the economy to the tune of &#163;13.2 billion per year in sickness absence costs&#151;the equivalent of 175 million working days. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has found that work based on physical activity programmes can significantly reduce absenteeism and staff turnover.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000050"></a>The Foresight report on future trends in obesity predicts a cost, at current trends, of some &#163;50 billion a year. In Essex, there is a gym-based programme operating across five primary care trusts called condition management. It focuses on getting people on incapacity benefit back to work. Services include advice on diet and exercise but also focus on career development and helping people overcome barriers to work, whether they are emotional, educational or health-related. The programme works with people with stress, depression and muscular problems, giving practical advice to encourage positive thinking.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000051"></a>It is clear that without these huge investments in sport and physical activity programmes of this nature, the economy and health of this country would be much poorer. We have heard today of an excellent project, Go Play Rugby, which deserves all the attention it has received. These amateur sporting schemes, as the noble Lord, Lord Addington, has said, are very important; they are essential cogs in the vast change we need to endorse across the nation.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000052"></a>We also need increasing national rollout schemes and mass promotion which have cost benefits in terms of economies of scale. It is encouraging to see the Government taking steps in the right direction. I only hope that they will do more to empower those bodies with a presence in our communities to do what they do best in providing opportunities to be physically active.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000053"></a>Go Play Rugby has made a huge impact and we applaud its success. I should like to highlight some other programmes which have been effective in introducing physical activity into people&#146;s lives. Go London is an extension of the national Go programmes which were launched in March 2008 by the Fitness Industry Association to get more teenage girls more active. It is widely known that there is a massive drop-out rate among young girls around the age of 14 who are doing sport, and this can have detrimental effects in the long term, if not for ever.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000054"></a>The Go programme was originally developed in response to the Government&#146;s research which highlighted the fact that teenage girls are a healthcare priority, key  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC181"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC181</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>to reversing the escalating obesity crisis. The Go London project has given 14 to 16 year-old girls free access to health club facilities, allowed them to participate in non-traditional sporting activities and engage in a range of modern, exhilarating exercise sessions led by professional qualified instructors.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000055"></a>Another programme I commend is Adopt a School. Completely free of charge for the schools involved, Adopt a School pairs up health and fitness clubs with local schools to give kids access and opportunities to engage in fun physical activities.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000056"></a>Last week I received, as no doubt other noble Lords did, an update on the new opportunities for PE and sport programmes: a nationwide &#163;750 million lottery investment in sporting facilities for young people and the wider community. Nearly 3,000 sports facilities have been funded to date, leading to a 70 per cent increase in the number of activities available in the communities in which these facilities have sprung up.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000057"></a>Active at Work is an adult programme that has been running across parts of Britain for over three years and targets inactive employees. The programme lasts for 12 weeks in which a group of up to 30 employees receive complimentary gym membership and instructor-led group sessions at least once a fortnight. At the end of the three months, participants are offered avenues to carry on exercising in other ways. The health and fitness industry has a great deal of spare capacity. With more than 30,000 people on the Register of Exercise Professionals, these programmes can be channelled within clubs and leisure centres or out in the community. These are some examples of programmes run by the health and fitness industry. We must support these efforts wholeheartedly if the Government are to achieve their target of getting 2 million people more active more often by 2012.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000058"></a>I conclude by congratulating the noble Lord on bringing another important dimension into the debate surrounding sport. Let us hope that the points that he has made in this debate are heard by the wider public.</p>
<h5><a name="08071793000208"></a>5.20 pm</h5>

Nobody can accuse my noble friend of being an armchair commentator, which is unusual in this House in the sporting area. I particularly appreciate his positive approach to this subject. He has highlighted the RFU&#146;s Go Play Rugby scheme as a great example of how to encourage participation in sport from school through the transition into the community. There is no reason why maximising success, developing talent and encouraging the greatest possible participation should not go hand in hand. They are not mutually incompatible, and they should not be competing priorities. It is clear that ensuring that the transition from school to the community has become the focus of many sports&#146; governing bodies.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000060"></a>Whatever one thinks about Sport England and its previous priorities and whether it was successful in meeting its targets&#151;I am afraid I do not think it

I welcome that shift in emphasis in giving the national governing bodies a much greater role and money in return for delivery of key outcomes by means of whole sport plans. In its funding, Sport England has also recognised the importance of a network of modern, accessible clubs for each sport, which we welcome. The new strategy stands a much better chance of delivering its targets and being successful than the previous strategy.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000061"></a>The RFU&#146;s Go Play Rugby scheme will form a template for the future in adult recruitment campaigns. It was remarkably successful. Some 700 clubs took part, which was more than was anticipated. It was centred around the 2007 world cup. At that time, there was a slight dip, and I suspect that at one point the RFU thought &#147;Heavens! This is not going to work out.&#148;. At one stage, it seemed to be a relatively high-risk strategy, but what a triumph at the end of the day.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000062"></a>We now have Play On, which is designed to help players stay in the game as they move between school, club and university. It will take place throughout 2008-09. The RFU has put forward the idea of a pathfinder to help players move through what it calls the rugby journey. Go Play Rugby achieved something like 9,500 recruits against a target of 6,000. The RFU has calculated that from an outlay of &#163;1 million something like &#163;23 million will come back over five seasons. That is quite some achievement.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000063"></a>With the Play On campaign, the RFU has some innovative ways of attracting the attention of the target groups. I recently received an e-mail, which I must admit made me feel as though Tuesday could not come too soon. It said, &#147;Scrum down on the sand. This summer, O2 and the RFU have teamed up to bring you O2 Scrum on the Beach&#148;. That is quite an invitation and I look forward very much to next week, although I may not necessarily be found scrumming down on the beach. It is no wonder that the RFU scheme achieved the accolade of being shortlisted for the Sports Industry Awards in the category of best promotion of a sport by a governing body. I am just sorry that the competition was so fierce that it did not end up as winner of that category, but that demonstrates that it has the accolade of its peers. It was a very professional write-up too.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0006.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000064"></a>What is remarkable is not just the nature of the campaign but the quality of the evaluation, which enables us, as opinion-formers, to form a view by very carefully examining some of the outcomes. I believe that it is a great model, as it shows how the Olympics can be used to drive greater participation. I am sure that a lot of very useful models could be derived from that campaign.</p>

<p><a name="08071793000065"></a>Of course, other sports bodies&#151;perhaps not quite as successfully but certainly in a growing way&#151;are also very much engaged in finding new ways of encouraging participation. We have the ECB&#146;s Get Into Cricket campaign, which is resulting in something like &#163;30 million of investment in facilities and in club cricket. There is the Grassroots Athletics roadshow and the Power of 10 scheme. I love the way that different sports use different metaphors in order to  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC183"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC183</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>encourage participation. That is a very powerful metaphor for athletics. The Get Into Football campaign is funding something like 270 football development officers.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000066"></a>The Lawn Tennis Association&#146;s new work in this area is a particularly good example, and it is interesting that it has come at just about the same time as the RFU&#146;s scheme. It is a condition of funding that tennis clubs have a junior development programme, and there is the Tennis Clubmark condition, in which clubs can apply for loans, grants and programme funding. It is a strategic tool to drive improvement in the sport. There is also the development of community tennis through hot spots, in which, in due course, some 20 specific areas will be funded. There are also beacon sites, which will have dedicated coaches.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000067"></a>The sport governing bodies want to see the Government take various actions. The national alliance of governing bodies, the CCPR, is increasingly clear about the kinds of steps that need to be taken and the benefits of increasing participation in school sports through to community sport. It is committed to extending participation, and there is a remarkable consensus by the CCPR that has, in my view, led to the Sport England change of strategy. It centres around the local club, which, as my noble friend said, is crucial. One of the CCPR&#146;s suggestions is to enhance the community amateur sports clubs scheme by making junior subscriptions eligible for Gift Aid. It has made some fairly careful calculations and reckons that by 2012 this could cost the Government a mere &#163;2 million. The impact of that could be absolutely enormous. In the context of the Olympics, that is very important, but it is not clear what additional funding the Government are making available in order to increase participation in the run-up to the Olympics.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000068"></a>My noble friend Lord Addington and I have a recent, terrific example. It is the inspiring story of a local rugby club where participation by young people has changed people&#146;s lives astronomically. The noble Lord, Lord Pendry, whose speech I very much enjoyed, spoke about rugby in Newham. Well, this is a rugby club in Southwark called the Southwark Tigers. As a result of a profile in the <I>Times</I>, my noble friend Lord Addington and I made contact and we are now helping it identify how it can get a club house, and work with the local cricket club and other sports clubs to improve its facilities. It plays in Burgess Park. It was founded by Vernon Neve-Dunn and has done a remarkable job with very few resources. Some 80 children attend Sunday practices and it has quite a number of teams. The benefits of the rugby training and of playing in the teams have been enormous. It is one of very few examples&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Pendry cited another&#151;of home-grown, inner-city rugby. As a rugby fan, I am convinced that it will be of great significance. Now, off the back of a youth team, it is developing a senior side that will in turn give greater support to the junior side.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000069"></a>I must finish at this point. I shall be extremely interested to hear what the Minister has to say. It is not, of course, just a matter of resources but also of enthusiasm. My noble friend has demonstrated enormous enthusiasm for his sport, and other governing bodies do likewise. The RFU&#146;s example is an inspiring story, and if we can replicate it across other sports we are set for a bright future.</p>

It was very encouraging. Perhaps if he has some spare time he could come and give me some assistance with the Castle Rising football club, of which I am chairman, which seems to lurch from one request for a cheque to the next.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000071"></a>I declare an interest as chairman of the National Playing Fields Association, so I am sure the Committee will realise how delighted I am with the contribution to sport that the scheme has made. It is very encouraging, and I am delighted that it has worked as well as it has. Everything about it has been said by noble Lords. There was a request to ask the Minister how far he will extend and encourage these sorts of schemes. Will he get as far as tiddlywinks, darts or ping-pong? One never knows where it is going to stop.</p>

<p><a name="08071793000072"></a><a name="80717-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><b><a name="80717-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="08071793000229"></a>Lord Davies of Oldham:</b> I am grateful to all noble Lords who have spoken in this interesting debate and particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Addington. I appreciate his dash from the successful crew to this Room. I congratulate him on that achievement, which cheered us all. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, is no armchair enthusiast and that was proved this afternoon. We know the noble Lord&#146;s commitment to rugby as well as his general interest in sport.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000073"></a>He is right that the Rugby Football Union&#146;s Go Play Rugby campaign was hugely successful. It attracted more than 9,000 players back into the game and identified an issue that exercises us all, which is the drop-out rate in sports. As my noble friend Lord Pendry indicated in his contribution, we are concerned to strengthen the links between school and clubs that ensure that young people come into sport, but tackling the drop-out rate is of great significance, too. We all know how greatly it affects sports. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Addington, that the Go Play Rugby campaign was in many ways a potential template for other sports to tackle the phenomenon of people finishing in a sport too early when they would often benefit by returning to it. I agree also with the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, that the health of the nation is aided significantly if we can promote exercise and commitment to sport throughout much longer periods of people&#146;s lives.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000074"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Howard, asked how far we will go. The answer is that we will deal with authorised national governing bodies of significant sports. I counsel him, however, that I have no means of assessing how aggressively the tiddlywinks people present their case&#151;although, since they have been mentioned in today&#146;s debate, I expect representations from them. I advise him, too, to be a little careful with ping-pong. Table tennis is a mightily important sport in this country. I am president of a hugely successful table tennis club in Enfield with which I have a long association. I assure the noble Lord that nothing is more effectively and efficiently run than that club. Nothing brings youngsters into sport and into really vigorous exercise more than  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC185"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC185</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>ping-pong or table tennis. With China hosting the Olympic Games this year, we should be careful to pay due respect to a significant sport which challenges the abilities of young people.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000075"></a>Sport is not just about professionals; it is about reaching out into the community and the grass-roots structure. That is why Go Play Rugby&#146;s success was important. Bringing 6,000 players back into the game exceeded its expectations and was a signal success. As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, indicated, it had a national media campaign which coincided with the excitement around the world cup. Although England did not quite reach the heights of 2003, the team certainly sustained interest throughout the competition most brilliantly. In many respects, people warmed as much to its valiant efforts on that occasion as they had to its success in Australia four years earlier.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000076"></a>The campaign was supported by Sport England. More than half a million pounds went through the National Sports Foundation, which is why we are pleased to recognise the campaign&#146;s success. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, that one of its important aspects was evaluation: what have we learned from the campaign and what lessons can we derive that are of value to other sports? The RFU undertook substantial research into the effectiveness of the campaign and helped to set up a model for how things can be done in future. Sport England benefits from illustrations of successful endeavour of that kind. I hasten to add that it has similar expertise available to help other sports with media campaigns. I am quite sure that sports are looking at the success of Go Play Rugby, related to a particularly significant year for the sport, and will organise themselves in the same way.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000077"></a>The Active People survey carried out by the RFU has produced a wealth of data around participation levels in sport. Special England has built on that and broadened it right across sports in England. We now have data on the participation in sport by adults over 16 for every local authority in England. That gives us a base for progress. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, paid due tribute to this. These are our essential tools for working out how resources can be directed most effectively. We all know that resources are never limitless&#151;although I assure noble Lords that we will continue, through the sports governing bodies, to direct resources to these targets. We now have a model on which sport is able to build to get a clear analysis of what needs to be done. We can take encouragement from other sports governing bodies which are responding to the challenge of increasing delivery.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000078"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, indicated his reservations about past work by Sport England. It has changed its priorities. We now regard it as being well placed to deliver a new era for sport. It is an opportunity, which of course is reinforced by the significance of the Olympic Games, to promote sport in England and across the United Kingdom.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000079"></a>We should not underestimate the significance of this year. Once the Olympic flag is handed from Beijing to London, attention switches significantly with regard to the whole Olympic movement and world interest in sport. It is an enormous opportunity for this country.  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC186"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC186</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>There are still sceptics&#151;not present, I hasten to add, among noble Lords here today&#151;who wonder whether the world will respond, or whether London and the country can respond to the challenge. We should have every confidence. This country is one of the outstanding participative sporting nations in the world. It is not always the highest achiever in every single sport, but that may be a reflection of the sheer diversity of the participation of Britons in sport. Whenever I am assailed by the question how it is that we promote the most significant tennis tournament in the world and yet it is nearly 75 years since we last had a Wimbledon male champion, I reflect on the fact that of course tennis is only one of the great sports in which people participate. It should be recognised therefore that there are counter-pressures in other sports through their sheer abundance and the opportunities which are provided.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000080"></a>The job of Sport England is, through effective governing bodies, to ensure that we increase opportunities. We want those opportunities to be in terms of encouraging people to play sport for life, which was, after all, the essence of the Rugby Union campaign which is the subject of this debate. It is clear that we have to focus on a shared goal with the governing bodies to maximise English sporting success. We are not going to get high-level success unless we expand the talent pool and improve the quality of what we do at every level. The key&#151;and it is well attested through a range of sports&#151;to success at the highest level is the nurturing of the grass roots and the opportunities provided there.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000081"></a>The strategy that Sport England is presenting is a new partnership, which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, in his contribution recognised, between Sport England and the national governing bodies. It obviously needs more public funding to deliver against the outcomes of grow, sustain and excel. It will recognise that it will be expected to meet targets. Again, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, emphasised this point, and the noble Lord, Lord Addington, also reflected on the question of achievement. We intend to ensure that those who have pursued successful strategies are encouraged and rewarded by the resources made available to them. Others who fall off the pace have to buck up their game, frankly. It is important that they are incentivised. To obtain grants, support and financial resources, they must have strategies which meet the overall position. This strategy is central to our objectives of increasing participation in sport from grass roots up and allowing everyone to develop their potential. Of course, we look forward to sport gaining from the Olympic excitement in this country once the transfer of the flag has occurred. I have not the slightest doubt that we shall see a significant leap forward.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000082"></a>However, although the rugby scheme is concerned with retaining people in sport, the Government have been committed to developing sport and physical exercise in schools, ensuring that they have the resources to develop young people&#146;s sporting talents when they are at their most creative. There are tough participation targets across the country, which can only be good for sport.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000083"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Addington, indicated in his remarks, the relationship with clubs is crucial. In the past, our greatest weakness as a sporting nation  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC187"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC187</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>has been that we have relied upon clubs to operate in an entirely free-market structure within which they sink or rise according to their own strengths and abilities, without any feeling that they encourage participation in the local community. One of the strengths of sport development that we are pursuing is to ensure that clubs get a chance to present themselves effectively to educational institutions and schools, to forge those links that will benefit the clubs. Young people will move on to them once they have left school, but you cannot make progress in sport solely on the basis of a school career. It is important that clubs provide the framework afterwards.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000084"></a>Where we have seen decline in recent years, as clubs have suffered through limited participation and have not sufficiently developed in certain areas because there has not been a close enough link between the sport and the locality, great strides have been made. There is no doubt that the sport has glamour attached to it; it can appeal to young people and do an enormous amount to encourage participation in sport. That has not only societal benefits, it has sporting and associational benefits, as the noble Lord Pendry indicated on health. It may also have the benefit of a better society, in which young people who are active and participate in and value their locality are unlikely to engage in anti-social practices that we all inevitably deplore.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000085"></a>I emphasise that there are hard resources behind this. The Prime Minister last year announced an additional &#163;100 million investment in PE and sport for young people, to ensure that there should be three hours of sport for 16 to 19 year-olds per week.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_GC188"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column GC188</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000086"></a>These are broad issues. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, said that he was not too sure about the funding. We are committed to spending &#163;783 million on sport over the next three years, bringing the total up to &#163;2.2 billion by 2011. These are big sums of money and big commitments. We must withstand the obvious criticism that money spent in one area is unavailable to another. Members of the Committee will recognise the pressures on the DCMS budget, but the Government recognise the value of sport and are prepared to make significant commitments to ensure that we take advantage of the unique opportunity of the London Olympic and Paralympic Games to increase interest in sport.</p>

<a name="80717-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="08071793000087"></a>I assure the noble Lord that today in this debate he has highlighted one strategy that has proved immensely beneficial for Rugby Union. It is an illustration of what can be done through careful thought, planning and imagination. As we have learnt, Sport England is eager to promote these opportunities more widely. I have no doubt that the spin-off from the campaign that the noble Lord has highlighted will go well beyond Rugby Union and help in the pursuit of our overall strategy of encouraging sporting participation among a much greater number of people at a time when the focus on sport will undoubtedly increase in this country.</p>

<p><a name="08071793000088"></a><a name="80717-gc0007.htm_spmin0"></a><b><a name="80717-gc0007.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="08071793000230"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Lord Brougham and Vaux):</b> That completes our business. Before I adjourn the Committee, I, too, congratulate the Lords rowing team and the noble Lord, Lord Addington.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="08071783000052"></a>I am publishing today, and placing in the Libraries of both Houses, Sir Joseph Pilling&#146;s report of his independent strategic review of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), the UK&#146;s aviation regulator. I commissioned this review last September, following a recommendation by the Transport Committee of this House.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_15"></a><a name="08071783000053"></a>I am grateful to Sir Joseph for his thoughtful report and his recognition of the important contribution which the CAA makes to aviation in the UK and internationally. He found that the CAA has been and continues to be highly successful, but he concluded that its framework and organisation could be modernised to meet future challenges in the fast-changing aviation sector.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="08071783000054"></a>Some of Sir Joseph&#146;s recommendations are for the Government, including some which are relevant to the separate review of airport economic regulation which I announced recently, and to work on improving the passenger experience. I intend to consider these recommendations in detail over the summer and to make a fuller statement in the autumn. Interested parties who wish to comment on the report should write to me by the end of September.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="08071783000055"></a>Some of the key recommendations deal with the CAA&#146;s governance and would bring the way that the organisation operates more in line with modern regulatory practice.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_23"></a><a name="08071783000062"></a>First, the Vehicle Operator Services Agency has an IT contract with Siemens covering the computerisation of the MoT Scheme. The Siemens data centre is based in the UK and all operational data are stored in the UK. However, some of the data were processed by Siemens staff in India on a controlled basis for the purpose of correcting and updating software code. The data was not transferred to a physical storage device outside the UK, and the data could not be saved, amended or copied to any device in India.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_50"></a><a name="08071783000092"></a>The Parliamentary Ombudsman has today published the report of her investigation into the prudential regulation of the Equitable Life Assurance Society from 1988 to the end of November 2001.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_51"></a><a name="08071783000093"></a>The ombudsman's investigation was launched in 2004 following the publication of Lord Penrose's independent forensic investigation into the events at Equitable Life (HC 290).

<p><a name="wms_stpa_52"></a><a name="08071783000094"></a>The ombudsman has looked at the application of the now replaced prudential regulatory regime under the Insurance Companies Act 1982. Her investigation has covered issues of considerable factual and technical complexity.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_53"></a><a name="08071783000095"></a>Against this backdrop, it was necessary for the bodies subject to the ombudsman&#146;s investigation to make detailed representations on a number of occasions throughout the investigation. Those representations were put forward at the ombudsman&#146;s request to assist her review of the evidence. They highlighted substantive differences of view between the bodies and the ombudsman which she has responded to in the report published today.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="08071783000114"></a>The Employment and Social Policy Informal Meeting was held on 10 to 11 July 2008 in Chantilly, France. I represented the UK.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="08071783000115"></a>The theme of this Informal was revising the European social agenda. This provided the chance to discuss the Commission&#146;s social package which was launched at the beginning of July 2008.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="08071783000116"></a>The meeting started with a Ministers-only breakfast meeting looking at ideas to make social Europe more concrete and closer to its citizens. A social Europe week and a common declaration from all member states of the EU&#146;s social offer/deal to its citizens were some of the ideas raised.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="08071783000117"></a>There were three plenary sessions, each devoted to specific challenges linked to social Europe: the impacts of climate change and globalization, of changing demographic structures and the fights against poverty and discrimination. There was broad support by all delegations for the Commission&#146;s renewed social agenda and interesting discussions on poverty and active inclusion in particular. For the UK, I pledged broad support for the new proposals while highlighting some of the areas which would need further work. I raised the challenges posed by financial exclusion and the further possible useful work at a European level in this area. Other member states welcomed this positive Statement on anti-discrimination and thought the financial exclusion point was a good example of specific problems needing concrete answers and they were willing to discuss further.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="08071783000118"></a>An innovation by the presidency was the introduction of web chats at the end of each plenary session. The public had been invited to put questions to Ministers via the French presidency website and these were answered by whichever Minister chose to. I answered a question on active ageing pointing out the economic implications, the importance of skills, the need to exchange information and best practice and the challenges of anti discrimination.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_74"></a><a name="08071783000119"></a>I met bilaterally with Ministers from Denmark, Sweden, and Italy, and I hope that the new Italian Minister will visit the UK in the autumn and see a Job Centre Plus office. I was also able to discuss with the French High Commissioner for Active Solidarity against Poverty, Martin Hirsch, UK views on EU social experimentation, including the trans-national pilot projects which we believe can offer significant new insights in the field of social inclusion.</p>

<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS88"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column WS88</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>Council was held in Cannes on 7 and 8 July 2008. My right honourable friend the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith and my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, Bridget Prentice, attended on behalf of the United Kingdom. Since it was an informal council, no formal decisions were taken. The following issues were discussed.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_75"></a><a name="08071783000121"></a>During the first session of the council, member states considered what practical measures could be taken to improve the internal security of the EU and police co-operation. All welcomed the presidency idea that police co-operation should be developed around the principle of convergence, with most defining that to mean practical changes to improve cross-border working by police forces, such as radio interoperation, data sharing, work on major events and in tourist areas. Several called for more European police training.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="08071783000122"></a>The UK agreed with the practical approach recalling that, especially on the third anniversary of the London bombings, one of our top priorities remained counterterrorism. As such we welcomed the work led by the counterterrorism co-ordinator. Counter-radicalisation, projects like the maritime analysis and operation centre (MAOC(N)) on drugs, criminal asset confiscation, cybercrime, and a data sharing and protection strategy were also all important. The presidency concluded by confirming that the lack of a new treaty did not stand in the way of the practical measures Ministers wanted.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="08071783000123"></a>The presidency introduced their paper in the civil protection session by stressing the need for the EU to be prepared, improve capabilities, convergence and interoperability and suggesting that some modules (specialised intervention teams based on member state assets) be put on standby. A number of member states supported the need for co-operation, but responded with caution regarding new structures and any suggestion of EU authority over national resources.  Modules must remain on a voluntary basis to ensure that member states have full control over the use of their own assets.   It was concluded that these should remain voluntary but the EU should look at any capability gaps and support joint training initiatives.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="08071783000124"></a>Over lunch, the final report of the interior future group was presented and there was a general discussion with member states welcoming it.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a><a name="08071783000125"></a>We expect the work of both of the future groups to be officially concluded at the JHA Council at the end of July.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a><a name="08071783000126"></a>The presidency presented the migration pact and said that they hoped to adopt it at the October council. All member states supported the pact but raised points of detail, with some arguing that asylum procedures should not be changed, others wanting a single consolidated instrument on legal migration procedures, concerns regarding the creation of a common border guard; and some seeking a stronger reference to burden sharing of people.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_81"></a><a name="08071783000127"></a>The UK welcomed the pact and noted that the EU should continue to focus on practical measures that deliver results including on data sharing, border control, and passenger name records (PNR). The EU&#146;s border agency, Frontex, (among others) should be used to strengthen the external border but the responsibility  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS89"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column WS89</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>should remain with the member states. On asylum, the UK stressed that the EU should focus on implementing existing asylum legislation. The EU must provide a haven, but also needed to work together to combat abuse. The global approach to migration needed to be further implemented although we needed to be clearer on the links between development and migration.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_82"></a><a name="08071783000128"></a>The first justice session opened with a debate introduced by the presidency about whether judges required further training in EU law and judicial co-operation. Most member states welcomed the discussion but concerns were raised about judicial independence and the way the training should be delivered. Most thought that any such training should be open to judges, prosecutors and court officials and that the key subjects should be EU law, other member states&#146; law and language training.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_83"></a><a name="08071783000129"></a>The second justice session focused on the protection of children and vulnerable adults. For the discussion on protecting children, the presidency urged member states to establish national missing child alert systems which should be interoperable. The UK supported both the principle and detail of the presidency&#146;s ideas and explained that the UK was rolling out an alert system. Information sharing on convicted sex offenders, use of CCTV and automatic number plate recognition were all also useful. The presidency concluded that the child alert system would be taken forward.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_84"></a><a name="08071783000130"></a>There was a discussion about how the European Union should deal with the question of the protection of vulnerable adults in order to meet the challenges of an ageing population and the high level of mobility of European citizens. The presidency encouraged member states to ratify the Hague Convention on the international protection of vulnerable adults and there was a discussion about how member states could improve the implementation of the convention. The UK signed and ratified the convention within Scotland in 2003. Work is under way to extend the convention to cover England and Wales.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_85"></a><a name="08071783000131"></a>There was a short discussion of the report of the justice future group over lunch. Those Ministers who spoke broadly welcomed the report.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_87"></a><a name="08071783000135"></a>The Government announced in November 2006 that, as part of their work to improve accountability for EU funds across the EU, HM Treasury would  


<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS90"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column WS90</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>prepare an annual consolidated statement, audited by the NAO, on the use of such funds in the United Kingdom. We are today laying before Parliament the first of these Statements, along with the Comptroller and Auditor General's (C&amp;AG) audit opinion and report.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_88"></a><a name="08071783000136"></a>The purpose of this arrangement is to strengthen the audit and Parliamentary scrutiny of the UK's use of EU funds and help detect any weaknesses in the UK's management of these funds so that these can be more effectively and rapidly tackled. The Statement and C&amp;AG's first report sets an excellent basis for doing this.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_89"></a><a name="08071783000137"></a>The C&amp;AG's positive opinion on regularity clearly shows that the management of EU funds by UK authorities during the period covered by the Statement has been sound and that there has be no evidence of material irregularity in the payments made to beneficiaries. The Government welcome this finding, as providing assurance on the management of EU funds in the UK was one of the Statement's key objectives.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_90"></a><a name="08071783000138"></a>The C&amp;AG's limitation of scope does make it clear that more needs to be done to improve the consistency of the recording and the accounting of EU funding by UK central government bodies. The Government are working to ensure these issues are addressed. In particular, improved guidance is being developed so that all future EU transactions and balances are recorded consistently and separately in the accounts of all the relevant entities. The actions taken this year will be the first in a rolling programme of improvement in this area.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a><a name="08071783000139"></a>This Statement and the improvements that result from it will be important in building momentum for similar action to be taken by our EU partners. Such action is critical, as a positive statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors on the reliability of the EU's accounts will only ever be obtained if measures to improve the management of agricultural and structural funds are taken by member states as well as the Commission.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a><a name="08071783000140"></a>In this context, the Government warmly welcome the statements that have been published by the Dutch Finance Ministry and the Danish national audit office, as well the Swedish initiative to publish a statement in the spring of next year. In time, the UK hopes to welcome similar reports on the use of EU funds from other member states.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a><a name="08071783000141"></a>The Government hope this Statement and the C&amp;AG's audit opinion will be helpful to the European Court of Auditors and the Commission when they are performing their own audits and controls. I will be sending copies of this Statement to both institutions, as well as to my counterparts in other member states.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a><a name="08071783000142"></a>It is crucial that EU taxpayers are given the necessary assurance that EU money is being spent correctly. The UK's initiative to publish this Consolidated Statement on its use of EU Funds will make a positive contribution to ensuring this is the case. I will continue to work to encourage my counterparts in other member states to show a similar degree of commitment to providing such an assurance.</p>

The changes will come into effect on 1 August 2008. Copies of the report summarising the responses to the public consultation will be deposited in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="08071783000144"></a>The register was set up in December 2005 in response to increased threat of outbreaks of avian influenza. Poultry keepers with more than 50 birds are legally required to provide essential information about their premises to populate the register. To date, the register has been used for avian influenza risk assessment, prevention and control.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a><a name="08071783000145"></a>Decisions on changes of use of the register took into account the views of individuals and organisations who responded to the consultation as well as the wider public and taxpayer interest, given that the register is a valuable resource. The intention has been to achieve a balance between the benefits of appropriate data sharing, including public protection and improving public services, and the proper respect for personal data in line with our data protection obligations.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a><a name="08071783000146"></a>Use of personal data on the register will be extended in the following areas:</p>
 management of other poultry diseases (in addition to avian influenza), including other notifiable diseases and zoonoses;planning, response and recovery by the emergency services and other responders in civil emergencies affecting poultry premises, including avian disease outbreaks;planning of visits related to legislation on veterinary medicines and on animal welfare;providing information as necessary to the EC to substantiate UK claims for compensation from the EU in the event of a disease outbreak;informing the work of Defra and Welsh Assembly Government statisticians and economists in the development of evidence-based policy; informing the annual agricultural census and hence enabling the poultry questions to be removed from the census; facilitating (non-commercial) ad-hoc surveys as part of Defra and Welsh Assembly Government&#146;s regional and national activities towards achieving their strategic objectives, including for example England&#146;s Sustainable Food and Farming Strategy and GB&#146;s Animal Health and Welfare Strategy. This may also include the provision of advice and information to individual poultry keepers; andinforming the development of future customer contact management and registration as part of Animal Health&#146;s Business Reform Programme.
<a name="80717-wms0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a><a name="08071783000147"></a>It is important to note that the register will not be available freely to new users in connection with these purposes. Defra (Animal Health) will issue extracts of the register as necessary to the new users in response to receiving a specific request for personal data but

These arrangements shall be in line with the advice in the Government&#146;s recently published report on data handling procedures<sup>1</sup> which is available in the Libraries of both Houses, and with policies and advice in response to the recommendations from the recently completed independent review on data sharing by Richard Thomas and Dr Mark Walport<sup>2</sup>. For example, measures being put in place across government departments and agencies include:</p>
 mandatory training for all staff involved in handling personal data;further enhancing the transparency of arrangements, through annual reporting to Parliament on progress and the use of information charters which provide clarity to the public about the use and handling of personal data.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_107"></a><a name="08071783000160"></a>I am today publishing <I>Transforming Places; changing lives: a framework for regeneration. </I>This document sets out an ambitious package of proposals&#151;for consultation&#151;that aim to shape the way that regeneration is carried out in future in England. Publishing the framework fulfils a commitment from the 2007 sub-national review of economic development and regeneration.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_108"></a><a name="08071783000161"></a>We have made great strides in regeneration in the past 10 years, narrowing the gap between the most deprived neighbourhoods and the rest. The new approach builds on what we know works.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_109"></a><a name="08071783000162"></a>The framework contains a renewed focus on ensuring that regeneration tackles the underlying economic challenges to increase social mobility and support people to reach their potential, regardless of where they live. Specifically, the measures proposed aim to:</p>
ensure that regeneration investment is co-ordinated and prioritised in the right places, with public, private, and third sector organisations working together in the same places towards a shared vision;devolve power&#151;decisions about where to invest should be made as locally as possible, so this framework proposes an approach to prioritisation that starts with communities and their councils, and aims to align investment behind local and regional regeneration priorities&#151;making programmes fit places, not places fit programmes; and,

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_110"></a><a name="08071783000163"></a>The framework proposes that all regeneration should be aligned behind three priority outcomes:</p>
improving economic performance in the areas that have not yet made the same progress as other areas;improving rates of work and enterprise in these areas; andcreating sustainable places where people want to live and can work, and businesses want to invest.

<p><a name="wms_stpa_118"></a><a name="08071783000174"></a>The Local Transport Bill, currently before Parliament, contains measures to improve public transport and tackle road congestion.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_123"></a><a name="08071783000180"></a>Following the March 2005 Treasury Committee report on ATM (automatic teller machine) charging, the Treasury invited the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, the right honourable John McFall, to chair a working group on ATMs to take forward work on key issues. The working group, which included banks, independent ATM operators and consumer groups, published its report on 13 December 2006.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_124"></a><a name="08071783000181"></a>The working group announced an agreement to provide around 600 new free cash machines across 1,707 target low-income areas that it identified as lacking convenient access to these machines. To achieve this, a market-based financial incentive&#151;known as a financial inclusion premium&#151;was introduced, to encourage ATM operators to place or retain free ATMs in deprived areas with a low expected volume of transactions. The working group also agreed to implement improved transparency rules for charging cash machines. Since publication of the working group report, LINK has assessed around 10 per cent of the identified low-income areas as unsuitable for an ATM location as there is no centre of population.</p>




<notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2008" textMonth="July"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS97"></a><b>17 July 2008 : Column WS97</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>
<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_125"></a><a name="08071783000182"></a>The Government are pleased to report that the industry has, over the 18 months following publication of the working group's report, made excellent progress towards its goals of placing around 600 non-charging machines in low-income areas across the UK, with around 2 million individuals on low incomes standing to benefit.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_126"></a><a name="08071783000183"></a>As of 30 June 2008, sites for 562 of the 600 new ATMs required have been identified. Of these, 419 new free machines are already in use and issuing cash to the public. 74 per cent of these ATMs that are based in the target deprived areas receive the financial inclusion premium. Encouragingly, nine of these new cash machines have proved so popular that their level of withdrawals means that they have now graduated from the financial inclusion premium scheme.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_127"></a><a name="08071783000184"></a>Banks, building societies and independent ATM operators have all contributed new free-to-use cash machines; independent ATM operators have provided or are in the process of supplying around 35 per cent of the confirmed new non-charging ATMs. The UK ATM network, LINK, is continuing to work with its member banks and ATM operators to identify suitable sites in the remaining target areas, and is engaging closely in this exercise with Members of Parliament, local authorities, consumer councils and retailers.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_128"></a><a name="08071783000185"></a>The benefits in terms of financial inclusion are clear. Data from LINK suggest that the new ATMs currently in operation or under contract will enable almost 1.3 million residents in the target low-income areas to access cash more conveniently and manage their money more effectively.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_129"></a><a name="08071783000186"></a>In terms of improved transparency, operators of cash machines that charge users for withdrawals and that can upload screens remotely have met the end-June 2007 deadline to improve the on-screen standards of at-a-glance signage. This means that it is clear to a consumer when a charge is applied when withdrawing cash. Good progress was also made by operators in enhancing external signage by end-December 2007.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_130"></a><a name="08071783000187"></a>The Government are encouraged by the substantial progress achieved, and would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those involved in extending free access to cash to those who need it the most.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0003.htm_para27"></a>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_151"></a><a name="08071783000214"></a>My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, will be publishing the final revision of the regional spatial strategy for the north-west of England, in late August or early September. On publication it will supersede the current RSS. Also to be published are the reports of a consolidated sustainability appraisal, a habitats regulations assessment and sustainability statement.</p>

<a name="80717-wms0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_152"></a><a name="08071783000215"></a>The published regional spatial strategy will form part of the statutory development plan for every local authority in the north-west, and set the framework for the production of local development frameworks and local transport plans. It will provide the spatial plan for the development of the region, and the policy framework for employment, housing, transport and the environment.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_153"></a><a name="08071783000216"></a>The current strategy, initially published as regional planning guidance, became the regional spatial strategy in September 2004 with the enactment of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act. A draft revision of the regional spatial strategy was submitted to the Government in January 2006 by the North West Regional Assembly. It was subsequently tested in an examination in public between November 2006 and February 2007, and the report of the independent panel which conducted this examination was published in May 2007. The Secretary of State considered the recommendations of this independent panel, and took into account the representations made on the draft revision, and changes in government policy since the draft revision was submitted, before publishing proposed changes for further public consultation between March and May 2008.</p>

This allocation is calculated according to a simple formula based on the size of the local over-60 population. Funding will be distributed through a specific grant, details of which will be set out in the letter to local authorities.</p>

For these authorities, details of their prospective allocation from pot 2 will be provided no later than 30 September 2008. They will then be invited to confirm, by no later than 15 October 2008, whether they wish to take up this offer. Funding will again be distributed through a specific grant.</p>

<p><a name="wa_qnpa_0"></a>What proportion of the stalks, leaves and roots of food crops grown commercially in the United Kingdom are recycled for (a) composting; (b) biogas; (c) biomass; and (d) use in coal-fired power stations; and where the remainder goes. [HL4744]</p>

Most of the biogas plants in the UK are fuelled by animal manures and waste from the food processing chain, rather than crop residues.</p>

<a name="80717w0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_0"></a><a name="08071782000028"></a>Around 9 per cent of the sugar beet crop (around 650,000 tonnes a year) is used in the production of transport biofuels. Around 2 per cent of cereal straw (around 200,000 tonnes) is used to generate electricity in dedicated biomass power stations. Around 200,000 tonnes of agricultural residues (including cereal straw), wastes and energy crops, are used to generate heat. Around 2.3 million tonnes of a wide range of woody biomass and biomass wastes (including forestry residues, paper industry waste and imported plant wastes), are co-fired with coal.</p>

<a name="80717w0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1"></a><a name="08071782000029"></a>The vast majority of the remaining residues from crop and horticultural production are either returned to the soil to help build soil organic matter content and provide nutrients for following crops, or are used as animal feed or bedding, which is then recycled to land.</p>

This position was set out in the 2003 <I>Future of Air Transport</I> White Paper.</p>

<a name="80717w0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_2"></a><a name="08071782000034"></a>In February this year, the Government completed the consultation &#147;Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport&#148; which provided evidence on meeting the conditions for a third runway with associated passenger terminal facilities.

<a name="80717w0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_3"></a><a name="08071782000037"></a>There have been restrictions on night flights at Heathrow since 1962. The underlying principle of these restrictions is to preserve the balance between the need to protect local communities from excessive aircraft noise at night and the operation of services where they provide economic benefits. These restrictions are reviewed periodically.</p>

<a name="80717w0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_4"></a><a name="08071782000038"></a>The current regime which applies from October 2006 until October 2012 comprises restrictions on the types of aircraft which may be operated throughout the &#147;night period&#148; (11 pm to 7 am).</p>

<a name="80717w0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="08071782000039"></a>In addition, further restrictions apply between 11.30 pm and 6 am (the night quota period). In the latter period, first, the noisiest types of aircraft cannot be scheduled to operate. Secondly, the Department for Transport sets two limits&#151;on the number of aircraft movements and on the amount of quota points that may be used. Neither limit may be exceeded. The quota points system allocates a quota count (QC) number to each different type of aircraft for landing and taking-off according to the amount of noise generated. Every time the aircraft operates in the night quota period its number of QC points is deducted from the total for the season. There are two seasons&#151;summer and Winter.</p>

<a name="80717w0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_6"></a><a name="08071782000040"></a>The regime provides for a stepped reduction in noise quota over the life of the current regime (ie until 2012), encouraging operators to use the quietest aircraft available to them.</p>

<a name="80717w0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_7"></a><a name="08071782000041"></a>There is provision for certain flights to be disregarded from the requirement to be counted against the movements and quota limits in exceptional circumstances. These include cases where there are:</p>
delays to aircraft which are likely to lead to serious congestion at the airport or serious hardship or suffering to passengers,delays to aircraft resulting from widespread and prolonged disruption of air traffic;

There are of course general obligations under European law to control the spread of TB and infraction proceedings can arise whenever the Commission considers there has been a failure correctly to implement EU law. The decision to set a policy of not issuing licences to farmers to cull badgers to prevent bovine TB has not resulted in any such failure.</p>

However case-control studies carried out as part of the randomised badger culling trial (RBCT) did investigate associations between a number of feed types and risk of a herd TB breakdown. Studies TB99 and CCS2005 found an association between feeding silage and the use of grass feeding types for grazing/forage and an increase in risk of TB breakdown, respectively. The findings of these studies are in the final report of the Independent Scientific Group on cattle TB. In addition, TB99 also identified not using feeding supplements as a risk factor for confirmed cases of TB.</p>

It will not be possible to confirm which substances are likely to be caught by the regulation, and which are likely to remain available for continued use to control pests and weeds, until the negotiations are concluded and its provisions have been finalised.</p>
