I am not surprised, especially given that the noble Lord has an interest in this matter, that the Government were not keen to make these accounts available to the public as early as they might have done; they indicate that the liabilities of the National Health Service pension scheme have increased over the past year by some 26 per cent to &#163;165.4 billion and that the net deficit to be funded by the taxpayer in the current year has increased by no less than 45 per cent to some &#163;9.3 billion. Is the Minister aware that public sector resource accounts are required by law to be published by 31 January and that these accounts, bearing the date 26 February, are therefore nearly four weeks beyond the statutory publication date and 11 months out of date?

The statutory deadline for laying the scheme accounts is 31 January, and the accounts were laid before Parliament on 30 January. I said in my Answer that the accounts that I referred to were made available on the website and in printed form in February. We met the deadline. It is worth making the point that the liability is equal to the amount of money that would be needed on 31 March 2006 to set up a reserve to meet, on the assumptions used, all the benefit payments up to the death of the last surviving beneficiary. That is why, at first reading, the figure seems so large. But I should have thought that all noble Lords would want NHS staff to receive a decent pension.</p>

They have had increases of between 30 per cent and 60 per cent in the past three years. An average GP is now earning more than &#163;100,000 a year. That means that, retiring today, they are on a pension pot which would cost &#163;1.25 million to buy in the private sector. Is not the real problem that, for many years to come, that will gobble up all the increase in national health spending?</p>

The noble Lord will know that in fact the Government have been criticised by the general practice committee of the BMA for recent decisions taken over the dynamisation of the value of the GP pension fund. Yes, there have been issues about the cost of the contracts, but they are about incentivising doctors&#151;consultants and GPs&#151;to enhance the services that they give patients. Encouraging signs are emerging on that basis.</p>

Surely it is a fraud on pensioners to pretend that that is sustainable; it is not.</p>

Some provisions are for new employees not to receive pension from the age of 60 but to continue to the age of 65. That is not out of line with what some private sector schemes have done.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0"></a><a name="07022757000356"></a>&#147;Anybody with a thorough understanding of pensions knows that Mr Brown&#146;s &#145;tax raid&#146; was not the root cause of the industry&#146;s demise.

Is not the situation now entirely different? We face a serious threat of energy insecurity, prices are high, fuel poverty is a serious social issue and the environment is very high on the agenda. In those circumstances, should not the Government seriously consider, along with other apparent changes in departmental responsibilities, the re-creation of a Department of Energy at Cabinet level to bring a focus to those crucial issues, as cogently argued by the noble Lords, Lord Whitty, Lord Patten, Lord Palmer, and others?</p>

<p><a name="st_15"></a>

The Government recognise that in their policies on energy supply and its guarantee, and environmental issues. The noble Lord will not mind if I say on this occasion that not all issues are reducible to the machinery of government, but he will recognise that collaboration between government departments is important in this area, and a Cabinet committee chaired by the Prime Minister deals with energy and the environment.</p>

It is not the reshaping of portfolios that is required but the right decisions. There are some very tricky decisions to be made, and it is about time that the Government got on and made some of them.</p>

These decisions are a little more than tricky; they are very difficult indeed. The future and well-being of our people and the future of the wider environment in terms of world climate change depend upon our following the right strategy. That is why the Government are making the environmental dimension such a high priority. The climate change Bill will be brought before this House in the very near future. However, I agree with the noble Lord wholeheartedly that the issue revolves around accurate and correct decision-taking by government.</p>

Given that, does the Minister agree that the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Ezra, has great merit?</p>

In our recent debate on the electricity industry, I referred to the appointment in the DTI of Mr Mark Higson as head of its nuclear consultation and liabilities team. I believe that his role will be to remove the barriers to new nuclear build. Does the noble Lord recognise that this includes responsibility for radioactive waste management policy? With the Select Committee studying this issue, we recently saw a Defra Minister. Who is now actually responsible for radioactive waste policy? Is it Defra or is it Mr Higson in the DTI?</p>

Such bread is not required to display any kind of nutritional information labelling. What do the Government intend to do about labelling in that respect, particularly with regard to salt, but also in respect of the other issues that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, mentioned, such as fat?</p>

Much of the legislation around the labelling of food is controlled by European legislation, and we are in constant discussion with Europe. In the mean time, though, one must pay tribute to the work of the FSA in generally encouraging companies to introduce labelling. There are signs of considerable success in this area. We should simply continue the efforts to encourage more labelling and to make it more transparent and easily understandable.</p>

Let us be clear: salt has many attributes. The approach of the FSA with the industry is gradually to reduce the level of salt so that the daily intake comes down but essentially consumers do not know the difference. None the less, salt is still being used to give flavour&#151;bread without salt is not a great thing to eat&#151;as a preservative and in other good ways.</p>

The team met with the Chadian Foreign Minister, Ahmat Allami, and raised our concerns over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the east, due to cross-border offensives from Darfur and rising levels of inter-communal violence. We will continue to work with the UN and other partners to secure the best option for a deployment to Chad.</p>

Will he confirm that it is now estimated that there are 380,000 refugees in the refugee camps on the border between Chad and Darfur? They are drawn from the Central African Republic as well as from Chad and Darfur. Ground-to-air missiles have been provided by the Sudanese Government to Chadian rebels, and there is the continued arming of the Janjaweed militia. How does he respond to a statement last week by the United Nations commissioner for refugees in Chad, who said that it is now,</p>
<ul><a name="07022757000408"></a>&#147;witnessing a level of violence completely unknown to Chad before&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07022757000348"></a>that Janjaweed attacks are &#147;wreaking havoc on humanitarian operations&#148;, that there is &#147;rampant insecurity&#148; and that this is another Rwanda in the making?</p>

The reality on the ground is that there are instances of inter-communal conflict among the people of Chad as well. The volume of arms in the area is growing exponentially, and it is precisely for that reason that the UN secretary-general is reporting to the Security Council today on options for a peacekeeping force to deal with what is becoming an extremely acute crisis.</p>

If it does go ahead, will the UK seek to ensure that, unlike in Darfur, its strength and terms of engagement are adequate to protect civilians at risk, including both internally displaced persons and refugees?</p>

The deployment in Darfur has been undertaken by the African Union and had a relatively restricted mandate&#151;even so, that mandate was arguably not fully used. In Chad, there would be a UN deployment. There have been mixed signals from the Governments of the region about whether they would welcome any kinds of deployment, but I believe that the secretary-general is quite right in saying that for this crisis to be resolved the deployment must be underpinned by adequate funding in order to ensure that there are enough people with enough logistical support and enough of the materials to secure peace over a long period.</p>

I am sure that the Minister is pleased that he was able to report that the UN is considering sending a force, but can he give a more specific reassurance to those desperate people in Chad that they will be receiving the adequate protection to which they are entitled, and which they so desperately need?

Last Thursday, I was at the United Nations arguing about the urgency of the requirements of Darfur and Chad, and now also of the Central African Republic.

So it is proposed that a big UN force will go into Chad, with some reluctance from the Chadians, who think that it might drag them into the war as well.

When we discussed the Bill in Grand Committee, we on these Benches expressed our concern that it had been published a week before the Leitch review on skills. We also expressed concerns that Clause 19 had been put into the Bill without any consultation with the universities or even with most of the FE colleges. The fact that the Government have laid so many amendments at this stage could be an indication that they are rushing the Bill into law. Or it could be an indication that they are listening&#151;perhaps I should give the Minister the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<a name="70227-0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_14"></a><a name="07022757000097"></a>We have tabled Amendment No. 1 because we know that the Lyons review of local government is about to be published, certainly before the Budget on 21 March. We are sure from statements that have been made that it will emphasise that strategic regional bodies will need to work closely with local authorities and their partners. It seems strange to us that the local government Bill, too, has been published before the Lyons report. However, in line with what has been said by Lyons, the LGA, the CBI and others, we seek to insert into this Bill a firm duty for the Learning and Skills Council to consult and work with local area partnerships.</p>

<a name="70227-0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_15"></a><a name="07022757000098"></a>The LGA and the CBI recently met to discuss the Lyons report. In their response, <I>Making &#145;Place Shaping&#146; a Reality</I>, they made their commitment to working together crystal clear. They said:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7"></a><a name="07022757000363"></a>&#147;The CBI and LGA agreed that local government should have a more significant role in enabling local economic development and have agreed to a series of joint actions including improving the delivery of public services that underpin economic development and improving public and private sector engagement&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70227-0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_16"></a><a name="07022757000099"></a>When we discussed the amendment in Committee, the Minister concentrated his reply on the local partnership teams of the LSC, which do not appear in the Bill. He emphasised that these teams, whose areas of operation would be coterminous with local authorities, would work flexibly with the local authorities and other partners to deliver services on the ground and ensure that decision-making and provision planning take account of local needs and conditions.</p>

<a name="70227-0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_17"></a><a name="07022757000100"></a>While we agree wholeheartedly with the need for these teams, we believe that there is a need also for the LSC to be involved with strategic decision-making at sub-regional level. As my noble friend Lady Sharp of Guildford pointed out in Committee, there is evidence to show that travel-to-work areas and areas served by certain industries and centres of further education are formed by sub-regional hubs or clusters of towns and local authorities that have an identity of their own. These groups of authorities have common interests and often join together to undertake activities and make decisions. It is essential that the LSC works at this level, as well as at the strategic, regional and the very local levels. We therefore envisage these partnerships to be of many different sizes as appropriate to the groupings that exist in the sub-region. We would be happier if there was reference to them in the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

We sympathise with the concern of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that regional LSCs will be too large and out of touch to handle issues that tend to be local and not regional, but we still feel that colleges should expand their role in liaising with local authorities and other local bodies. We certainly would not like to see the LSC operating at three different levels: national, regional and local.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"></a><a name="07022757000102"></a>We hope that the reduction in the number of learning and skills councils will bring about a significant reduction in the bureaucracy and expense that they currently generate. I hope that the Minister&#146;s optimism about the ability of the nine councils to respond flexibly and appropriately to local matters that might be brought to their attention will be justified, but I feel that any difficulties that might emerge from this should be resolved by reducing the scope of the LSCs&#146; powers rather than by increasing the size of their presence.</p>

The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, was kind enough to say that the Government might be listening on this Bill; I appreciate the compliment. As she knows, we have spent six years listening, to her in particular, and the reason why we have come forward with these proposals goes back to her initial suggestion that we should have a regional structure for the Learning and Skills Council and not the system of 47 local learning and skills councils that we initially set up. She therefore knows that we listen intently and sometimes reach the right position eventually.</p>

<a name="70227-0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_19"></a><a name="07022757000104"></a>Having arrived at the structure of the nine regional learning and skills councils, plus, as the noble Baroness said, the 150 local partnership teams, which we expect broadly to mirror the areas of local authorities, we do not think that it would be a good idea to set in place another structure, least of all a statutory structure, although we completely recognise the importance of engaging with the sub-regional groupings and consulting at that level, as she rightly said.</p>

<a name="70227-0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_20"></a><a name="07022757000105"></a>We believe, though, that the amendment as it is framed would place an additional bureaucratic burden on the Learning and Skills Council and on local authorities. The partner authorities that, under the amendment, the Learning and Skills Council would need to consult when establishing the proposed sub-regional committees are defined in the amendment by Clause 79 of the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill; they are  concerned with the aspect of that Bill that deals with local area agreements. The list of bodies for consultation under that clause is extensive. It includes bodies such as the English Sports Council, the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission, the fire and rescue authorities&#151;and I could go on.</p>

<a name="70227-0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_21"></a><a name="07022757000106"></a>We believe that consultation by the Learning and Skills Council with bodies such as these would be onerous and unnecessary. Moreover, as the amendment proposes that the committees would be statutory, further subsequent changes would need to go through the whole process of statutory consultation again with the same bodies. While we share the objective of the noble Baroness to ensure that there are effective means of sub-regional consultation and engagement by the Learning and Skills Council&#151;the LSC is, indeed, committed to that&#151;we do not believe that putting this arrangement in the Bill would be a productive step forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_24"></a><a name="07022757000111"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I will speak also to government Amendments Nos. 3 and 4. Amendment No. 2 is a technical amendment that clarifies the intention behind the regulation-making power provided in Clause 2. Clause 2 inserts Section 18A into the Learning and Skills Act 2000, which provides for the establishment of regional councils. Section 18A(2) gives the Secretary of State the power to make provision about regional councils in regulations and Section 18A(3) specifies what these regulations may, in particular, make provision about. An illustrative draft of the regulations was made available to the House ahead of Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="70227-0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_25"></a><a name="07022757000112"></a>Provision about regional councils will be made in regulations, rather than in primary legislation, in order to give the LSC greater flexibility over time, by enabling the LSC to respond to, and more rapidly accommodate, possible future machinery of government changes. The first draft of any such regulations will, however, be subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses, as in the arrangements that I set out in Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="70227-0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_26"></a><a name="07022757000113"></a>This amendment clarifies that regulations may provide for delegation of its functions by a regional council. While it has always been the intention that regional councils should be able to delegate their functions, this amendment makes it absolutely clear that regulations allowing a regional council to do so can be made. Such regulations may provide for the delegation of functions by a regional council to its chairman, from the chairman to a member of the regional council and, with the consent of the national council, delegation of functions by a regional council to its staff. The amendment also clarifies that regulations may provide for the appointment of a regional council chairman from among the members of the regional council.</p>

<a name="70227-0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_27"></a><a name="07022757000114"></a>There will be checks on the power for a regional council to delegate functions to its staff. This amendment allows regulations to provide for a regional council to delegate functions to a member of staff, but only where the national council consents. The national council may specify that this consent relates to particular functions of the regional council or description of functions. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_30"></a><a name="07022757000119"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, when we debated this amendment in Grand Committee, it had an additional paragraph at the end about promoting the well-being of members of the local community, which, to say the least, did not command the support of the Committee. We removed it, therefore, before tabling the amendment again so as not to detract from the virtues of the rest of it.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_31"></a><a name="07022757000120"></a>In moving the amendment, my noble friend Lady Sharp commented that the Bill, which radically changes the responsibilities of the Learning and Skills Council, lacked a declaratory statement about the objectives of the council. In replying the Minister claimed that the Act that set up the LSC, the Learning and Skills Act 2000, did not lack declaratory ambition and that, anyway, the recent grant letter to the LSC from the Minister in another place laid out clearly what was expected of it. My noble friend admitted that there was little between us in what we would like to see from the LSC but expressed the opinion that such things needed to be in the Bill, not in a private letter from a Minister.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_32"></a><a name="07022757000121"></a>It is in this spirit that we have retabled the amendment. We believe that a mission statement similar to that which was applied to schools by the Education and Inspections Act 2006 should be imposed on the LSC for post-compulsory learning. We believe that the learning funded and organised by the LSC is of such fundamental importance to the success of our economy that legislation needs to make quite clear the standards and partnerships which should apply.

I thank the Minister for his letter of 11 February. I was particularly pleased to see Stockton-on-Tees in the working draft of 29 January attached to his letter. Years ago I attended Stockton-on-Tees technical college. I went to what we then called night school. I was working in a steel foundry. Having previously studied history and economics, it seemed sensible to learn engineering drawing, structural steel design and weight calculations for complex cast components. It was a wholly positive experience. The tech provided me with the wherewithal to do what I was employed to do with much greater understanding and efficiency.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_33"></a><a name="07022757000127"></a>The Minister&#146;s letter of 11 February deals with two of the matters that we discussed in Committee: first, the staff reduction programme, begun towards the end of 2005, and, secondly, the LSC&#146;s intended management and geographic structure. The two are interlinked. In 2005, the LSC used a baseline figure of 4,700 employees. The number actually employed in 2004-05 and 2005-06 averaged close to 4,400. When, later this year, there are 3,630 staff, there will, I believe, have been a net reduction of about 800. Since the Minister told the House in December last that 1,100 had already gone, either he or I must be wrong.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_34"></a><a name="07022757000128"></a>The letter also provides a baseline figure for administration costs in 2001-02 of &#163;249.1 million, which, I believe, was the expenditure from September 2000 to March 2002&#151;a period of 19 months not a year. Things can get difficult when the information provided is unreliable.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_35"></a><a name="07022757000129"></a>The structure of the LSC will remain decentralised, which is most welcome. The change from the present structure is confined to removing the statutory status of the 47 and conferring that status on the nine existing regional bodies. Although the 47 will disappear we are to have the council, nine regional councils, 42 area directors and 150 team partnerships. Whatever else is changing within the LSC, the management structure will not.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_36"></a><a name="07022757000130"></a>One question is left unanswered: what will happen to the 750 non-executives? How many will remain? My amendment would do two things. First, it would put the LSC structure into the Bill. I believe that that is right because, however policy changes, there will still be some 2,600 institutions of education involved therefore a decentralised structure is vital if local needs are to be met. I have Stockton-on-Tees in mind. Accepting the need for appropriate flexibility, the amendment provides for changes in the number and location of area directors and puts no upper or lower limit on the number of team partnerships. Indeed, I have followed the Minister&#146;s letter as closely as I could. Secondly, the amendment would strengthen the position of local authorities in relation to the LSC. That point was made in Committee and is strongly supported by local authorities and the Mayor of London. They all believe that they should appear early in the Bill because of the importance of further education and training to the people who elect them. I strongly agree.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_37"></a><a name="07022757000131"></a>We are in familiar territory. We are probably close to agreement on the substance, as I believe the Minister was in his reply to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. There remains, however, the question of whether provision should be made on the face of the Bill. The Executive usually say, &#147;It is not necessary. We will see that it happens anyway&#148;, but Ministers cannot bind their successors, so an Opposition will say that matters would be better safeguarded by statute than by undertakings. I believe that in this case the face of the Bill is the right answer. Not being a parliamentary draftsman, I am sure that the detailed wording of the amendment will need to be changed. However, if the Minister agreed to its thrust it would be a simple matter to get it right in a government amendment at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_38"></a><a name="07022757000132"></a>I look forward to the Minister&#146;s positive response. I beg to move.</p>

Our concern is that such an amendment would lead to even more responsibility being taken away from the colleges and invested instead in an unelected body. We would far rather the LSC&#146;s duties were restricted to light-touch and arm&#146;s-length oversight rather than the heavily involved and wide-ranging role that the amendment suggests.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_39"></a><a name="07022757000134"></a>On the amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Eccles, as I said in response to Amendment No. 5, the efficiency-saving that the change from local to regional councils will, one hopes, bring about is our primary reason for supporting the move. However, my noble friend raises some interesting questions, and I hope that the Minister can answer them satisfactorily. As I said in response to the first amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, the worst-case scenario that we can envisage would be a LSC that spans national, regional and local levels. That would involve overwhelming bureaucracy and wasteful government at its worst; as such, we cannot fully support the amendments.</p>

It is important to understand that the Bill before us amends the Learning and Skills Act 2000, which sets out the purposes of the Learning and Skills Council very clearly. Section 3 of that Act says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13"></a><a name="07022757000369"></a>&#147;The Council must secure the provision of reasonable facilities for&#151;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="07022757000136"></a>Section 4 of the 2000 Act says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18"></a><a name="07022757000374"></a>&#147;The Council must&#151;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_19"></a><a name="07022757000375"></a>(a) encourage individuals to undergo post-16 education and training;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20"></a><a name="07022757000376"></a>(b) encourage employers to participate in the provision of post-16 education and training;</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21"></a><a name="07022757000377"></a>(c) encourage employers to contribute to the costs of post-16 education and training&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022757000137"></a>Taken together, those two provisions set out a very broad sweep of ambitions and duties in respect of the Learning and Skills Council.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_40"></a><a name="07022757000138"></a>What the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, wishes to do&#151;because she always encourages us to aim higher in our ambitions for education and training&#151;is to define the duties of the Learning and Skills Council more widely still. Though I welcome the fact that she no longer wishes them to promote general well-being, as she did in her amendments in Grand Committee, we are still concerned that her current amendment would significantly extend the duties of the LSC, beyond the point where it is reasonable to do so. In this I follow the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. Proposed paragraph (iii) of her amendment would require the council to,</p>
<ul><a name="07022757000378"></a>&#147;promote the fulfilment of the educational potential by every person participating in courses funded by the Council&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70227-0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_41"></a><a name="07022757000139"></a>I understand the aspiration set out by the noble Baroness, but it does not need saying that an FE college is not a school. I say this because, given the terms of the amendment, it would be very difficult to see how either the Learning and Skills Council specifically or indeed the further education system as a whole could effectively discharge the duty in paragraph (iii), recognising that most FE students follow specific courses, a good proportion of them part-time. It is hard to see how, in practice&#151;given that a student&#146;s relationship with a college is fundamentally different from a pupil&#146;s relationship with a school&#151;the Learning and Skills Council could realistically meet the proposed duty.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_42"></a><a name="07022757000140"></a>I can, however, give an encouraging response to other elements of the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment. She highlights the importance of quality in her amendment. We entirely agree with her. That is why, for example, the Quality Improvement Agency in Further Education is dedicated to working with providers, including those performing poorly, to raise their standards and increase their capacity. We are also, as is the noble Baroness in her amendments, committed to ensuring fair access to learning. That is why we have introduced educational maintenance allowances at a cost of many hundreds of millions of pounds. These are specifically geared towards promoting fair access to learning, and doing so with considerable success. I very much agree with the noble Baroness about the importance of the Learning and Skills Council, both nationally and regionally, co-operating with further education colleges, among others.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_43"></a><a name="07022757000141"></a>As we set out in our White Paper last March, the Learning and Skills Council is establishing a new and more effective relationship with colleges and providers, so that they can focus on improvements and meeting the needs of learners. A key part of this is the new arrangement for a single nominated Learning and Skills Council individual, called a strategic partner, for each college or other provider. Their role will be to discuss priorities, to commission provision within a much more streamlined and light-touch planning framework and systematically to help co-ordinate and build partnerships between the LSC and the respective college or provider. I hope that the objectives set out by the noble Baroness in her amendment are very substantially met. For the reasons I have given, we cannot go the whole way with her in her amendment.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_44"></a><a name="07022757000142"></a>I am delighted that the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, had such a good experience of further education in Stockton-on-Tees and that he brings that experience to consideration of this Bill. As he said, we are narrowing the points of disagreement between us. I have dealt with the issue of numbers a good deal in our correspondence, and I will seek fully to reply to his latest letter to me. I hope to deal with most of the issues he raised, which are technical and deal with the calculation of numbers relating to job changes at the Learning and Skills Council and with base lines.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_45"></a><a name="07022757000143"></a>The noble Viscount asked how the baseline set out in the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s first annual report and accounts, covering a period of 19 months, could be compared with subsequent years. That is a major point. I am informed that the calculation of the baseline was necessary, because Section 29 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000 specifies that the first financial year for the council should be the period starting with the date on which it was established and ending with the second 31 March following that date&#151;as the noble Viscount said, that was a period of 19 months. However, for the first seven months, the Learning and Skills Council was in embryonic form and did not become fully operational until April 2001, when the operational staff transferring from the former training and enterprise councils and the former Education Funding Council for England took up posts. I am advised that the &#163;249 million baseline figure to which the noble Viscount referred is appropriate for the department and the Learning and Skills Council to use because, for all practical purposes, it relates to a period of 12 not 19 months. Subsequent comparisons are, therefore, reasonable. Perhaps I may deal with the other issues raised by the noble Viscount in correspondence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_46"></a><a name="07022757000144"></a>Amendment No. 6 is not necessary because it would place a statutory duty on the regional councils of the Learning and Skills Council, of which there will be nine, to set up between 27 and 54 area offices. However, as I said earlier in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, the Learning and Skills Council will set up around 150 local partnership teams, which is approximately one per local authority. I set out their functions in my letter to the noble Viscount.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_47"></a><a name="07022757000145"></a>As I stressed in that letter and in my remarks, the Learning and Skills Council and local authorities already work in close partnership and the arrangements by which they do that will be strengthened by proposals in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, currently in another place, which place a duty on responsible local authorities to co-operate with partner authorities, of which the Learning and Skills Council is one, in producing local area agreements.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_48"></a><a name="07022757000146"></a>I hope that I am further narrowing the points of disagreement between the noble Viscount and myself. When I have replied to more of the specific points raised in his latest letter, I will be happy to engage with him further.</p>

I am grateful to the Minister for reading us the declaratory statements in the Learning and Skills Act 2000, but reasonable provision, as stated in that Act, is not quite the same as high-quality provision. He rightly identified that that is one of our major concerns; but, I suppose we will have to make do with the Audit Commission, rather than having something on the face of the Bill, if the Government insist that that is not appropriate.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_54"></a><a name="07022757000154"></a>The noble Viscount said: My Lords, I return to directions, which we discussed in Committee. The Minister correctly said that the duty to comply with directions is higher than that to have regard to guidance, and that the power to give directions allows greater control. Therein lies the problem. Ministers are constantly looking for greater powers of centralised control and for control that can be exercised without reference to Parliament. By good fortune, nearly all the legal departments serving Ministers have so far advised restraint, as, I believe, happened in the Minister&#146;s department.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_55"></a><a name="07022757000155"></a>In the 2000 Act there are powers of policy direction in Section 25. If those powers were exercised, the LSC would have a duty to report under Section 28 in its annual accounts presented to the Secretary of State and to Parliament. No such reports have been made. The schoolmaster&#146;s cane has remained behind the curtain, but it would be better if it were not there in the first place, not least because at some recent date, probably about a year ago, the LSC lost confidence in itself, as its 2005-06 report clearly shows. It is not the strong and independent non-departmental public body it needs to be. It does not debate matters publicly with the department. It apparently has no views about the Bill.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_56"></a><a name="07022757000156"></a>The Minister suggested in Committee that the LSC could always go to judicial review. How often has a non-departmental public body gone to judicial review and won against a Secretary of State? Does the Minister really believe that the LSC would approve a recommendation from its chief executive that it go to judicial review? Does he believe that the chief executive would ever make such a recommendation? The trouble is that the Government have not studied the psychology and practice of non-departmental public body management. Ministers forget that sanctions, potential or otherwise, erode confidence. Having eroded confidence and thus damaged performance, they tighten the screw&#151;as is proposed here. Confidence is further eroded. These powers of direction should be dropped. Direction should be kept for its conventional constitutional purpose: matters of administration and of last resort. If my amendment were agreed, consequential government amendments would be needed in other clauses. The constitutional argument would be the same. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="07022757000157"></a><b><a name="70227-0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07022757000840"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, the noble Viscount returns to an issue that he raised in Committee: the legitimacy of directions by Ministers on policy or routine management. Perhaps I could seek to reassure him again that it is not our intention to act unreasonably in this regard. The sort of matters that we envisage being subject to directions rather than guidance include the organisations and bodies to be consulted in preparing a strategy on the part of the respective learning and skills council, the form of and broad areas to be covered by the strategy, and matters to which a body should &#147;have regard&#148; when preparing its strategy. It is our firm intention to keep directions high-level and specific. We have demonstrated this clearly in the draft directions that we have already published for the strategy-making body for London, which I made available to noble Lords at an earlier stage. That document set out very clearly the scope of proposed directions. Those directions concern the form and content of the London strategy-making body. The strategy must,</p>
<ul><a name="07022757000409"></a>&#147;be presented as a written document; focus on training and skills for learners aged 19 and above who are in employment or who will be seeking employment ... be supported by a high quality evidence base and identify the evidence used in formulating or reviewing it; contain measurable outcomes; promote equality of opportunity&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07022757000349"></a>It sets out the elements that must be covered by the strategy. It also sets out a process for updating the strategy, stating that it must be set for a period of five years and formally reviewed and updated annually. It also sets out arrangements for consultation when formulating or reviewing a strategy, including listing the bodies that should be consulted.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_57"></a><a name="07022757000158"></a>We do not regard those as unreasonable matters that the strategy-making body should have regard to in devising a strategy; on the contrary, if we were not able to give assurances that these matters would be pursued by the respective strategy-making body, I believe we would be in dereliction of our duties to Parliament. So we think that the matters covered by the proposed directions are reasonable and, on that basis, I do not believe that the issues raised by the noble Viscount apply. However, as he says, as a last resort, there could be a judicial review if the Secretary of State sought to act unreasonably. Although I cannot give him the figures for judicial reviews in this area, they are common within the public sector where it is thought that public bodies act unreasonably.</p>

With regard to the last point, I think that there is a difference between judicial reviews raised by private bodies and bodies among the public and those that might be raised by a non-departmental public body taking on its own Secretary of State. I do not think that that has happened very often, if ever.</p>

<a name="70227-0003.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_58"></a><a name="07022757000160"></a>I do not disagree at all with the Minister that those matters need to be covered. My point is quite different: they can be covered in the Bill and by guidance, letters and dialogue. It is the constitutional issue relating to directions about which I am concerned.

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_60"></a><a name="07022757000163"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 9, 21 and 22, which are grouped with Amendment No. 8. Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are similar to Amendments Nos. 20 and 21 proposed by these Benches in Grand Committee. They would insert a new section in the Learning and Skills Act 2000 enabling the Learning and Skills Council to work with city region councils, which develop their own labour market strategies, as in the case of London, covered elsewhere in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_61"></a><a name="07022757000164"></a>The first amendment would ensure that any such strategy took account of local area agreements and local improvement targets. The second amendment relates to consultations which should be carried out in formulating such strategies and asks that they should include not only the responsible local authorities but also partner authorities working with them. If this duty is not placed on the new strategic body, there is a danger that conflicting strategies will emerge to the detriment of learners in the area and the effectiveness of the programmes.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_62"></a><a name="07022757000165"></a>The Minister was reluctant to burden the Bill with this detail and claimed that the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, which is currently passing through another place, will cover these matters. His reassurances have not convinced the Local Government Association, which has asked us to lay this amendment again to indicate the strength of its feeling on the matter. Can the Minister assure the House that the new regional strategic body would not be able to make decisions without regard to these agreements and targets?</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_63"></a><a name="07022757000166"></a>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 have not appeared previously in the Marshalled List. They would ensure that the Learning and Skills Council gave active regard to representations from the local authority when considering either the establishment or dissolution of a further education corporation and that it provided those authorities with written information and reasons for such decisions.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_64"></a><a name="07022757000167"></a>Councils have duties with regard to schools and entitlements and options for pupils over the age of 14, and they have a strategic lead with regard to 14 to 19 education. They also have duties to fulfil every child&#146;s educational potential under the Education and Inspections Act 2006, and they share responsibility for monitoring admissions, planning sufficient places and building schools for the future. All those responsibilities will be impacted by LSC decisions to open or close colleges of further education. The LSC therefore must exercise its powers to reorganise colleges in close consultation with local authorities. I beg to move.</p>

As your Lordships will be aware, in Grand Committee, there was a very lengthy discussion about the position of London, to which the amendment relates. It was understood, I think, that London is in a special situation because there are skill disparities in London, a high unemployment rate of 7.5 per cent&#151;higher than the national average&#151;and high child poverty rates. Of course, it was understood that skill levels are only one dimension in all this, but they are an important one. There was general agreement that it was right that there should be a special role for the mayor in seeing through the strategy in London and in establishing and chairing a new London skills and employment board.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_65"></a><a name="07022757000169"></a>Our only problem is that the Bill seems to make that a matter for the Secretary of State's discretion. Although that might be all right today, one does not know what may happen in future. Therefore, we felt it necessary to have an amendment that makes it obligatory on the Secretary of State to ensure that the board is established and permanent&#151;that those arrangements continue with no question of them being withdrawn by some future Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_66"></a><a name="07022757000170"></a>I must say that when we had that discussion and many people agreed with that view in Grand Committee, my noble friend made an extremely sympathetic response. We were very pleased that he responded in the way that he did. Since then, I have had a very welcome letter from him indicating general agreement with that. That being the case, when the amendment is called, seriatim in its place, I intend to move it and hope to receive the endorsement of the House.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"></a><a name="07022757000172"></a>I am glad that the Government have come some way in amendments to be moved in a later group to meet the concerns raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, in Grand Committee and again here by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. However, the government amendment to allow the Secretary of State to specify other people and organisations which the Learning and Skills Council should consult falls a long way short of providing sufficient reassurance. In reply to this amendment or when he moves his amendments, can the Minister confirm which organisations he intends to include in guidance?</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_68"></a><a name="07022757000173"></a>The Learning and Skills Council has enormous powers over further education providers and will have yet more when the Bill goes through. It is only right that those powers are wielded with the utmost care to ensure that local organisations are listened to and their concerns acted on. I hope that the Government will consider whether the amendment moved by the noble Baroness can be more positively incorporated into theirs.</p>

In Grand Committee, I promised that if my noble friend Lady Turner wished to table her amendment to Clause 4 again on Report, we would give it very sympathetic consideration. She has done so and I can say that we are glad to accept it. We always intended to put the arrangements for the existing non-statutory London skills and employment board on a firm and permanent footing. The amendment gives us the opportunity to do so, which we are glad to embrace. We are also glad that it has such wide support across the House.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_69"></a><a name="07022757000176"></a>On Amendments Nos. 8, 9, 21 and 22 tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, let me say first that we share entirely the objectives of the noble Baroness in respect of consultation with local authorities and the need to take account of local area agreements. However, as I said in Grand Committee, we do not believe that these amendments are necessary. In the first place, the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill will place a duty on local authorities to co-operate with partner authorities, of which the Learning and Skills Council is one, when producing local area agreements. The Bill also proposes that partner authorities such as the LSC must, in exercising their functions, have regard to every local improvement target specified in the local area agreement which relates to it. That, I believe, goes a considerable way towards meeting the objectives set out by the noble Baroness.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_70"></a><a name="07022757000177"></a>However, in terms of the duties on the further education sector itself, we believe that the right place to refer to these matters is in direction and guidance. We have been considering how to take forward the issue of strengthening directions and guidance to ensure that the process takes place. Although the published draft of the directions and guidance does not currently refer to local area agreements and local improvement targets, we intend to ensure that the matters referred to in Amendment No. 8, as proposed in the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, are addressed in the final version of the directions and guidance. That will meet the objective set out in Amendment No. 8.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_71"></a><a name="07022757000178"></a>Turning to Amendments Nos. 21 and 22, I understand the concern to ensure that the Learning and Skills Council consults the community, including the relevant local authority, where there are proposals to establish or dissolve further education corporations. Such consultation is already a fundamental part of the process of establishing and dissolving further education corporations and it will continue to be so. Regulations are already in place which set out the process for publishing proposals to establish and dissolve corporations. While some minor amendments to the existing regulations are required to reflect the transfer of powers from the Secretary of State to the Learning and Skills Council, we intend to keep the current process set out in those regulations in place. They prescribe both the type of information that must be included in the proposal and the manner in which it must be published. The proposal must include the rationale for the action being proposed and there is an existing requirement for all proposals to be sent to the local authority in the area the institution is situated, or is proposed to be situated. Under the regulations, following a period of at least one calendar month, any representations from the community, including the relevant local authority, have to be considered by the Learning and Skills Council before a decision is made to establish or to dissolve a further education corporation and, as I have said, these provisions will be retained in the new regulations to be made under Section 51 as amended. Local authorities will therefore have information on the rationale for the proposed action. They will also have the ability to comment on those proposals and to have those comments formally considered before any decision can be made. So I hope that the matters raised by the noble Baroness are fully met.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"></a><a name="07022757000186"></a>Under the Greater London Authority Act the Mayor is required to consult the Assembly and others in preparing and revising a large number of strategies. The Greater London Authority Bill, currently in another place, strengthens the scrutiny role and the amendment seeks to place that strategy on all fours with the other strategies. The same language is used as in the Greater London Authority Bill that regard must be had to comments submitted by the Assembly; a written statement and response must be received; comments by the Assembly that are accepted should be identified and reasons set out for not accepting any comments. I have been in correspondence with the Minister and I thank him for his letter responding to my concerns encapsulated in this and the next amendment.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_77"></a><a name="07022757000187"></a>The Minister distinguishes this strategy, saying that it is part of the national skills strategy framework&#151;indeed it is&#151;and that the Secretary of State will resolve disputes. There is not so great a distinction. All mayoral strategies sit within a framework, the different subject areas. The Secretary of State has considerable reserve powers. When we were debating that Act we discovered, because someone had counted, perhaps with the use of a computer, that there were more mentions of the Secretary of State than there were of the Mayor. To argue that this strategy is different because of the Secretary of State&#146;s role and because of the policy framework within which it sits does not take us a great deal further.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_78"></a><a name="07022757000188"></a>I mention also the strategy of the London Development Agency, which is part of the Greater London Authority family. The Mayor has a considerable role in it but it is a regional development agency and in that way subject to many of the RDAs&#146; constraints. In the case of this Bill it is the Mayor who appoints the board and it seems to me that it is not only not unreasonable but an appropriate progression of the Assembly&#146;s scrutiny role. I believe that scrutiny plays an important part in achieving good policy as the end result. It is not opposition; that is not how I approach it. In summary, I see no difference between this and the other strategies that will be subject to the input from the Assembly in the way that I have described.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_79"></a><a name="07022757000189"></a>Amendment No. 13 seeks to increase the openness of the way in which the board functions and to include provision for openness in regulations. Again I thank the Minister for his letter. He says that the provision does not need to be set out in directions. I agree that the right of access to meetings and material of such a board should not need saying but experience suggests that it does. I acknowledged in Grand Committee that in some matters confidentiality should inevitably prevail but that it would be best if the board were to decide to be completely open and that the default position should be open. I acknowledge that the Government want to move in the direction of greater openness. I should like to see them do so with more energy than so far has been offered.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_80"></a><a name="07022757000190"></a>I said that experience sadly suggests that it is necessary to spell these matters out. The London Development Agency, to which I have referred, has not always been wholly open in the way it has conducted its business. I pay tribute to the deputy chair of the LDA, who I think is gradually persuading the board of the value of openness. He comes from a background in local government, which is an important factor. Members of the board will mostly be business people. People with that background have a different ethos from those of us who are used to conducting our business in the public eye. They are not naturally comfortable with having sometimes quite difficult discussions in public. The board has met, but it did not do so in a public manner; indeed, I understand that a journalist was specifically refused the opportunity to report on its first meeting. It is not possible to find any of its business published on the web. A Google search takes one to the London Development Agency, and pretty much all I have been able to find is the announcement of the board&#146;s membership.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_81"></a><a name="07022757000191"></a>I would prefer to see these provisions in regulations; or, if not in regulations, at least in the Secretary of State&#146;s directions. In his letter to me the Minister said he will consider guidance. My third preference, I suppose, is not &#147;considering&#148; guidance but a commitment to guidance. I would like to see the commitment at a higher level than that, for the reasons I have explained. I beg to move.</p>

As I made clear when speaking to the previous group of amendments, anything that makes the Learning and Skills Council more transparent, accountable and responsive to local opinion and needs is a good thing. There is no other way that we can move towards a demand-led system. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure us on these points, and that he will consider these amendments carefully.</p>

Amendment No. 12 would require the London Skills and Employment Board in preparing its strategy to consult the Assembly, and to have regard to any response. Amendment No. 13 would make statutory provision about public access to the body&#146;s meetings and papers. </p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_82"></a><a name="07022757000194"></a>On Amendment No. 12, we fully accept that the views of the Assembly are important and need to be taken account of by both the Mayor and the London Skills and Employment Board. That will be the case, and it is made clear in the draft directions, which I read out in response to the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and which we have made available to the House. These state:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29"></a><a name="07022757000386"></a>&#147;In formulating the strategy, the Board must consult the following consultation bodies&#148;,</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022757000350"></a>including the Greater London Assembly.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_83"></a><a name="07022757000195"></a>The draft directions also state that the strategy must include a summary of the main issues raised by those consulted and how they have been addressed, so there must therefore be a formal response to that consultation as well. However, I reiterate that we do not accept that the Assembly has a different role from that of other consultation bodies in respect of this strategy. The skills strategy will not be like the mayoral strategy set out in the Greater London Authority Act, which make up the Mayor&#146;s strategic framework for London. Rather, the role of the London Skills and Employment Board is to formulate a skills strategy for Greater London that sits within the framework of legislation that concerns the Learning and Skills Council and its functions in relation to education and training. The Learning and Skills Council will be under a duty to carry out its functions in accordance with the skills strategy. We believe that this makes it a very different strategy from the mayoral strategies.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_84"></a><a name="07022757000196"></a>The skills strategy for London will be produced by the Mayor and the London Skills and Employment Board working together, with the Mayor as its chairman. The board will be under a duty to comply with directions and to have regard to guidance given by the Secretary of State, and the skills strategy will form part of the national skills strategy. All this means that it is different in kind from the Mayor&#146;s other strategies. For this reason, although we believe it right that the assembly should be consulted, it would be wrong to say that the assembly&#146;s role should be exactly the same with regard to the skills strategy as with the mayoral strategies in the GLA acts.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_85"></a><a name="07022757000197"></a>On Amendment No. 13, we have considered this point further. It is still our view that it would be unduly prescriptive to set out in regulations or directions whether and how the public and press should be given access to meetings and documents of the London Skills and Employment Board. If the noble Baroness were willing to withdraw her amendment, I can undertake to seek to develop guidance on the need for transparency and openness in the conduct of the business of the board. On the board&#146;s actual practice, although as she said the early meetings have been held in private, I understand that as the members of the board become more accustomed to their new role, it is likely that they will want to move towards having meetings in public rather than in private. If we were to develop guidance of the kind I have just indicated, this would give them a strong lead in this direction.</p>

<a name="70227-0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_86"></a><a name="07022757000198"></a>There is no disagreement between us about the desirability of having meetings in public wherever possible. However, we believe this decision should be left to the judgment of the board members, most of whom are London employers and well aware of their responsibilities to the wider community in their city and anxious to serve it. Guidance is a better route to go down than directions of the kind envisaged by the noble Baroness in her amendment.</p>

I am in danger of repeating what I said in introducing both amendments. I think I anticipated the Minister&#146;s arguments. I am sorry that he feels unable to accept that there is a particular role for the Assembly to contribute to the development of the strategy. The Mayor will shortly have new duties in, for instance, housing and climate change. Those are not matters where the Government are going to leave him entirely to his own devices, so I do not see the distinction that the Minister sees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"></a><a name="07022757000202"></a>I am grateful for what the Minister says on taking forward openness and transparency. I feel slightly uncomfortable in even having to raise the matter, and do not want it to be thought that I do not have confidence in the individual members of the board. Having had, over a period of many years, dealings with people from different backgrounds, I have become entirely used to the different ways we all approach public duty. Their commitment is no less, but the customs which they apply are very different. Having said that, and thanking him for looking at the point on transparency, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_91"></a><a name="07022757000207"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, this amendment is about the social and emotional needs of some of the students at FE colleges. If the House will forgive me, it may be helpful to explain where I am coming from. In doing so I can explain what I am asking for and why.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_92"></a><a name="07022757000208"></a>My knowledge and experience in this area derives from the 16 years I spent as chairman of Toynbee Hall&#146;s youth department, and particularly from my participation for three or four weeks each year in organising and delivering outdoor activity programmes for young people with learning difficulties, mainly those with emotional and behavioural problems. In the process, I got to know quite a lot about the needs of these young people. A large proportion of them, probably nine out of 10, came from dysfunctional and sometimes chaotic families. Quite a number had been neglected or abused.</p>
<a name="time_8"></a>
<a name="70227-0005.htm_time0"></a><h5><a name="0704192000001"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_93"></a><a name="07022757000209"></a>What most of these young people wanted above all was an adult they could trust and who cared about them. They wanted not a department or a service but a person whom they could rely on to be there when needed. Most of these young people had failed at school, usually because they had had a bad start, not having had any educational support from their families. They got behind, they got discouraged, they found it humiliating, and so it went on. Most of them ended up truanting or sitting at the back of the class, raising Cain.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_94"></a><a name="07022757000210"></a>Interestingly, some of these young people, who had rejected the school environment, were prepared to be persuaded to have a go at a course in an FE college. They perceived it as an adult activity, they perceived some of the courses as relevant to their needs, and were prepared to have a go. These are what are called hard-to-reach young people&#151;they do not walk through a door easily. It is crucial that if such young people walk into an FE college, we do everything we can to help them make a success of it. We must help them cope socially and emotionally, and to organise their life. Above all, we must encourage them, because self-confidence is often terribly lacking.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_95"></a><a name="07022757000211"></a>That is what I mean by pastoral care. If they do not get that care, many of those young people will fall out of college, revert to petty crime, rent-a-mob, running drugs, climbing up trees to stop the bulldozers, or running cigarettes across the Channel&#151;I have heard all those stories. Then they will go on to serious crime and the revolving door of prison, unemployment and crime. That is why I want pastoral care to be on the face of the Bill.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_96"></a><a name="07022757000212"></a>The Minister wrote me an extremely helpful letter, for which I am very grateful,. It gives a very full picture. The difficulty with Report is that if I leave the Minister to speak his own brief, other noble Lords who want to speak will not know what he wrote to me. I shall briefly summarise the noble Lord&#146;s comments but am quite prepared to be told that I have got it wrong.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_97"></a><a name="07022757000213"></a>The first several paragraphs of the Minister&#146;s letter refer to various other pieces of legislation which could empower a Government to bring pressure to bear on further education colleges and the Learning and Skills Council to provide pastoral care and other help to emotionally and behaviourally disturbed young people.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_98"></a><a name="07022757000214"></a>I am not comfortable with any of those references. The two most important points are made at the end, when the noble Lord points out:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31"></a><a name="07022757000388"></a>&#147;In the March 2006 White Paper, <I>Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances</I>, we said that governing bodies should consider how their pastoral arrangements should best reflect the characteristics of their student body&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022757000351"></a>That is good, but that White Paper proposal has not appeared in the Bill. Perhaps the Government have thought better of it, which is why they have not included it in the Bill. We cannot rely on a White Paper.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_99"></a><a name="07022757000215"></a>The other important point is that Ofsted&#146;s <I>Handbook for Inspecting Colleges </I>has a marvellous list of things that must be inspected. It includes extensive guidance for inspectors, and inspection criteria include,</p>
<ul><a name="07022757000410"></a>&#147;whether the college plans effectively to meet the needs of potentially underachieving groups; whether the college helps learners to develop their self-confidence, team working skills&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07022757000352"></a>and the emotional development of learners. I just eat up things like that&#151;I love the idea of them. But those criteria are only for Ofsted. I think that I understand that Ofsted will no longer make regular three-yearly visits to every school and every further education college, but will visit only occasionally when there is some cause for concern. I am not entirely happy that the fact that Ofsted is carrying out such a thorough inspection will solve the problem that we are looking at, but I shall listen with interest to the Minister.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_100"></a><a name="07022757000216"></a>However, I am pleased that Ofsted&#146;s brief in this respect represents the Government&#146;s point of view and that the Government are thinking in the same way as me: they want to do what I believe is right. The only question is whether we should not incorporate this in primary legislation now. I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_96"></a>
<a name="07022757000217"></a><b><a name="70227-0005.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07022757000856"></a>The Lord Bishop of Manchester:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment No. 15, which stands in my name, but I support the significant points concerning pastoral services that have just been made by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, speaking most movingly, not least from his personal experience in FE. With him, I ask the Minister to ensure that the review of pastoral arrangements, including multi-faith chaplaincy, which is commended in the White Paper published last year to which he referred, is then transformed from the vision of a White Paper into the reality of legislation.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_101"></a><a name="07022757000218"></a>As I and others from across the House have said at all the stages of this Bill, there is more at stake than pastoral arrangements alone, important though they are. My amendment would remove an historical anomaly whereby 16 to 19 year-olds in schools have an entitlement to provision for their spiritual, moral, social and cultural development but 16 to 19 year-olds who are in colleges do not. Such entitlement is about more than pastoral matters; it relates to the whole of college provision, to a college&#146;s ethos and inclusivity, and to the extent to which it meets the needs of all young people in college of whatever faith or none.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_102"></a><a name="07022757000219"></a>It simply cannot be right that young people at this crucial and vulnerable age who are in colleges have no space within the curriculum, or in enrichment or other activities, to explore the important questions about meaning and purpose in their lives and about the values, beliefs and faiths in our society, and that that omission occurs simply because they happen to be following a vocational course or, in some cases, an A-level course in a college rather than in a school.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_103"></a><a name="07022757000220"></a>I realise that this is not the moment for a great debate about the current moral difficulties of this generation of young people. We need time to absorb the lessons of, for example, the United Nations report on childhood. However, we need to ponder the messages that come from multi-faith chaplaincies in colleges about young people who are very interested in faith and values but who lack the moral compass to which earlier generations of young people may have had access. Some of the young people who are being drawn into a violent gun culture in places such as Peckham, or in Moss Side in my diocese, or some of the young people who are on hard drugs in places all over the country or who indulge in escapist binge-drinking on a Saturday night, are likely, if they are in any form of post-16 education, to be in colleges rather than anywhere else.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_104"></a><a name="07022757000221"></a>We should salute the FE colleges for the way in which they support these students and for the way in which they are attracting increasing numbers of the so-called NEET students&#151;students not in education, employment or training&#151;who are often from marginalised groups and deprived areas.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_105"></a><a name="07022757000222"></a>We should make absolutely sure&#151;and this means having some sort of legal duty or entitlement&#151;that the colleges have spiritual, moral, cultural and social development at the heart of any provision, especially in relation to employability skills. Employability is not only about technical and practical skills; employers are often quoted as saying that their main requirements from young employees, in addition to a basic level of skills, are qualities such as reliability, honesty, self-confidence and a sense of right and wrong. These are core human values, as I am sure noble Lords will agree, which have always been directly linked to the values and traditions of the faiths, whether Christianity or the other great religions, and to the great humanist traditions.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_106"></a><a name="07022757000223"></a>As noble Lords noted in Committee, churches and faiths are at one with the British Humanist Association in championing spiritual and moral education in FE colleges through the LSC-funded project, All Faiths and None. I say clearly from the Bishops&#146; Bench that engaging with faith and non-faith traditions is an essential part of every young person&#146;s development and training for skills. If this or any Government convey the impression that all that matters in life is economic prosperity and technical skill, there will be sad consequences for society and young people. Indeed, we are already seeing those consequences in the confusion, disaffection and sometimes depression among the young.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_107"></a><a name="07022757000224"></a>To refer again to the United Nations report, I see it as no shame at all that 30 per cent of young people have so-called &#147;low ambitions&#148; in the areas of technical and vocational skills such as construction, engineering, IT, health and caring services. My younger daughter is training as a nurse at the moment. These are not low aspirations&#151;and even if they happen to be called so-called &#147;low ambitions&#148; they have just as much value as academic achievements. We need to show young people in colleges that they deserve equality of esteem and entitlement with those young people who are following the academic route in schools.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_108"></a><a name="07022757000225"></a>On this Bench, we have taken on board the Minister&#146;s comments in Committee that this Bill is about the structure and organisation of FE rather than the curriculum. I withdrew the earlier proposed amendment, which might have placed a duty on colleges in respect of the curriculum. But what I suggest through this amendment is that the LSC should have regard, as part of its brief, to the spiritual, moral, social and cultural needs of students as well as to the other important aspects of their education and training. A modest signal given now in this Bill indicating the broader overall purposes of further education would correct the historical anomaly to which I referred, whereby the deeper needs of students and the values and faiths of our society appear to be a matter for 16 to 19 year-olds only if they are in schools, not colleges. That simply cannot be right.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_109"></a><a name="07022757000227"></a>On the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, I absolutely agree with him about the needs of the group of young people to whom he referred. Those who have dropped out of school very often find that they are treated very differently in a college and respond well to that. It is important that their pastoral needs are taken care of. However, I echo the words that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, used in respect of one of my earlier amendments, in that I think that this is a matter for the colleges, rather than for the Learning and Skills Council.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_110"></a><a name="07022757000228"></a>On the amendment of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester, we on these Benches believe that it is right that the anomaly should be corrected&#151;that anomaly exists, there is no question about it. Provision should be made in colleges for the spiritual, moral, cultural and social needs of young people. My only concern is whether the right reverend Prelate&#146;s amendment would place a duty on all colleges to have chaplaincies of every faith that operates in this country or else be accused of discrimination. Can the Minister respond to this concern of mine? Obviously, this sort of work needs to be made available to young people, but in my view they should not be forced to take part in it once they are over the age of 16.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_111"></a><a name="07022757000229"></a>Amendment No. 49 would place on colleges of further education the same duties to promote the well-being of students as the Children Act 2004 gives to schools; it would also give the same duties to promote community cohesion as the Education and Inspections Act 2006 puts on schools. Given that many pupils of the same age&#151;14 to 19 year-olds, as we have just heard&#151;attend both sorts of institution, we on these Benches see no justification for colleges not having these duties. When the national vocational diplomas get into full swing, even more of these young people will attend FE colleges. Even now, in areas where students from many schools do some or all of their A-levels at FE colleges, a different set of duties applies to them in the two kinds of educational institutions that they attend. This cannot be right.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_112"></a><a name="07022757000230"></a>When the Education and Inspections Act 2006 passed through this House, we had long and interesting debates about the integration or otherwise of pupils of different faiths in different kinds of schools. Some of your Lordships were keen on single-faith schools and others were against them, on the basis that they did not assist people of different faiths to get to know one another and to get on together. The compromise hatched by the Government in the face of this situation&#151;with the assistance of the noble Lord, Lord Sutherland of Houndwood, and others&#151;was to allow faith schools to continue, but to give all schools the duty to promote social cohesion. Some of us will be very interested to see how Ofsted inspects them on that duty, and whether the criteria will include their admissions policies. In colleges, however, you usually get a much more mixed population. One might think that it would be easier for colleges to fulfil this duty. Whether or not this is the case, it is vital that we have coherence and strength of message about the importance of social cohesion and the five outcomes of the <I>Every Child Matters </I>programme.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_113"></a><a name="07022757000231"></a>Many students at FE colleges are, indeed, still children and their well-being must be served just the same, whether they attend college or school. If the Government accept this principle, and my amendment or something like it, we would need an amendment to Section 125 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 to allow colleges to be inspected, as well as schools, on the new duty. Perhaps the Minister will think about that when considering my amendment.</p>

The points made by my noble friend Lord Northbourne about these young people who, for whatever reason, have got into difficult circumstances are very important.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_114"></a><a name="07022757000233"></a>Funnily enough, this morning I was at a breakfast organised by Plan where I heard about a young man who had been in and out of unlawful activity. He used the gym as a method of working out. In that process, he came across a young person suffering from Down&#146;s syndrome. They established a good relationship and this brought out the best side of the young man, who stopped offending and went on to become an adviser on such young people for a local authority. That is a one-off but I refer to the spiritual side, the whole community involvement side and the facilities that should be available for the young people whom we are discussing.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_115"></a><a name="07022757000234"></a>As the right reverend Prelate said, there should be no difference in this regard between those who are at school and those in the same age group who want to undertake further education or training. We should welcome them whenever and however they come into the system. In my view it should be made very clear to the LSC as well as to individual colleges that this should take place. I hope that the Minister will reassure us on that.</p>

I also pay tribute to the work that has evidently gone on behind the scenes in the creation of these amendments. The noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and the right reverend Prelate proposed two amendments that offer two alternative methods of achieving wider and better provision of spiritual guidance in FE colleges.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_116"></a><a name="07022757000236"></a>As I am sure the Minister will agree, their arguments are irresistible. Surely he will acknowledge that it is at best odd, and at worst inconsistent, that one 16 year-old should be entitled to pastoral care or spiritual care and guidance while another is deprived of it purely by virtue of the educational establishment that they attend.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_117"></a><a name="07022757000237"></a>This issue is so important to the general well-being of students, and to the contribution of FE colleges to their wider communities. I have great sympathy with the difficulties that the right reverend Prelate encountered in Committee. It seems that the Bill has been drawn so narrowly as to preclude the inclusion of a substantive amendment to encourage the adoption of either spiritual, moral and cultural guidance as proposed by the right reverend Prelate, or pastoral care as proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne. I shall be very interested to read the Ecumenical Agency&#146;s report later in the year. Can the Minister assure noble Lords that he will take its recommendations into account and that he will communicate to it whether he intends to introduce policy following the report?</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_118"></a><a name="07022757000238"></a>Amendment No. 49 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, makes for familiar reading, as she said. I recall reading in the <I>Official Report</I> that, during the passage of the education Bill last summer, the Government accepted amendments tabled by the Liberal Democrats that placed a duty on governing bodies to promote well-being. The terms of this amendment cover similar ground but add to that duty a duty to promote community cohesion. I warmly support the principle behind the noble Baroness&#146;s amendment; nobody can disagree with the importance of promoting well-being and community cohesion. I hope that other noble Lords will agree with me that no further education college would not promote well-being and community cohesion. Amendment No. 49 raises an important issue, for which I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, but I believe that this is a matter of social responsibility and should not be a statutory requirement. We are concerned that the law as it applies to children might be invoked with respect to adults, as could be the case were this amendment accepted. That is our reservation on Amendment No. 49.</p>

It simply does not stand up. The argument of logic is very powerful and I cannot see any grounds to dissent from what has been said. I hope that the Government will respond positively to this, especially as it has such wide support in the House and outside the House in the humanist community. We are not debating faith, which sometimes divides us; this is something that unites us. It is in the interests of all young people that they should receive this nourishment.</p>

<a name="07022757000240"></a><b><a name="70227-0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07022757000861"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, I will deal first with the spiritual, moral, cultural and social needs, quite rightly highlighted by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester. I entirely agree with him that it is wrong to conceive of further education as purely a matter of technical and practical skills. We made clear in last year&#146;s further education White Paper that education and training for community development and personal fulfilment have an important place. The White Paper states that,</p>
<ul><a name="07022757000389"></a>&#147;for young people in particular, [further education] must extend to inculcating the values, attitudes and knowledge that society seeks from its young people&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70227-0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_119"></a><a name="07022757000241"></a>We are concerned to see that institutions educating 16 to 19 year-olds take the spiritual and moral well-being of their students seriously.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_120"></a><a name="07022757000242"></a>We also recognise that many students want their faith or spiritual needs recognised, and that many colleges already provide a range of facilities to meet their students&#146; spiritual needs, including multi-faith chaplaincy services and prayer rooms. Indeed, under Section 44 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, there is already a statutory duty on further education colleges, in respect of 16 to 19 year-olds, to ensure that an act of worship is held at least once a week.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_121"></a><a name="07022757000243"></a>We do not think that imposing a wide-ranging duty on the Learning and Skills Council, changing its remit, is the way forward for the reasons I set out in Grand Committee. I hope I can indicate our commitment to strengthening provision in this area in ways that the right reverend Prelate will welcome. In particular, Clause 7 of the Bill provides that the Learning and Skills Council must have regard to guidance from the Secretary of State on consulting with employers, learners and potential learners. The draft of this guidance, which I have made available to noble Lords, specifically recognises that,</p>
<ul><a name="07022757000411"></a>&#147;for many young people, their faith or spiritual needs are important defining characteristics of who they are&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70227-0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_122"></a><a name="07022757000244"></a>The draft guidance also states that the Learning and Skills Council should,</p>
<ul><a name="07022757000412"></a>&#147;consider consulting learners and potential learners on their spiritual and faith or no-faith needs as a key part of reviewing student support services&#148;.</ul>
<a name="70227-0005.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_123"></a><a name="07022757000245"></a>I stress the words &#147;a key part&#148;. Consultation on these aspects could, where appropriate, include representatives of key faith communities or faith groups.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_124"></a><a name="07022757000246"></a>I reiterate the undertaking I gave in Grand Committee to study carefully the review of the spiritual, moral, social and cultural needs of students in further education, being carried out by the National Ecumenical Agency in Further Education, of which the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of London is patron. We look forward to the recommendations of the agency in April. Once this review has been reported in the spring, we will consider whether there is a need for further national initiatives or policy. Following the lead of the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, I undertake that the Minister for Further and Higher Education will be glad to meet the right reverend Prelate and any other noble Lords who wish to join that meeting to discuss the report and initiatives that it would be sensible to take forward in light of it.</p>

<a name="70227-0005.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_125"></a><a name="07022757000247"></a>I hope that, while I have not been able to satisfy the right reverend Prelate entirely, I have at least been able to move some way in his direction, on the basis of our shared concern to see these issues taken seriously in further education, and not simply regarded as the preserve of schools and institutions dealing with younger people.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70227-0006.htm"/>


<a name="70227-0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_126"></a><a name="07022757000248"></a>On Amendment No. 14, moved by the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and Amendment No. 49, moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, I agree strongly with them that there is a need for robust systems to ensure the well-being of students, promote community cohesion and ensure that all young people have access to appropriate pastoral care. Let me set out some of our provisions in this regard. First, it is a requirement that where 14 to 16 year-old pupils who are registered with a school spend part of their time in a further education college, they remain pupils of the school. That school, therefore, has a duty to promote their well-being. Amendment No. 49, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, seeks to place duties on FE colleges that mirror existing duties on schools. These are not needed.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_127"></a><a name="07022757000249"></a>Colleges, through the work of their student support services, tutorial work and enrichment work activities, are constantly engaged in promoting the well-being of young people. That is underpinned by Section 175 of the Education Act 2002, which requires governing bodies of further education colleges in England and Wales to ensure that they exercise their functions with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of their younger students.</p>
<a name="time_10"></a>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_128"></a><a name="07022757000250"></a>Colleges are held to account for their performance in both these areas through the inspection arrangements. The common inspection framework in England has a range of relevant evaluation questions, including the extent to which the college is educationally and socially inclusive and the effectiveness of its links with other organisations, including organisations concerned with the care and welfare of children, in promoting the well-being of learners. Indeed, the common inspection framework makes clear that issues affecting the well-being of children have always been central to inspection judgments. Inspectors will evaluate the extent to which the five <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes of being healthy, staying safe, enjoying and achieving, making a positive contribution, and achieving economic well-being are being met by colleges.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_129"></a><a name="07022757000251"></a>The common inspection framework in Wales requires similar evidence of the work of colleges in relation to their learners and their inter-relationship with local communities. It specifically asks how well the learning experiences meet the needs and interests of learners and the wider community and how well learners are cared for, guided and supported; but these judgments will necessarily be dependent on the context of the college. Colleges where the majority of learners are adults, for example, will have very different arrangements from those where the majority of students are 16 to 19 year-olds. It is increasingly the practice in colleges that there are self-contained sixth-form centres for students under 19, not least to ensure that better and more focused pastoral arrangements are in place.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_130"></a><a name="07022757000252"></a>As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, has rightly observed, a small number of children of compulsory school age are, for a wide variety of reasons, not registered with a school. Some of those are enrolled on a full-time basis in a further education college. All 13 to 19 year-olds in England, whether they are registered with a school, with a further education college or with neither, are covered by provisions in Section 6 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006, which places a duty on local authorities in England to secure access for young persons in their area to sufficient educational and recreational leisure-time activities which are for the improvement of their well-being. &#147;Well-being&#148;, under that section of the Act, relates to the five <I>Every Child Matters</I> outcomes and the educational activities must include those that are for the improvement of the young people&#146;s personal and social development.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_131"></a><a name="07022757000253"></a>Section 10 of the Children Act 2004 is also relevant. It imposes a duty on each children&#146;s services authority in England to make arrangements to promote co-operation between the authority and each of its &#147;relevant partners&#148;. The Learning and Skills Council is listed as a relevant partner, being the strategic commissioner of post-16 provision. The National Assembly for Wales is also listed as a relevant partner in relation to children's services authorities in Wales. Once the new First Minister is appointed in Wales in May 2007, these functions will transfer to Welsh Ministers.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_132"></a><a name="07022757000254"></a>However, we propose to go further still. The White Paper, <I>Further Education: Raising Skills, Improving Life Chances, </I>published last March, stated that FE college governing bodies should consider how their pastoral arrangements should best reflect the characteristics of their student body of all age ranges. Taking this commitment forward, we are currently developing pilots which will test and evaluate different approaches to pastoral support. The pilots will include a particular focus on children and young people in care as part of our Green Paper commitments. We also want to explore how pastoral arrangements can best work to support those 14 to 19 year-old learners who learn across more than one institution, and who have been of particular concern to the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_133"></a><a name="07022757000255"></a>The evaluation of these pilots will be built into guidance for providers by April 2008. I will keep noble Lords informed of their progress and my honourable friend, the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education will be glad to discuss the outcome of those pilots with noble Lords before we develop that guidance for providers. So I hope that I have gone some way towards meeting the concerns that have been raised.</p>

I am informed that that includes activities such as hosting faith awareness weeks, which meets the point raised by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester. The Government encourage and support these activities. For example, we work with the Association of Colleges in England and others to ensure that colleges have good guidance on effective practice in community cohesion work. As I said, they are then inspected against that.</p>

He is right that there is now a light-touch inspection regime, but all institutions are still visited on a regular cycle. That varies depending on the type of institution but it is about once every three years. The point that I think the noble Lord was getting at is that the depth of that inspection is now in inverse proportion to success. Successfully managed institutions whose self-evaluation is positive and held to be accurate by inspections will not receive one of the old-style inspections that included large numbers of inspectors sitting at the back of classes. However, institutions that demonstrate weaknesses in their self-evaluation or whose leadership and management is not found to be satisfactory by inspectors&#151; and that includes pastoral support of pupils&#151;will be subject to a more in-depth inspection and can be issued with a notice to improve or, in extremis, be placed in special measures, which requires a radical improvement plan to be put in place. The inspection arrangements are still robust in meeting the noble Lord&#146;s concerns.</p>

I undertook to consider the points raised further. I and my honourable friend the Minister for Further and Higher Education are now persuaded that the legislation should cover consultation with learners, employers and &#147;other persons&#148; nominated by the Secretary of State. Amendment No. 17 reflects that change.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_140"></a><a name="07022757000272"></a>The LSC already consults a wide range of partner bodies about the exercise of its provision and funding duties in relation to learners. We acknowledge that, and of course expect it to continue. By proposing the amendment, we also recognise that there may be a need for consultation by the LSC in the future with &#147;other persons&#148; about decisions which affect them.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_141"></a><a name="07022757000273"></a>Amendment No. 17 will allow us to specify in guidance organisations that the LSC should consider consulting. That will include partner bodies and other organisations that we may specify. Specifying organisations in guidance will maintain flexibility and allow us to respond to changing circumstances in the FE system without the need to amend legislation.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_142"></a><a name="07022757000274"></a>A draft of the statutory guidance, which this clause proposes that the LSC must have regard to in consulting employers, learners and other organisations and partners, has been made available to the House. The guidance will remain under review and would be updated to reflect any change to the duty placed on the LSC by Clause 7. However, since it already covers consultation with the LSC's partner organisations, we have no immediate plans to extend the categories of persons whom the guidance recommends that the LSC should consult.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_143"></a><a name="07022757000275"></a>Amendments Nos. 16, 18, 47 and 48 make minor, technical changes to Clauses 7 and 21. Amendments Nos. 16 and 47 make it clear that there might be consultation, by the LSC or by governing bodies of FE institutions, with one or more of the categories of consultees named in guidance, and that such consultation will be on decisions that specifically affect that group or person.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_144"></a><a name="07022757000276"></a>Clause 7 requires that guidance from the Secretary of State to the LSC specify that the views of a person being consulted are to be considered in light of their age and understanding. Clause 21 contains a similar requirement in relation to guidance to governing bodies of FE institutions from the &#147;appropriate authority&#148;&#151;the Secretary of State for institutions in England, and the Welsh Ministers for institutions in Wales. Amendments Nos. 18 and 48 ensure that those requirements relate only to consultation with learners and potential learners. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_149"></a><a name="07022757000284"></a>Clause 9 amends the Learning and Skills Council's current power to form companies as set out in Section 18 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, to make it clear that it can form companies limited by guarantee as well as those limited by shares, subject to the Secretary of State's consent. Similarly, Clauses 20 and 25 amend the powers of further and higher education corporations to make it clear that they can form companies limited by guarantee as well as those limited by shares. Clauses 9(4), 20(6) and 25(4) make retrospective provision.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_150"></a><a name="07022757000285"></a>These technical amendments make it absolutely clear that the retrospective provision is only required until immediately before the amendments come into force. Once they are in force the retrospective provisions are no longer required, as the amendments themselves provide that the Learning and Skills Council and further and higher education corporations will have the power to form companies limited by guarantee. The clauses as drafted provide that Clauses 9(4), 20(6) and 25(4) relate to the period ending on the date that the remainder of Clauses 9, 20 and 25 come into force. I am informed that there is therefore an overlap of one day. The amendment shortens the period so that it ends immediately before the rest of Clauses 9, 20 and 25 commence, so that there is no overlap.

All my amendments, save Amendment No. 39, are the same as those laid in Grand Committee, and I am afraid that my views have not changed, despite the Minister&#146;s careful reply on that occasion.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_157"></a><a name="07022757000294"></a>Amendment No. 23 would remove the reference to,</p>
<ul><a name="07022757000413"></a>&#147;significantly less well than it might in all the circumstances reasonably be expected to perform&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07022757000353"></a>as we believe that this is an intervention too soon, too far and too woolly. Amendment No. 24 would allow the council to give the corporation of a college advice but not directions. Amendment No. 25 would remove the power for the LSC to require a governing body to dismiss a principal or other senior member of staff. Instead, Amendment No. 26 would insert a statutory procedure through a model similar to that which applies to schools that are failing, whereby a written report of the LSC&#146;s concerns would be sent to the governors and the principal, and the governors would have to reply to the LSC with their plan of action. Frankly, if this procedure were in place, I could not envisage any need for the LSC to use the powers that the Government want to give it. Indeed, I believe it is only right that such a procedure should be laid down in statute. Amendments Nos. 36, 37 and 39 would insert the appropriate similar amendments into Clause 18, which relates to Wales.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_158"></a><a name="07022757000295"></a>We believe that these powers are neither appropriate nor needed in the hands of an unelected body whose job is to fund and organise the provision of further education. Despite the Government&#146;s amendments, which state that the LSC and the Welsh Assembly Government must, after consultation, publish statements on how they plan to use the new intervention powers and lay them before the Secretary of State and Parliament or the Welsh Assembly as appropriate, we are still not happy with the extent of these intervention powers. We have therefore sought in this group of amendments to modify the worst of them.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_159"></a><a name="07022757000296"></a>We acknowledge that the Government have made clear the circumstances in which the LSC might direct a governing body to dismiss a senior member of staff. However, there is no evidence that in these circumstances governing bodies would not act by themselves without needing the LSC on their backs. College governing bodies take these matters extremely seriously, and there is no evidence that a college has not acted decisively when it has needed to. In a sector of around 400 institutions, it is inevitable that some will perform less well than others. Around 70 principals leave their post each year, but most leave to take up a post elsewhere or to retire. A small number are asked to leave by their governing body. In cases of serious mismanagement or college failures, governing bodies work with the LSC and an interim principal until a new person can be appointed.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_160"></a><a name="07022757000297"></a>The Association of Colleges has estimated that 25 financially weak colleges were merged with stronger neighbours between 2000 and 2005&#151;a period, by the way, of enormous improvement in the whole sector, matched by no other public service. Only on two occasions in the past 10 years has a whole governing body resigned.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_161"></a><a name="07022757000298"></a>While considering the Government&#146;s proposal to take intervention powers from the Secretary of State and give them to the LSC, it is worth noting that the Secretary of State has not found it necessary to use these powers since they were created by the Further and Higher Education Act 1992.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_162"></a><a name="07022757000299"></a>Noble Lords will recall that another of our concerns about Clause 17 is that it interferes with employment law and the contractual arrangements between a college corporation and its employees. The intervention of the LSC or Welsh Assembly Government could make it more difficult for governors to take the appropriate action, and it could certainly open them up to legal action and possible compensation for breach of contract.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_163"></a><a name="07022757000300"></a>The Government&#146;s response to that issue in the guidance is that they,</p>
<ul><a name="07022757000414"></a>&#147;would expect the college to have a strong evidence base on which it would be able to rely in the event of a claim for unfair dismissal being brought before an employment tribunal&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07022757000354"></a>Any college that has such an evidence base will itself dismiss the person concerned and does not need the LSC to instruct it to do so. If it has not such a base, the person should not be dismissed in any case&#151;either by the college independently or on the instruction of the LSC.</p>

<a name="70227-0006.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_164"></a><a name="07022757000301"></a>Another concern is that the Bill gives the LSC new powers but does not specify how responsibility for failure should be attributed to the various senior members of staff. The absence of a real appeals process would make it impossible for the college to comply with the statutory disciplinary and dismissal procedure in any meaningful way, as any representations that the individual might make to the college would make no difference. The decision will not be made by the college; it will be made by the LSC.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_165"></a><a name="07022757000302"></a>Much of the money spent by colleges is public money, and none of us condones bad practice or poor quality in teaching or management. Of course the LSC has a role in supporting and advising colleges that are underperforming. In extremis, there are still the powers of the Secretary of State. There is no evidence that we need to transfer those powers to an unelected body. As we are talking about public money contributed by the taxpayer, it is only right that someone who has been elected and can be dismissed by the same taxpayer has the powers of intervention. I beg to move.</p>

Their amendments go some way to provide the necessary scrutiny of such potentially draconian powers and they certainly improve Clauses 17 and 18 in many ways.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_166"></a><a name="07022757000304"></a>We do not feel, however, that those amendments go far enough. They do not even begin to address our concern about the effect that the clauses will have on the relationship between the Learning and Skills Council and further education institutions, of which the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, so eloquently spoke. More importantly, they do not disguise the fact that the powers given by the clauses would damage the development of the further education sector as a whole and reduce the independence of individual colleges still further. The government amendments do nothing to change that; therefore, although we are glad that the Government are listening to this House and making a genuine effort to find a middle ground, the amendments are not enough.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_167"></a><a name="07022757000305"></a>As my response to the government amendments may have led your Lordships to expect, we are very sympathetic to the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. They deal with exactly the point that the Government have failed to address: the effect that the clauses will have on the relationship between the Learning and Skills Council and further education institutions. Clause 17 provides for the Learning and Skills Council to take on an enormously powerful role. The Government have made it clear to us that they have no expectation of that power being used at all frequently. As we have heard, it has never been used by the Secretary of State. By their amendments, they have made any use of it much more transparent and accountable not only to Parliament but to the wider public.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_168"></a><a name="07022757000306"></a>None of that makes any difference to the fact that the body that directs much of colleges&#146; funding, issues guidance and is generally a close and constant presence in the running of our colleges is being given the power to go in over the head of the governing body and sack staff, even to dismiss governors. The Liberal Democrat amendments make it considerably more likely that the powers will indeed be used only as a backstop in the most urgent cases. As such, they are very sensible and go a long way to improve the clauses. However, we do not feel that they can be amended sufficiently to guard against the harm we believe they will do. So, despite the best efforts of the Government to address our concerns, we have tabled amendments to leave out Clauses 17 and 18. We believe that these clauses are a step in entirely the wrong direction.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_169"></a><a name="07022757000307"></a>Further education institutions need to be given more, not less, independence. They need to be trusted more by the Government, not hedged around with endless rules, regulations and micromanaged targets. The only way for this sector to gain the status and credibility it deserves, and which we desperately need it to achieve, is for the Government to give colleges and the governing bodies managing them the power to develop their own diverse, innovative and locally responsive strategies and direction. Frankly, the Government should know better than to continue with clauses like these. They have commissioned several reviews and reports, most recently the Leitch review, all of which have told them the same thing: colleges need to be trusted with real independence in order fully to achieve their potential. Yet the Government continue with this unprecedented level of interference. There is no suggestion that this degree of control will be appropriate for schools or universities, so why do the Government think it is appropriate for colleges?</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_170"></a><a name="07022757000308"></a>These powers will not only prevent the further education sector developing, they will actively damage it, which is why we propose the outright removal of the clauses rather than their modification. Giving the Learning and Skills Council these powers will erode the position of colleges&#146; governing bodies instead of encouraging governors to continue to maintain a keen and active interest in their colleges. The Government are taking responsibility away from them, for no discernible reason. As I said at Second Reading, the further education sector receives some of the best Ofsted reports. I should, however, make it quite clear that we are not against rigour or driving up standards. We are perfectly happy for these powers to continue to reside where they are at present: with the Secretary of State, who is elected and paid to take difficult decisions and is ultimately accountable to the electorate. In Clause 18 the proposed shift of powers to the Welsh Assembly is at least a shift to another body answerable to the electorate, but Fforwm, the Welsh sister body to the Association of Colleges, reports that colleges want these powers to remain with the Secretary of State.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_171"></a><a name="07022757000309"></a>No doubt the Minister will tell me, as he did in Grand Committee, that these powers are very rarely used and are a last resort, but clearly not everyone sees them in that light. The morning after the Queen&#146;s Speech, the &#147;Today&#148; programme said that there was to be a further education Bill to &#147;sack college principals&#148;, and in a press release in response to the Government&#146;s White Paper that heralded the Bill now before noble Lords, the Learning and Skills Council referred more than once to poor provision being &#147;cut out&#148;. You can almost see the Learning and Skills Council salivating at being given this power.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_172"></a><a name="07022757000310"></a>We too want to see the highest standards in our colleges, but if there is a need to intervene to remove a principal or members of the governing body, the power to do so should reside with the Secretary of State. Members on these Benches feel that these clauses are a significant step in the wrong direction and therefore would like to see them removed entirely. When it comes to the appropriate time, I shall seek the opinion of the House.</p>

Like other noble Lords, I do not see the need for these provisions and do see the very strong arguments against introducing such potentially draconian micromanagement. In my view, governing bodies must retain overriding responsibility for the good management of their institutions, including the appointment and dismissal of senior staff. It is odd and incongruous that the Government should want to introduce the measures in Clause 17 at the same time as giving colleges substantial new responsibilities such as those set out in Clause 19.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_173"></a><a name="07022757000313"></a>Given that the debates about Clause 19 have somewhat polarised opinion in the further education/higher education sector, I want to use this opportunity to stress that, despite opposition among university vice-chancellors to Clause 19, I share their widespread admiration for the work of the further education sector and the contribution it makes to education, including higher education, in the United Kingdom. So I too would like to see Clause 17 removed and therefore support Amendment No. 34, in the names of the noble Baronesses, Lady Morris of Bolton and Lady Verma. If that approach is not successful, I would certainly support the measures proposed by the noble Baronesses, Lady Walmsley and Lady Sharp of Guildford, in Amendment No. 26 as a sensible compromise.</p>

<a name="07022757000317"></a><b><a name="70227-0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07022757000882"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, surely the responsibility for disciplining and removing teachers in schools now rests with the general education council?</p>

<p><a name="st_123"></a>
<a name="07022757000318"></a><b><a name="70227-0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07022757000883"></a>Lord Adonis:</b> My Lords, where a local education authority exercises its powers to suspend a failing school&#146;s delegated budget, it becomes the direct employer of the staff and can take decisions, including on the employment of teachers. The powers are comparable. However, I cannot stress too greatly, in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that these are in extremis powers to be used in cases of objective failure and underperformance. The autonomy of governing bodies to sustain failure, which is essentially the noble Baroness&#146;s case, would not be supported by the Government or, I hope, by the noble Baroness on reflection.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_175"></a><a name="07022757000319"></a>We are talking about cases of failure and underperformance that are demonstrated in inspection reports and are objective. We are not talking about any discretionary power to intervene that would undermine the proper autonomy and freedom of governing bodies of institutions that are running well to conduct that institution&#146;s affairs. I hope that the distance between us is narrower than the noble Baroness portrayed. She was presenting a great point of principle that I do not believe pertains. If she were sitting where I am and had to take decisions about institutions that are failing and therefore offering a substandard education to their students, I am not sure that she would see it so much in terms of the absolute principle that she has set out. </p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_176"></a><a name="07022757000320"></a>I understand that there are strong feelings because the powers, if exercised, are draconian. I would like to reassure the House that they would be used only in extremis. I would also like to speak to our Amendments Nos. 27 to 33 and 35 in this group, which, as the noble Baroness generously acknowledged, go some way to meeting the concerns set out in Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_177"></a><a name="07022757000321"></a>My amendments would ensure that the failure policy under which the Learning and Skills Council is operating is approved by the Secretary of State and laid before the House. We believe that there will be proper accountability for the overall policy under which the Learning and Skills Council acts in this area. It is already accountable to the Secretary of State for a comprehensive framework that includes quarterly ministerial reviews and a performance forum that charts progress against annual targets. As I stressed, the amendments that I am moving will, over and above that, require the Secretary of State formally to approve and to lay the statement of intervention policy before each House of Parliament, which will further increase transparency and accountability.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_178"></a><a name="07022757000322"></a>As the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, rightly said, cases of outright failure are extremely rare; nevertheless, we want to address more effectively and efficiently any such instances and those of inadequate provision. That is the reason for these powers. However, when it comes to intervening, in all cases the LSC will raise any concerns with the institution&#146;s chair of governors and college principal and agree an appropriate way forward. Regardless of the scale of concern, the LSC will issue a notification to the institution setting out the agreed action arising from the initial discussion and monitor progress against that notification. In more serious cases a formal notice to improve will be issued, specifying the required improvements and a timescale of no more than 12 months to secure them. We believe it is right that providers have the opportunity to improve before any formal intervention takes place. That is another stage that has to be gone through before the formal intervention powers set out in the Bill could take effect.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_179"></a><a name="07022757000323"></a>In cases of outright failure, where insufficient progress is made against the agreed improvement plan, and where the college is unable to demonstrate that it has the capacity and capability to bring about improvement, the LSC could consider the use of powers under Clause 17. Those powers might also be considered in exceptional circumstances where there is immediate and significant risk, such as fraud. The notice will specify any immediate action; for example, a direction to remove the chair of the governing body or to dismiss a specified senior member of staff. I stress, though, that the use of these powers must be relevant and appropriate in the given circumstances. The intervention policy that will be developed to set out the procedures will illustrate the circumstances when it would be appropriate to consider the direction to dismiss a senior office-holder.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_180"></a><a name="07022757000324"></a>I stress again that these powers will not be unfettered. As a result of the government amendments I have just spoken to, the Secretary of State must approve the intervention policy. He will also retain the power to direct the LSC itself, should that be necessary. In addition to these powers, the LSC continues to be accountable to the Secretary of State through the comprehensive accountability framework.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_181"></a><a name="07022757000325"></a>The judgment made on failure or unsatisfactory performance will not be imprecisely defined. The LSC&#146;s published intervention policy will make clear precisely what is meant in practice. The precursor to that document, <I>Identifying and Managing Underperformance</I>, which I have made available to noble Lords, refers to providers who have been awarded a grade 4 by Ofsted inspectors, which is the most unsatisfactory inspection grade, and to situations where an area of provision is deemed to be unsatisfactory or where the LSC&#146;s analysis of learner success rates shows that more then 25 per cent of provision falls below the minimum level of performance. The definitions we have in place now, as set out in the guidance document <I>Identifying and Managing Underperformance</I>, will, no doubt, be extensively debated during the consultation process that the LSC will be required to conduct as a result of government Amendment No. 29. We will take full account of the consultation undertaken as a result of that amendment.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_182"></a><a name="07022757000326"></a>We expect that, in the vast majority of cases where failure is identified under the procedures I have just set out, the governing body would take the necessary action to improve performance before any intervention was needed. The LSC would continue to work with the governing bodies and to respect their autonomy during that process. I also reassure noble Lords, and reiterate for the record, that the LSC would only be able to direct dismissal where the governing body already has the power to dismiss under its own articles of association, so the role of the LSC would be akin to that of a local authority in a case of extreme failure on the part of a school. The corporation of the institution, which is normally the governing body, being the employer of the staff in an FE college, would continue as the employer, and this would not change that relationship.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_183"></a><a name="07022757000327"></a>Where the LSC has invoked its power to direct a governing body to dismiss a member of staff, there will be a very clear evidence base for such a decision. That should provide sufficient evidence for governing bodies to successfully defend any claims of unfair dismissal under employment law. The Secretary of State&#146;s retention of the powers to direct the LSC where he is satisfied that it would be appropriate to do so is also important in this matter.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_184"></a><a name="07022757000328"></a>The noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, wished to press the principle of Clauses 17 and 18. I entirely respect her decision. However, on the point by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, if Clauses 17 and 18 remain in the Bill, we would be prepared to look sympathetically at her Amendment No. 26, which sets out a requirement for a further formal statutory process to be gone through. We would consider bringing back amendments at Third Reading to ensure that there is a further, formal statutory process whereby the principal of a college of further education has to be written to, along with the governing body, by the Learning and Skills Council. We would further require that that report must set out in writing, at the beginning of the process of intervention, the Learning and Skills Council&#146;s concerns.</p>

<a name="70227-0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_185"></a><a name="07022757000329"></a>I have given a good deal of reassurance about how these powers will be exercised. As I say, they are for cases of extreme failure. In that context, I hope that the House will feel able to continue to support Clauses 17 and 18.</p>

I welcome the Government&#146;s Amendments Nos. 27 and 33. The noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, asked a question that was also asked in Grand Committee, when he was not in his place. The Minister&#146;s reply was the same, and I will give the Minister the same response now: local authorities are elected bodies. That is our main objection to giving these powers to the LSCs&#151;they are not elected bodies. The Minister asked the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, whether she might think differently if she were sitting in his position. We accept that there are hard decisions to be made sometimes, but if I were sitting in the noble Lord&#146;s position when these hard decisions had to be made, I would much rather recommend to the Secretary of State that he or she made those decisions than leave them to the unelected learning and skills councils.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_205"></a><a name="07022768000016"></a>There have been many hours&#151;indeed, days&#151;of discussion in and outside the House on Clause 19. These government amendments reflect those long discussions. I hope that they will enable us to establish a consensus across the House and I thank all noble Lords who have helped us to find a good way forward, including both opposition Front Benches. Perhaps I may mention also John Hayes, from the opposition Front Bench in another place, my noble friend Lady Warwick and her colleagues in higher education, including many Members of this House, and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, who I know will speak after me to Amendment No. 43.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_206"></a><a name="07022768000017"></a>In our discussions, my honourable friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education and I have reflected on three issues in particular, in relation to which we are now proposing amendments to Clause 19. The first issue is whether further education institutions should be allowed to authorise other institutions to award foundation degrees on their behalf. The second issue is whether the use of the new foundation degree-awarding powers should be subject to scrutiny after a fixed period. The third is whether there should be a formal review of the effects of FE colleges awarding their own foundation degrees.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_207"></a><a name="07022768000018"></a>In all our discussions, the needs of learners and quality control have been paramount. We must take every precaution to protect not only the proud reputation of the UK&#146;s higher education brand, but also the prestige of the foundation degree both at home and abroad. We have worked closely with the Quality Assurance Agency in drawing up a draft criteria document, which has been made available to your Lordships. The document is a cornerstone of our rigorous quality assurance mechanism and will form the basis of the QAA&#146;s assessment of any further education institution in England applying for foundation degree-awarding powers.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_208"></a><a name="07022768000019"></a>The criteria are rightly stringent. They are based extremely closely on the existing standards for institutions applying for award-making powers, supplemented by additional criteria that are tailored specifically to the foundation degree qualification. These additional criteria include the requirement for an applicant institution to have no fewer than four consecutive years&#146; experience, immediately preceding the year of application, of delivering HE programmes at a level equivalent to the foundation degree.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_209"></a><a name="07022768000020"></a>It has been commented that the proposals will jeopardise existing relationships between further and higher education institutions and that this will in turn have adverse consequences for learners. I stress that there is no intention whatever of endangering existing partnerships, especially where these are working well. While some FE institutions will seek foundation degree-awarding powers because that will meet and respond to local demand from employers and learners and because the development of higher-level skills provision is at the heart of the institution&#146;s core skills mission, they will still want to maintain&#151;indeed, to develop&#151;their collaborative arrangements with higher education institutions. Others will want to maintain the existing validation arrangements in delivering foundation degrees because that arrangement suits the local demand. This is about choice. We regard all these different arrangements as being equally valid.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="07022768000103"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_210"></a><a name="07022768000021"></a>In this respect, we are entirely sympathetic to the spirit of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. We agree with his emphasis on the importance of the student voice and the need to ensure that the interests of learners are protected and promoted. Furthermore, we entirely share his desire to protect the excellence of the UK&#146;s higher education brand. The requirement to consult the student body will be written into the criteria that will form the basis of the Quality Assurance Agency&#146;s assessment of a further education institution that is applying for foundation degree-awarding powers. Paragraph 4B of the current draft of the criteria document states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64"></a><a name="07022768000099"></a>&#147;We propose that an application will not be considered unless the college has consulted its students about whether it should seek to acquire Foundation Degree Awarding Powers&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022768000083"></a>It is quite right that the views of the students are taken into account. Inserting this requirement into the criteria, which will be used to determine whether an institution should be recommended for foundation degree-awarding powers, is the most appropriate way of achieving that end and will secure the objective that was rightly set out by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_211"></a><a name="07022768000022"></a>We fully agree with the noble Lord&#146;s wish to ensure that transparent and articulated progression routes are available to all learners. This issue, too, is dealt with comprehensively by the draft criteria for foundation degree-awarding powers. Paragraphs 28 to 34 of Section 3 of that document set out the requirement for articulation agreements to be a core feature of all foundation degree programmes. Articulation agreements are the means by which students studying for a foundation degree can identify routes for progressing to further higher-level study, typically the completion of an honours degree, either at the institution awarding the foundation degree or elsewhere.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_212"></a><a name="07022768000023"></a>Furthermore, we have published <I>Foundation Degrees: Ensuring Progression</I>, a note that sets out the detail of how articulation arrangements currently work, how they are communicated to learners, and remedial actions that are available in cases where problems arise. This note will be incorporated into the next iteration of the criteria document, but, for now, it may be useful to expand on the main points.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_213"></a><a name="07022768000024"></a>Articulation agreements identifying progression routes for learners who wish to progress from a foundation degree to further higher-level study are a matter for institutions themselves. All foundation degree providers within the FE system currently have such agreements with providers of honours degrees and they will continue to do so regardless of whether they are awarded their own foundation degree-awarding powers. Therefore, Clause 19 will in no way diminish the importance placed on clear progression routes for learners.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_214"></a><a name="07022768000025"></a>The current arrangements work well, with institutions collaborating in the interests of their students. However, a safeguarding role is also played by the Quality Assurance Agency. The criteria that the QAA will use to assess an institution&#146;s application for foundation degree-awarding powers include, as I stated a moment ago, detailed guidance on the need for an applicant to demonstrate that it has identified and publicised,</p>
<ul><a name="07022768000101"></a>&#147;clear routes that facilitate opportunities for successful progression from Foundation Degrees towards another qualification&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07022768000084"></a>If an institution has not made adequate provision in this respect at the time of submitting an application for foundation degree-awarding powers to the QAA, it will not be able to satisfy the criteria and will not be recommended for the new foundation degree-awarding powers. Put quite simply, articulation agreements will be absolutely essential if a further education institution is to be recommended for foundation degree-awarding powers. It is also critical that both FE and HE institutions promote the articulation arrangements to their learners. Foundation degree students need to identify clear and viable progression routes should they choose to make their foundation degree a stepping stone to further higher-level study, which would typically be the completion of an honours degree. For this reason, the QAA benchmark statement, which will be incorporated into the criteria for foundation degree-awarding powers, clearly says:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65"></a><a name="07022768000100"></a>&#147;The identification of explicit progression arrangements should be available to learners on foundation degree programmes through course handbooks and prospectuses&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70227-0008.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_215"></a><a name="07022768000026"></a>I believe that the system delivers good articulation. There are clear incentives for providers in both sectors to offer progression and our proposals do not change these. Lifelong learning networks, which bring partners together to provide progression both into and through higher education, reinforce these incentives. If one looks at college and university prospectuses, one immediately notices the emphasis that is given to foundation degrees as a pathway to honours programmes, as well as a valuable qualification in their own right.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_216"></a><a name="07022768000027"></a>Both further and higher education institutions already promote these opportunities to their prospective students through course documentation, and it is in the interests of institutions, if they want to continue to attract students, to take a positive approach to advertising such opportunities. Furthermore, organisations such as lifelong learning networks and Foundation Degree Forward have an important role to play in clarifying and strengthening progression routes into and from foundation degrees. For example, Foundation Degree Forward produces best practice guidance for HE and FE institutions about the promotion of articulation to students.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_217"></a><a name="07022768000028"></a>When the QAA periodically returns to an institution to carry out an audit, it will again scrutinise the ways in which progression routes are identified and promoted to foundation degree students. If the institution is deemed inadequate in this respect, it will not achieve a judgment of broad confidence from the QAA. A judgment of limited confidence or no confidence would have serious adverse consequences for an institution&#146;s reputation and, for this reason, the self-regulating system that operates at present is effective and sustainable.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_218"></a><a name="07022768000029"></a>The amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, also raises the issue of whether an institution that is granted the new foundation degree-awarding powers should then be able to delegate those powers by authorising another institution to award foundation degrees on its behalf or to accredit another body to provide courses leading to a foundation degree. The Government have full sympathy with the intention behind this part of the noble Lord&#146;s amendment&#151;the desire to see that standards are maintained. These are concerns that I share. For this reason, as I shall explain, we have proposed Amendments Nos. 41 and 42, which address this issue.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_219"></a><a name="07022768000030"></a>Finally, we propose to give clear advice to the Privy Council that foundation degree-awarding powers should be granted for an initial time-limited period of six years. We do not believe that it would be appropriate for a further education institution applying for foundation degree-awarding powers for the first time to be granted those powers in perpetuity. Our recommendation is that the powers should be granted for an initial probationary period, which would allow the further education institution to establish a strong track record in the delivery of high-quality foundation degree programmes before it is given the power to continue awarding those degrees.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_220"></a><a name="07022768000031"></a>Once this probationary period has been completed to the satisfaction of the QAA, the institution may apply for the powers to be renewed. I should make it absolutely clear that it will not necessarily be a case of an FE institution having to reapply for its powers every six years; when the initial probationary period has been served and the QAA is satisfied with the institution&#146;s provision, its foundation degree-awarding powers can be granted indefinitely by the Privy Council. The noble Lord, Lord Dearing, suggested that a probationary period of four years rather than six should be time enough to determine whether all is well or whether problems have arisen. Your Lordships may be aware that, when we made it possible in 2004 for private providers of HE to obtain degree-awarding powers, we said that these powers should be awarded for periods of six years. We do not feel that a shorter period of award for high-performing further education institutions would be right in the light of this. I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, will be alive to that comparison.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_221"></a><a name="07022768000032"></a>We fully intend that, as well as the initial assessment by the QAA to ascertain whether they are competent to award their own foundation degrees, FE institutions that obtain foundation degree-awarding powers will be subject to an interim review during their six-year probationary period. In consultation with the QAA, which shares our view on the importance of regular quality reviews, we are considering when these interim reviews should take place.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_222"></a><a name="07022768000033"></a>Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 address the issue of whether FE institutions should be allowed to authorise other institutions to award foundation degrees on their behalf&#151;an issue that has been loosely referred to as &#147;franchising&#148;. I hope that these amendments will address the concerns raised in Grand Committee by the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Walmsley, my noble friend Lady Warwick and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. As I explained, it is envisaged that, when a FE institution first applies for powers to award foundation degrees, it will be granted these powers for an initial probationary period of six years.</p>

<a name="70227-0008.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_223"></a><a name="07022768000034"></a>Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 reflect the helpful advice that we have received from the QAA on this matter. Amendment No. 41 proposes to amend Section 76 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 so that the Privy Council has the power to specify, in an order granting a further education institution foundation degree-awarding powers, that the institution&#146;s power to grant foundation degrees does not include the power to authorise other institutions to do so on its behalf. We are seeking to place controls on FE institutions applying for foundation degree-awarding powers where their students undertake a significant proportion of their foundation degree provision at another FE institution that does not have those powers.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_224"></a><a name="07022768000035"></a>We considered best how to achieve this. We have opted for an amendment to Clause 19 and further changes to the criteria that the QAA will use to assess an application for foundation degree-awarding powers. Dealing with the matter entirely in primary legislation could leave us with an arrangement that lacked flexibility. For example, a statutory provision preventing further education institutions from awarding foundation degrees unless they had provided the majority of the course could restrict the ability of FE institutions with foundation degree-awarding powers to offer foundation degree courses that include a significant work-based element where training is provided by an employer. Foundation degrees are, by their nature, work-focused higher education qualifications that do not necessarily conform to any specific delivery model. Work-based learning and employer involvement in the design and development of foundation degrees is positively to be encouraged. I should it make clear that, whatever proportion of a foundation degree is taught in the workplace, responsibility for the quality of provision lies with the awarding institution.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_225"></a><a name="07022768000036"></a>We have therefore settled on Amendment No. 42, which amends Section 76 of the 1992 Act so that the Privy Council also has the power to specify in an order that the institution cannot grant a foundation degree to a person who was not enrolled at the institution at the time he completed the course of study for which the foundation degree is granted. This amendment should be considered in conjunction with further changes that we now propose to the criteria against which an applicant institution will be assessed. The QAA will not recommend an FE institution for foundation degree-awarding powers if that institution&#146;s foundation degrees are being taught largely by another FE institution that does not itself have those powers. This will be spelt out in the criteria that the QAA will use. I recognise that the draft criteria document that we published on 14 February does not fully reflect this point, and I undertake that the next version, which we intend to publish very shortly, will do so. I should add that in all this we are working closely with our advisers on quality in the QAA.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_226"></a><a name="07022768000037"></a>Until now, when degree-awarding powers have been granted under the 1992 Act, they have automatically included the power to authorise another institution to award degrees on one&#146;s behalf, and there has been no requirement that recipients of degrees from the institution with degree-awarding powers must be enrolled at that institution. The power to specify these restrictions in an order granting foundation degree-awarding powers will lie with the Privy Council. However, in advising the Privy Council, the Secretary of State will act on the basis that it is inappropriate, in the first instance, for an order granting foundation degree-awarding powers to a further education institution to permit the institution to authorise other institutions to award its foundation degrees, or for those foundation degrees to be awarded to students not enrolled at the institution with foundation degree-awarding powers. This is not a position dependent on the strength of any individual college&#146;s application. Rather, it is an acknowledgement that without this restriction there could be unacceptable risks to the perceived quality of the UK degree brand.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_227"></a><a name="07022768000038"></a>As we have made clear in the published draft criteria, our advice will be that the Privy Council, in the first instance, should grant foundation degree-awarding powers to an FE institution for a fixed period of six years. At that point, it will be open to the institution to apply to have the powers renewed. At that point in the process, the Secretary of State may decide to advise the Privy Council that, as well as being renewed, the powers should be upgraded to allow the institution to authorise other providers to award its foundation degrees, and to award foundation degrees itself to students enrolled elsewhere. By this time, the FE institution will have had the opportunity to establish a track record not only as a provider of higher education, which it must already have been in order to be considered for foundation degree-awarding powers, but also as a body able to award its own qualifications.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_228"></a><a name="07022768000039"></a>We believe that, by this time, it will be possible for the leading HE providers in the further education sector to be granted the full foundation degree-awarding powers, without risk to the immensely important UK higher education brand. However, if a college has completed its six-year probationary period and there is still concern about the reputational risks arising from the upgrade of its powers, there is no requirement for such an upgrade to take place.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_229"></a><a name="07022768000040"></a>It is conceivable that an FE institution might wish to enrol a student and then make arrangements for a significant proportion of that student&#146;s foundation degree provision to be delivered by another FE institution without powers to award foundation degrees. I stress that the representatives of colleges in the mixed-economy group have made it clear that this is not what they intend. I must be absolutely clear that an institution without foundation degree-awarding powers that was farming out its students in this way would not be recommended by the QAA for these powers.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_230"></a><a name="07022768000041"></a>Moreover, if a FE institution were granted foundation degree-awarding powers restricted to persons enrolled in the institution and were then found to be franchising out its foundation degree students, I would expect it to receive a limited confidence judgment in its QAA audit. In the event that, as would most probably be the case, those powers had been granted on an initial time-limited basis, the institution would certainly not successfully complete its probationary period and it would not be recommended for renewal of the powers. This will be made absolutely clear in the draft criteria against which applicant institutions will be assessed by the QAA. We intend to bring forward a further draft of the criteria document shortly, which will reflect this important change.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_231"></a><a name="07022768000042"></a>I should also make it clear that, once the QAA is satisfied that an FE institution is competent to exercise full foundation degree-awarding powers, it will be recommended to the Privy Council that the restrictions referred to in Amendment Nos. 41 and 42 be lifted. At that point, the FE institution will be permitted to use its foundation degree-awarding powers without any further restriction, just as higher education institutions with degree-awarding powers are currently able to do.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_232"></a><a name="07022768000043"></a>Amendment No. 44 addresses whether the use of the new foundation degree-awarding powers should be subject to scrutiny after a fixed period of time; that was another issue raised in our deliberations in Grand Committee. My honourable friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education and I have given careful consideration to the points made about this issue. We recognise that Parliament and the public have a strong interest in understanding the practical effects of the use of these powers. We all share a common interest in ensuring continuing confidence in the quality standards of foundation degrees, wherever they are awarded.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_233"></a><a name="07022768000044"></a>We propose, therefore, that the Secretary of State should be placed under a duty to lay a report before Parliament on the effects of Clause 19, which gives the Privy Council the power to grant FE institutions in England the power to award foundation degrees. This report, which is encompassed by Amendment No. 44, is to be laid within four years of Clause 19 coming into force. We believe that that is a further significant step towards meeting concerns raised in Grand Committee.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_234"></a><a name="07022768000045"></a>I have spoken at length because the issues involved are important and complex. We believe that the changes that we have made go a significant way towards meeting the concerns raised by noble Lords in Grand Committee and those encompassed by the amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. I commend them to your Lordships, and I beg to move.</p>

<p><a name="st_138"></a>
<a name="07022768000046"></a><b><a name="70227-0009.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07022768000112"></a>Lord Dearing:</b> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment No. 43, which is in this group. I am in the unusual position of listening to a 20-minute reply to amendments I have tabled but not argued for. I am most grateful to the Minister&#151;I am overwhelmed. If I may, I will take all four elements of my amendment. The first was that students must be consulted before an application is made for foundation degree-awarding powers. What the Minister said is excellent. It is a necessary condition for the award of powers that this consultation takes place. I take it that it is implicit in that provision that the outcome of that consultation will be notified to the QAA when it considers the application. I am well satisfied on that.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_235"></a><a name="07022768000047"></a>The final part of my amendment&#151;I will leave the two more difficult points until last&#151;concerns a review after four years. The Minister explained why he has gone for six years&#151;there is a precedent, but I have chosen another precedent for my four years. I am reassured, however, by the knowledge and his assurance that there will be an interim review after some unspecified period&#151;probably around three years. That means that he has gone a long way towards my view that there needs to be an early review. I am well content to accept what he has said.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_236"></a><a name="07022768000048"></a>I turn to the more difficult elements: one was franchising and the other was progression. On franchising, the Minister said that there has been some further thought about the information given in, I think, Section 8 of the notes that were circulated on 14 February. It provided that most of the learning had to take place in the institution that had the degree-awarding powers. He has now moved away from that to provide for those cases where much of the learning takes place in a company. I believe that there are a number of such cases where most, if not nearly all, learning takes place in a company. I think the Minister was saying that the &#147;most&#148; criterion now applies to an institution of further education that does not have degree-awarding powers. I can understand that, but I would like to read carefully what the Minister said. If a large proportion of, or &#147;most&#148;, learning is delivered in a company, I would be concerned if it were still permissible for some other part of it, say a quarter, to be delivered by a FE college without degree-awarding powers. I recognise that the Minister is making a substantial response to my amendment on this&#151;it is a case of looking at the detail.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_237"></a><a name="07022768000049"></a>I come finally to the issue of progression. I attach great weight to this for two reasons. First, because it concerns something worked for and paid for by a student in an FE college; it is called a foundation degree. We know now that 54 per cent of students progress from that to an honours degree. It is, therefore, essential to them that there should be this opportunity for progression. There should be no doubt about it that an FE college has a progression agreement with at least one higher education institution, and that the criteria should extend beyond bare existence of some such thing. It should be attainable, as an additional commitment to study, in some recognised, maximum period. One does not want to have to take two or three years to do the final year. I see in the notes that we were given that 1.3 years is regarded as a maximum&#151;that seems right.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_238"></a><a name="07022768000050"></a>I want to be absolutely clear about the intention of the Government. In his speech, the Minister said that the QAA has to be satisfied, at the time of submission, that the college has such an arrangement.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_239"></a><a name="07022768000051"></a>We know that there are 700 foundation degrees under development. That is at the moment, and there will be hundreds more as time progresses. I want to be absolutely clear that the requirement applies not only to those that were being offered at the time of the application but will apply to any that are offered by the college at any time in the future. That seems fundamental.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_240"></a><a name="07022768000052"></a>There is a second reason why I think this matter is important. The first reason was to do with a fair deal for the student. The second is to do with the assurance of quality. It is an assurance to me that the FE college must have an arrangement with an institution of higher education before it can offer a foundation degree. That seems to me a very important assurance that this foundation degree is of the nature of a degree in higher education in the United Kingdom. That is very important to every institution and to the nation given, as we recognised, the importance of the brand, which is not only worth billions of pounds a year in foreign exchange earnings but in attracting a good share of the ablest people in the world into our institutions. I see this as an assurance and one that I want to see going beyond the six years. As I understood what the Minister said, there will be a thorough check after six years, but thereafter it will be within the powers of the Privy Council to give an indefinite award. I want to be sure that when that happens, it is nevertheless a requirement that there should be an articulation arrangement with at least one university for every course; otherwise, the student will be short-changed and will be at risk.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_241"></a><a name="07022768000053"></a>I am concerned about this being a thin end of a wedge. Things do not stand still. As I recall, the polytechnics served an apprenticeship of 20 years to get their degree-awarding powers. Until then, they were under the guidance of the CNAA. But they got those powers. Now we have a situation in which it was decided that there should be foundation degrees, but from a university even though they are delivered by an FE institution. Now we are moving on to say, &#147;No, they will do it in their own right&#148;. I am concerned that we shall move on from that to say, &#147;Why should they not move to the full degree and become fully institutions in which a student can pursue the whole course in one place?&#148; I can see advantages in that, but it changes the mission of the further education colleges. I am deeply concerned that they should stay with their mission because they constitute an engine room for skills for the whole economy. It is a natural aspiration for people to want to move up market, but we need people who concentrate on the engine room rather than go on to the bridge; they drive the ship.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_242"></a><a name="07022768000054"></a>I am well content with what the Minister said on my amendment with regard to the students&#146; voice and the review. I listened to what the Minister said on the other two points. He has gone a long way to meet me. I should like to read precisely what he said on franchising; I hope to be fully reassured.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_243"></a><a name="07022768000055"></a>On my last point on articulation, which I saved to the end, this is an enduring concern which goes beyond six years. It is an issue on which I may ask the House to listen to me again at Third Reading.</p>
<a name="time_17"></a>
<a name="70227-0009.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="07022768000105"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="st_139"></a>
<a name="07022768000056"></a><b><a name="70227-0009.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07022768000113"></a>Lord Walton of Detchant:</b> My Lords, I can hardly believe that it is 14 years since the publication of the report of the Hamlyn Foundation&#146;s National Education Commission, which I was privileged to chair. At that time we were very concerned about a number of issues relating to higher and further education. There has been a series of major developments since that time which are to be warmly commended. One of the things that we recommended at the time was the establishment of learning and skills councils. We also recommended that there should be a progressive move to a greater degree of parity of esteem as between academic and vocational qualifications. The further education sector has done a wonderful job in those intervening 14 years in providing proper standards of vocational education for many individuals who would not otherwise have benefited from that kind of educational experience.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_244"></a><a name="07022768000057"></a>But it is fair to recognise that there is considerable anxiety&#151;which I know will soon be articulated by the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick&#151;in the university sector about the powers which this clause will now grant to further education colleges. The foundation degree launched in 2001 was always intended to provide a vocationally focused and academically rigorous route into higher education with built-in progression opportunities for foundation degree students who wanted to progress to honours degree level. There has been a rapid growth in foundation degree delivery, largely achieved through extensive and successful collaboration between higher and further education institutions. The universities have pointed out that more than 60,000 foundation degree students were registered by 2006 but that no university provided validation of those degrees without also providing tuition either directly or through a franchise agreement. The problem that I  see with this clause is that it is likely to break, or at least to have the possible effect of breaking, that crucial link. Many universities are concerned that progression to higher education will be adversely affected and that higher education institutions will have less incentive to articulate foundation degrees with honours programmes, thus undermining the excellent progress that has been made towards building ladders of progression through lifelong learning networks.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_245"></a><a name="07022768000058"></a>FE colleges do not currently have the power to award any other nationally recognised qualifications in their own right but only through recognised awarding bodies such as City and Guilds and BTEC. This clause will create an anomaly whereby FE colleges will be able to award HE-level qualifications but not those at FE level. Many HEIs have invested heavily in building collaborative relationships with FE colleges. These may be put at risk if they are in competition with each other over foundation degree programmes. I and many others who have a lifetime&#146;s involvement in the university sector have concerns about the whole principle articulated in Clause 19. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, put the case very well and was very persuasive but I still cannot overcome those reservations about awarding foundation degree-awarding powers to FE colleges, whatever work the Quality Assessment Agency undertakes before they are given that power. I have concerns about the principles in Clause 19.</p>

<p><a name="st_140"></a>
<a name="07022768000059"></a><b><a name="70227-0009.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07022768000114"></a>Baroness Morris of Bolton:</b> My Lords, I thank the Government, the Minister, and in particular Bill Rammell for the genuine efforts that they have made over the past few weeks to listen to our concerns and those of interested organisations and for coming forward with amendments to address these points.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_246"></a><a name="07022768000060"></a>There is no doubt that the government amendments improve Clause 19 considerably and address many of the concerns of Peers and outside groups. The draft guidance and explanatory material that the Government recently provided has informed and advanced the debate in many areas.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_247"></a><a name="07022768000061"></a>We are very happy that the Government have decided to accept our recommendation that a report is laid before Parliament four years after the powers in this clause are implemented. This will give us an opportunity to scrutinise whether these safeguards have been sufficient, and to consider whether more are needed, or whether the proposals we are looking at today are enough. That will also do much to reassure people that the Government&#146;s commitments on secondary legislation, which were given today and at other stages, are being effectively implemented. One of these ensures that the Privy Council will specify that further education institutions may only award foundation degrees for a period of six years before undergoing a comprehensive review by the QAA, prior to being considered suitable for awarding these powers in perpetuity. This review is critical and I would welcome any additional assurances that the Minister can offer on the rigour and thoroughness of the review. It is necessary to maintain the standards of foundation degrees and to ensure their continuing credibility in the eyes of students, employers and the higher education institutions that the students will, I hope, progress on to.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_248"></a><a name="07022768000062"></a>Similarly, we are glad that the Government have tabled amendments to allow the Privy Council to restrict the abilities of further education institutions to accredit foundation degrees in other institutions. This franchising of the accrediting power has caused real concern, because of the enormous damage it could do to the foundation degree brand in a short time. Again, the Government&#146;s reassurances that these powers will not be given until an institution has successfully completed its six-year review period will do much to restore faith in this clause.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_249"></a><a name="07022768000063"></a>However, there is still one point on which we do not believe the Government have fully appreciated the strength of feeling. It has already been mentioned in other speeches: the relationship between higher education and further education, and progression from one end to the other of a foundation degree. The Government have assured us that they understand that this is one of the principal motivations for students undertaking a foundation degree, and have given some assurances about the continuing importance of articulation agreements between higher and further education, in order to ensure a good fit between the courses. On these Benches, we do not believe that it is enough.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_250"></a><a name="07022768000064"></a>We fully support the principle behind proposed new subsection (6B) in the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, in his amendment on this clause. Putting the continuing progression from foundation degrees to honours degrees in the Bill is a necessary step for maintaining important relationships and to ensure the further success of foundation degrees. An unequivocal sign that a foundation degree is a higher education-level qualification, with commensurate standards of course content, teacher quality and the chance to convert the qualification into a level 6 honours degree, with the equivalent one more year of full-time study, is indispensable. Without this safeguard, this clause could still lead to the eventual development of two tiers of foundation degree, with those awarded by a higher education institution being considered more credible than those awarded by a further education college. This is something that must be guarded against at all costs.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_251"></a><a name="07022768000065"></a>To put a requirement for ensuring progression in the Bill will introduce nothing that the Government have not already committed to in secondary legislation, but will address one of the last serious concerns that we on these Benches, and many elsewhere, have. I hope that the Minister will be able to continue in the spirit of engagement with this debate, and will ensure us that he will consider this point and bring back an amendment that encapsulates this principle at Third Reading.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_252"></a><a name="07022768000066"></a>One of the great pleasures of debating this Bill has been speaking to many wonderful people whom we have in the further education sector. I have spoken to a number of principals, who say that you have to be aware that people going into foundation degrees are working, and studying part-time. Quite often, they will finish the foundation degree, probably be quite tired and therefore will not continue immediately. Or, because they have a foundation degree and work for a big company, they may be transferred elsewhere and not go back to the university where they had the original articulation agreement. It is important that those points are taken into consideration. I hope that everybody from the universities will recognise that. We are dealing with a very different kind of student, and it is important to encourage them as much as possible to go into higher education.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_253"></a><a name="07022768000067"></a>Although I understand the desire to consult students, there is some concern in further education colleges over which students will be consulted. Will it be those who are already doing foundation degrees, or those who are doing other things, but may think about going on to degrees? Will this consultation be binding on the council of governors? It is very important that when a further education college has gone to a great deal of work and effort to put something in place, it cannot be overturned at a whim by somebody who may not even consider going on to do a foundation degree.</p>

<a name="70227-0009.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_254"></a><a name="07022768000068"></a>I would also like the Minister to clarify something for the Association of Colleges&#146; sister organisation in Wales, fforwm. There was some confusion during the debate in the Welsh Assembly on this Bill as to whether Clause 26 was sufficient to allow the Welsh Assembly to enact similar legislation to enable Welsh colleges to award their own degrees. Although many Welsh Assembly Members thought that it would be, surely the Welsh Assembly has not been given the power to amend the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, and so has no ability to extend the Privy Council&#146;s remit to cover Welsh further education colleges. Is this the case and, if so, can the Minister explain why the Government have not thought it necessary to extend the same potential to Welsh colleges as they have to English colleges&#151;or, indeed, have they overlooked that?</p>

<p><a name="st_141"></a>
<a name="07022768000069"></a><b><a name="70227-0009.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07022768000115"></a>Baroness Warwick of Undercliffe:</b> My Lords, I rise to support Amendment No. 43, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and to welcome Amendments Nos. 41, 42 and 44, tabled by the Minister. In so doing, I declare my interest as chief executive of Universities UK.</p>



<page url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70227-0010.htm"/>


<a name="70227-0010.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_255"></a><a name="07022768000070"></a>Since the Bill was published I have greatly appreciated the way Ministers and noble Lords from across the House have been willing to engage in really constructive debate about how Clause 19 could be improved. I do not want, at this stage in our debate, to rehearse the reasons I gave at Second Reading for believing that the measures in Clause 19 are a mistake. We are where we are. I recognise that the real task before this House is to define the improvements to the Bill that will prevent unintended consequences, about which I&#151;and many other Peers&#151;have had concerns.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_256"></a><a name="07022768000071"></a>As the Minister said, the two issues that have become the focus of attention&#151;and which have been reaffirmed by virtually every speaker&#151;are addressed in Amendments Nos. 41 and 43, and relate to progression and the franchising of courses. I shall deal with franchising first. The Bill, as currently drafted, would give colleges that gain foundation-degree-awarding powers the right to validate courses delivered by other third-party institutions, both in the UK and abroad. The Minister has made some very welcome commitments on that front but, as I said earlier, further education colleges will be taking on primary responsibility for the quality and standards of their own foundation degree qualifications for the first time. To allow them to validate provision in third-party institutions at the same time would substantially increase the risks to reputation and quality management. The measures in Clause 19 already pose risks to reputation; therefore it is right to proceed cautiously.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_257"></a><a name="07022768000072"></a>It is clear from what my noble friend has said that the Government have accepted this. Indeed the Minister&#146;s amendment gives the Privy Council the power to exclude the right to authorise other institutions to grant awards on behalf of an institution newly in receipt of foundation degree-awarding powers. In the package of information published on 11 February it is made clear&#151;and the Minister reaffirmed this&#151;that the Privy Council will be advised to apply this restriction for the first six years only. As I understand it, at the end of that period a college will have to re-apply for foundation degree-awarding powers and the Privy Council will be encouraged to grant unlimited powers, both in terms of time and the right to franchise their courses.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_258"></a><a name="07022768000073"></a>I very much welcomed what my noble friend said in presenting his amendments. I can see why the Government have done this, but I do not, on reflection, believe that it goes far enough. The Government have made it clear from the outset that they envisage only a small number of colleges, which already deliver a large volume of foundation degrees and have substantial experience in this area, gaining these powers. I cannot believe that it was intended that the further education sector should, at any stage, be able to establish consortia whereby a small number of colleges validate foundation degrees in a wide range of partner colleges, effectively cutting universities out of the loop possibly across a whole region. That could happen; indeed, we have heard reports that that is already the intention of a group of London colleges.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_259"></a><a name="07022768000074"></a>The point is that this could increase the likelihood of the foundation degree becoming seen as a signature FE qualification, and yet the Government chose to call it a degree because they wanted the explicit link with universities. The evidence from Foundation Degree Forward confirms the importance of this for prospective students and employers. Welcome though the Minister&#146;s amendments are, as are his subsequent assurances, we need to go further and I support Amendment No. 43 of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, which would exclude in perpetuity the possibility of franchising by FE colleges.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_260"></a><a name="07022768000075"></a>On progression, the other major issue with which we have been dealing, other noble Lords have emphasised the importance of students on foundation degrees having concrete options for progression on to honours-level study. Again, the Minister helpfully outlined how the Government intend to ensure that progression arrangements remain a key component of foundation degrees. That is enormously welcome but, again, it does not go far enough. I hope that the Minister will be persuaded in particular by the arguments of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. They would make it a requirement that to successfully apply for foundation degree-awarding powers, a college must have secured agreements with at least one higher education institution to guarantee progression from all its foundation degrees to full honours level.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_261"></a><a name="07022768000076"></a>The Minister has said that that is already secured through the current requirements of the academic infrastructure and, therefore, putting such a detail into primary legislation would be unnecessary. However, given the importance of this issue, which others have emphasised&#151;and I can only reaffirm&#151;the strength of feeling on it, and that academic infrastructure could very easily be subject to change over time without reference to this House, it would be helpful to put the matter beyond doubt. If the Minister has no objection to the principle, which he has re-affirmed, that progression should be embedded in the criteria for gaining foundation degree-awarding powers, I hope that he will not object to making that explicit on the face of the Bill, as has been urged by the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, and the noble Lord, Lord Dearing.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_262"></a><a name="07022768000077"></a>Finally, and briefly, I welcome Amendment No. 44, which would ensure that the arrangements introduced by the Bill were subject to review after four years. I also welcome the statements in the material published by the Department for Education and Skills on 11 February to the effect that the draft criteria will be amended to time-limit the initial award of the new foundation degree-awarding powers to six years. Both steps seem eminently sensible.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_263"></a><a name="07022768000078"></a>I should like to record my thanks to the Minister for the way in which he has responded to our debates in Committee, has anticipated our arguments this evening and has given us further reassurances. We are making good progress and I hope that we can persuade him to go just a bit further on the issues of franchising and progression.</p>

<a name="07022768000079"></a><b><a name="70227-0010.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07022768000116"></a>Baroness Walmsley:</b> My Lords, we on these Benches have always supported the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and note with pleasure the Government&#146;s intentions in relation to most of the matters within it. The guidance published in advance of this Report stage has been helpful. Noble Lords will note that we on these Benches have not re-tabled our amendments which sought to restrict award-making powers to particular courses or departments, given that we have been convinced during our consultations since Grand Committee that any college which reaches the quality required by the Privy Council would have sufficient internal quality control procedures to ensure that such a college was not likely to put on the market a degree from a weak department. The market would sort that out, anyway.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_264"></a><a name="07022768000080"></a>On progression, I shall not reiterate what has been said by three noble Lords, but we share their concerns. I have a feeling that there will be some chat about this matter between now and Third Reading, and we might come back to it. I am particularly keen on the ban on franchising in new subsection (6C) of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing. We believe that the whole matter of degree-awarding powers is a major step that should be carried out with extreme caution&#151;a bit at a time and with appropriate safeguards. Therefore, we welcome Government Amendments Nos. 41 and 42 and the thought that the Government have put into making appropriate arrangements for work-based learning.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_265"></a><a name="07022768000081"></a>I note that new subsection (6D) in the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, is a sort of probationary period and I welcome the statement in the guidance that a college would have to be reviewed after six years, rather than four. It seems appropriate that the number of years should be consistent across the sector. But, from the point of view of the student, to have a foundation degree from an institution which, at the end of the probationary period, lost the power to award degrees, would call into question the validity of the degree that the student had already obtained. Is there any way of safeguarding the quality of that degree during the probationary period, should the institution not retain degree-awarding powers after the six-year period? Perhaps a mentor university could be appointed that could guarantee the quality of the degrees awarded during the probationary period.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_266"></a><a name="07022768000082"></a>In the interests of the student, some though will need to be given to that if that happens, because not every college will get through its probationary period and go on to be given powers to award foundation degrees in perpetuity. At least one or two could very well not make it, and we need to think about the degrees obtained by such students. Can the Minister consider that idea?</p>

<p><a name="st_143"></a>
<a name="07022772000002"></a><b><a name="70227-0010.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07022772000174"></a>Baroness Blackstone:</b> My Lords, like other speakers in this debate, I am grateful to my noble friend the Minister and to the Minister of State for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education for taking part in a number of conversations on how we might improve Clause 19. As the Minister knows, I am unhappy about the introduction of this change by the Government, but, as my noble friend Lady Warwick has said, we are where we are, the pass has now been sold and those of us who were against the principle now have to think about how we qualify the measure to ensure that damage is not done.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_267"></a><a name="07022772000003"></a>At this stage, we need to focus on the commitment made by the Government at Second Reading, which has not yet emerged in this debate, to limit the number of FE colleges that would gain power to validate their own foundation degrees. It was said that that would involve only a very small number of colleges of the highest quality. That seems to have been forgotten in this debate.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_268"></a><a name="07022772000004"></a>We have had much discussion this evening on ensuring progression, on which I wish to say more, because I share the concerns expressed by other speakers. As they have said, we need to proceed with caution, particularly on franchising, to which I wish to return, also. I also want to say a little more about the review, because I would like to learn more from the Minister about its precise nature.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_269"></a><a name="07022772000005"></a>So far, I am not convinced that we have anything to hold on to in ensuring that this power will not become exercisable by all, or nearly all, FE colleges. We need some minimum threshold for the number of students pursuing HE courses in further education colleges before they move to validating their own higher education programmes in the shape of foundation degrees. There needs to be a significant number of such students to provide an appropriate environment for them and the economies of scale necessary to provide the appropriate library, laboratory and IT facilities cost-effectively. However, I strongly welcome the Government&#146;s proposal for what is, basically, a six-year probationary period. It is a step in the right direction.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_270"></a><a name="07022772000006"></a>I am also glad to hear that further education colleges will not get the powers established by Clause 19 without having some articulation arrangements. However, there is no requirement in the Bill; as speakers from all sides of the House have made clear, that is what we need. Reiterating what others have said, I hope that the Government will come forward at Third Reading with an amendment that puts it in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_271"></a><a name="07022772000007"></a>Having worked closely with the Association of Colleges for some years, I hate to say this, but I find some of its briefing a little worrying. Of course, as the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Bolton, has said, many students who do foundation degrees do not want to progress to honours degrees, but many want to. The AoC also claims that, although some students may want to progress in another direction, they do not want to do honours degrees. Again, this is true; they may want to acquire professional qualifications instead. However, many universities are providing just such programmes to achieve professional qualifications, especially the post-1992 ones. There should be an articulation between foundation degrees and these sorts of qualifications, as well as appropriate honours degrees. I strongly support what others have said about the need for further thinking about this.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_272"></a><a name="07022772000008"></a>Given the Government&#146;s commitment to rigorous quality controls, it seems odd that further education colleges will not only be able to validate their own degrees but will eventually be able to validate the degrees of other institutions and form consortia of FE colleges to do that for them. That takes FE colleges away from their main mission of delivering level 2 and 3 qualifications to the many hundreds of thousands of young people and adults who need them to gain satisfactory jobs and to have worthwhile careers in our economy, where these skills are in all-too-short supply. I have to confess that I found it a little hard to follow everything that the Minister was saying about what is being put into the guidance. I feel that all the concerns that my noble friend Lady Warwick expressed are valid. Frankly, I do not think that we should ever give FE colleges the role of franchising. I do not think it is part of their mission to undertake such work.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_273"></a><a name="07022772000009"></a>I strongly support proposed new subsection (6D) of the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and Amendment No. 44, which the Government brought forward, for which I am grateful to them. However, such a review should be independent, and that should be provided in the Bill. It should not be done by civil servants in the Department for Education and Skills, however much I respect those officials. Will the Minister confirm that it is the intention that this review should be independent?</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_274"></a><a name="07022772000010"></a>Such a review should look at the impact of Clause 19 on FE colleges in a very general way. It should not simply be about the quality of foundation degrees. The review should look at the clause&#146;s effect on the mainstream work of further education, on the vocational programmes that they provide for adults and young people below level 4 and on important areas such as basic skills courses for adults. As the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, said, there is a long and rather sad history of post-school education institutions neglecting their lower-level work or even dropping it as soon as they are encouraged to start focusing on higher-level qualifications. Were that to happen, it would be a disaster for our FE college system and indeed for the nation.</p>
<a name="time_19"></a>
<a name="70227-0010.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="07022772000170"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_275"></a><a name="07022772000011"></a>Any review should also look at the clause&#146;s effect on universities. The Minister said that he did not think that existing partnerships would be endangered. I am puzzled as to why he thinks that they will not be, because&#151;this certainly would apply in my own institution&#151;were some of the FE colleges with whom we are in partnership to decide to validate their own foundation degrees, it would damage our partnership. They would float off to do it on their own. I am not sure what the basis of my noble friend&#146;s claim was. A review needs to look at the wider questions of the clause&#146;s effect on post-1992 universities. We must remember that those universities have invested a great deal of time, effort and resources into foundation degrees and in collaborating with the FE system. By encouraging further education colleges to become direct HE providers, rather than continuing with the well established system that we have&#151;which I think is working well, contrary to what some further education college principals have claimed&#151;we could well undermine those very universities in a quite deep and unfortunate way.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_276"></a><a name="07022772000012"></a>We have to be aware that the number of qualified students coming forward to fill places for foundation degrees and even for honours degrees is growing pretty slowly. There are now as many places to fill as there are qualified students to fill them. What do the Government believe will happen when the anticipated demographic downturn takes place? I have enormous sympathy with the vice-chancellor of Bolton University, who has argued that widening participation in higher education through FE may destroy the capacity base of widening participation universities such as Bolton to deliver the Government&#146;s agenda. Universities rightly have to compete to recruit students. I have nothing against that; it is absolutely fine. However, I question whether we should be introducing, developing or creating a divided market between FE and universities when demographic decline is predicted. FE colleges validating their own foundation degrees will understandably want to build their HE capacity. Who can blame them? This could lead to some new universities undershooting on their HEFCE contracts and having to be shored up by HEFCE, at considerable cost to the taxpayer. It could also, of course, lead to them being forced to make substantial redundancies, which will also add to the taxpayer&#146;s costs.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_277"></a><a name="07022772000013"></a>Surely what we want to see in our post-school educational system is a coherent system with clarity about the role of different institutions. Clause 19 reduces that clarity by muddling the roles of further education colleges and higher education institutes. At a time when we want to see the ambitious targets set by the Leitch report on intermediate-level qualifications being met by further education colleges, it encourages them to expand in a quite different direction. Moreover, it could leave some widening participation universities seriously exposed. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will agree that any future review, interim or final, will reach beyond the very important questions of quality, progression and franchising to these wider issues.</p>

<p><a name="st_144"></a>
<a name="07022772000014"></a><b><a name="70227-0010.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07022772000175"></a>Baroness O'Neill of Bengarve:</b> My Lords, do the Government object to putting in the Bill a provision stating that those FE colleges that have the power to award foundation degrees should have an articulation agreement with one or more HEI, to ensure that students who successfully complete the foundation degree are entitled to progress to an honours degree? That question goes to the heart of many of the worries. Although the Minister gave considerable assurances, I do not see that in his amendments and I wonder whether the Government object to putting that into the Bill.</p>

I dealt with virtually all the points raised&#151;I did not necessarily persuade noble Lords&#151;but I did present the Government&#146;s case, so I hope that the House will forgive me if I do not reply again to them. I want to go to the heart of the issues in the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, around which the debate has focused, and summarise where I think we are.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_278"></a><a name="07022772000016"></a>I took the noble Lord to say that he believed that we were broadly there on student voice, on a probationary period for further education colleges in being awarded degree-awarding powers in the first instance, and on franchising, subject to him studying carefully the long explanation that I gave on how the arrangements will work and the controls that will be in place. The fourth issue was articulation agreements, in respect of which I believe that we have in place the most robust requirements in what we will say in the QAA&#146;s draft criteria document, which I shall make available to noble Lords shortly. However, I hear all the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, and others, and undertake that my honourable friend the Minister for Further and Higher Education and I will consider them further to see whether it might be advantageous to have something in the Bill when we come back on Third Reading.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_279"></a><a name="07022772000017"></a>The review after four years was warmly welcomed on all sides. My noble friend Lady Blackstone asked whether it would be independent and whether the scope could be broadened. I undertake that we will consider both those issues, and I will return to the House on them later.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_280"></a><a name="07022772000018"></a>The only other point on which I think I should respond now is that of Wales; having not been able to give an answer in respect of Wales earlier, I certainly do not feel that I can let it pass a second time. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, asked whether Clause 26 would be wide enough to allow the National Assembly for Wales to pass measures similar to Clause 19. The answer is no. She is correct that Westminster would need to legislate for that to be possible, unless an Order in Council were made to give the National Assembly the measure-making power. However, it is not the policy of the National Assembly to take that power at present, so the issue does not arise.</p>

<a name="70227-0010.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_281"></a><a name="07022772000019"></a>On that basis, I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Dearing, will feel able not to press his amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"></a><a name="07022772000036"></a>The noble Lord said: My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 51 to 55 and 58 to 66. Current practice is for industrial training boards to submit proposals for levy orders annually&#151;indeed, we debated two orders only last week&#151;but levy rates have remained unchanged for a number of years. Consequently, Clause 24 amends Section 11 of the Industrial Training Act 1982 so that, where an industrial training board wishes to raise a levy, it must, subject to some exceptions, submit levy proposals covering a three-year period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"></a><a name="07022772000037"></a>Schedule 1 makes amendments to other provisions in the 1982 Act in consequence of the changes to a three-year levy order model. Schedule 2 repeals certain provisions of the 1982 Act in consequence of the changes to be made by Clauses 23 and 24. Those proposed changes were welcomed in Grand Committee. The proposals are of a purely technical and drafting nature. They make some minor adjustments to the drafting of Clause 24 and the consequential amendments to the 1982 Act, to ensure that the drafting is consistent overall and that all the necessary consequential changes have been made. I stress that the changes do not alter the intended effect of Clauses 23 or 24 or the consequential amendments made to the 1982 Act. I beg to move.</p>

The Minister will probably have guessed that this is a probing amendment. It relates to concerns that have been voiced at earlier stages in our debates by, among others, the noble Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree, and my noble friend Lord Carlile. It reflects a concern about people who may lack capacity and be discharged from hospital, perhaps into a residential or nursing home, and who may at that point be incapacitated, temporarily or for a longer duration.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_305"></a><a name="07022772000055"></a>The purpose of the amendment is simply to establish whether the Bournewood provisions would apply to people in that situation. It would be enormously helpful if the noble Baroness could simply address that question tonight. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="07022772000056"></a><b><a name="70227-0011.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07022772000189"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs (Baroness Ashton of Upholland):</b> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for being extremely succinct and for representing the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, in her usually efficient and effective manner. I shall address precisely the points that she has raised.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_306"></a><a name="07022772000057"></a>I say at the outset that the policy is that everyone should be assessed by a doctor and at least one other professional. The draft regulations are framed so as to require the doctor involved to have special experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorder. One element in what the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, is seeking is that that would include, for example, the expertise to identify when physical causes were impacting on a person&#146;s mental presentation, which might lead to the sort of temporary incapacity that the noble Lord wanted us to refer to, as the noble Baroness did on his behalf.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_307"></a><a name="07022772000058"></a>I am confident that the safeguards that we have will cover temporary incapacity. While the person lacks capacity, they will be able to be covered by the Bournewood safeguards. The assessors will have the ability to diagnose mental disorder and to recognise when a person&#146;s lack of capacity is likely to be temporary. It is critical that we give people the right training and ensure that they have the right qualifications and experience.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_308"></a><a name="07022772000059"></a>However, because we are setting the period of authorisation on a case-by-case basis, we can ensure that the authorisation is able to be short. The review must be triggered by the home or hospital if there is a change; for example, if the person regains capacity or is clearly moving in that direction. Of course, the representative can also trigger a review if all else fails. I shall always keep the code under review and will look again to ensure that it identifies that as fully as possible. But I hope that I have assured the noble Baroness about the safeguards and that I have given her the explanation that she is looking for.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_311"></a><a name="07022772000064"></a>As noble Lords are aware, as things stand, most of the regulations relating to deprivation of liberty assessments must be made under the affirmative resolution procedure. However, the Mental Health Bill provides that some regulations relating to the deprivation of liberty assessment procedure are to be made under the negative procedure; namely, prescribing the period or periods within which assessors must carry out assessments; prescribing any information that a best-interests assessor must provide to an eligibility assessor; and modifying the usual deprivation of liberty assessment procedure when the supervisory body and managing authority are the same; for example, when a local authority provides a care home.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_312"></a><a name="07022772000065"></a>The aim is to make things easier for everyone, and supervisory bodies in particular, in that they will be able to access all the regulations relating to deprivation of liberty assessments in one place. Where the assessment regulations are made in one set, as will be the case under this amendment, they will all be subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny for England&#151;that is, the affirmative procedure. In Wales, the regulations will be subject to equivalent procedures by the National Assembly for Wales. I beg to move.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70227-0011.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_316"></a><a name="07022772000070"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we return to a subject that we debated in Committee. Anyone who has read the record of our proceedings will know that the matter is, in essence, fairly straightforward; namely, whether it is right for a person who has been deprived of his liberty to have to pay for the period in which he is subject to authorised detention. I think it would be entirely accurate to reflect our Committee stage by saying that we on these Benches feel that that would be wholly wrong and that the Government are of a different view.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_317"></a><a name="07022772000071"></a>There are two reasons for bringing this matter back. The first is to underline its importance. We are talking about people in care homes and hospitals who are not free to leave and who are therefore unable to remove themselves from the situation. They are being detained and having to pay for it, and, in our view, that is simply wrong. It places them in a unique position in that they are unequal to anyone else who is lawfully detained.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_318"></a><a name="07022772000072"></a>The detention is subject to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as is detention under the Mental Health Act. Article 14 prohibits unjustified discrimination in the application of the other articles, including Article 5. There is not necessarily any difference between people who are detained under Bournewood provisions and people in the same accommodation who are looked after under Section 117 of the Mental Health Act. They may both lack capacity, be compliant and have a mental disorder or disability and need residential care&#151;perhaps a high level of care&#151;and they can both be subject to legislation in their own interests; yet one person would be charged for being there and another person would not.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_319"></a><a name="07022772000073"></a>Not surprisingly, this point was picked up by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its report on the Bill. The committee states at paragraph 91:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_103"></a><a name="07022772000157"></a>&#147;In our opinion, to charge someone for accommodation in which they are deprived of their liberty potentially engages civil rights and obligations, and therefore the right of access to a court to determine those rights under Article 6 of the Convention. There is a potential discrimination for the purposes of Articles 5 and 6 and Article 14, in that a person deprived of their liberty in their own best interests in a hospital will not be charged for the detention whereas a person deprived of their liberty in their own best interests in a care home will&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"></a><a name="07022772000074"></a>The two other points that I wish to raise were matters that we did not get a chance to talk about on the previous occasion because we were rather hurried. I refer to the purpose behind the amendment. In her reply to me last time round, the noble Baroness said that, if we were to make the change that I was suggesting so that such care was free, there would be a perverse incentive for relatives to ensure that their relatives came under the Bournewood provisions in order to evade paying for the care. I am not wholly convinced by that argument. I can see why the Minister made it, but our reason for bringing forward the amendment is to get relatives and everyone else to look at the standards of the care packages that are provided for people who lack capacity.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_321"></a><a name="07022772000075"></a>My second point concerns the status of independent care homes. This time, the amendment would ensure that, when a person was deprived of his liberty, the supervisory body would make the arrangement and contract with the care home. The provisions to safeguard the Bournewood-type patients throw into stark relief the fact that residents in independent care homes are not protected by the Human Rights Act in the same way as patients in hospitals or residents in local authority homes. That is because independent care homes are not considered to carry out public functions. It seems rather irrational that a care home manager in one establishment can identify a potential deprivation of liberty and yet such deprivation may be treated completely differently elsewhere because the place in which it is happening is not deemed to be carrying out a public function.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_322"></a><a name="07022772000076"></a>For those good reasons, I thought that I would again try to persuade the Minister to think about the matter and perhaps to persuade her colleagues that there may be a bit more at stake here than simply public finance. I beg to move.</p>

I agree that it is very important that relatives and friends take the trouble and time to ensure they are content with the packages of care provided in care homes, wanting them to be of the highest possible standard. From her experience of chairing a health authority, the noble Baroness will know how important it is that those who may be extremely vulnerable get the highest quality of care. We are fortunate in the quality of care that many of our elderly people enjoy. Nonetheless, we must be extremely vigilant.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_323"></a><a name="07022772000078"></a>As the noble Baroness would expect, I looked very carefully at the Joint Committee on Human Rights report published on 4 February. There is a bit of confusion in the report on which I need to get back to the committee. It refers to Article 6, which concerns the right to fair trial. As the noble Baroness will know, that is not linked to the process of means testing to determine the extent to which someone contributes to the cost of their care in a care home. Access to justice, to a court, to challenge a deprivation of liberty authorisation is provided for with non-means tested legal aid available for the purpose. I just wanted to put that on the record.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_324"></a><a name="07022772000079"></a>The NHS body or local authority that authorises the deprivation of liberty may well also be involved in commissioning care arrangements, but it will not always be so. As the noble Baroness said, where private arrangements have been made between family and a care home, the situation will be different. We do not consider, having provided additional safeguards to protect human rights of people who are unable to consent to arrangements for their care, that that is a reason of itself to alter the arrangements to apply commissioning and funding of health and social care for individuals.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_325"></a><a name="07022772000080"></a>NHS care and treatment is free at the point of delivery, but major implications of providing free care and treatment would arise in relation to care homes. People receiving those new safeguards will largely be those with severe learning difficulties or older people with severe dementia or similar problems. Many such people will be living in residential care settings and any financial contribution that they make is determined by the national policy of means testing.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_326"></a><a name="07022772000081"></a>For some individuals, the need to ensure their safety may have led to greater restrictions in their best interest which amount to what has been described as a deprivation of liberty. But I emphasise&#151;I want to say this very clearly&#151;that if a person is in a care home and subject to a standard authorisation to deprive them of their liberty, that can be only because an independent assessor has said that it is necessary in their best interests to keep them safe. That is a critical part of why the provisions are so important in the context of the Mental Capacity Act. It is part of their care package to ensure that they are safe and well cared for that an element of deprivation of liberty must take place, but the safeguards to protect human rights are now built into the Bournewood provisions.</p>

<a name="70227-0011.htm_para38"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_327"></a><a name="07022772000082"></a>Because of that, we do not believe that that should lead to changes in how their care is commissioned and funded. We think that it would provide unacceptable inequities between those care home residents who are deprived of liberty and those who are not. In many cases, deprivation of liberty does not result in someone being unable to do many things. It may be a deprivation of liberty only in certain circumstances: for example, when they need to eat or in the evening, if they are prone to wander. That is a very different set of circumstances from that which might prevail under mental health legislation.</p>

This series of government amendments will give family and friends or any other concerned person a way to trigger the safeguards if they think that a person is being deprived of liberty and that hospital or care home managers are failing in their duty to seek authorisation.</p>

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_331"></a><a name="07022772000088"></a>I pay tribute to noble Lords who raised this in Committee and draw the attention of noble Lords to the role that stakeholder organisations are playing in helping us to get this very difficult policy right. That helpful and constructive dialogue over the past few months has been very valuable. I put that on record and state that the amendment is intended to address one of the concerns that they have rightly raised with us.</p>

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_332"></a><a name="07022772000089"></a>In Committee, the noble Earl, Lord Howe, and the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, made the point that the safeguards would be further improved if action could be taken to initiate the authorisation process by someone other than the hospital or care home managers when there is concern that a person is deprived of liberty. I thank them for raising that matter and thank the noble Lord, Lord Rix, who would have raised the matter had he been well enough to be with us in Committee, but who raised it in spirit none the less.</p>

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_333"></a><a name="07022772000090"></a>I undertook to take the matter away and consider whether we could achieve that without, as noble Lords will remember from our discussion, blurring the issue of who should have statutory responsibility for obtaining an authorisation if a person needs to be deprived of liberty to provide high quality care in their best interests. I think we were all agreed that that duty must rest with the hospital or the care home managers. I remain convinced that the best route to follow in such cases is to take the matter up with the care home or hospital in question. They can and, in most cases, would then apply for authorisation. Sometimes, they might be able to allay the concerns of relatives or friends. There may be a relevant order of the Court of Protection or an authorisation in place of which the individual querying the matter is not aware.</p>

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_334"></a><a name="07022772000091"></a>I recognise that family and friends would be in a stronger position if it was known that they could take a straightforward step to make sure that a person was assessed. The amendments provide exactly that. They will enable anyone to take action if they have not been able to sort out the matter by asking the care home or hospital to apply for authorisation. They can apply to the supervisory body, which will appoint a best interests assessor to consider whether a person is in fact deprived of liberty. An IMCA will be appointed if there is no one among friends and family to consult. If the assessor identifies that an unauthorised deprivation of liberty is taking place, the full assessment process will go ahead as if an authorisation had been applied for. If the care home or hospital considers that the care plan needs to continue while the assessments are carried out, it will have to issue an urgent authorisation and obtain a standard authorisation with seven days. The amendments would not affect the right to apply to the Court of Protection to hear the case.</p>

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_335"></a><a name="07022772000092"></a>I am confident that the amendments achieve my aim, which is to ensure that clarity remains about the duty of care homes or hospitals to apply for authorisation if it may be needed. Concerns about deprivation of liberty are dealt with, first, by the care home or hospital concerned. If someone thinks that a person may be deprived of liberty unlawfully, an assessment can be triggered. I hope that noble Lords will welcome and accept the amendments.</p>

If I had told them that I would one day be understudy to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, I think that they would have called the doctors. Today, it is my privilege to be the noble Lord&#146;s understudy. I will try to do him justice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_336"></a><a name="07022772000094"></a>I pay enormous tribute to him. Although he has not been part of our debates, he has worked so hard behind the scenes to plug away at these issues, which are most important. I join the noble Baroness in sending the best wishes of the whole House to him.

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_337"></a><a name="07022772000095"></a>Those of us who had the privilege to take part in deliberations on the Mental Capacity Bill thought about and discussed long and hard the role and involvement of relatives in many decisions on behalf of people who do not have capacity. Often, rightly, we decided that relatives should not play a role. This time, we are absolutely right to say that they should and to exercise that tremendous safeguard for people who are enormously vulnerable because they are deprived of their liberty, as happened in the case that went to the European Court. The noble Baroness rightly identified all the things that matter to them, such as having access to information and the requirement that once a deprivation has been noted, it must be registered in a number of places. On my behalf and that of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, I thank the noble Baroness very much for that.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"></a><a name="07022772000098"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, we return to a matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and others in Committee and one on which we still have to find agreement. The amendment is pretty straightforward; it states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_107"></a><a name="07022772000161"></a>&#147;The maximum length of an initial authorisation [for a deprivation of liberty] must not exceed six months, and the maximum length ... must not exceed 1 year&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022772000117"></a>A large percentage of the people to whom these provisions will apply will be the elderly in residential care. Many older people in residential care are extremely frail and their conditions change over time, although they can change quite rapidly. For that reason, permitting the deprivation of liberty for a year seems to us too long a period for it to persist. Therefore we are making one more attempt to get the noble Baroness to agree that the noble Lord, Lord Rix, and I are right in seeking a period of six months for an initial deprivation. I beg to move.</p>

The noble Baroness will know that I have met representatives from a number of organisations who raised this issue with me. I thank them for their time and consideration in coming in to talk to me about it. I am not going to go as far as the noble Baroness wants, but I hope that in what I am able to say, she will be given enough comfort perhaps to offer me half a thank-you on behalf of herself and the noble Lord, Lord Rix.</p>

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_340"></a><a name="07022772000100"></a>I agree completely with the principle lying behind all the noble Baroness has said: we want to deprive people of their liberty only for the shortest time possible. My first point is that that will be made perfectly clear in the code and training materials; it is absolutely essential. That is why we are setting the authorisation period on a case-by-case basis on the best interests assessor&#146;s recommendation, which will be based on the person&#146;s best interests in the particular circumstances and the likelihood of change. I will add material to the code stating that authorisation should be recommended for 12 months only if the assessor was confident that there is unlikely to be a change in the person&#146;s circumstances within that period. There will be people&#151;noble Lords will be able to think of them&#151;about whom we can be sure that that is the case. The noble Baroness has expressed concern that people should not reach for the ultimate ability to go to 12 months when a shorter period would be better. The point was also made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, in Committee.</p>

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_341"></a><a name="07022772000101"></a>The review and Court of Protection safeguards mean that if the deprivation of liberty is no longer needed, it can and will be ended. We will make sure that information and support is provided for families and carers to ensure that they can be effective in helping their loved ones to make use of these safeguards, and we shall discuss that support later this evening. I am therefore confident at this stage that we are putting in place everything required to deliver our aim of making sure that the deprivation of liberty does not continue longer than it has to. There will be no default to 12 months, so I do not support reducing the maximum period specified in the Bill because I do not want to have unnecessary assessments taking place. They would merely divert resources from frontline care. The noble Earl, Lord Howe, said in Committee said that we could not have it both ways. I could not say that the case would not arise for all that many people and then argue that it is a resource problem. The truth is that however many cases arise&#151;I hope that there will be few, but there will be some&#151;it is nevertheless still a resource issue, although I agree that it is not a huge one.</p>

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_342"></a><a name="07022772000102"></a>I also do not want people or their families disturbed and unsettled in circumstances where it is quite clear that there will be no change, but I accept that providing a period of 12 months with no ability to change it does create an issue if I am proved to have been inaccurate in my assessment, or indeed if a period of six months was not correct, or that over time it is considered that we ought to be able to settle on another period. So I will ensure that when the Bill goes to another place, a power is taken in England and Wales to reduce&#151;and only to reduce, not to increase&#151;the maximum period at a future date if monitoring of the operation of the safeguards convinces the Government that this is necessary. The monitoring body will report to the Secretary of State and will include these statistics. That will be published and made available in the Libraries of both Houses, so the specific information gathered by the body looking at this issue will be put in the public domain. If that information leads to the conclusion that we need to amend the period of 12 months down to a lower figure in order to address anything that may have arisen, the power will be in place to do so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"></a><a name="07022772000108"></a>At this stage I do not wish to restate the many points we have made throughout our consideration of this Bill and the Mental Capacity Bill about advocacy being the cornerstone on which the whole matter rests. When a person lacks the capacity to consent to their care and treatment, they are likely to need support in expressing their views. While it is right that some of the representatives I have cited in that list may have the capacity to act as an advocate for a person, they may not truly be capable of acting as an advocate for the person&#146;s welfare as opposed to, say, their financial circumstances. That is the reason for specifying the list and providing that a person should have access to an advocate during the assessment process.</p>

Let me start with when someone is being assessed. We have made sure that there is a professional appointment who is independent of the provider and the decision-maker about their care. His role is to establish and report on what is in their best interests. We call them the best interests assessor, the job title fits the job and that is what they have to do. They are required by law to take into account the views of all the people listed within the amendment. They have to have the skills to communicate with those people and to help them input their views.</p>

I do not want to go so far as saying that we need the support of an IMCA at that point, unless there is no one available to consult. We want the best interests assessor to approach interviews with friends and family from the viewpoint of the best interests of the person who may be deprived of their liberty, which may not always be the same as the interests of the family. It will be in many cases but it will not always be. That is as it should be. Introducing an IMCA to help and support the family could shift the balance, and what we are interested in at that moment is the best interests of the person being assessed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"></a><a name="07022772000112"></a>The families tell us often that what they really need is information. We want to make sure that families understand and are provided with information about the safeguards, about how to be involved and who to speak to in their case, and we will be working with service users and families to make sure that we get that right. Once an authorisation is granted, the role of the best interests assessor falls away and we are extremely sympathetic to the point that was made in Committee and has been made by organisations that I have met&#151;that a family member or friend who is acting as a representative could not have a level playing field of having access to quality advocacy support. We are going to do something about that: as my noble friend Lady Royall said, we are looking at advocacy more generally and coming back to it in another place. I would like to add that into that mix because in a sense it is about the same issue, but we will do so and make sure that we have advocacy support available to families and friends during an authorisation and beyond in the way that the noble Baroness would expect. I hope that on the basis that the cup is half full she will withdraw her amendment. </p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"></a><a name="07022783000002"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, this amendment would impose a duty to give information about unauthorised deprivation of liberty. It would place in the Bill the Government&#146;s amendment in the draft code of practice&#151;here I foreshadow a debate that we will move on to in a few minutes&#151;that the supervisory body should inform certain people of the fact that a request for an authorisation was turned down. It would place in the Bill the Government&#146;s proposal in the code of practice that the supervisory body commissioning the care must do so in a way that makes it possible for the managing authority to provide the care in accordance with the outcome of the assessment process.</p>

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_352"></a><a name="07022783000003"></a>In addition, the amendment seeks to ensure that there is a mechanism for identifying cases where a managing authority has failed to provide the care in accordance with the outcome of the assessment process and for referring such cases to the relevant inspection body. I can guess what the Minister will say about the status of the code of practice and matters being placed on the face of the Bill, but we are talking about the detention of people and the deprivation of liberty; we are talking about people who are particularly vulnerable in that they lack capacity. In comparable situations in which people are detained, the force of statute is often brought to bear. We on these Benches believe that there is an equivalence and that therefore the matter should be enshrined in the Bill.</p>

<a name="70227-0012.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_353"></a><a name="07022783000004"></a>While we recognise that it may be unnecessary to inform an inspection body every time an authorisation is turned down, we believe that it should be informed if the supervisory body has any concerns that someone is still being deprived of their liberty when it has been decided that that deprivation is not in the person&#146;s best interests. The supervisory body is the most appropriate body to fulfil the role of monitoring the situation and reporting any concerns to the relevant inspection bodies. That in a nutshell is the reason for the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="07022783000005"></a><b><a name="70227-0012.htm_spnew12"></a><a name="07022783000090"></a>Baroness Ashton of Upholland:</b> My Lords, let us begin from the principle that, if an application is made for an authorisation of deprivation of liberty and it is not granted, the deprivation of liberty should not take place, as it would be unlawful. We consider it extremely unlikely that any managing authority would recognise and comply with a duty to request an authorisation of a potential deprivation of liberty and then go ahead with an unlawful deprivation of liberty if the authorisation was not granted, particularly&#151;this is an important safeguard&#151;as the outcome would be known by the commissioner of the care, by the friends, by the family, by the person concerned and by any IMCA who was involved.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_354"></a><a name="07022783000006"></a>The first two sub-paragraphs of the amendment do the same as the current paragraph 58. My difficulty comes with what follows in sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), because it does not work. They assume that if the authorisation has been turned down the reason is that the proposed care is not in the person&#146;s best interests, but that might not be the case; for example, the assessor might have concluded that the care being suggested would not of itself be a deprivation of liberty, in which case authorisation could not be granted and would not be needed. They might decide that the use of the Mental Health Act needs to be considered. They might decide that the person does not have a mental disorder or that the person has the capacity to consent.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_355"></a><a name="07022783000007"></a>The sub-paragraphs assume and indeed require that the person will continue to be cared for by the managing authority that made the application, but that may not be in the person&#146;s best interests. If authorisation is not granted, decisions will need to be made about how to avoid the deprivation of liberty. The assessor&#146;s report will inform the decision, but there are likely to be a number of options. The person may need to be in a different care home or in hospital. The person may remain in the same place but the care plan may need to be reviewed or a proposed restriction not instituted. The person may remain in their own home.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_356"></a><a name="07022783000008"></a>The commissioning and the care planning decisions will have to be taken in the person&#146;s best interests, as we have already discussed, with the views of families, carers and friends taken into account. Our difficulty is that we are dealing with many varied circumstances. I have tried briefly to illustrate some of them. Undoubtedly, cases and circumstances will arise that I have not outlined and we cannot foresee, and the difficulty is that we cannot define in statute what should happen in every case. That is why we have taken the choice to address the issue of what should happen when authorisation is turned down in the code of practice.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_357"></a><a name="07022783000009"></a>I will read a little bit:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_118"></a><a name="07022783000051"></a>&#147;The managing authority is responsible for ensuring that they do not deprive a person of their liberty without an authorisation. The commissioners of care are responsible for ensuring that the care package is commissioned in compliance with the Bournewood safeguards. The action they will need to consider if a request for an authorisation is turned down will depend on the reason why the authorisation has not been given&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<a name="70227-0013.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_358"></a><a name="07022783000010"></a>We then give examples, some of which I have indicated. The monitoring of the safeguards that we will establish will be a further protection against unlawful deprivation of liberty. We also state in the code that the supervisory body should consider alerting the monitoring body if it is concerned that unlawful deprivation of liberty will not be avoided.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_359"></a><a name="07022783000011"></a>On the basis that there are so many different circumstances and that the code, which has statutory effect, will tackle that effectively, we believe that there is nothing between the noble Baroness&#146;s objectives and mine, but that we need to tackle this issue in the way that I have suggested. I hope that she will feel able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_360"></a><a name="07022783000013"></a>When the Minister was going through her examples, I was not sure exactly how the assessments could be made. There would have to have been a level of concern in order for a question of authorisation to have been raised, only for there to be the result that a person should either move to another care home&#151;and how would they do that?&#151;or remain where they were. That said, I understand what she says about the need to retain some flexibility, and therefore at this stage I will not press the matter, having raised it. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

These amendments enable us to increase our ability to prescribe the training and skills of assessors. Schedule 6 to the Mental Health Bill provides for the insertion of Schedule A1 into the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Part 9 of Schedule A1 contains provisions about assessments under the schedule. Included within Part 9 is a power to make regulations about the selection and eligibility of people to carry out assessments under the schedule.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_364"></a><a name="07022783000019"></a>The Bill, as currently drafted, states that the regulations may make provisions about the qualifications and experience of assessors. We would like to widen the regulation-making power to enable the Secretary of State and the National Assembly for Wales to specify training that assessors must have undertaken in order to be qualified to carry out the various deprivation of liberty assessments, and the skills that assessors must have. For England, we will develop training modules that will link to the Mental Capacity Act training programme and a competence framework for deprivation of liberty assessors that will be consistent with competences being developed for professionals fulfilling similar roles under the Mental Health Act. With regard to Wales, this will be a matter for the National Assembly for Wales and the regulations prepared by it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"></a><a name="07022783000025"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Rix, again, the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe. This government amendment strengthens the arrangements for dealing with a case where deprivation of liberty is not authorised because it is not found to be in the person&#146;s best interests but the best-interests assessor reports that the person is in fact already being deprived of their liberty.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_369"></a><a name="07022783000026"></a>The safeguards that are already in the Bill are as follows. The person concerned, the care home or hospital, any IMCA involved and all interested parties consulted by the best-interests assessor would be told that the authorisation request had been turned down. The person concerned, the care home or hospital and any IMCA involved will be given a copy of the best-interests assessment. They will know the reasons why the assessor considers that the person is deprived of their liberty and the reasons why it is not in the person&#146;s best interests.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_370"></a><a name="07022783000027"></a>The draft code of practice states that the best-interests assessor should write their report in a way that will help commissioners and providers of care to avoid depriving the person of liberty, including making recommendations; that the supervisory body should liaise with the hospital or care home to ensure that the unauthorised deprivation of liberty does not continue; and that the supervisory body should alert the monitoring body if it has concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"></a><a name="07022783000028"></a>Your Lordships will see from what I have said that safeguards have been provided, but I agree with the view expressed in Committee about the importance of making sure that action is taken if something has gone wrong and a person is deprived of liberty when they need not be, so I undertook to look at whether we could strengthen the safeguards.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_372"></a><a name="07022783000029"></a>The amendment will require the supervisory body to inform in writing the person concerned, the managing authority of the care home or hospital, any IMCA involved and every interested person consulted in the best-interests assessment that an unauthorised deprivation of liberty is taking place. That will strengthen the safeguards in two ways. First, it will explicitly draw attention to the fact that the way in which the person is currently being cared for is unlawful. It does not depend on people understanding that from reading any assessment report. Secondly, it includes family members consulted by the best-interests assessor among the people to be informed. I also committed to look again at the code, and we will include in the next draft more about the value of involving families in deciding how to end the deprivation of liberty and examples to make it clearer when the monitoring body should be involved.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_373"></a><a name="07022783000030"></a>I am convinced that the safeguards in these amendments will ensure that any unauthorised deprivation of liberty is ended promptly.

</ul> &#147;Duty to provide a second opinion for serious medical treatment <ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_156"></a><a name="07022777000074"></a>(1) This paragraph applies to a person (P) who is deprived of liberty in accordance with this Schedule if an NHS body is proposing to provide, or secure the provision of, serious medical treatment within section 37(6) to him.</p>
</ul><ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_157"></a><a name="07022777000075"></a>(2) P shall not be given the treatment unless a registered medical practitioner (other than the medical practitioner in charge of the care of the patient) has certified in writing that the patient is not capable of understanding the nature, purpose and likely effects of that treatment but that it is in the best interests of the patient in accordance with this Act that the treatment be given.</p>

</ul>
<a name="70227-0013.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_376"></a><a name="07022777000003"></a>The noble Baroness said: My Lords, I return to a matter that we discussed in Committee: the proposed duty to provide a second-opinion doctor where someone who has been deprived of their liberty, subject to the Bournewood provisions, requires serious medical treatment. We discussed that matter at some length and talked about the sort of treatment it could apply to, such as ECT, therapeutic sterilisation or artificial nutrition and hydration.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_377"></a><a name="07022777000004"></a>A significant percentage of people covered by these proposals are patients who would meet the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act but for their compliance with the treatment proposed for them, or, in some cases, because they are unaware of the treatment being administered to them. Many of the others will be receiving medication and treatment for medical or physical conditions, or both. Under the Mental Health Act there is a statutory second medical opinion procedure for medication beyond three months&#151;the same applies for ECT&#151;and this is an attempt to replicate that safeguard.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_378"></a><a name="07022777000005"></a>The Government have said that, under the Mental Capacity Act, an unbefriended person has the right to an independent mental capacity advocate who can request a second medical opinion to help them to decide whether the treatment is in the person&#146;s best interests. I accept that that is a valuable safeguard. However, this amendment would serve a different function. It is not about supporting the patient and ensuring that what is proposed happens; rather, it provides scrutiny of the medical decision and prior authorisation of the treatment by someone qualified to give it.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_379"></a><a name="07022777000006"></a>The report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights on the Mental Health Bill identified an omission of something in this area that would have promoted or enhanced human rights. It argues for,</p>
<ul><a name="07022777000109"></a>&#147;effective supervision and review of decisions to give treatment without consent for mental disorder&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07022777000068"></a>where that,</p>
<ul><a name="07022777000110"></a>&#147;involves psychotropic medication or other significant interferences with physical integrity&#148;,</ul>
<p><a name="07022777000069"></a>such as ECT.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_380"></a><a name="07022777000007"></a>Apart from the appointment of an IMCA, the checks in the Mental Capacity Act are retrospective. The committee considered that &#147;effective supervision and review&#148; required more than common law and  the provisions in the Mental Capacity Act. The committee recommended that that be remedied through a second-opinion system or a visiting inspectoral body, such as the Mental Health Act Commission.</p>

<a name="70227-0013.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_381"></a><a name="07022777000008"></a>We discussed this in Committee, when the noble Baroness did not agree with me that there was a need for a second-opinion appointed doctor. She felt that it would be too great an imposition. She cited cases where people had need for heart surgery or other treatment. I should make it clear that this does not apply to emergency situations, although it is about serious treatment. I doubt whether an IMCA would have the technical knowledge on which to decide whether the information they were given by a doctor was correct. That is the point of difference between us, and it is why I return to this amendment. I beg to move.</p>

I know that the noble Baroness does not mean this, but &#147;deprivation of liberty&#148; concerns only that and is not about authorising any course of treatment. I know that she would agree with me on that.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_382"></a><a name="07022777000010"></a>The provision of treatment takes us right back into the Mental Capacity Act itself. The provision of treatment to a person deprived of their liberty has to be in accordance with the arrangements and safeguards in that legislation. There is no justification to adapt those for people deprived of their liberty. Decision-making about serious medical treatment for these people should be handled as with a group of people who do not have the capacity to consent, not differently. Where the primary reason for deprivation of liberty is to allow treatment to take place, the benefits of being treated would be considered as part of the best-interests assessment. We have to do the best-interests assessment to determine that they can be deprived of their liberty. If serious medical treatment is the reason for depriving someone of their liberty, the best-interests assessor would have to consider that as part of their assessment. This is in addition to, and does not replace, the requirement to comply with the rest of the Mental Capacity Act.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_383"></a><a name="07022777000011"></a>The requirements in the Mental Capacity Act governing decision-making when a person is not able to consent are robust and practical. We had a lot of scrutiny on this during the passage of the Mental Capacity Act. Where serious medical treatment is proposed, there will be a need, in accordance with the best interests provision in the Act, to consult anyone named by the person, engaged in caring for them or interested in their welfare. Any donee of lasting power of attorney or deputy appointed by the court would have to be consulted. If there is nobody of that nature whom it would be appropriate to consult, an independent mental capacity advocate would be appointed to represent the person&#146;s interests. Any of these people has the right to seek a second medical opinion regarding serious medical treatment, in the same way that a person could have done had they had capacity.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_384"></a><a name="07022777000012"></a>The noble Baroness asked whether the IMCAs would do that. I went to the IMCA pilot schemes to see whether it was happening. I can confirm, having looked at it, that IMCAs obtain second opinions where they consider it necessary. The practice that is already under way demonstrates that, where they believe it is appropriate, they do. In addition, you can make an application to the Court of Protection if there is a dispute that the proposed treatment would be in the person&#146;s best interests.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_385"></a><a name="07022777000013"></a>The requirements in the Mental Capacity Act lead to greater involvement in decision-making by the person concerned, ensure that what is decided is genuinely in the person&#146;s best interests and that, as far as it can be, the decision made is similar to the one the person would have made if they had had capacity. We have the capacity for second opinions to be obtained by all the people I have mentioned. With the safeguards in the Act, you can only act in the best interests of the person concerned. If the deprivation of liberty were for the purpose of serious medical treatment, then the best-interests assessor would have to determine that it was in the best interests. If all else fails, the Court of Protection can intervene where people believe that serious medical treatment is not in their best interests. I think that my package of safeguards meets what is of genuine concern to the noble Baroness. I hope that she will be able to withdraw her amendment.</p>

I listened to what the noble Baroness said about the provisions only authorising deprivation of liberty and not treatment. My argument is that, if a person lacks capacity and is deprived of their liberty, there is a greater need to ensure that they are not subjected to wrong or inappropriate treatment. There is a need to provide greater protection than would apply to somebody who did not lack capacity and who, as the noble Baroness said, had the right to ask for a second medical opinion. That people deprived of their liberty should have to rely on an IMCA to obtain a second opinion is insufficient protection.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_386"></a><a name="07022777000015"></a>I noted what the noble Baroness said about the IMCA pilots. Can she reassure me that, as the IMCA scheme rolls out, the matter will be kept under supervision? I have a sneaking concern that perhaps the pilots took place in an area where there was a well established tradition of advocacy and there were well trained advocates who understood what they could and could not do. That may not be the case all over; nor may homeowners be as supportive of advocates as they should be.</p>

One of the great advantages of pilots is that we can learn all the lessons necessary. I would want to look carefully at the circumstances in which those opinions were sought. If the noble Baroness is right, and these are particularly well trained advocates, we need to ensure that everybody else involved is equally well trained.</p>

There is a transitional period to be gone through. The noble Baroness talked about the Court of Protection, which has not until now had to make decisions about people&#146;s welfare. It has primarily made decisions about goods and property. She will understand, then, where some of my concern comes from.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_387"></a><a name="07022777000018"></a>We are on either side of a fine line. I would prefer that people deprived of liberty had the extra protection afforded to them in my amendment. Clearly, the noble Baroness disagrees. We will continue to keep this matter under scrutiny as the Act is rolled out. I hope that, if we find there is a problem, we can return to it at some stage very quickly. In the mean time I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"></a><a name="07022777000030"></a>In Committee, the Minister referred&#151;as does the Munjaz judgment&#151;to the fact that departures from the code of practice can be on a policy or a practice level and they can relate to more than one person. They can relate to groups of individuals, as was the case at Ashworth Hospital and its policy of using seclusion and restraint. In the light of that judgment, could individual hospitals make substantial departures from the code of practice, however it turns out to be in the light of discussions on the primary legislation? We need to understand those key facts before we can let this measure leave your Lordships' House. They will be of key significance to the interpretation of many aspects of the legislation and the code of practice.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_397"></a><a name="07022777000031"></a>At the beginning of our deliberations on the Bill, we talked about principles and the purpose of the legislation. At the tail end, we are talking about the role of the legislation and how it will be interpreted. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="07022777000032"></a><b><a name="70227-0014.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07022777000124"></a>Lord Patel of Bradford:</b> My Lords, I have already alluded to the Department of Health&#146;s quite unsatisfactory approach to the mental health code of practice in our debate on Amendment No. 71A. Therefore, I will make only a brief contribution to this debate.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_398"></a><a name="07022777000033"></a>Many times in our debates the Minister has responded to calls for statutory measures by telling us of the advantages, particularly in terms of flexibility, of the code of practice. The legendary flexibility of the code is sometimes seen to be just that&#151;a legend. We have had three editions in 20 years, and the Mental Health Act Commission currently produces a guidance note for services outlining the parts of the book that practitioners should annotate to stay on the right side of the past six years&#146; worth of case law.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_399"></a><a name="07022777000034"></a>More importantly, the code is being promoted by the Government in these debates as a way not only to make services work better but to ensure that they work to what might be regarded as minimum standards of practice and legality under human rights law. We are asked to accept this role for the code, while it is also made explicit that it has no statutory force and may be departed from when any service believes that it has a cogent reason to do so. I echo the sentiments of the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, on cogent reasons and the explanation for that.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_400"></a><a name="07022777000035"></a>Your Lordships may be surprised to learn that I am quite sympathetic to the argument that the code is the most appropriate means of striking a balance between the need for certainty and predictability in law, and the flexibility that may be required over time or may be required to deal with just those sorts of difficult cases that would make bad law. The code needs to be supported to take this role on board. Departures from it should be exceptional, not routine, and should be justified and recorded. The amendment sets out a modest and reasonable means to make the code work better, and I entirely support it.</p>

<a name="07022777000036"></a><b><a name="70227-0014.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07022777000125"></a>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath:</b> My Lords, we come, almost at the end of our deliberations on Report, to a most important matter. As the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, and the noble Lord, Lord Patel, have stated, the inter-relationship between the Act and the code is critical in terms of confidence about how the legislation will be carried out in practice, and the advice and guidance that is given to practitioners in exercising what are often difficult judgments. We need to acknowledge that, legislate as we do, practitioners in the field need clarity, as we have all agreed. Equally, it is important that professionals have the confidence to exercise their professional judgment and discretion within the parameters of the Act, but with sufficient flexibility too. In a sense, the code enables us to have that discretion and professional judgment but within the clear parameters set down by the legislation. I pay tribute, as I have done before, to the architects of the 1983 legislation. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, referred to the three occasions on which the code has been amended since the 1983 Act came into being. He may say that it should have happened more often, but it clearly shows that the code is not set in stone. We have a mechanism for making adjustments to it in the light of experience. There is also clear parliamentary scrutiny of the code and any changes to be made to it.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_401"></a><a name="07022777000037"></a>Before responding to a number of points that were made, perhaps I may correct a statement that I made in Committee on 29 January in relation to the code of practice. It may be found at col. 115 of <I>Hansard</I>. In setting out the facts of the judgment in R (on the application of Munjaz) v Mersey Care National Health Service Trust 2005, I stated that the judgment set out the circumstances which could provide cogent reasons for not following the guidance in the code. While I stand by the correctness of what I said, I now understand that the reasons are given in the interpretation of the judgment in the 10th edition of Richard Jones&#146; <I>Mental Health Act Manual</I>, published by Thomson Sweet &amp; Maxwell. I apologise for this misattribution, and wish to put the record straight.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_402"></a><a name="07022777000038"></a>The amendment would spell out the status of the Mental Health Act code of practice in the legislation. My problem with it is that it would also raise its status far closer to that of directions. It also provides that the reasons for any departure from the code must be recorded.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_403"></a><a name="07022777000039"></a>The amendment would have the effect of overturning the position established by the House of Lords in the case of Munjaz and would effectively reinstate the Court of Appeal&#146;s overruled view on the matter: that the code must be followed and may be departed from only in relation to an individual patient. I accept that noble Lords, in proposing the amendment, wish to ensure that patients are treated effectively and consistently in accordance with the guidance in the code, but this amendment is not the right way of achieving it.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_404"></a><a name="07022777000040"></a>We are considering this matter carefully and will continue to do so. We understand the advantages of placing the status of the code in legislation. That is why, as part of the promised amendment on principles, I will bring forward at Third Reading a provision setting out the status of the code, but I must make it clear that it will not be the restrictive status proposed in the amendment. Rather, it will be a status consistent with the judgment of the Appellate Committee of this House in Munjaz.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_405"></a><a name="07022777000041"></a>This is already implicit in the Act. As I said to noble Lords in Committee, we will strengthen the introduction to the code. I readily accept that the current introduction and the draft introduction do not give sufficient guidance and clarity to professionals on the status of the code of practice. Therefore, in addition to introducing an amendment on the status of the code to be put in the Bill, we will clearly need to look carefully at the drafting of the code of practice in relation to its status. I am happy to share that with noble Lords who have taken part in this debate so that we may have the benefit of their advice and wisdom.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_406"></a><a name="07022777000042"></a>It is clear that people must understand what the code means in practice and that the people to whom it is addressed must have regard to it. This was confirmed by the Appellate Committee of your Lordships' House. The committee said that it was not sufficient merely to have regard to the code, in the sense of being able to deviate from it as a person sees fit, but, rather, that the people to whom it is addressed must follow its guidance except where they have cogent reasons to depart from it. The dictionary definition of &#147;cogent&#148; is &#147;convincing and compelling&#148;. I am not sure how much further I can go on that. It is pretty clear that one has to have a jolly good reason for departing from it. The requirement that cogent reasons must be shown for any departure sets a high standard which is not easily satisfied. A court, in reviewing any departures from the code, should scrutinise the reasons given for the departure with the intensity which the importance and sensitivity of the subject matter require.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_407"></a><a name="07022777000043"></a>The problem with the amendment is that it would raise the status of the code beyond what is either necessary or sensible. It would have the effect of limiting the flexibility of practitioners to develop local policies to reflect the needs of particular groups of patients. It might run the risk of ossifying professional practice and make it harder for patients to know how they are likely to be treated. I accept that a delicate balance has to be struck between the principles enunciated in the Bill and the Act and the discretion that needs to be given to practitioners in the code of practice. I think that we would all agree that professionals need discretion, but they need to be discreet within the principles enunciated in the Act and in the code of practice. Equally, we do not want to reach a position in which professionals are left in too much of a straitjacket when using their professional discretion.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_408"></a><a name="07022777000044"></a>I do not pretend that this is easy or that these matters are easy for a professional on the ground. These are difficult matters and it is a difficult judgment, but we happen to believe&#151;and we believe that this is confirmed by the decision of your Lordships' House in the Appellate Committee&#151;that we have the balance right.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_409"></a><a name="07022777000045"></a>I also believe that it is very important to recognise the comments made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, when he discussed the question of whether Ashworth was free to depart from the code as a matter of policy, and not just in relation to individual patients or groups of patients. The noble and learned Lord could see no reason why it should not be able to do so,</p>
<ul><a name="07022777000112"></a>&#147;provided of course that it can demonstrate that it had a good reason for doing so&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="07022777000071"></a>He also referred to the,</p>
<ul><a name="07022777000113"></a>&#147;obvious danger that, if the Code could be departed from in the case of individual patients or groups of patients where no written guidance was available, decisions to do this would be open to attack as being arbitrary because their consequences were unregulated and unpredictable&#148;.</ul><a name="time_25"></a>
<a name="70227-0014.htm_time1"></a><h5><a name="07022777000115"></a>8.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_410"></a><a name="07022777000046"></a>There is no question that practitioners should have proper regard to the code of practice and keep records of significant departures from the guidance in the code. However, I worry about the implications of the amendment, which could increase the level of bureaucracy requiring practitioners to consider all aspects of the code in respect of each individual patient and recording any reason for departing from it.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_411"></a><a name="07022777000047"></a>We do not favour an attempt to raise the status of the code any further towards that of directions. It is guidance&#151;important guidance, but guidance none the less. Overall, any such change risks reducing the flexibility of the operation of the Act. The current position is that while the code gives guidance, it leaves professional discretion on the interpretation of the statutory provision to the professionals responsible for detaining and treating patients and allows, when there are cogent reasons to do so, the policies which depart from the guidance in the code to be developed in a way which provides transparency and clarity for patients and professionals.</p>

<a name="70227-0014.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="stpa_412"></a><a name="07022777000072"></a>I understand how important it is to get this right and wish to give as much clarity as possible to noble Lords and practitioners in the field. That is why, while I do not accept the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, we will propose an amendment at Third Reading, as part of the amendment on principles, which I hope will make it clear that the status of the code as set out in Munjaz is brought into legislation.</p>

It is not surprising that ever since 1983 the House has been discussing this question and Members on either side of the House&#151;or whichever side they happen to be on at the time&#151;simply disagree. That said, it is helpful that the Minister has alluded to the fact that we wait to see with the amendment. It is a matter of supreme importance, given all that has been said by noble Lords all the way through our discussions&#151;and not simply those who wish to defend the rights of patients but those who wish to see the issue clarified for practitioners, who are often highly exposed to criticism about their failures, especially with regard to cases when there has been a tragedy. Practitioners are having their work scrutinised and their failures put under the microscope.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"></a><a name="07022777000049"></a>For those reasons, it is important that there is consistency and clarity between primary legislation and the code of practice. They were very different documents in draft. I take the point that the code of practice will be substantially revised in light of the discussions that we have in this House and another place, and that this part in particular&#151;that is, the relationship of the principles in the code of practice to the rest of the measures&#151;will definitely be revised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_435"></a><a name="07022777000063"></a>As Clause 45 is currently drafted, orders made under it are not subject to the negative or affirmative resolution procedure. That is the usual practice with a commencement order. However, in its report on the Mental Health Bill, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended that all orders that contain transitional or saving provision should be subject to the negative resolution procedure. The amendment will ensure that that happens. I beg to move.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="07022766000001"></a>Tuesday, 27 February 2007.</h2>

<h4 align="center"><a name="07022766000004"></a>The Committee met at half-past three.</h4>


<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000005"></a>[The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Viscount Allenby of Megiddo) in the Chair.]</p>

<p><a name="07022766000006"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07022766000036"></a>The Deputy Chairman of Committees (Viscount Allenby of Megiddo):</b> Before the Minister moves that the first order be considered, could I remind noble Lords that in the case of each order, the Motion before the Committee will be that it considers the order in question. I should perhaps make it clear that the Motion to approve the order will be moved in the Chamber in the usual way.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="07022766000002"></a>Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 2007</h3>

<p><a name="07022766000007"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07022766000037"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000008"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of the order is to reduce road traffic casualties by improving road safety. It allows for stronger penalties and more effective enforcement, bringing the law in Northern Ireland largely into line with that in Great Britain. Many of the provisions in the Road Safety Act 2006 are replicated in the order. Almost all road casualties are preventable. Most are caused by the behaviour of road users themselves. The order will enable dangerous behaviour to be tackled through stiffer penalties and more effective enforcement regimes. It will make the non-wearing of seatbelts an endorsable fixed penalty offence, and will double the fine for careless and inconsiderate driving. It is already an offence to use a hand-held mobile phone while driving, but the fact that PSNI issued 15,500 fixed penalty notices in 2005 suggests that we need a stronger deterrent. We envisage three penalty points and a fixed penalty doubled to &#163;60. Temporary speed limits are needed to protect road workers and road users at roadworks. Many drivers think that they are there to be ignored, which is why we propose that breaching a temporary speed limit should be an endorsable offence that attracts between three and six penalty points.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000009"></a>There are also provisions to clamp down on owners and keepers of uninsured vehicles, including police powers to seize and dispose of vehicles and to enforce continuous insurance from the record. Graduated fixed penalties will help to make the punishment fit the crime. In the case of speeding, this will mean that the faster someone drives, the more points they will get and the quicker they will lose their licence. Foreign-registered drivers who offend should not get off scot free simply by driving off. We propose regulations requiring errant drivers to pay a deposit in lieu of a fixed penalty or pending a court appearance. There is scope, too, for EU drivers to be brought into the fixed penalty system.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000010"></a>Important as punishment is, what we really want is that offending drivers mend their ways. There are already successful retraining courses for drink drivers. The order allows for regulated courses for other serious offences such as speeding, to which courts will be able to refer the worst offenders. It is vital that drivers, and those who teach them, have the best possible training. Presently, only car driving instructors need to register with the Driver Vehicle Testing Agency. The order enables there to be regulation of the registration, training and examination of all driving instructors, including for lorries and motorcycles. This includes provision for disabled people to join the profession. Implementation of these measures will increase professionalism and raise standards in the industry.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000011"></a>Part 3 of the order provides scope to change fundamentally the driver licensing system. It envisages future regulations to provide for full driver licences to be issued automatically to people who have passed their driving tests and for the replacement of paper counterparts with electronic driver records. The anomaly whereby some foreign licences can be exchanged in Great Britain but not in Northern Ireland is addressed by provisions in the order for the relaxation of Northern Ireland regulations on exchangeable driving licences. MoT enforcement will be bolstered through the mandatory display of MoT discs on vehicle windscreens.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000012"></a>Some of the provisions, including increased penalties for offences relating to seatbelts, mobile phones, driving without proper attention and careless driving can be commenced fairly soon after this order is made. Other provisions anticipate and underpin an important programme of change over several years. I know that noble Lords will recognise that I cannot be more specific on timetables. We all hope that the implementation of the order will be taken forward by a restored Assembly. I beg to move.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000013"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 2007.&#151;(<I>Baroness Amos</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="07022766000014"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0001.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07022766000038"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I thank the noble Baroness the Lord President for introducing the order, and I welcome her again as a Northern Ireland spokesman. We broadly support the order. There was a debate with lengthy speeches in the other place, so I will not go over that ground again. Perhaps I could ask the noble Baroness to firm up on one or two of the questions asked at the other end to which I did not get an answer by reading <I>Hansard</I>.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000015"></a>One area where we would be anxious to see more enforcement is in relation to people driving vehicles completely illegally&#151;uninsured, unlicensed, unregistered and un-MOT-ed. There is too much of that in the Province and I would like to know what the Government are doing to toughen up on it. The MoT point was made by Lady Hermon in the other place, but I am not sure that the Government have yet committed themselves to reviewing the whole MoT process, a process which I understand is still well behind. It is 100 per cent government-controlled. I am not saying that that is bad, because in other parts of Europe&#151;Spain, for example&#151;I have seen government-controlled MoT places. I have had my own car MOT-ed in Spain for many years. When it is done well, which it is there, it is extremely efficient. I am not saying that we have to go private, but I am saying that it is up to the Government, if they are going to keep it government-controlled, to make sure that there are adequate provisions and adequate facilities and that people can get their vehicles MOT-ed in due course on time.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000016"></a>On Article 38, Lady Hermon asked in the other place:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="07022766000034"></a>&#147;Before the Minister moves on to respond to the point made by my erstwhile colleague, the hon. Member for Lagan Valley, I ask him to answer my question: why is it that under article 18 it is only the offence of manslaughter by the driver of a motor vehicle that will be on a so-called newly introduced driving record? Why is causing death by dangerous driving not listed in the same way?&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons Fifth Delegated Legislation Committee, 30/1/07; col. 18.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="07022766000033"></a>Mr Cairns agreed to answer that in writing, but I am afraid that I have not seen a copy of the answer, if there is one on the record. Otherwise, in general, I support the order.</p>

<p><a name="07022766000017"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0001.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07022766000039"></a>Lord Smith of Clifton:</b> We greatly supported the aims of the Road Safety Act 2006 when it was going through Parliament, so we welcome the order.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000018"></a>The Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland has done a lot of good work in trying to tackle road safety issues in Northern Ireland. Indeed, road deaths in Northern Ireland have gone down from 171 in 2000 to 125 in 2006. That must be good progress. That is a great success, but clearly there is still a needless and tragic waste of life. It is particularly distressing that, of the 125 people who perished on Northern Ireland&#146;s roads last year, 34 were young people under 21.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000019"></a>We welcome the provisions in the order on hand-held mobile phones. I am sure that all Members of the Committee will have witnessed improper use of mobiles while people are driving. The message that using a hand-held mobile phone is dangerous has not got through sufficiently. I hope that the measures before us will ensure that the message hits home. We also very much welcome the provisions on seatbelts and on breaching temporary speed limits. Of course we support the measures on road traffic offenders being able to attend a driver retraining course. We want to see a decrease in deaths and serious injuries, and we therefore support the order.</p>

<p><a name="07022766000020"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0001.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07022766000040"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> I had not intended to say anything on this order, as I am broadly supportive of it, but a couple of the comments of Members of the Committee have provoked me to rise to my feet. Consequently, I wish to address two issues. I address the first with a little trepidation because what I am about to say could be wrong. If I am wrong, I hope that the noble Baroness will point that out as soon as the appropriate missive has come from those behind her.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000021"></a>The noble Baroness referred to enforcement regarding foreign drivers, foreign offences and so on. In 2001 or 2002 we had a meeting on transport&#151;I think it was a meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council&#151;and this issue arose. There was an agreement in principle between us and the appropriate Ministers for the Republic of Ireland that there should be mutual enforceability of road traffic offences between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. If people travelling from Northern Ireland to the Republic commit an offence, it should be taken into account under our procedures. Otherwise people would get a &#147;free pass&#148; on the matter. There was a discernibly high incidence of accidents close to the border in both Northern Ireland and southern Ireland, suggesting that drivers who may feel almost immune from penalty become careless.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000022"></a>The same principle applies throughout the legal jurisdictions of the United Kingdom. I have taken advantage of this myself: I have a speeding conviction in England, but it does not have any effect on my Northern Ireland licence. That is crazy and something ought to be done about. On the position of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, it was known at the time that the Republic would have to significantly change its legislation so that the legislation would operate in parallel. Within the United Kingdom as a whole the legislation is parallel but there is not mutual enforcement. It is an obvious loophole that should have been filled well before now.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000023"></a>The second issue is MOTs. I am sorry to disagree with my noble friend Lord Glentoran, but I am not as ambitious as he is&#151;he obviously has one car in the UK and one in Spain. I have a car registered in Northern Ireland and another registered in England. The difference in MoT procedures between Northern Ireland and England is the same as chalk and cheese. There is no problem with MoTs in England as you can easily arrange one and carry it out. It is done in a co-operative context with good-quality service. In Northern Ireland the service is appalling, simply because it is in the state sector, for which there is no good reason. When we were developing the reform and reinvestment initiative in the Northern Ireland Administration, we wanted to get a lot of things out of the state sector that should not have been there&#151;such as the Department of the Environment running car parks in Belfast and other places. What is a government department doing running car parks and vehicle testing centres? Not only is that not necessary, but it is done inefficiently.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000024"></a>My noble friend Lord Glentoran is not sufficiently Thatcherite on this issue. He really should be more robust in his comments. A Government who are anxious to see public expenditure savings would see that. Even though the savings would be fairly modest, they would still be significant and these things add up. If those issues are looked at, they will help to reduce the very high level of public expenditure in Northern Ireland compared with other parts of the United Kingdom. It is one of the reasons why public expenditure is higher there. Northern Ireland departments insist on doing things that elsewhere in the UK are no longer government matters.</p>

<p><a name="07022766000025"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0001.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07022766000041"></a>Viscount Simon:</b> Although it is not strictly dealt with in the order, I raise the issue of wearing seatbelts in Northern Ireland, as it comes under the order. Lives would be saved in all countries if seatbelts were worn. A survey of drivers in the Thames valley estimated that 30 per cent of drivers do not wear seatbelts. Of that 30 per cent, had they been involved in a crash, 65 per cent would have survived. Extrapolating that across the whole country, making the non-wearing of seatbelts an endorsable offence could save 300 lives. I do not expect my noble friend to reply on this, but it would be nice if she could write to me on it in due course.</p>
<h5><a name="07022766000035"></a>3.45 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07022766000026"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0001.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07022766000042"></a>Baroness Amos:</b> I thank noble Lords for their general welcome for the order. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, asked about the need for more enforcement, particularly with regard to those who are driving vehicles illegally. Consultation on that issue has recently been completed and legislation is planned for later this year.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000027"></a>On the offence of manslaughter, I understand that death by dangerous driving is included within paragraph (1)(a) of that article and is an offence under the Road Traffic (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. I understand that my honourable friend David Cairns has written to Lady Hermon and I will ensure that a copy of his letter gets to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000028"></a>I totally understand the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, on MOT centres still being within government control and the concerns that arise because of delays. I understand that there were a number of problems as a result of strike action occurring at the same time as a large increase in the volume of requests for MOTs. Those backlogs have now been eliminated and tests are being offered in line with the agency&#146;s targets. There are now extra staff, and overtime has been increased to improve effectiveness. However, the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, raised a wider point about whether the service needs to be in government ownership. I will feed that point back to my colleagues who are looking at the issue. In answer to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, I am not aware that we have plans to reconsider government control, but, in the light of the strong representations this afternoon, I will refer this issue back.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000029"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, also asked about mutual enforceability. We are looking at that. My understanding is that although UK and Irish legislation both allow the recognition of driver disqualification, that will not come into effect until early 2008. A feasibility study is also looking at the issue of penalty points, which are inconsistent between Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain. The noble Lord also raised the issue of what happens here compared with what happens in Northern Ireland. It is certainly possible for someone to have 11 penalty points in England and 11 in Northern Ireland, with two different paper counterparts. We therefore need to look at the issue urgently. We recognise that it is a major problem. A feasibility study for co-operation on motoring infringements falling short of disqualification is currently under way and will report by early 2008.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000030"></a>My noble friend Lord Simon raised the issue of seatbelts. As I understand it, we are introducing penalty points in Northern Ireland that we do not have in England and Wales. My noble friend was saying that there should be greater consistency between the two areas. I am happy to write to him on that.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000031"></a>The point on hand-held mobiles raised by the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, was more a comment than question. The strengthening of the legislation is happening today. If this order is passed, we can move quickly towards having exactly the same position in Northern Ireland. I think that I have addressed all the points raised. I commend the order to the Committee.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07022766000032"></a>On Question, Motion agreed to.</p>
<h3 align="center"><a name="070227100000001"></a>Policing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007</h3>
<h5><a name="070227100000027"></a>3.50 pm</h5>

<p><a name="070227100000002"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="070227100000029"></a>The Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Policing (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000003"></a>The noble Baroness said: The purpose of this order is to amend existing Northern Ireland policing legislation and to introduce new subject areas in line with England and Wales.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000004"></a>The following policy areas are included in the draft order: provision for further opportunities for the Police Service of Northern Ireland to civilianise posts by way of extending, in line with England and Wales, the range of powers and duties otherwise available to police officers by way of designation to investigating officers, detention officers and escort officers, and introducing two categories of designated civilian, namely staff custody officer and police community support officer (PCSO); provision for streamlining the police trainee recruitment process to allow the PSNI to make provisional police trainee appointments, subject to the satisfactory completion of medical tests and security vetting; provision for changing the recruitment procedures for police support staff in line with those proposed for police trainees, including a power to allow government to bring forward regulations to satisfy concerns that designated civilians should be vetted to the same standard as police trainees; provision for the reintroduction of legislative provisions to enable the PSNI to address an acute shortage of detective constables, by way of the recruitment of experienced constables with the required skills from other forces; provision for the police ombudsman to make application to the Public Prosecution Service to allow for the reinvestigation of police officers previously acquitted of a qualifying offence where new evidence has been obtained; provision for the police to close roads or divert traffic, or prohibit or restrict the use of a road or waterway, if considered necessary for the preservation of the peace or the maintenance of public order; and provision for the police to examine documents and electronic records in order to establish whether they contain evidence that someone has committed or is preparing to commit a serious crime.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000005"></a>I should like to provide a little more information on some of the key provisions in the draft order. The introduction of police community support officers to policing in Northern Ireland will help to build on the existing commitment of the PSNI to making communities safer through the delivery of real community policing and effective neighbourhood policing plans. PCSOs are not a cheap alternative. They will be full-time members of staff and will have a clearly defined role that will reflect their unique contribution to enhancing community safety. There will be a clear delineation of responsibilities between PCSOs and their regular police colleagues. It is, however, important to remember that PCSOs are not police officers. The majority of their time and the key focus of their role will be around engaging with local communities.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000006"></a>The PSNI is in a strong position to learn from the experience of the introduction of PCSOs in England and Wales. I know that the PSNI intends to apply those principles to its implementation programme and to adapt good practice in PCSO recruitment, training and supervision.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000007"></a>On staff custody officers, we are also introducing a provision that will enable the PSNI to civilianise the role of custody officer in line with proposals in Great Britain. The Home Office is currently working with nine police forces to introduce custody officers at a number of pilot sites as a direct result of concerns expressed during the passage of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000008"></a>The pilots are about making quantitative and qualitative assessments of the impact of the post of staff custody officer before deciding on the suitability of a national rollout. Although we are legislating for these provisions at this time, we envisage that the PSNI will wish to consider the outcome of the pilot exercise before introducing staff custody officers in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000009"></a>On the issue of investigation by the Police Ombudsman, noble Lords will be aware that the Criminal Justice Act 2003 provides for application to be made to the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland by the Chief Constable to allow him to reinvestigate persons acquitted of a qualifying offence where new evidence has been obtained, which is commonly known as the double jeopardy rule. However, where that person is a police officer, the proper investigative authority is the Police Ombudsman. Equivalent provision for the Police Ombudsman was unfortunately overlooked when the Criminal Justice Act was being drafted, and these provisions will correct that omission by introducing a new Section 86A into the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000010"></a>Document seizure powers are necessary to allow the police to operate effectively in dealing with a threat from serious and organised crime. I believe that noble Lords will find it helpful if I explain at the outset the distinction between what we are proposing today and how it relates to the existing powers of police to seize evidence under PACE. PACE seizure powers are applicable only where the officer has reasonable belief that the article is evidence in an offence, that it was obtained as a consequence of the commission of an offence, or that it is necessary to seize it to stop it being concealed, lost, altered, damaged or destroyed. In some instances it may not be possible to meet the necessary level of reasonable belief. We are therefore providing police officers with a limited power that will allow them to establish reasonable belief by, for instance, having documents translated or cross-checking map references.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000011"></a>These provisions will also create appropriate safeguards to protect the rights of the public. As well as the time limit on the retention of documents, items believed to be subject to legal privilege are exempt from examination, any document or record cannot be photographed or copied and a record must be made of any examination.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000012"></a>I believe that the provisions in this draft order will greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the police across a range of areas and I commend it to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="070227100000014"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0001.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070227100000030"></a>Lord Glentoran:</b> I thank the noble Baroness the Lord President for outlining so clearly the provisions in this important order. We support the order in principle. I am concerned about just one aspect of it: sub-paragraph (5)(e), relating to the Police Ombudsman. It goes against the grain to create a situation where members of the PSNI can be open to double jeopardy. Although I heard the reasons that the noble Baroness gave, ever since the Bill was introduced some years ago I have argued against overburdening the Police Ombudsman with powers, as has now been clearly demonstrated by her office. I ask the Minister, and may ask again in future, what plans the Government have to review the powers of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000015"></a>There are reports about the huge costs and the retrospectiveness of current investigations. We are trying to go forward in Northern Ireland. We hope that the Assembly will sit and that it will quickly take us further forward. We do not want to go on with retrospective investigations involving double jeopardy situations, looking into issues that are sensitive from the viewpoint of national security. I would like to feel that Her Majesty&#146;s Government will soon have plans to review the powers of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="070227100000016"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0001.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070227100000031"></a>Lord Smith of Clifton:</b> We, too, broadly welcome the order. However, I should like to raise with the Minister some specific points on staff custody officers and police community support officers. Our primary concern is about the training of such individuals. Can the Minister tell us whether detailed training schemes for each of these new types of officer have been  developed yet in Northern Ireland? It is particularly important for PCSOs, who will daily come into contact with the public. Can the Minister reassure us that such individuals will be required to undergo a rigorous programme and that such programmes will include specific training on relationships with young people? Can the Minister also tell us whether she expects PCSOs immediately to exercise all the powers given to them under the order? I am particularly concerned about the power of a PCSO to detain someone.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000017"></a>On Regulation 6 and the introduction of civilian staff custody officers, the Minister will know that we Liberal Democrats expressed great concern about the designation of this role during passage of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. The custody officer acts as the guarantor of the suspect&#146;s rights and is a major guardian of the standards of the whole system. It is therefore vital that the person exercising the important powers of a custody officer be properly independent and accountable. The police custody officer is accountable as an officer of the Crown. He is subject to police disciplinary procedures. He is expected to resist an illegal order. Civilian staff will be more likely to worry about the consequences for their employment if they act independently. One wants an assurance that this concern will not weigh unduly with them.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000018"></a>A police custody officer must hold at least the rank of sergeant. A sergeant is an experienced police officer who has years of familiarity with police procedures. By contrast, there is no requirement that the civilian custody officer should have any particular experience or training. A police custody officer&#151;the sergeant&#151;can also use his rank to ensure that the police constables treat suspects correctly and follow the PACE codes of practice. Will a civilian member of staff be able to assert the proper authority of a constable and therefore safeguard suspects&#146; rights? Can the Minister inform the Committee of the experience of police services in England and Wales that have designated custody officers in this way? Have we learnt anything from the experience over here in England and Wales?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000019"></a>We welcome the provisions in Regulation 8. It is entirely sensible for the medical and vetting procedures to apply only to those who have reached the stage of being in the pool of qualified candidates. This will undoubtedly ensure that the appointment process is conducted more speedily than it is at present.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000020"></a>We also welcome the provisions of Regulation 11. Although we raised serious concerns about the double jeopardy provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 when it was proceeding through the House, we recognise that it is necessary to close this potential loophole in regard to police officers by ensuring that the ombudsman is involved.</p>

<p><a name="070227100000021"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070227100000032"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> I do not welcome this draft order, and I need further clarification from the Minister. I have two particular problems: the first is in Regulation 10 on the recruitment of experienced constables with the required skills from other forces; and the second is in Regulation 11, to which the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, referred, on the role of the Police Ombudsman.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000022"></a>Regarding the provision in Regulation 10 on experienced constables from other forces, is that restricted to other forces within the United Kingdom, or does it refer to forces outside the United Kingdom&#151;within the European Union, for example&#151;or does it refer, indeed, to the Garda Siochana in the Republic of Ireland? If it involves the latter, has the Minister read the oath that recruits take when they join the Garda Siochana? Does she think that people who have taken that oath will be welcomed by most people in Northern Ireland? I think that there is a grave problem there that needs to be addressed. I want an answer from the Minister about whether she has read the oath and whether she thinks it is consistent with the views of most people in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000023"></a>Regulation 11 on the Police Ombudsman contains many problems. As the Minister may know, the role of the Police Ombudsman is tainted and has little or no credibility in Northern Ireland. That is the reality on the ground. The Police Ombudsman is tainted because she is married to an SDLP councillor who only yesterday declared that he wants the break-up of the United Kingdom and a united Ireland. He is a candidate in the SDLP, and it stated that yesterday at its press conference. It may be said that the wife of a pro-Irish politician is not responsible for his politics. That is theoretically correct, but the perception of people on the ground is that the Police Ombudsman is tainted and biased, and she therefore has little credibility.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000024"></a>The order refers to the reinvestigation of police officers. What period will that cover? Will it be the period since the Belfast agreement, or the period before the Belfast agreement? If it refers to the period before the Belfast agreement, will it apply to civilians who have previously been accused of terrorism? Now that new evidence has become available, will they also be subject to further reinvestigation? That needs to be clarified because there should not be double standards with one standard for the police and an easier standard for civilians in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000025"></a>Then there is the question of the extension of the ombudsman&#146;s powers. Has she the power to apply herself to matters relating to national security within the United Kingdom? If so, is that widely understood within the United Kingdom, especially by the Minister answering today? There are serious implications here as we have international terrorism. If the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland will slowly but surely get involved in the national security of the United Kingdom she could reveal things that apply to attacks against the United Kingdom by international terrorists.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070227100000026"></a>The order extends the ombudsman&#146;s powers, yet the explanatory document states that that will not cost any more money. Can that be explained? How can the ombudsman have an extension of powers without costing any more money? Is it not correct that the ombudsman herself has said that she wants her budget increased? Please tell us the truth.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000029"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07022792000130"></a>Lord Maginnis of Drumglass:</b> A huge number of things about this order cause an immense amount of disquiet. One of the difficulties we face is that this order is coming forward in the wake of the Police Ombudsman&#146;s report on Operation Ballast. Impartial and experienced people see that report as widely flawed. It is perhaps one of the most flawed documents we have seen in the administration of justice in Northern Ireland over the past 40 years.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000030"></a>It struck me as peculiar when I heard the Lord President say that a matter in respect of the Police Ombudsman had been overlooked in the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Many of us believe that that was a fairly convenient oversight. When something is introduced by Order in Council, it is much easier to get a flawed amendment passed than if it is proposed when a Bill is being considered and amendments can be tabled.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000031"></a>The reality is&#151;I am almost concluding before I bring forward the argument&#151;if we move the Police Ombudsman and the whole process of examination, re-examination and examination after acquittal, and we see it implemented the way in which it is implemented by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, we will find the methodology. It will not merely be facts that are misinterpreted. I will talk about the way in which so-called facts were handled in the past. It will lead to a revelation of methodology. We all know that&#151;none better than those of us who have served and lived in Northern Ireland&#151;the methodology in dealing with committed terrorists is not something that you would want your best friend to be involved in. The reality is that it is a dangerous and difficult business.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000032"></a>I come from soldiering in 1970, when there was no such thing as &#147;good intelligence&#148; in terms of Northern Ireland. In 1972, we had 470 victims of terrorism. Building up an intelligence network is not a pleasant business. The people who have intelligence are not the noble Baroness the Lord President, or Ken Maginnis, or the gentlemen sitting behind the Lord President. They are terrorists, whose information can be tapped. They are dangerous people to work with, and they bring huge danger to their handlers. If we give someone like the Police Ombudsman the power to probe that methodology and, if we take the latter-day threat, the national intelligence agencies&#151;which are becoming more responsible&#151;they will not impart their intelligence to our ordinary police constabularies if they believe that they are bound to reveal it to the ombudsman, who can then reveal it to the public. No one has leaked information more consistently than the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland. Journalists knew more about Operation Ballast than the Chief Constable or the Secretary of State, long before Operation Ballast was produced.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000033"></a>It is not just an internal matter if we damage the integrity of the intelligence sources in our nation. We are not an island in that respect: the intelligence agencies of other nations share information with us. Do we honestly believe that they will share information that ultimately will be revealed to the ombudsman? I hope that I have made the point sufficiently that there is a huge danger. I know that the noble Baroness has colleagues who well and fully understand the implications. I hope that there will be more consultation and discussion within government. </p>
<h5><a name="07022792000119"></a>4.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000034"></a>It is important that I briefly underpin what I am saying. With other professionals, I have looked at the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland&#146;s report on Operation Ballast. I noticed that it contains seven serious factual inaccuracies, which I will provide for the Lord President if required. There are six serious potential security risks to individuals or to intelligence methodology. There are five seriously flawed judgments, which are frequently repeated assertions without any supporting argument. For example, where the ombudsman has found that some documents are shredded, she does not suggest that it has to do with data protection legislation, but that it is a deliberate attempt, with malice aforethought, to destroy something incriminating. She makes that assertion, and it is totally wrong.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000035"></a>There are three obvious self-contradictions in the report and four non-sequiturs. There are six insidious innuendoes which endanger the lives of decent people who have put themselves between the terrorists and the community, some for over 30 years, and who have now retired, believing that they can enjoy their remaining years with their families without having to be behind six-foot fences and bullet-proof glass; without having to look under their vehicles; without having to run the gauntlet that they have had to run for many years. Now they have been thrust back into the forefront. Terrorists are released; we can trust them back out in the community, but the very people who brought the 470 deaths in 1972 down to 13 deaths in 2001 are being examined.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000036"></a>I could say other things about Operation Ballast. There are 15 demonstrations of lack of professionalism and a profound failure to understand the issue. There are 20 blatant examples of a lack of impartiality in assessments and conclusions, to which I have already alluded; drawing the wrong conclusions and looking in the wrong place. For example, somebody is brought in for questioning for 48 hours. The police have some forensic information but have not defined quite what it is, and they go to the Secretary of State to ask for a 48-hour extension. That produces a piece of paper. Once the matter is dealt with, that piece of paper is probably shredded; it is of no importance. But I will tell you who should have a copy of it: the Secretary of State. Of course, the Police Ombudsman would not have thought of looking there. Or perhaps the Secretary of State and his staff did not know where it was.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000037"></a>All in all, this is a dreadful report, full of sloppy drafting. It is put in the context of six years&#146; work by the Police Ombudsman; that is six years of clawing increasing powers unto herself with a budget rising on a year-by-year basis&#151;&#163;5 million in the first year and &#163;9 million now. That is a fair rise in six years, given the increasingly peaceful situation we have in Northern Ireland. But a total of &#163;42 million! And it is being suggested that it is money well spent.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000038"></a>Let me put that &#163;42 million in the context of 13,000 or 14,000 police a few years ago and almost 10,000 police now. What has the ombudsman delivered? She has delivered an average of one criminal conviction per year. That is 0.001 per cent. Going at that rate, there would be one conviction per 100 policeman every 100 years. That puts it in context. That is what the Police Ombudsman has achieved. It cost &#163;7 million per conviction, and we want to give her the opportunity to rake over history in a way that is of no benefit to the erstwhile victims or to a society striving to overcome its distrust. That is the very antithesis of good law.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000039"></a>I am sorry for taking so long, but I want to be frank, and I do not want anyone to leave the Committee without understanding the implications of what has happened over the past six years. I do not want them to exacerbate the problem that we are likely to face if we increase the powers of an ombudsman who does not measure up to the criteria intended by Maurice Hayes, and has never done so. Maurice Hayes was one of the most senior civil servants in Northern Ireland. He took a huge interest in security and cross-community matters, and he was widely respected by us. When he suggested a police ombudsman, he asked for somebody with real judicial experience. We did not get anyone with judicial experience or investigative knowledge about the background of terrorism that has troubled us for many years.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000040"></a>There are other aspects of this order that I would like to talk about at equal length, but I shall not inflict myself on the Lord President. I hope that she will take seriously the possibility that by moving this order in this form, she may not only damage the emerging peace and political process in Northern Ireland, but undermine the whole basis for trust between and among intelligence agencies, both internal and external to the United Kingdom. We are facing, possibly for the next 40 years, a terrorist threat of international dimensions. However much we want to pander to certain prejudices to persuade people along, that is not the basis for making law or the basis on which we should risk the integrity of the United Kingdom.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000041"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0002.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="07022792000131"></a>Baroness Blood:</b> I did not intend to speak in such a serious debate, but I want to make two points. I have listened to the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, and I realise that he has a real knowledge of the ombudsman&#146;s office and what goes on there. Listening to him, it seems that this concerns only terrorist offences. I could name a dozen ordinary issues on which the ombudsman has conducted investigations where people have been quite happy. Three years ago, I had that experience. Believe it or not, a policeman rather curtly put me in a good deal of danger so I took it up with the local station and the matter rolled out into the ombudsman&#146;s office. I was quite satisfied with the outcome. I think we have the balance right. I am not trying to trivialise anything that the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, said. These are very serious matters.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000042"></a>My second point is that I take offence at what the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, said. The ombudsman's office is headed by a woman who got the job, I assume, on merit. She was appointed under the fair employment Act&#151;I would assume that every job at that level would come under that. However she got the job, I think it is wrong to personalise it by quoting her husband. If the wives of noble Lords sitting round this table were to say something and it was quoted elsewhere, they would probably say that it was drivel, so I do not think that we can lay something her husband said at the ombudsman&#146;s door. Everybody knows he is an all-Ireland man&#151;that is what he wants. I understand that she was appointed on merit. It is wrong to personalise it in that way.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000043"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0002.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="07022792000132"></a>Lord Maginnis of Drumglass:</b> I shall not detain the Committee long, but perhaps I can emphasise one point. Weeks before Op Ballast was made public, I talked about a leaking process. It was a leaking process through the press. Literally within 24 hours, the channels were able to run their programmes. Chris Moore on UTV had a programme on within 24 hours that had taken days or weeks to film, so there had been a break in confidentiality. One might have suspected that when one saw the SDLP leader in another place, Mark Durkan, jumping on the bandwagon and doing what any of us could have done.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000044"></a>The identities of three senior police officers were fairly lightly disguised. I worked with them and know them. They were straightforward, decent people. As three individuals, they did more than any other three to bring peace to Northern Ireland. They were named in another place by the leader of the SDLP as though they were criminals. There is no piece of paper that can answer that. That is the reality and that is what we face. Quite bluntly, I do not want to appear to be controversial, but I have to put it in these terms. If we undermine the faith of the majority of people&#151;by &#147;the majority of people&#148; I mean lots of people who have no political axe to grind, ordinary members of both traditions&#151;or we undermine the integrity of the law and the processes of the law, we thrust Northern Ireland back into the arms of the unscrupulous.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000045"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0002.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07022792000133"></a>Lord Molyneaux of Killead:</b> I shall be very brief. I do not disagree with much of what has been said. However, it is perhaps not generally known that before I arrived in this building, I had served as a justice of the peace for a good many years. There is a limit to matters that were discussed at that time, but I am increasingly horrified by the proof of present-day tampering with various aspects of the law to which, in those days, I was dedicated, as I still am. I leave it at that.</p>
<h5><a name="07022792000120"></a>4.30 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07022792000046"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0002.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07022792000134"></a>Baroness Amos:</b> I recognise the strength of feeling around policing issues in Northern Ireland. They remain a highly sensitive area, and are compounded by the fact that, because of the size of the population, everyone in Northern Ireland who operates in the public service tends to know everyone else and has a particular view about the ways in which that service is conducted. However, it is important to accept that the ombudsman met fully the competencies of the post and was appointed on merit. That does not mean that there should be no discussion of any issues or concerns requiring debate, but it is important that such discussions are conducted openly, transparently and in a way that is not personal. We all have a role to play in supporting transparency and accountability in Northern Ireland.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000047"></a>A number of noble Lords have talked about the Police Ombudsman this afternoon. It is important to make a couple of things very clear. First, the police in Great Britain are also subject to the double jeopardy provisions, so this is not specific to Northern Ireland: these provisions are for everyone, including the police in Great Britain.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000048"></a>On the question of who investigates, the Chief Constable investigates in Northern Ireland in the case of civilians. I also confirm that there is no time limit in respect of these issues, but the person to be retried must be capable of getting a fair trial. That is decided by the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland, as it is in England and Wales. So the order puts no new or specific provisions in place for Northern Ireland. Instead, it is bringing provision in Northern Ireland in line with that in England and Wales. The Police Ombudsman is the only legitimate authority for investigating police suspected of serious crimes, so the provisions to address double jeopardy will provide only the powers that are currently available to the Chief Constable. On the importance of reviewing those powers, the Government consistently monitor the powers of the Police Ombudsman, and will continue to do so.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000049"></a>As I said, the Article provides the Police Ombudsman with the same powers as the Chief Constable to make an application to the Director of Public Prosecutions to reinvestigate in certain circumstances persons acquitted of a qualifying offence. In the Police Ombudsman&#146;s case, that power would be used where police officers were previously acquitted. Some cases already require reinvestigation by the ombudsman, and have either been forwarded by the Chief Constable or are reinvestigated where a complaint has already been received.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000050"></a>The straight answer to the question whether this gives the Police Ombudsman additional powers is no. The Police Ombudsman is the only legitimate authority for investigating alleged criminal conduct by police officers. The Police Ombudsman therefore requires this statutory provision to ensure that she can fulfil her role of investigating police officers acquitted of a serious crime when new and compelling evidence has emerged. In essence, the provisions ensure that a common and equitable approach is adopted to the closure of all cases that require reinvestigation, regardless of whether they are conducted by the Chief Constable or the Police Ombudsman.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000051"></a>Some wider questions were asked about the role of the Police Ombudsman and about whether there would be additional resources for her as a result of this work. Evaluation of the budgetary needs of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is an ongoing process through assessment of annual budgetary estimates and programmes submitted by the office and in-year monitoring of expenditure in keeping with public expenditure accountability processes and requirements. Any additional costs would be subject to a detailed business case being made.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000052"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, asked a number of questions about the detail of the McCord Report. Given the Police Ombudsman&#146;s independent status, I do not think it appropriate for the Government to comment on how the ombudsman conducted her report or on specific details and points of the investigation. The Government are, however, concerned about the issues of collusion identified in the report. We support the Police Ombudsman and the Chief Constable in their proposals to address those concerns, and we are confident that appropriate and fair action will be taken to reinvestigate cases when new and compelling evidence comes to light. We of course recognise that final consent to reinvestigation will be made by the Director of Public Prosecutions. I appreciate that the retired police officers&#146; association has many concerns about how the ombudsman conducted the investigation and understand that a detailed report on those concerns may be forthcoming.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000053"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0002.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07022792000135"></a>Lord Maginnis of Drumglass:</b> I apologise for interrupting the noble Baroness. Can she define the word &#147;collusion&#148; for me? There is no such word in law. If it is something other than collusion, why are we not using those words? If it is conspiracy or something of that nature, why are there no charges? The Police Ombudsman can hide behind the word &#147;collusion&#148;, but Government cannot because the word does not exist in law.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000054"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0002.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07022792000136"></a>Baroness Amos:</b> If the report&#146;s publication and the allegations being made require further investigation which leads to any kind of criminal process, that will happen. This is not about moving immediately from a report and investigation to a criminal process. If there needs to be further investigation and cases need to be drawn to the attention of the appropriate authorities, that will happen. I am not sure that I entirely understand the noble Lord&#146;s point about defining collusion. &#147;Collusion&#148; is a word in the English dictionary and I have been aware of it for many years. I think that we all understand what it means. Does the noble Lord want to come back?</p>

As someone who has been a soldier in Northern Ireland, I may have allowed someone whom I know to be a terrorist to move freely with a loaded van from point A to point B so that I could intercept him at that point, while at the same protecting a terrorist who is compromised so that he may be of further use to me as an informant. That is collusion but not a crime. In legal terms&#151;I do not have to tell the noble Baroness about legal issues&#151;it could not result in me being charged with collusion. I am doing by job. I may collude&#151;and I understand the dictionary meaning of the word&#151;with the most dreadful terrorist who is supplying me with information. I assure the Minister that that is exactly what one did. One did not, however, conspire with the terrorist to kill someone else. Therein lies the difference. I do hope that she fully understands my point. I appeal to her again to speak to her colleagues&#151;who have huge experience, as I know after serving in Northern Ireland&#151;before she proceeds down this road.</p>

I know that he recognises that. Of course these issues need to be considered against the background of contextual issues; I think we all recognise that. But it is not for me or anyone around the table to make those judgments. We should leave them to the relevant authorities.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000057"></a>The noble Lord made other points about the cost of the ombudsman&#146;s office and its effectiveness. The noble Lord is smiling at me: I know that he knows that I will not agree with him. He took one figure for the overall cost of the ombudsman&#146;s office over six years, and then took one yardstick as a measurement of effectiveness and success. That is entirely inappropriate. The ombudsman&#146;s function is to deal with all complaints of misconduct against the police. We would all be extraordinarily concerned if, as a result of the investigations, a huge number of prosecutions was brought annually against individual members of the police service, because that would indicate an enormous failing in the police service.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000058"></a>We should note that, in the period mentioned by the noble Lord, the ombudsman&#146;s office has dealt with more than 21,000 complaints. That is a huge number of complaints. My noble friend Lady Blood alluded to the fact that part of the function of the Police Ombudsman is to work to ensure that complaints are properly investigated so that those who have made them feel secure in the knowledge that they have been listened to and investigated.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000059"></a>The most recent independent survey of the performance of the ombudsman&#146;s office indicates that 83 per cent of Protestants and 84 per cent of Catholics in Northern Ireland who responded thought that the ombudsman would ensure that the police do a good job. Of the police officers subjected to investigation by the ombudsman who responded to the survey, 85 per cent thought that they were treated fairly, and 73 per cent were satisfied or very satisfied with the way in which they were treated.</p>

We can produce fallacious figures such as those&#151;I am sorry that the Minister&#146;s advisers have given her such figures to articulate&#151;but when the Police Federation for Northern Ireland expresses a lack of confidence in the Police Ombudsman, as it did at its annual conference, I am more impressed by that than I am by various extractions that one or two civil servants may manage to accomplish.</p>

The noble Lord, Lord Maginnis, has one view; I have another. It is entirely appropriate that we are having this debate. It will not end here. As I said at the beginning of this discussion, policing in Northern Ireland remains, and will remain for a very long time, a highly sensitive and emotive issue. We all recognise the history, but part of the responsibility that we all have is to try to move this issue forward in a way that is helpful to the people of Northern Ireland. In doing that, I recognise that there will be real differences in the way that we interpret factual information. I do not in any way dispute that. This kind of discussion is part of the nature of our democracy.</p>

Has she read the oath of allegiance taken by members of the Garda Siochana and does she think it will be well received and appropriate within Northern Ireland? In the context of the increasing threat of international terrorism in which the United States and other countries wish to co-operate with intelligence services in the United Kingdom, will the powers of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland extend to matters of national security and, if so, would that not deter the United States and other countries from co-operating with the intelligence services of the United Kingdom? Finally, the noble Baroness, Lady Blood, totally misunderstood and misrepresented what I said. I made clear that a wife is not responsible for the political views of her husband, but he is a political activist working for the break-up of the United Kingdom to bring about a united Ireland and, as such, the Police Ombudsman&#146;s position is tainted in the eyes of the people of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000064"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0003.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="07022792000143"></a>Lord Trimble:</b> I shall not go into details&#151;though I may find some other way of communicating them to her&#151;but I can think of one incident where something in the ombudsman&#146;s report will compromise or make more difficult the activities of the intelligence services here in dealing with today&#146;s and tomorrow&#146;s terrorist threat. Their capability has been seriously affected by the revelation in that report of a particular aspect of the methodology being used here. I shall find some other way of communicating. It is not wise to go further on this matter.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000065"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0003.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="07022792000144"></a>Baroness Amos:</b> I look forward to having that discussion with the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, outside the Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Smith, asked me about community support officers and raised particular questions about their training. CSOs will undertake training in a range of issues relevant to their role, including training in their powers, human rights, personal safety, interacting with people&#151;a particular concern of the noble Lord&#151;problem solving, diversity, managing evidence and first aid. It is anticipated that the initial training period for CSOs will last five to six weeks.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000066"></a>Only six powers will be conferred on CSOs on introduction and the power to detain will not be one of them at that stage. The powers are: to acquire name and address for relevant offences; to confiscate alcohol from young persons and dispose of it; to seize tobacco from young persons and dispose of it; to enter and search premises for the purpose of saving life or limb or preventing serious damage to property; to direct traffic and place traffic signs; and to enforce cordoned areas for the purposes of a terrorist investigation. These are the six areas that the Police Service of Northern Ireland considers will produce the most immediate impact on the ground. There is a strong view that if we conferred the full range of powers at the outset, it would delay the introduction of CSOs.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000067"></a>On staff custody officers, hundreds of experienced police sergeants are currently acting as custody officers in Great Britain. Three hundred and fifty are in the PSNI at a time when front-line supervisory experience is at a premium. Allowing appropriately trained and capable police staff to perform the role will allow experienced officers to be redeployed to front-line supervisory duties and to extend the options for DCU commanders and chief officers to have a wider pool of police and staff available to them.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000068"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, talked about the appointment of constables with special policing skills. The Police Service of Northern Ireland has experienced a loss of specialist skills, particularly at the rank of detective constable. There are currently 97 vacancies, and the Policing Board and the Chief Constable are pressing for these provisions to be brought forward as a matter of urgency. Article 10 reintroduces Section 23 of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2003, allowing for the appointment of constables who have a specified policing skill. We anticipate that the officers are likely to come from other UK police services and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000069"></a>The noble Lord asked me specifically if I had read the oath of allegiance. I have not.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000070"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0003.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="07022792000145"></a>Lord Kilclooney:</b> I was not talking about the oath of allegiance. I rather suspected that the Minister had not read it; it needs to be considered in further detail. On the employment of constables from forces in the United Kingdom and specifically the Republic of Ireland, there is a rule in the PSNI, as the Minister knows, that 50 per cent of the new members must not be Roman Catholics. Will the employment of police officers from the Republic of Ireland comply with that rule?</p>

<p><a name="07022792000071"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0003.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="07022792000146"></a>Baroness Amos:</b> I am not aware that that rule will apply in this case, but if I am wrong and if I can expand on that answer in any way, I will write to the noble Lord.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000072"></a>The noble Lord also asked me about the powers of the Police Ombudsman with respect to matters of national security. My understanding is that the ombudsman can gain access to the information that she needs from the security services to enable her to carry out her role as a Police Ombudsman. I am not aware of the Police Ombudsman having a wider role in issues of national security. She therefore has discretion to establish relationships with the oversight bodies of the security services and to draw to their attention to any concerns that arise through her investigations. However, I am not aware of the Police Ombudsman having that wider role with respect to national security considerations.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="07022792000002"></a>Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146; Compensation) (Payment of Claims) (Amendment) Regulations 2007</h3>
<h5><a name="07022792000122"></a>4.54 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07022792000075"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0003.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="07022792000147"></a>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146; Compensation) (Payment of Claims) (Amendment) Regulations 2007. <I>7th Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I></p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000076"></a>The noble Baroness said: I confirm that these provisions are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The regulations are being made under the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146; Compensation) Act 1979, and their purpose is to increase by 3.6 per cent the amounts of compensation to those who first satisfy all the conditions of entitlement on or after 1 April 2007.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000077"></a>It may help if I very briefly explain the history and purpose of the Act. An employer can of course be sued by people suffering from an industrial disease contracted from their work with that employer. However, the diseases covered by the Act take a long time to develop and may not be diagnosed until 20, 40 or even 60 years after exposure. By then, the employer may no longer exist. It is therefore unsurprising that there can be difficulty in obtaining compensation. Parliament brought the legislation into force to help those people. The Act provides for lump-sum payments to be made to sufferers from certain dust-related diseases, or their dependants. The three main conditions of entitlement are: that the person is entitled to industrial injuries disablement benefit; that there is no relevant employer who can be sued; and that no court action has been brought, or any compensation received, in respect of any of the diseases for which a person is claiming under the Act. The scheme covers a number of respiratory diseases, but around 70 per cent of claims paid under the scheme are for those suffering from mesothelioma. This is an extremely severe form of cancer and is invariably terminal within a short time. The average payment to sufferers is around &#163;14,000. The scheme has been very successful. Payments of &#163;21 million were made in the last year alone.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000078"></a>On 29 January this year, the Government issued a consultation paper seeking views on the current state support for industrial injuries. Although I cannot pre-empt any conclusions of the review, I can say that all suggestions will be carefully considered and that nothing is being excluded. The Committee may also be aware that there was a separate consultation last year on the level of state support for people suffering from mesothelioma. A mesothelioma summit is planned for 13 March this year, when the options for moving forward will be discussed.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000079"></a>More specifically, we are also looking at improving claims handling for mesothelioma to ensure that, wherever possible, people with mesothelioma can receive compensation in life so that they can benefit from it while knowing that their families will be more secure in the future. The scheme forms only a small part of government measures on asbestosis. Significant improvements have also been made to health and safety procedures to prevent future exposure.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000080"></a>Finally, all of us understand that no amount of money can ever compensate those unfortunate people for their suffering and loss, but the regulations do ensure that the compensation provided maintains its value. I commend the uprating of the payment scales to the Committee.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000081"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers&#146; Compensation) (Payment of Claims) (Amendment) Regulations 2007. <I>7th Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I>&#151;(<I>Baroness Morgan of Drefelin.</I>)</p>
<h5><a name="07022792000123"></a>5 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07022792000082"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0003.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="07022792000148"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> Before I was quite correctly interrupted by the Lord Chairman, I was going to thank the Minister for explaining the regulations so clearly. Perhaps I should also thank the Lord Chairman for shutting me up at the appropriate moment. In retrospect, I should also like to thank the officials for preparing a very comprehensive reply to many of my questions on last year&#146;s pneumoconiosis operating order, which was signed by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, on 7 March last. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, for his letter of 22 February, announcing the imminent debate of the regulations. The noble Baroness can be reassured that I shall be brief. These dust-borne diseases from which some people suffer by reason of their employment are horrible in the extreme. Many years ago, a cousin of mine married a man who, before the Second World War, returned from Japan with the equivalent of a quarter of a lung, having been a prisoner there, so I know, admittedly at second hand, how people cope with breathing and talking difficulties. However, we are talking here about industrial diseases rather than the afflictions of war pensioners. Nevertheless, the results are identical and, as the noble Baroness has said, progressive. In many cases, they result in cancer of the lung and, ultimately, death.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000083"></a>Parliament, in the dying days of the previous Labour Government in 1979, enacted the legislation underlying the regulations to provide a measure of compensation to those who could not claim either from their employers, past or present, or, if the latter had ceased trading, from their insurance company. As I understand it, insurance companies have to keep records for 60 years, but I would be grateful if the noble Baroness could confirm that. My point is that employers are the first port of call for sufferers, followed by their insurance companies, and only if recourse to them fails does the state come in, as the noble Baroness said. Obviously that reduces the number who need to come to the state for aid in this matter.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000084"></a>Last year, therefore, it was a surprise when I was told that the number of claimants had actually risen. Some 1,989 claims were dealt with by Jobcentre Plus between April 2005 and January 2006, of which 1,774 were successful. One would expect, with modern medical knowledge and the various environment laws that we now have, that the number of claims would reduce over time. What are the current claims and success rates? It would be useful to have a breakdown of the age of claimants and whether they were primary or secondary dependants. We would then have some guidance on what the future holds.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000085"></a>I know that the Government have been conducting a review of the current industrial injuries benefit scheme, and I would be grateful for information on their conclusions, which they should have reached by now. I am tempted to revisit this subject, or the possible relationship between sufferers from the various diseases in the regulations, and the new ESA, but I shall resist that temptation for now, although you might hear it tomorrow. One can never quite tell.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000086"></a>Last but not least, I congratulate the Government on producing the regulations. The Act, as the Government know well, says that these do not have to be uprated every year. If memory serves me right, they did so in 2004 and last year, with a gap in between. Now they have done so for 2007-08. They have done well for a small group of people who suffer from the most horrible of ailments. The whole welfare regime is currently in the melting pot. It is absolutely right that the Government should look at it again, as well as at sufferers of these dust-borne diseases.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000087"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0003.htm_spnew10"></a><a name="07022792000149"></a>Lord Livsey of Talgarth:</b> I am aware of the problems on the ground. In my constituency, when I was in another place, quite a number of miners suffered from pneumoconiosis. They worked in the anthracite fields of south-west Wales. If one meets any of those gentlemen in their own homes, one understands that they can hardly breathe. It is a very serious and distressing matter indeed.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000088"></a>There are three points that I would like to make. There is a useful table in the schedule, which gives the age breakdown and the amounts of money paid. Where it is lacking as far as I can see&#151;perhaps the Minister will correct me&#151;is that there are no statistics for the number of people involved, just their ages and the payments made. I raise that issue because I would like to know the number of miners and their widows who have applied for the payments but have not yet received them. In the constituency of Roger Williams MP, my successor in the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency, one former miner has been waiting six and a half years for payments. Indeed, there are many other cases that I know of where justice is not being done. It is a very vexed question.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000089"></a>I know that the regulations are not specifically about people who have not received payments to which they may be entitled. None the less, I welcome the regulations, because the uprating, as the Conservative spokesman has said, is right and just progress, with payments being made to those who are entitled to them. The Leader of the House, in answer to a question in the other place, indicated that there are over half a million people involved in this in Wales and that &#163;3 billion been paid out to the miners. That is highly creditable, but there are people who are still waiting, and it would be nice to know what is happening to them.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000090"></a>There are several other categories that do not appear to qualify. On 22 November 2006, Don Touhig, the Member for Islwyn in the other place, asked about surface workers and whether they were entitled to assistance. The Minister may not be able to answer. He was offered a meeting with the Prime Minister about that. I do not know what the outcome was, and I do not necessarily expect the Minister to be able to reply to that question here today, but perhaps she could do so in writing.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000091"></a>I have asked about surface workers who do not appear to qualify, but those who worked in privately owned mines do not appear to qualify either, even those who worked part time in those mines and perhaps worked for the NCB for the rest of the time. Is there one compensation rule for former NCB employees and another for those who worked in private mines who do not appear to qualify? Those may be misconceptions on my part, but they are certainly matters that cause great concern in the communities concerned. After all, if employees with dust-related diseases who work for private companies and are affected by asbestosis qualify, why is it apparent that miners who worked in the private sector do not appear to qualify? I may be wrong about that, but if these are misconceptions, I would like them to be cleared up. If they cannot be cleared up here today, perhaps they can be cleared up in a letter.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000092"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0003.htm_spnew11"></a><a name="07022792000150"></a>Lord Jones:</b> I am glad to follow my noble friend Lord Livsey, who speaks with insight on these matters. In another place, I heard over a number of years how he took an interest in the very serious problem that beset Wales. We all work together for the greater good to help to alleviate distress in families throughout Wales. I also thank the Minister for her introduction of the regulations. I support them, and the increased payments are to be welcomed. The regulations are clearly beneficial and well-intentioned. It is good that the scheme is under review. Perhaps there will be a positive outcome that encompasses those families that are currently excluded.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000093"></a>I would like to put on record my appreciation, with context in mind, of the decisions of the Wilson and Callaghan Administrations that moved to investigate the associated illnesses in the stated industries and then legislated to bring about compensation and just solutions. I declare an interest as a serving Minister in those 1970s Administrations. It is very good that the current Administration have decided to uprate annually. I have a particular interest today in the fortunes of the slate quarrymen, most of whom are in north-west Wales. How much money has been allocated to the slate quarrymen suffering from dust? How much has been paid since inception? How many individuals have been in the scheme, and how many remain after all these years? When will the consultation, which is about to start, report? What is the average compensation payment to the slate quarrymen? How many lump sums and how many weekly payments are being or have been paid in recent years?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000094"></a>The <I>Hansard</I> of the 22 February sitting of the Third Delegated Legislation Committee in another place repays examination. I have a context in mind. Mr Jeff Ennis, the MP for Barnsley, described how his grandfather in Grimethorpe, who was a miner, had to retire at 42 because of his dust-related disease. He lived until he was in his mid-70s, but there was always a cylinder of oxygen and an oxygen mask by his bed and his armchair. It is not for nothing that the mining community refer to it as a &#147;lingering death&#148;. Using that dramatic phrase emphasises the humanity of the situation. I am so glad that the Government have advanced to a point where they have done something about it. I hope that my remarks are regarded as positive.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000095"></a>In the debate, Jeff Ennis was followed by Mr Dennis Skinner, a well known man, who weighed in to give the history of the legislation as only he could. He entered the other place, as I did, in 1970. He subjected the regulations to his fierce scrutiny. He inveighed against lawyers; if I may say that without making a particularly pointed reference. He was very strong on it. Mr Paddy Tipping MP described how for 50 years in his constituency asbestos dust had blown from the factory into the streets and in all probability into the houses.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000096"></a>I am glad that we have advanced and that we have this very positive measure here today. I am glad that the slate quarrymen of north-west Wales have obtained justice and that they and their dependants have been admitted into the scheme. It took some doing to get the slate quarrymen admitted into the scheme. The context of that relates to 1978 when, as a Wales Office Minister, I went from Westminster via Bangor to Anglesey, to the home of Elwyn Jones, a retired solicitor, who over a generation ago advised slate quarrymen of the north-west on how to obtain compensation payments. He was retired and elderly in his flat on the banks of the Menai Strait. After I saw him that day, I went to the Transport and General Workers&#146; Union office in Caernarfon by the harbour, where I met Tom Jones, another Welshman, who had brought many cases on behalf of the slate quarrymen to Mr Elwyn Jones to raise in the courts. Elwyn Jones had been a Member of Parliament until he lost his seat in 1951.

<a name="70227-gc0003.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000097"></a>It may help if I give further context for debates in the years ahead. There is a quarry in Blaenau Ffestiniog called Llechwedd where thousands of quarrymen were employed and the world&#146;s largest slate quarry was at Llanberis. Those two quarries produced most of the cases that were brought to Elwyn Jones and Mr Tom Jones at the Transport and General Workers&#146; office. National Museum Wales now has a museum of slate quarrying in Llanberis. If any Member of the Committee is interested and wishes to see slate tiles being made, they can because there is a daily demonstration by a retired slate quarryman. One can see how the dust would enter the lungs of those engaged in the process. Llechwedd is underground and the quarrymen had to bring their own candles to work in the dark and unpleasant conditions. I thought I should emphasise these matters so that the Committee can take some of the history into account. The late Lord Cledwyn&#151;Cledwyn Hughes&#151;had a significant part in advancing the legislation that assisted slate quarrymen in 1979. Additionally, the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons at that time, an AUEW man, came to this House and played a distinguished part in advancing the cause of those who suffered from the dust. I welcome the regulations. I think they are very good. I am glad that the money has been increased, and I urge the Minister to advance the inquiry as fast as she can and come forward with proposals to enable more families to have the relief they deserve.</p>

I also thank noble Lords for adding a little humanity to our discussions. Regulations can sometimes seem a dry, dull collection of words and numbers, and it is easy to forget that we are talking about the traumatic experiences of real people who have a life-shortening disease and real challenges to face. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for his kind words.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000099"></a>Insurance companies are required to keep their records for 60 years, which is important in the situation that we are talking about today. My noble friend Lord Jones and the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, asked about the Government&#146;s review of industrial injuries disablement benefit. Ministers have asked for a review of the current IIDB scheme to ensure that it meets the needs of our modern society and is compatible with the Government&#146;s broader welfare reform agenda. A consultation document was published on 29 January, and the consultation period will end on 22 April, so it is still open. The Government will be considering all the issues that come out of it.</p>

<p><a name="07022792000100"></a>I was asked why the number of cases of mesothelioma is still rising. Mesothelioma has a long latency period, and it can be 40 years or more before the disease becomes apparent. According to the epidemiological analysis of the disease, it has not yet reached its peak, so we will see a continuance of that trend for some years. It will continue to be a very important issue. Therefore, the numbers will rise.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000101"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, asked about the numbers of sufferers and dependants with outstanding claims. I do not have the information on the split between sufferers&#146; and dependants&#146; claims, but I will write to the noble Lord with the information as soon as I can after this debate. In terms of the numbers of miners being paid under the scheme, we are not aware of any claims outstanding, certainly not for more than six years, but my team of officials behind me will investigate that.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000102"></a>The question of surface workers is very important. The Industrial Injuries Advisory Council is considering surface workers, and the report should be published shortly. Miners in privately owned mines should be covered by the 1979 Act scheme unless the existence of a private employer means that they would not benefit from the scheme. If the employer is still in existence, they would not fulfil the criteria of the scheme. My noble friend Lord Jones asked questions about quarrymen, such as how many of them have been paid in total and what the sum in total paid to them has been. Unfortunately, we do not collect data on the occupations of people who we pay, and we therefore cannot supply that information. I was very grateful to my noble friend for reminding us why the Act came into being in the first place. The original intention was to respond to the extremely pressing concern to provide compensation for workers suffering from dust-induced diseases. The average payment from the scheme is currently set at around &#163;14,000. The scales are set out in the regulations to identify the levels of payment according to the age of the claimant. They are not about the numbers of people claiming; they are about the levels that people might receive, depending on their age and disability.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000103"></a>I remind noble Lords that there are two very interesting consultations going on; the IIDB review and the mesothelioma summit on 13 March, as I have mentioned. That will be very important, given the rising numbers of people with mesothelioma, as it will look at how the state support system can best meet the needs of those very important people. I am sure that we all agree on the importance of the 1979 Act and the need to uprate the amounts paid, as we have discussed today. The Act provides some assistance for those affected by these devastating diseases who cannot get compensation through the courts.</p>

There is a long latent period; it takes 40 years or longer, and 40 years ago we did not have the knowledge that we have now. Obviously, if that answer is not comprehensive enough, I will be happy to write to the noble Lord.</p>

<h3 align="center"><a name="07022792000003"></a>Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order 2007</h3>
<h5><a name="07022792000125"></a>5.25 pm</h5>

<p><a name="07022792000107"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0004.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07022792000154"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Lord McKenzie of Luton)</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order 2007. <I>7th Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I></p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000108"></a>The noble Lord said: I will speak also to the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2007. I am satisfied that the orders are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order will, as usual, increase most national insurance benefits by the retail prices index, which is 3.6 per cent, and will increase most income-related benefits by Rossi, an index that excludes rent, mortgage interest, council tax and depreciation, which is 3 per cent.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000109"></a>The Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order sets out the amount by which contracted-out occupational pension schemes must increase members&#146; guaranteed minimum pensions which accrued between 1988 and 1997. Where the annual increase in the retail prices index exceeds 3 per cent, the guaranteed minimum pensions indexation requirement is capped at that level under the primary legislation. This year&#146;s order therefore provides for an increase of 3 per cent.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000110"></a>This year&#146;s uprating adds over &#163;3.5 billion to government spending and reinforces our commitment to tackle poverty by helping those most in need and to build an active welfare state. The order provides for an extra &#163;2.48 billion for pensioners, of which &#163;300 million is above inflation, and an extra &#163;560 million for disabled people and carers. We now spend over &#163;10 billion a year more on pensioners than if we had simply continued the policies that we inherited in 1997, and pensioner incomes have risen across the board, with the poorest benefiting the most. We have lifted more than 2 million pensioners out of absolute poverty, and 1 million out of relative poverty. Indeed, we have now reached a position in which pensioners are less likely to be poor than the population as a whole, breaking the historic correlation between poverty and old age. We now need to maintain that achievement, and in the Pensions Bill, which has now completed its Committee stage in another place, we will legislate to ensure that the progress we have made for today&#146;s pensioners is locked in for tomorrow&#146;s pensioners.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000111"></a>We will only truly eliminate inequality in retirement when we eliminate inequality in working life. That is why our welfare reforms and our aspiration for an 80 per cent employment rate are so important and why we are so committed to tackling entrenched poverty and disadvantage. Ten years ago, nearly 6 million adults in this country were dependent on benefits, and with that benefit dependency came poverty. The number of children living in poverty doubled. Today, child poverty is falling faster than anywhere in the EU. Since 1997, 800,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty, and 2 million out of absolute poverty.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000112"></a>Tax credits are now benefiting around 6 million families and 10 million children. From April this year, families with children will be, on average, &#163;1,550 a year better off in real terms than in 1997, while those in the poorest fifth will be on average &#163;3,450 a year better off. That support goes hand in hand with the other measures that are designed to give working families the support that they need. In 1997, paid maternity leave lasted for 16 weeks. From April, it will rise from six to nine months, and by the end of this Parliament we intend to extend statutory maternity pay and maternity allowance to a full year.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="07022792000113"></a>Of course, there is more to do if we are to eradicate child poverty, and we will continue to look at what more the Government can do to help those most in need, but ultimately it is the opportunity to work that provides the only long-term, sustainable anti-poverty strategy. That is why this Government&#146;s approach to tackling poverty has been about maximising opportunities to work. It is why we created the national minimum wage and tax credits to make work pay, why we have invested in Jobcentre Plus and the New Deal to help people find work, and have maintained a strong economy that sees everyone sharing in the benefits of record economic growth. Today more people are in work than ever before. Employment is up by more than 2.5 million since 1997 and is up in every region of the UK.</p>

Our Welfare Reform Bill will build upon that success. It will deliver on our commitment to reform incapacity benefits while ensuring security for those who cannot work. Together with our city strategy, it will offer a new approach to delivering employment services to some of our most disadvantaged communities.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000007"></a>Our disability rights legislation, which is the most comprehensive of any European country to date, and our age discrimination legislation are breaking down the cultural and discriminatory barriers facing disabled people and older workers. Our future success in tackling poverty and worklessness will depend on our ability now to build on a decade of progress, towards our aspiration of a fair and inclusive society that offers opportunity and independence for all. This year&#146;s uprating measures move us further towards that aspiration. They reinforce our commitments to tackle poverty and exclusion, and to ensure security in retirement. I commend the orders to the Committee.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000008"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order 2007. <I>7th Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I>&#151; (<I>Lord McKenzie of Luton</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="070227104000009"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0004.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="070227104000173"></a>Lord Skelmersdale:</b> I am again grateful to the Government for introducing these orders and I note the change of voice and tone in that introduction. I should apologise to the Committee. If we go on&#151;I suspect that we will&#151;beyond 6.05 pm, I am afraid that I have an unavoidable commitment which I cannot break. Therefore, I will not be here at the end of the debate. My noble friend will of course remain.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000010"></a>The uprating order is, as usual, predictable and follows precisely the autumn uprating statement. So we have known since September by how much the various national insurance benefits would rise&#151;that is, 3.6 per cent&#151;and most income-related benefits will rise by 3 per cent, which, as the Minister has said, is inflation stripped of rent, mortgage interest, council tax and depreciation&#151;the so-called Rossi index. The guaranteed minimum pensions order rates the contracted-out final salary schemes by the same amount.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000011"></a>On reading the Minister&#146;s colleague&#146;s speech in another place, it surprised me just what was going on. Where the annual increase in the retail price index exceeds 3 per cent, uprating of the guaranteed pensions indexation is limited to 3 per cent, even though last year&#146;s RPI was 3.6 per cent. The latter figure is made up by comparing prices of a standard shopping basket with mortgage interest added in.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000012"></a>I suspect that few people will recognise the figure of 3.6 per cent. Certainly, my son's employers do not. He works in London as a back-room boy for a bank and is paid a basic salary, with no extra payment based on his own efforts. He cannot be compared with, say, some of your Lordships in the financial world. His pay rise was 6 per cent, which, interestingly, is what pensioners believe is on average their extra cost of living over the past year. This is hardly surprising when the cost of heating fuel, council tax and petrol is considered.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000013"></a>Given the Office for National Statistics&#146;s new website, where people can work out their own inflation rate using a questionnaire of 23 items, I wonder whether the official basket of prices could be altered. Can I issue a plea that all the information given by those who use the website should be added together and averaged out, so that we can see the true position? I of course accept that this would be rough and ready, but it would be no more rough and ready than the RPI. However, it would be much more representative of what is actually happening, even though it would depend on who actually uses the website. It would be skewed for example if it was mostly used by pensioners or young working people.</p>
<h5><a name="070227104000164"></a>5.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000014"></a>However, the official basket takes no account of whether people actually buy the products and services in that basket. Even using this basket, RPI stands at a nine-year high of 3.6 per cent. I suppose that it is the Rossi index of 3 per cent that is nearest to the cost-price index used by the Bank of England to  set interest rates. Given that the Chancellor has instructed the bank to keep the CPI at 2 per cent, it is hardly surprising that interest rates are on the rise. Will the RPI continue to rise? The Minister will probably duck that question by saying, as I used to in his position, that he never answers hypothetical questions. What he can and should answer, however, is what the monthly RPI figures were from October 2006 to January 2007, which will give us a guide on what to expect in the autumn uprating statement.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000015"></a>I would like to make three points about the uprating order and I am rather surprised that the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments did not raise my first point. Regulation 6 gives the dates of when the various upratings will start. My question refers to paragraph (5), which states:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070227104000160"></a>&#147;Any increases in the sums specified for ... (iii) carer&#146;s allowance (except in a case where the Secretary of State has made arrangements for it to be paid on a Wednesday) ... shall ... take effect on 9th April 2007&#148;.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070227104000156"></a>There are two Wednesdays&#151;one immediately before and one immediately after&#151;close to 9 April; namely, 4 and 11 April. Which one is being referred to? My guess is 11 April, but it is by no means clear and I find it rather strange drafting.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000016"></a>The Minister&#146;s colleague told another place:</p>
<ul>
<p class="tabletext"><a name="070227104000161"></a>&#147;The order provides an extra &#163;2.48 billion to pensioners ... and an extra &#163;560 million to disabled people and carers&#148;.&#151;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/2/07; col. 42.]</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="070227104000157"></a>I am no mathematician, but I took advice from one of my noble friends who concluded that that added up to &#163;3.04 billion. However, this order provides for more than an extra &#163;3.5 billion in departmental expenditure on benefits, which leaves a gap of some &#163;500 million. On what will this be spent?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000017"></a>Actually spending all this money depends on take-up. We have known for a long time that pensioners are particularly bad at taking up the benefits to which they are entitled. This also applies to other sectors, not least those who would be eligible for council tax and housing benefits. How much of last year&#146;s budget was underspent, and what have Ministers done to correct that? One of the normal reasons for low take-up of benefits is the huge complication of the forms that need to be completed by the applicant. I know that there have been sporadic attempts to shorten them and that some in the past have won plain English awards. What progress has been made in the past year on this most desirable objective?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000018"></a>Towards the end of his speech, the Minister rather boasted of some things of which the Government are proud which were outside the remit of this order. So I shall do exactly the same thing. Last but not least, I read, as I expect did the Minister, last year's debate and noted in particular my noble friend Lord Howard of Rising's point about what is not in the order; namely, the over-80 age allowance. This has been set at 25p a week since decimalisation. It is true to say that it has never been uprated by any Government since it was introduced, nor has there been any suggestion that it should be abandoned. Since Ministers tell us that no single pensioner needs to live on less that &#163;119.05 a week&#151;if the pension credit is taken up, which it is not, of course, by more than 1.5 million pensioners&#151;25p represents only a smidgeon over 0.05 per cent over that sum. Is it not time that the Government who, as we established during our discussion on the previous order, are reviewing the whole of the welfare scene, gave this some thought? That said, I, and the millions of people who are affected by these orders, welcome them.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000019"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0004.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070227104000174"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> I am very pleased to follow the noble Lord. I concur with much of what he has said. The orders, particularly the Social Security Benefits Up-rating Order 2007, are standing features of the annual parliamentary calendar. The good news for the Grand Committee is that we can ask the same questions every year. The bad news for the Minister is that he has to try to answer them.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000020"></a>I shall concentrate for a moment on process. It is a shame&#151;and my experience over time, although it is not the Government&#146;s fault&#151;that the uprating process has become an annual ritual. That means simply that people assume that the customers or claimants, or whatever you like to call them, are being looked after merely by the implementation of the annual uprating for the cost of living. Although that is obviously true so far as it goes, the difference between the average earnings index and the retail price index has some quite dramatic effects over time. It is easy to forget those because the uprating order is annual. Annually, the slippage by itself is minimal. Over years, however, it can be substantial.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000021"></a>The really important process question, which I have posed before and which has perplexed me for a long time, is just exactly what corporate knowledge the department applies each year to this process. I suspect that it is an Excel spreadsheet on someone&#146;s desktop computer. A Rossi index, an RPI index or an average earnings index is put in and an answer comes out, which is the uprating statement. I hope that that is not true. I understand that a piece of business-like work needs to be done, and that one cannot think about it all or calculate it all afresh from first principles every year. However, Section 150 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to review the level of benefits annually to determine whether they have retained their value relative to the general level of prices. If one considers that question in the context of today&#151;as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, has rightly pointed out&#151;customers or claimants this year face council tax rises, fuel costs and other such matters.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000022"></a>It would cause me some concern if the process applied by the department to reach the figures in the orders is nothing more than the uprating formula being applied and that that is all that is involved. That would be a shame. It would also be a dereliction of duty&#151;not according to the letter of the law, because one could argue that Section 150 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 was being fulfilled, but in spirit. As I say, if that approach is taken by virtue of neglect, inequality will become entrenched over the years and financial disadvantage will grow. Over 25 or 30 years, unintended consequences are bound to emerge for whatever Government are in power. I would like to think that some of the pointy heads in the department who think about these things carefully&#151;I know they are high quality people; &#147;pointy heads&#148; is a term of endearment, not abuse&#151;are looking carefully at some of the underlying factors so that we can deal with the longer-term consequences of some of these things.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000023"></a>The figure that overhangs this debate is the 4.4 per cent increase in the July average earnings index. That is what is happening to sons who are bankers, although perhaps bankers are paid better than other people. We all hope that there has been a general increase in the country&#146;s wealth. Indeed, the Government arguably have an economic story to tell, and I acknowledge the progress that has been made. Many of the benefits of that have been put in the direction of alleviating child and pensioner poverty, which is all very good so far as it goes. However, it is self-evident that if the wealth of the nation is increasing and floats everyone up, the tax take increases as a result. The default position should therefore almost be the average earnings index and not the RPI.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000024"></a>The other thing that perplexes me, which is built into the formula in Section 150 of the Social Security Administration Act 1992 and has been built up piecemeal over the years, is the differential between the list of benefits with a statutory requirement to be uprated and those without such a requirement. Benefits with the statutory requirement, as I am sure the Committee will know, embrace such things as the attendance allowance and the disability living allowance. Benefits without a statutory requirement include child benefit, housing benefit and jobseeker&#146;s allowance. There is no longer any rationale for that difference. There were good reasons at the time why these benefits all came into these categories individually, but we should seriously consider the whole situation and say that every benefit should be statutorily uprated. There is a prima facie case for saying that the default uprating level should be the average earnings index. I do not say that as a spokesman for my party, because I am not; I am simply interested in the subject.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000025"></a>The rationale is that the Government&#146;s own ambitious targets will never be reached unless we embrace some elements of both these things over the distance. The child poverty target for 2010 is certainly on course to be missed. It will certainly not be met for 2020 unless serious attention is given in Budgets, uprating statements and Pre-Budget Statements in forthcoming years. These are the kinds of things that policy makers in the department will have to wrestle with if the Government&#146;s own targets are to be met. Government spokesmen may throw this back in the faces of opposition spokesmen&#151;that happens more in the other place, which is the best place for it; it is handled much more elegantly here in my experience, which is not yet that great&#151;but the argument that you are just spending money and cannot account for it is not the way to look at it. The way to look at it is to ask what ambitious targets the Government are setting and whether the current plans meet, or are likely to meet, those targets. I do not think that they are. That is a matter of concern in our uprating debate this afternoon.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000026"></a>I want to know what the department is planning. The Social Security Advisory Committee has a body of expertise that could help us to understand some of these things, and it could be invited to review these matters. Sir David Freud is helping the department with some implementation issues. I am not sure whether one of the tasks that he has been given is to look at the built-in inequality in the current uprating statement and process, but it is certainly a question that could be considered. Another question that really needs to be considered is what is not in the order. Ministers can easily make a good case, as the Minister has done, for the progress that has been made, but someone&#151;it was not me; I am not that much of an anorak&#151;counted 464 benefits, tapers, premiums and allowances in the order. I just want to make it clear that I did not count them myself; I simply pass it on for what it is worth. A hundred and thirty of those have not been uprated at all: 130 thresholds, disregards and other levels that are set have been frozen. They have been frozen over the years, as I have said earlier. If benefits, premiums and thresholds are frozen, particularly the capital thresholds and allowances, there is a loss over time, which people really begin to feel, particularly in our more disadvantaged families. We need to look at that very carefully.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000027"></a>The Minister did not mention&#151;I am not surprised&#151;the healthy nature of the National Insurance Fund. Noble Lords might like to look at the back of page 28 of the Government Actuary&#146;s most recent report, which shows that we have a surplus of &#163;4.2 billion in the current annual year, going up to &#163;10 billion in 2011-12. There is no pressure, particularly on contributory benefits and the flexibility available to the Government. Although the Minister parades his generosity, there is a lot more flexibility behind the Government&#146;s position, should he choose to use it.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0004.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000028"></a>Some of the frozen thresholds and premiums I was talking about could easily have been accommodated, even if it was on a rolling programme looking at a series of benefits. We have just finished looking at an important order on pneumoconiosis, a welcome initiative that the Government took of their own volition. They used their discretion and uprated the awards to that cohort of deserving claimants. Over a rolling programme, they should exercise that discretion over a slightly wider area.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000029"></a>I mainly concur with the important speech of the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, about means testing on two points. I do not count up 464 benefits, but I read these orders and have been doing so for a long time. They are getting worse. They are getting more and more difficult to understand, even for anoraks like me. The noble Lord gets high points for noticing the date mistake. Unless you are a parliamentary draftsman with access to a law library, you have no way of making any sense of the explanatory section of these orders. The tables are comprehensive and welcome, because they can be compared year to year, but the text explaining the law is now incomprehensible. Something has to be done. I do not know what the benefits simplification unit is doing, but the Opposition are asking for results and some kind of outcome in every debate on this important subject. A degree of consolidation, if not simplification, would certainly make these orders more sensible. Finally, I have serious reservations about some of the effects that the means testing and&#151;a personal bugbear of mine&#151;the conditionality creeping into our system, piecemeal, by the back door, will have, particularly if that trend continues.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000030"></a>The order is welcome. The Government&#146;s position is understandable and their progress acknowledged. However, I, for one, would like to try to understand with colleagues what process the department is applying to get to these published orders, so that we can all better understand what is behind the documents before the Grand Committee this afternoon. If I do not get an answer this year, I shall be back next year.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000031"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0005.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070227104000175"></a>Baroness Hollis of Heigham:</b> I cannot resist responding to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, about RPI and so on. There is clearly a fairly automated process, because Parliament thought it the most appropriate balance between incentives into work and the rest.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000032"></a>I am sure that the noble Lord is right that unless one intervenes, as with pensioners and disabled people, then the gap between RPI and earnings widens each year. On any relative, as opposed to absolute, measure of poverty, this means that you increase the number of poor by definition, even though their benefits are increasing. Unlike the noble Lord, I think the answer is not to raise benefits but encourage more people into work: the welfare to work agenda. You could increase benefits by &#163;10 or &#163;20 per head per week and people would still be poor, bumping along and unable to manage their finances.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000033"></a>My noble friend made much of the welfare to work agenda in his introduction, and I throw in a comment or two about the thing he left out, as others have said, which is the earnings disregard. We all know that people who work are better off than people who do not work. We know that the best predictor of people coming into the labour market and getting a substantial job is that they have done a mini-job, possibly under 16 hours, the year before. Let us think about the social security system we have constructed. It is man-made&#151;it was made not by God but by men. If you are a lone parent, for whom there is a &#163;20 earnings disregard, you keep every penny for the first three hours you work. From three to 16 hours you have 100 per cent deductions, and after 16 hours&#151;Nirvana!&#151;you switch to tax credits and your income is suddenly doubled. That is crazy. We should be saying that you are better off for each and every hour you work; not dichotomies&#151;out of work, in work, with a little tinkering of earnings disregard&#151;but a dial. So, if you work six hours you get more income than if you work two; if you work 10 hours, you get more than if you work six. At 16 hours, instead of benefit being the core onto which you have income banded, you would have income being the core from which benefit then gets taken away. That is the right way to go, so that every hour of work encourages you to work another because you have an incentive to do so.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000034"></a>That is the bigger point. In that context, earnings disregards play their part. Lone parents get at least a &#163;20 earnings disregard, but we should not be talking about disregards. We should be allowing people to keep a portion of each hour they work until, at 16 hours, they keep the lot and are topped up by tax credits. If Sir David does anything, I hope that he gets away from this very Beveridge concept of being out of work or in work, whereas most partners in a couple relationship with kids and caring responsibilities are both in work and not in work and are also on benefit. Our social security system simply cannot reflect the untidiness of most people&#146;s lives, because we have this artificial, manmade construction of hours of work.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000035"></a>Lone parents and disabled people at least have a 20-hour disregard. Let us take a couple; they may not be married, but cohabiting. He is on IS and JSA with a health restriction. He may be sixty and drawing pension credit. If she goes into work, as soon as she has worked for more than one hour at minimum wage, every penny she earns comes off his benefit. What do your Lordships think they are going to do? Do noble Lords think she is going to work? Of course she is not. Particularly if they are not married and not necessarily used to collective joint accounts, he will say, &#147;You&#146;re taking away money from my pension credit; don&#146;t work&#148;. What message are we sending with new deals for partners? What message are we sending to women in their late 50s or early 60s? We want them to stay in the labour market building their pension and an income so that they do not go into their retirement poor.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000036"></a>If we mean it when we say that the answer to poverty is getting into work, which I wholeheartedly believe, and I know my noble friend believes, then we must build ladders into full-time work. They do not currently exist because of our crazy rules about 100 per cent deductions between either an earnings disregard of &#163;5 a week, at most &#163;20, and what you get when you work 16 hours a week. If we want to make it possible for lone parents to re-enter the labour market, if we want disabled people to come back into the labour market&#151;although they at least have the access to work rules&#151;and if, above all, we want cohabiting couples&#151;where there may not be the same bonds of financial trust as long-established married couples&#151;particularly the woman, to re-enter the labour market without penalty or pressure from the man not to do so, we must reconstruct our rules. We currently talk the language of welfare to work, but construct a social security system that, I am afraid, too often undermines it.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000037"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0005.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070227104000176"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> I thank each noble Lord who has contributed to what has been a short but passionate debate about an order that could be seen as quite turgid. I am grateful to the noble Lord,  Lord Skelmersdale, for having given me advance notice of the fact that he would not be able to stay throughout the debate and that his colleague would deal with the questions.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000038"></a>I shall start with the question that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, raised about where the &#163;3.56 billion is going&#151;about it not adding up. Some &#163;2.48 billion goes to pensioners, which is &#163;300 million above inflation; &#163;560 million goes to disabled people and carers; &#163;520 million goes to working-age people; and &#163;16 million goes to children. Somewhat tongue in cheek, he teased us about replacing RPI with an aggregate of what comes from the website. I am sure that he accepts that that would not be a fair way to proceed. The RPI and the other indices are constructed on the basis of a significant process by statisticians and have served Governments of all persuasions well.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000039"></a>I thought that the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, was going to stray into the issue of rates of inflation related to pensioners but he did not do so specifically, so I shall not answer on that but I would be happy to if it were a point that his colleague&#151;the noble Lord, Lord Taylor&#151;particularly wants to pursue. The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, raised an interesting point on Article 6 about whether the date was 4 April or 11 April. I shall have to write to him on that, which underlines the point that the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, made.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000040"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0005.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070227104000177"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> Split the difference.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000041"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0005.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="070227104000178"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> There was a small question about why we do not uprate the 25p age addition for the over-80s. Perhaps that emphasises a bit some of the complexity in the system. I am advised that no Government have increased it since it was introduced in 1971, but this Government have obviously done much to help older pensioners in particular: free television licences for those aged over 75, winter fuel payments worth &#163;200 per household and &#163;300 per household with someone over 80, and so on.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000042"></a>Pension credit take-up was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale. It is an important point; we need to make sure that people claim and receive the benefits to which they are entitled. We are writing to everyone whom we believe may have an entitlement to pension credit, encouraging them to apply and advising how the Pension Service can help them to do so. Over 2 million mailings are planned through 2006-07. We offer face-to-face visits and a full benefit entitlement check to the most highly eligible and vulnerable pensioners, with plans to undertake up to 1 million successful home visits during 2006-07. That underlines the Government&#146;s commitment to addressing the issues.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000043"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, talked about the process and the thinking behind the upratings, and asked whether someone just pressed a button and the figures spewed out. If you look at the data, you realise that that is not true. I think that he touched on the point about the number of potential rates, tapers and so on in the system. Some are uprated, some are not. Some are uprated by RPI, some by Rossi, some by the earnings index. In particular, the standard minimum guarantee for pension credit was uprated by 4.4 per cent, fulfilling a commitment that the Government made to protect the poorest pensioners. Some benefits since 1996-97 have been uprated significantly above RPI. Let us look at income support. The child allowance for those aged up to 11 has increased in real terms by something like 120 per cent over that period. The carer&#146;s premium has increased in real terms by 59 per cent over that period. There is a range of other such benefits, such as the disabled child premium, which has increased in real terms by 75 per cent since 1996-97.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000044"></a>Through pension credit, we dealt in part with protecting people and making sure that the working population and retired people share in the wealth that the country is creating, but the pension reform that is going through another place at the moment will relink the basic state pension to earnings. That will be welcomed by all. The commitment is to do it when it is affordable and by the end of the next Parliament, which is a very clear commitment. If you look at outcomes for child poverty, which was moving inexorably upwards when this Government came into being, there have been some genuine improvements. On the position of pensioners, which I outlined when I moved the order, you are now less likely to be poor as a pensioner than as a member of the population as a whole. That is quite a significant change.</p>
<h5><a name="070227104000166"></a>6.15 pm</h5>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000045"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, raised the old chestnut of the National Insurance Fund and its surplus. I understand that, since that surplus is routinely loaned back to the Government, if it were to be used in the way he suggests it would simply lead to equal and opposite tax increases. It is not a surplus in the sense that it is free for use without looking at the general consequences for taxation.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000046"></a>I have dealt with each of the points of the noble Lords, Lord Kirkwood and Lord Skelmersdale. My noble friend Lady Hollis was passionate and knowledgeable on these issues as always. She asked how we effectively make work pay, encouraging people into work and removing disincentives and the steps in the tapers and the system we have. In many ways, that debate is beyond the uprating order before us today. My noble friend is quite right that a number of the earnings disregards have not been uprated for a long time. The income support disregards have not changed since&#151;</p>

<p><a name="070227104000047"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0005.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070227104000179"></a>Noble Lords:</b> 1988!</p>

<p><a name="070227104000048"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0005.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070227104000180"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> That is indeed quite a long time. There would obviously be an issue of balance in the impact on work incentives if they were uprated, if they are not in-work benefits. That must be addressed. On why the benefits system is so complex and what has happened with simplification, the benefits system has evolved over a long period and complexity has developed for a wide range of reasons, not all of which are bad or unintentional. The department has a wide range of clients, who live multi-faceted lives; my noble friend Lady Hollis mentioned just how convoluted some of those lives can be. Jobcentre Plus alone receives 234 million contacts a year, which is an extraordinary number. There is obviously a need to balance people&#146;s needs, limit costs and target scarce resources.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000049"></a>The benefit simplification unit was created to act as a catalyst in driving simplification forward across the benefits system, challenging existing complexity and ensuring that the benefits system operates in ways that customers and staff can understand. On progress to date, as a first step it produced <I>Simplification: Guide to Best Practice</I> in May 2006. In addition, all DWP projects must show in their strategic outline business cases how they have maximised the opportunities for simplification. The BSU has set up a dedicated intranet site with additional guidance and help for staff and an email address for staff to forward ideas for change. Road shows for all staff across the department were completed this year to raise awareness of the simplification agenda. It worked closely with the Social Security Advisory Committee, which agreed that, from July 2006, its scrutiny proposals for regulations would include consideration of the complexity impact of the new measures. That is just some of the stuff going on; there is movement. The noble Lord raised an important point, however, as did my noble friend Lady Hollis.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000050"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0005.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070227104000181"></a>Lord Taylor of Holbeach:</b> What are the Minister&#146;s views on council tax increases and their impact on the cost of living for pensioners? One is already reading of people threatening not to pay. That council taxes are rising faster than pensions is undoubtedly a sore point. I am in the company of people who know far more about the subject than I. However, does the Minister not agree that we would not start from this point if we were starting again? We must live within the building that we have. To change is dangerous for two reasons; first, the impact on customers who quite properly rely on the benefits system; secondly, the need for fiscal responsibility, in government and in opposition, means that one has finite sums available for the benefits system. That traps the whole process in the sort of routine that we have been going through today. I have been impressed by the contributions made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, and my noble friend Lord Skelmersdale and by the way in which they have indicated that a more comprehensive review by the Government might lead to a better use of the resources available. I would like to know what the Minister thinks of that.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000051"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0005.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="070227104000182"></a>Lord McKenzie of Luton:</b> The issue of where we start from is hypothetical because we have to start from where we are, but it is probably right that if we sat down with a blank sheet of paper and designed a system it would not end up as the system is at the moment. The noble Lord is right that we have to have due regard to resources, which is why the strategic approach that the Government have adopted is right because it has helped people into work as a means of helping them out of poverty and on a targeted basis it supports those people who are unable to work. That has to be a proper and effective use of resources.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000052"></a>So far as council tax is concerned, I have a piece of paper somewhere that shows the increases in recent years, but I cannot put my hands on it. It has been in excess of the RPI, but council tax levels are an issue for local government. Since 1997, this Government have made a 39 per cent increase in real terms in funding from central government to local government, so dealing with these issues is a big responsibility for local government. We believe that there is no excuse for excessive council tax increases. Indeed, the approach that the Government have taken in bearing down on councils has borne fruit because people on the lowest incomes are able to access council tax benefit and as part of promoting that we need to make sure that people who are eligible access that benefit.</p>

<h5><a name="070227104000167"></a>6.23 pm</h5>

<p><a name="070227104000057"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0005.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="070227104000184"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon</b> rose to move, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Smoke-free (Penalties and Discounted Amounts) Regulations 2007. <I>8th Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I></p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000058"></a>The noble Baroness said: In moving that this Committee consider the draft Children and Young Persons (Sale of Tobacco etc.) Order, I shall speak also to the draft Smoke-free (Penalties and Discounted Amounts) Regulations and the draft Smoke-free (Exemptions and Vehicles) Regulations. These are draft instruments proposed under powers contained in Part 1 of the Health Act 2006.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000059"></a>I am delighted to bring these draft instruments before the Committee and, as both the subjects covered by these draft instruments were discussed extensively during the passage of the Health Act, I hope that the Committee sees the logic in considering these instruments together. I will take each of the instruments in turn to provide an overview of their effect as well as of their background.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000060"></a>The Children and Young Persons (Sale of Tobacco etc.) Order changes the age of sale of tobacco products from 16 to 18 years by amending the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. It also has the effect of changing the signage requirements for retail premises to reflect this change in age by amending the Children and Young Persons (Protection from Tobacco) Act 1991. It is our intention that these effects will take place from 1 October 2007 in both England and Wales. I am pleased to say that there was almost universal support for the increase in the age of sale of tobacco to 18 in response to the consultation that was held over the summer of 2006. It was agreed that the measure will help to reduce the availability of tobacco to young people, reinforce the dangers of smoking and make it easier for retailers to comply with the law.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000061"></a>I will now consider the two sets of draft regulations to be made under powers in the smoke free parts of the Health Act. The detailed provisions in the draft sets of regulations were subject to full public consultation in the second part of 2006. The drafts being considered today have been improved and strengthened based on the feedback that the Government have received from stakeholders and members of the public through the public consultation process. The Smoke-free (Exemptions and Vehicles) Regulations will apply only to England. I shall first go through the very limited exemptions to smoke free legislation, and then move on to vehicles that will have to be smoke free.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000062"></a>As my noble friend Lord Warner set out during the passage of the Health Bill through this place last year, I want to be clear that the Government propose very few exemptions from the protection that this legislation will give the public and employees. It is important to reiterate that smoke-free legislation will not apply to private dwellings, apart from any part of a dwelling that is used solely<I></I>for work for more than one person or where the public has access. Self-contained residential accommodation for temporary or holiday use will also not be required to be smoke free under this legislation, although the manager of the accommodation might choose to make it non-smoking. The regulations deal only with premises that would otherwise be required to be smoke free under the provisions of the Health Act.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000063"></a>Exemptions are provided to allow managers to designate specific rooms for smoking in the following types of premises&#151;hotels, guest houses, inns, hostels and members&#146; clubs, which may designate smoking bedrooms for the accommodation of guests or members. All other parts of the premises must be smoke free at all times. Dormitories and other shared accommodation that is made available under separate arrangements with the individuals who share that accommodation, such as in youth hostels, must be smoke free at all times.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000064"></a>Care homes, hospices and prisons may designate either bedrooms or rooms to be used only for smoking for use by persons over the age of 18. Notwithstanding the exemption for prisons within these regulations, I can confirm that the Prison Service is to introduce stricter controls on smoking in prisons, which will apply to both publicly and privately-provided prisons.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000065"></a>Residential mental health units may designate either bedrooms or rooms to be used only<I></I>for smoking for use by persons over the age of 18 only until 1 July 2008,<I></I>under provisions that were amended from the initial proposals published last year by the Government. The proposals in the regulations are made after consideration of the responses from stakeholders received from the department&#146;s public consultation last year. Offshore installations may designate rooms to be used only<I></I>for smoking. Research and testing facilities may designate rooms as not smoke free only while the rooms are being used for specified research or tests. Specialist tobacconist shops may allow people to sample cigars or pipe tobacco within the shop premises, but smoking of any other product, including cigarettes, is to be prohibited.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000066"></a>Under the draft regulations, any premises that have designated rooms for smoking must meet a number of conditions for smoking to be permitted. If not all the conditions are met, the room would need to be required to be smoke free at all times. The conditions are designed to best protect people from second-hand smoke and are universally applicable, while not being unduly onerous or burdensome. The regulations also include an exemption for performers. Where the artistic integrity of a performance makes it appropriate for a person who is taking part in that performance to smoke, the part of the premises in which that person performs will not be required to be smoke free. The exemption to allow smoking applies to the performer only and only during the performance.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000067"></a>Even though a limited number of exemptions will be made available by the regulations, there remains no obligation at all on people in charge of premises to implement exemptions to allow smoking within their premises. The regulations will also require vehicles to be smoke free at all times if they are used either to transport members of the public, whether or not for reward or hire, or in the course of paid or voluntary work by more than one person, as either a driver or as a passenger, even if people use the vehicle for work at different times of the day, or only intermittently. Importantly, that reproduces the same level of protection for people in enclosed or substantially enclosed workplaces and public places that are vehicles as people will have in places that are not vehicles.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000068"></a>Public or work vehicles that have a roof that can be stowed or removed will not be required to be smoke free when conveying people if the roof is completely removed or stowed, but the vehicle would be required to be smoke free if the roof is in place. Under the new law, a roof would include both a removable hard top as well as a canvas or fabric cover.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000069"></a>Like private dwellings, private vehicles will not be covered by smoke-free legislation. Under the regulations, a vehicle will not be required to be smoke-free if it is used primarily for the private purposes of a person who either owns the vehicle, or has a right to use the vehicle that is not restricted to a particular journey. That means, for example, that either a leased car provided to an employee under their employment contract or a rented car would not have to be smoke free if it is used primarily for private purposes.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0005.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000070"></a>The drafting of the regulations has been improved by listening to stakeholders who responded to the public consultation that the department ran last year, by clarifying that private vehicles used only occasionally for work purposes would not be required to be smoke free.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000071"></a>Finally, I turn to the Smoke-free (Penalties and Discounted Amounts) Regulations 2007. These regulations specify the fine levels for the three smoke-free offences set out in the Health Act, and will apply to both England and Wales. The proposals in these regulations have not changed from the draft regulations that were consulted on last summer, or indeed from what my noble friend Lord Warner, of Brockley, set out during the passage of the Health Bill through this place last year.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000072"></a>To recap, I shall detail the fines for offences and penalties. First, the offence relating to the display of no-smoking signs is level 3 on the standard scale&#151;currently &#163;1,000&#151;or a fixed penalty of &#163;200 discounted to &#163;150 if the penalty is paid within 15 days from when the notice is issued. Secondly, the offence of smoking in a smoke-free place is level 1 on the standard scale&#151;currently &#163;200&#151;or a fixed penalty of &#163;50 discounted to &#163;30. Thirdly, the offence of failing to prevent smoking in a smoke-free place is level 4 on the standard scale&#151;currently &#163;2,500&#151;and there is no fixed penalty for this offence.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000073"></a>The levels set are fair and proportionate and reflect advice that was received from the Home Office and responses to earlier consultations that were held on smoke-free legislation. It is clear that fines for the offences of failing to display appropriate no smoking signs and failing to prevent smoking in smoke-free places have to be sufficient to act as a deterrent.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000074"></a>Enforcement authorities will be working hard with businesses to support them to understand and to implement properly smoke-free legislation in their premises in the lead-up to 1 July, and the approach to enforcement will be non-confrontational. The Government are encouraging people to comply with the new laws from the outset, and if they do, no enforcement action, penalties or fines will be necessary. Of course, for most businesses, compliance will be straightforward, consisting of displaying no-smoking signs, and making sure they take the necessary action to ensure that people do not smoke in any enclosed or substantially enclosed part of their premises. I commend these regulations to the Committee.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000075"></a>Moved, That the Grand Committee do report to the House that it has considered the Smoke-free (Penalties and Discounted Amounts) Regulations 2007. <I>8th Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee.</I>&#151;(<I>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon</I>.)</p>

<p><a name="070227104000076"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0006.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070227104000185"></a>Earl Howe:</b> My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the regulations with her customary clarity. We all remember the extensive debates on these matters during the passage of last year's Health Bill. I do not intend to use this occasion to stage a rerun of any of the issues of principle contained in it. However, one or two matters of detail arise from her speech on which I would appreciate clarification.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000077"></a>I welcome one particular set of regulations, the Children and Young Persons (Sale of Tobacco etc.) Order. Most of the impetus for the smoking restrictions contained in the Health Act originated from a wish to curb the incidence of second-hand tobacco smoke and the health effects of passive smoking, but Section 13 of the Act was inserted with a view to bearing down directly on smoking prevalence. I am very pleased that the results of the consultation on this issue have enabled the Government to make the order, as it is important and potentially beneficial for the nation's health in the long term.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000078"></a>On enforcement, research in the United States has shown that the more stringently and vigorously such regulation is enforced&#151;I am talking now about the sale of tobacco to young people&#151;the more likely it is that smoking rates among the young will fall. Of course, retail outlets are not the only places where children buy cigarettes. My worry is that illicit sources of tobacco will substitute for the sources that this order will close off. Are the Government&#146;s predictions about reduced cigarette consumption a little on the optimistic side, given that the black market in smuggled cigarettes is difficult to police and given that the enforcement effort that is planned to back up these regulations does not look as though it will be all that energetic? It seems to me that effective enforcement in this area is likely to produce a greater health dividend than enforcement directed towards smoke-free premises, which to a large extent should be self-policing.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000079"></a>For the sake of the retail trade, can the Government do anything to encourage the uptake by young people of cards which demonstrate proof of age? Perhaps they could also encourage a consolidation of the various different card schemes so that retailers are in a much better position to know for certain that the prospective purchaser of a packet of cigarettes is not under age.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000080"></a>I now move to the regulations covering exemptions and vehicles. There is one feature of these in particular that I was surprised to see. Regulation 10 contains an exemption for designated rooms in adult mental health units. However, the exemption is for 12 months only. Can the Minister say why the Government have adopted a different approach towards mental health units from the one that they have taken, for example, towards prisons? Presumably they have consulted the relevant professional bodies on this issue. Is she satisfied that the special circumstances of mental health patients, many of whom find smoking to be therapeutic and a source of relaxation, have been taken fully into account? I am concerned that a complete ban in mental health establishments may prove difficult for patients and staff alike.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000081"></a>Regulation 3 covers private accommodation. The exclusions in paragraph (2) do not seem to me to be comprehensive. There are exclusions for carers and domestic workers, builders and maintenance men who work in private dwellings. What about people who work in other capacities, such as carpet fitters and furniture delivery men? It does not seem to me that they fit into the definitions set out in sub-paragraphs (a) to (d).</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000082"></a>I should like to ask about performances. During our debates on the Bill, I was extremely grateful to the Government for agreeing to introduce an amendment exempting theatrical and other performances from the smoke-free regulations. There is a specific provision in Section 3(8) of the Act to cover not only performances but also rehearsals. However, the regulations before us appear to cover only performances. There is no mention of rehearsals, unless &#147;performance&#148; is taken to include rehearsal. Can the Minister say why that is? I should perhaps say that Equity and the Society of London Theatre, among others, have expressed their concern about this. I am sure I do not need to tell her that it is almost impossible to expect an actor to smoke during a performance on stage, especially if he or she is a non-smoker, unless they have previously been able to rehearse doing so.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000083"></a>Regulation 9 covers research. Could the Minister tell me whether research that is specifically market-related is covered? I am thinking here of research conducted by a tobacco company designed to test consumer reaction to different brands. If that is not allowed for, why not?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000084"></a>I was concerned to read recently that substantial sums of public money&#151;&#163;29.5 million&#151;are to be made available to local authorities to fund the training and deployment of under-cover anti-smoking enforcement officers in pubs and clubs. We all recognise that these regulations have to be enforced, but this does look like a particularly heavy-handed and, frankly, over-zealous way of setting about it. Can the Minister comment on this?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000085"></a>Can she also comment on the enforcement of the regulations in so far as they apply to vehicles? I find it difficult to imagine how it will be possible to tell whether a vehicle is being used for business or private purposes in any given situation; or indeed how effective policing will be possible at all. As regards the application of the regulations, what about hire cars, which have an inherently ambiguous status? Presumably there is nothing to prevent someone smoking in a hire car if he or she is using it for private purposes: but if he does smoke, will that render the car unusable by anyone else? Presumably not. To get round this problem, can she say whether car hire firms will be able to designate some vehicles in their fleets as smoke-free vehicles and some non-smoke-free? What about company pool cars which can be allocated to employees without restriction and may be used for private purposes as well as for business? If a user of a pool car smokes while driving it for private purposes, what are the implications of his doing so for other potential users of the car, or are there none? The Minister will gather from this that I do not find the  wording of Regulation 11 to be wholly clear. Did I understand correctly that the exemption for private vehicles applies at all times irrespective of the use of the vehicle, even though the primary purpose of the use is private?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000086"></a>I have a concern about the proposed fines. Naturally, I realise that the penalty levels quoted in the regulation are maxima and do not necessarily represent the likely average level of fine. However, why is the maximum fine for a licensee or pub owner for failing to prevent smoking in a smoke-free place as much as &#163;2,500, when in Scotland the figure is only &#163;250? What can be the justification for that? And why is there such a large difference between the maximum fine of &#163;2,500 for a licensee in England for failing to prevent smoking and the maximum fine for a smoker, which is only &#163;50, with a reduction to &#163;30 if they pay soon?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000087"></a>Finally, I should like to ask the Minister about litter. More and more smokers will be forced to smoke outside once these regulations come into force. What steps will the Government take to bring to the attention of employers their duty of care to ensure that littering does not occur outside places of work? Is the Minister aware that to place a small bin outside any listed building for cigarette ends&#151;they are known as butt bins&#151;requires planning permission? The result in many areas is that there are no bins at all, and the problem of littering is very considerable. Can anything be done to make it easier for the owners of listed buildings to put butt bins outside them?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000088"></a>I hope the Minister will be able to shed light on these questions either today or, failing that, perhaps by letter.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000089"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0006.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070227104000186"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> I warmly support the implementation of the instruments. I have the advantage over some of my noble colleagues in that I come from a part of the United Kingdom that is already smoke free; I shall try very hard not to sound superior during the rest of my brief remarks. The department would be well advised to pay attention to the experience of Scotland, which demonstrates beyond peradventure that if the preparation, the change in culture and the education both of the public and of those who are in the various trades and professions most directly affected by the regulations are approached early, fears are dealt with directly and openly. The Scottish experience shows that one can win the argument before the law starts to bite. If preparation and forethought is given to the introduction of the regulations, many of the problems that are anticipated will fall away.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000090"></a>Scotland capitalised on the rather evident public support that obtained there, and the opinion poll evidence that I have seen to date suggests that that is also evident south of the border and in other parts of the United Kingdom, so that is something that can and should be done. Promoting effective co-ordination between local authorities and local government agencies is very important. The lead must be taken by local authorities and by government agencies as, I think, happened in Scotland. Benefits flowed directly from that. Informing employers, restaurants and others about the provisions of the smoke free law in advance of the legislation biting, in my experience, pays handsome dividends.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000091"></a>I have two questions that relate to cost. The cost has been raised already in the Grand Committee. First, &#163;29 million is certainly a large figure; although I am conscious of the fact that local government colleagues are always complaining that burdens are being placed by Parliament on local authority apparatus without the commensurate means to discharge the responsibilities at law. Therefore, I assume that &#163;29 million is an outside figure. Certainly, in the Scottish experience, it was much less than had been bargained for because of the culture change that had been planned in advance of the implementation of the regulations. The Committee needs a little more explanation of the &#163;29 million figure.</p>
<h5><a name="070227104000169"></a>6.45 pm</h5>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000092"></a>The Children and Young Persons (Sale of Tobacco etc.) Order 2007 is welcome. However, at paragraph 30 of the Explanatory Memorandum, the Department of Health has suggested a cost for the communications campaign of around &#163;1 million. That does not seem like a lot of money for an advertising campaign. To be effective in reaching young people, it would have to be television image-directed. I am no expert in modern advertising budgets, but &#163;1 million does not seem to be a lot.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000093"></a>If we are talking about money, the Committee would benefit from a little more information about the &#163;29 million that is to be put in the hands of local authorities. At the same time, the Minister would make me sleep more easily in my bed if she could say something a little more extensive about the budget for advertising. Reaching young people as part of implementing the orders will be very important if we are to get the outcome that the Government seek.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000094"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0006.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070227104000187"></a>Lord Monson:</b> I, too, thank the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon, for explaining the orders, although she will not expect me, a libertarian and a sceptic about scientific claims that are unsupported by empirical evidence, to be enthusiastic about them.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000095"></a>I shall start off on a slightly carping note: the phrase &#147;smoke free&#148; is used frequently throughout the regulations, but they really mean &#147;tobacco smoke free&#148; and &#147;herbal cigarette smoke free&#148;, herbal cigarettes containing no tobacco. There is no freedom from the smoke from bonfires, which can be extremely noxious, with people burning plastics and all sorts of dangerous things. Nor is there any freedom from traffic pollution or industrial pollution. The Minister will remember that no less a person than the Deputy Prime Minister told the House of Commons not long ago that 40,000 people a year died from traffic pollution and industrial pollution, a figure vastly in excess of the most extreme number of people who were said to have died from passive smoking.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000096"></a>I shall go through the orders in turn. First, I will deal with the penalties. I find the fine of &#163;1,000, albeit with the option of a fixed penalty, in relation to the display of &#147;No Smoking&#148; signs rather alarming. How widespread do the &#147;No Smoking&#148; signs have to be? I read in the paper&#151;yesterday, I think, or perhaps today&#151;that clergymen in Wales were being told that they had to put up &#147;No Smoking&#148; signs in churches. That is extraordinary, although it does not apply to England. I have never&#151;</p>

People were allowed to smoke in the crypt, but a crypt, I believe, is not a consecrated part of a church.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000099"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0006.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070227104000190"></a>Baroness O'Cathain:</b> Can I put the noble Lord right? St John&#146;s, Smith Square, does not happen to be a consecrated church. On the same point, however, I have had to ask people going into a wedding in our local cathedral to snuff out their cigarettes&#151;I promise you.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000100"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0006.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070227104000191"></a>Lord Monson:</b> I did not realise that St John&#146;s, Smith Square, had been deconsecrated; that explains a lot. I am horrified to hear about what happened in her cathedral. Twenty-five years ago in Venice, my wife and I were horrified to see a party of German peasants&#151;&#147;peasants&#148; is the only word that one can use&#151;wearing those short-peaked caps that one finds in Nordic countries and smoking small cigars as they went into St Mark&#146;s. They got a long way in before they were stopped. I have never come across that in England; I am horrified that we are not as well behaved in this country as I had thought we were. It must be pretty unusual all the same. However, it would be nice to hear from the noble Baroness whether it would be necessary to pollute our parish churches and cathedrals with &#147;No Smoking&#148; signs all over the place. They are not venues where you would expect people to smoke.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000101"></a>Like the noble Earl, Lord Howe, I am alarmed at the very high maximum penalty for failing to prevent smoking in a smoke-free place; that is, &#163;2,500. As he says, that is much higher than applies in Scotland. What will happen if the landlord of a pub or the manager of a restaurant tries to evict someone who is smoking? Will he not be arrested by the police for assault? We constantly read of people trying to make citizen&#146;s arrests in a very public-spirited fashion being arrested by the police and kept in a stinking cell for several hours because they have allegedly taken the law into their own hands. Is there not a danger that that will happen here? Why is there no lower fixed penalty for this offence as there is for the others?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000102"></a>On the exemptions and vehicles regulations, I am delighted that provision is made for offshore installations to have designated rooms which are well insulated so that smoke cannot drift into other parts. But why are not workers on the mainland given rooms which are well sealed so that smoke does not pollute other parts of the factory, office block or whatever? Why are only offshore installations being given this privilege? Obviously, it cannot be dangerous, because the Government would not allow that. It seems to me to be mean spirited.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000103"></a>I see that vehicles partly enclosed by a roof are caught by the regulations, which will presumably knock out a Citro"n &#147;Deux Chevaux&#148;, if such an example still exists. But a vehicle where the hood folds down totally into the body is exempt. There are not many cars used for business in that category now, but I suspect that there may be once these regulations come into play. Again, on a point of detail, under Regulation 11(5)(b) of Part 3, a vehicle is exempt where someone,</p>
<ul><a name="070227104000162"></a>&#147;has a right to use it which is not restricted to a particular journey&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070227104000158"></a>I have been trying to puzzle that out: I am probably very dense, but I am not quite sure of the subtlety there.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000104"></a>Finally, on the sale of tobacco to young persons, there is not really very much that I can say except to repeat that it is paradoxical that a Government, which six-and-a-quarter years ago used the Parliament Act to force through a law to allow boys and girls of 16 and 17 to be subjected to dangerous sexual practices&#151;which the noble Lord, McColl of Dulwich, a great medical expert, told us was twice as dangerous as smoking in moderation&#151;are restricting tobacco for people of the same age group, even if it is not being banned totally. I do not suppose that I will get very far on that, but I would be interested in answers to my earlier queries.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000105"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0006.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="070227104000192"></a>Baroness O'Cathain:</b> Like my noble friend Lord Howe, I congratulate the Government on the age for buying cigarettes being raised to 18. That is brilliant and very well done. I have a problem with the exposure of staff in care homes, hospices and prisons to smoking. Does that conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights where the staff will be exposed if the inmates are allowed to smoke? I am concerned about that because people who have a real problem about smoke probably would not be able to be employed in those areas, which is discriminatory, is it not?</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000106"></a>I know that the noble Lord will not be terribly keen on my point about Ireland. The fixed penalty for smoking in a non-smoking premises, to which he objected so strongly, is up to &#8364;3,000 in Ireland, which is &#163;2,000. So the penalties we have here are well within the range. Frankly, you need something fairly drastic to stop all this, because otherwise people will try to get around it.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000107"></a>I want to ask the noble Baroness about vehicles. Regulation 11(1)(b), under &#147;Vehicles&#148;, states that,</p>
<ul><a name="070227104000163"></a>&#147;in the course of paid or voluntary work by more than one person (even if those persons use the vehicle at different times, or only intermittently)&#148;.</ul>
<p><a name="070227104000159"></a>Lots of people use their own vehicles to give lifts to the elderly to day care centres or to help with meals on wheels. If they smoke in their private vehicles, and continue to do so, will they be stopped from doing  that? There might be a problem there. Obviously, I would not want smoking to go on in vehicles when people are being moved in them, as there will be a residual smell of smoke, which causes problems for people as well. I would like to know what the Government&#146;s view is on that.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000108"></a>Are bonfires and the particulates from cars not covered by the Clean Air Act and also by the vehicle regulations which have reduced emissions? I would have thought so. A lot of parish churches and cathedrals are used for musical events, plays and so on. Many so-called secular events take place in cathedrals because their upkeep is so expensive and they are always touting for business. That is another problem.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000109"></a>What about posters? We are talking about a very small amount for TV, which would buy you nothing after agent&#146;s commission and so on. What about the manufacture of posters and smoke-free signs? Will the Government give those to people? Will they be free? Or will everyone have to pay for them?</p>

<p><a name="070227104000110"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0006.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="070227104000193"></a>Lord Monson:</b> The noble Baroness suggested that the staff in prisons, care homes, and so on, might have their human rights violated if they were ultra-sensitive&#151;like the noble Viscount, Lord Simon, who unfortunately has an extreme condition&#151;and they were not able to take a job. Would that not apply equally to chambermaids in hotels who suffered from that condition, or to room-service staff generally?</p>

<p><a name="070227104000111"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0006.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="070227104000194"></a>Lord Faulkner of Worcester:</b> Like the noble Earl, I intend to resist the temptation to go over the debates that we had during the passage of the Health Bill. I also congratulate my noble friend and the Government on producing what is now a coherent and what will be an immensely popular policy when the new regulations come into force on 1 July. It is one of those rare occasions when public mood and government policy are wholly in tune.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000112"></a>The experience that we will have in England is the experience that has already occurred in all those countries that have gone smoke free before us. The noble Baroness has referred to Ireland, and the noble Lord has referred to Scotland. Until lunchtime today, I was travelling back from New Zealand, which went entirely smoke free in 2004. The opposition to the Bill in New Zealand was probably stronger than it was in any part of the British Isles. There was a fear that businesses would suffer and that there would be considerable reluctance on the part of native New Zealanders to observe it. That has not been the case. The law is rigorously enforced in New Zealand, not by armies of inspectors, but by the pressure of the public just saying to people, &#147;Excuse me, you cannot smoke here&#148;. In none of the places where smoke-free legislation applied in New Zealand was there any hint that people were flouting it. In the hotel bedrooms, there are rather fierce notices saying that the room is non-smoking, and if you smoke they will clean the room and charge you a supplementary amount for doing so. A number of hotels that I was staying in had notices to that effect.</p>
<h5><a name="070227104000170"></a>7 pm</h5>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000113"></a>I think that these regulations are fine. I was a little unhappy about one or two of the exemptions that were included, but I understood why they were. My one question to my noble friend is whether there will be an opportunity in perhaps two or three years&#146; time to review these regulations to see whether it is necessary, for example, to allow West End theatre productions to continue with smoking on the stage. I do not think that we should have made that concession; it has not been made elsewhere. But, as I say, I do not want to carp or cavil.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0006.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000114"></a>I regret also that the legislation will not apply to areas where substantial numbers of people congregate but that are technically in the open air. I am thinking particularly of sports stadiums that are in the open and not covered. The inconvenience and unpleasantness caused by tobacco smoke from smokers around one in a stadium is very substantial. Happily, the Football League is going entirely smoke-free off its own bat from next season. I hope that the other leagues in England and Scotland will follow. The same applies to railway stations and bus stations where large numbers of people congregate. Those places are technically not enclosed but people can suffer great inconvenience and possibly have their health damaged as a result of breathing in second-hand smoke.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000115"></a>As I say, however, I believe that this is another chapter on what is going to be a very successful policy. I commend my noble friend on introducing it.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000116"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0007.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="070227104000195"></a>Viscount Simon:</b> The noble Lord, Lord Monson, has been kind enough to acknowledge the fact that, as an asthmatic, I have problems with cigarette smoke. I am sure that these regulations will help many people who suffer from asthma and other smoke-related diseases going about their everyday business, and I thoroughly approve of them.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000117"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0007.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="070227104000196"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I am very grateful for the broad welcome that most noble Lords have given the regulations. I shall attempt to answer all the points raised today.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000118"></a>The noble Earl, Lord Howe, raised some points on the Children and Young Persons (Sale of Tobacco etc.) Order 2007. We do not think that there will be a significant knock-on effect on illicit sales. We are not aware of evidence on that point from Ireland, which recently increased the age limit from 16 to 18. We know that children get their cigarettes from a variety of sources, not only shops but friends and families. Street sellers are one source, but our information indicates that only about 5 per cent of young smokers have bought cigarettes from street sellers and that a smaller number get them from their parents&#151;how disgusting. We therefore do not believe that this is a matter of major concern, although it is concerning. It is wise for us to monitor future surveys to identify and act on any changes that might occur.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000119"></a>I turn to why the exemptions for mental health units are different from those for, for example, prisons and hotels. When we embarked on our consultation our proposals for mental health units were similar to those for the other places, that they should be exempt. However, the overwhelming response to the consultation was that all residents in mental health units had a right to have long-term exemptions. The respondents gave a range of reasons; for example: people with mental illness already faced health inequalities and stigma which can be exacerbated by perpetuating smoking in mental health units; given the health inequalities faced by mental health patients, there should be concern for the physical health as well as the mental health of these patients; as the Government have made a White Paper commitment to make the NHS smoke-free, why should mental health patients not benefit from that commitment; and that a culture of smoking exists in mental health settings among residents and staff, and some smokers who go into mental health units as non-smokers leave as smokers. Some people put the contrary view as expressed by the noble Lord, but they were in the minority at, I think, 25 per cent as opposed to 69 per cent of respondents.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000120"></a>Therefore, as the noble Earl will know, we have decided that there will be a sunset clause, and that there will be exemptions. There will be bedrooms or rooms used only for smoking, which must meet the conditions set out in the regulations. The mental health units must designate either bedrooms or rooms to be used only for smoking for persons over the age of 18 until 1 July 2008; thereafter, there will be a total exemption. It was also felt that this was a much simpler process for the people managing the mental health units to deal with.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000121"></a>In response to the point about carers and domestic workers&#151;and what about carpet fitters?&#151;we consider that delivery men and carpet fitters would be covered by the provisions in the regulations because such people maintain the structure and the fabric of the building. They will not be exempt; we are looking after their interests as well. I see that the noble Lord does not quite agree with that, but it is the view of the Government.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000122"></a>With regard to artistic performances, the Government have also received communications from various people involved in the business who have asked why rehearsals cannot be included as well as artistic performances. The Government&#146;s view is that people can practise smoking, or whatever, outside, where they are perfectly free to smoke&#151;or, if it is for artistic purposes, they can use pretend cigarettes. We believe it is necessary for people to be allowed to smoke only during the performance for artistic effect. We have considered that carefully, and that is the view. </p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000123"></a>In response to the point about research and testing facilities, in November last year, British American Tobacco wrote to officials in the Department of Health to confirm its understanding that its research and development activities would not be affected by the exemption&#151;if that was the point the noble Earl was making.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000124"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0007.htm_spnew2"></a><a name="070227104000197"></a>Earl Howe:</b> Is the Minister saying that those activities would not be affected by the exemption, and so would not be exempt?</p>

<p><a name="070227104000125"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0007.htm_spnew3"></a><a name="070227104000198"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> Yes. They would not be exempt. BAT is able to test its products, as it does now.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000126"></a>Rental vehicles would not be covered by these regulations if they were used primarily for the private purposes of the person who rented the vehicle. It would be the responsibility of the person renting the vehicle to ensure that it was smoke free if required under this legislation. Of course, many rental companies encourage people not to smoke in their vehicles to decrease cleaning costs and increase resale values. I noted in the short debate on this issue that took place yesterday in the other place that the Minister suggested that some large car hire companies might want to designate part of their fleet solely for those people who wish to smoke in vehicles that they hire, and other parts of the fleet solely for people who do not. She is discussing that issue with the car hire companies.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000127"></a>Regarding the &#147;armies of enforcement officers&#148;, some commentators have estimated that there will be 10,000 full-time officers across England. We believe that that is a ridiculous estimate, and it is not based on any fact that we know. We know from other jurisdictions that have introduced smoke-free laws that compliance builds very quickly and that enforcement action is generally not needed. All the stories about &#147;smoking spies&#148; are pure fantasy. Local authorities will want to help businesses to comply with the new laws in the first place so that penalties should not be necessary. There will be no spies&#151;I give your Lordships my undertaking.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000128"></a>We understand the concerns expressed by the noble Earl on litter problems. On planning issues such as erecting outdoor smoking bins, or &#147;butt bins&#148;, on listed buildings for example, we do not anticipate wholesale restrictions on these bins everywhere or that it will be a problem. However, if there is a problem, I am sure that we will be willing to discuss it further. We clearly do not want it to be an impediment to putting bins outside. We certainly do not want cigarette butts everywhere in the streets.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000129"></a>The noble Earl and the noble Lord, Lord Monson, asked about the &#163;2,500 fine. No fixed penalty is available for this offence. Examples of other offences carrying a level 4 fine, which this is, include selling tobacco products to children under 16 years of age and careless driving. This is therefore a proportionate measure that will help to encourage those who manage or control premises to take compliance with these new laws seriously. I note the helpful comments of the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, on the situation in Ireland.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000130"></a>On vehicle enforcement, we should not be dissuaded from making vehicles that can be regarded as mobile workplaces or public places smoke free. The regulations set out a clear position on vehicles, and we will work with local authorities to ensure that a sensible approach to enforcement is taken. The noble Lord, Lord Monson, raised the issue of vehicles with soft tops or removable hoods. I note that that exemption came from a debate in this very Room, when the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, raised the issue, making my colleagues in the department and our officials aware of the problem. So I put it on the record that it is thanks to the noble Earl that we have that specific exemption.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000131"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, gave us his invaluable views about Scotland, and the fact that Scotland&#146;s experience demonstrates that education is key and that we must start communicating now with people about the changes that will take place. The Department of Heath and various others will be marking 23 March, the beginning of the 100-day countdown to 1 July, as a start. Various things, such as badges, posters and pens, have already been produced.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000132"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0007.htm_spnew4"></a><a name="070227104000199"></a>Lord Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</b> Share them round.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000133"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0007.htm_spnew5"></a><a name="070227104000200"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I will certainly provide them for noble Lords who wish to have them. They will all be provided free, and are an important way of getting our messages across.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000134"></a>The noble Lord suggested that &#163;1 million for communication is very little. However, the &#163;1 million is only for the age change. Another &#163;9 million to &#163;10 million will be available for communicating the wider message. I realise that that will probably not go a long way for television advertisements, but it is a start. The &#163;1 million is a significant budget for reaching a very specific group affected by the age change. We will look to target the age change messages in media used by the under-18 age group and retailers.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000135"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0007.htm_spnew6"></a><a name="070227104000201"></a>Baroness O'Cathain:</b> Do they intend to target schools? You can get quite a lot of 16 to 18 year-olds there. I know a lot of smokers probably leave school at the age of 16, but is this part of the joined-up government syndrome?</p>
<h5><a name="070227104000171"></a>7.15 pm</h5>

<p><a name="070227104000136"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0007.htm_spnew7"></a><a name="070227104000202"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> I understand that that is currently not part of our planning. However, it would be a very good way to demonstrate our desire to be a joined-up Government, and I will certainly discuss it with colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para14"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000137"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monson, said that he thought that &#147;smoke free&#148; might not be the most appropriate way of describing what we are doing. We went for &#147;smoke free&#148; because we believe that this is about freedom for people to breathe and, for people such as my noble friend Lord Simon, not to have asthmatic problems. Rather than talking about a smoking ban, we wanted something much more positive, which is why we went for the words &#147;smoke free&#148;. However, I note what the noble Lord says about bonfires and traffic pollution.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para15"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000138"></a>The issue of churches may already have been adequately answered by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain. However, I should point out that churches are public places and workplaces, and are therefore covered by the Act. Clearly, they are often also used for secular purposes, as the noble Baroness suggested. Today, we are not debating signs, and I cannot say what signs will be needed and where they will be, but churches are workplaces.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000139"></a>On offshore installations, the Government&#146;s view is that, when workers on terra firma wish to smoke, they can go outside to a safe designated area. However, it may be rather difficult for them if they are on an offshore installation: they could get quite wet.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000140"></a>Noble Lords asked about funding for enforcement by local councils, and I think that some mentioned the funding package of &#163;29.5 million. This is to be paid over two years to fund the implementation of smoke-free legislation in local areas. Local authorities will be able to spend the funding that they receive as the need arises, including to support businesses, to understand and prepare for the new law, and to build compliance among the general public in the run-up to 1 July. The funding will also be used for enforcement activity and for other ancillary costs, such as street cleansing, once the legislation is implemented. We certainly do not want this to be an extra burden on the already stretched finances of local government.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000141"></a>The noble Lord, Lord Monson, mentioned the role of the police. The police are not an enforcement authority under this legislation, so we trust that it will not be necessary to use their valuable time in this way. </p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000142"></a>On the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady O&#146;Cathain, there is no human right to a smoke-free environment, but employers are obliged to provide a safe place of work for their employees. It is for employers to make safe arrangements for their staff or risk claims being made to the industrial tribunal.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000143"></a>Like my noble friend Lord Faulkner of Worcester, I am delighted that these regulations are being introduced. It is very good to have first-hand knowledge of the experience in New Zealand, as well as that in Scotland and Ireland. I confirm that we will review the legislation and the exemptions in three years. On sports stadia, I note what my noble friend said, but the fact that the Football League is to be smoke free is certainly a good step forward.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000144"></a>I hope that my noble friend Lord Simon will have a much healthier and trouble-free life now that we have these excellent regulations. I trust that I have answered all the questions asked by noble Lords. If not&#151;</p>

<p><a name="070227104000145"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0007.htm_spnew8"></a><a name="070227104000203"></a>Lord Monson:</b> The Minister has been tremendously helpful and I thank her for it, but perhaps she could enlighten me on a point that I made. With regard to a vehicle used for private purposes by a person who is not the owner, what is the difference between it being unrestricted to a particular journey and restricted to a particular journey? There must be a reason for that provision. I do not understand it, and I am not sure how it would be monitored.</p>

<p><a name="070227104000146"></a><b><a name="70227-gc0007.htm_spnew9"></a><a name="070227104000204"></a>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon:</b> As I understand it, it is for hire cars. I am not clear about that and recognise that I did not answer the earlier question from the noble Baroness about whether it is voluntary. I undertake to write to noble Lords with the answer to those two questions.</p>

<a name="70227-gc0007.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="070227104000147"></a>Before I close, I should like to emphasise the importance that the consultation process played in shaping the detail of these instruments, particularly in respect of mental health units. I thank all the organisations, both professional and third sector, that responded to the consultation and helped us to shape this policy, which we know is now evidence based. We think that that is tremendously important. I shall certainly check <I>Hansard</I> to ensure that I have no more than two letters to write. If I have, I will certainly do so. On the basis of our discussions today, I hope that the Committee will endorse these regulations.</p>

<a name="07022755000008"></a><b><a name="70227-wms0001.htm_spmin0"></a><a name="07022755000818"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs (Baroness Ashton of Upholland):</b> My right honourable friend the Minister of State (Harriet Harman) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_0"></a><a name="07022755000009"></a>I am publishing two reports today. First, a summary report of responses received as part of the consultation on the draft Coroners Bill and the action the Government intend to take as a result. Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. It will also be made available on the Department for Constitutional Affairs website.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_1"></a><a name="07022755000010"></a>In the Bill we aim to do three things. First, we will improve the way that the system serves the public interest and meets bereaved families' concerns. The Bill will give families involved in the inquest process a clear legal standing in the system. For the first time, they will have rights through a new appeals system, enabling them to challenge a coroner's decision, and a charter for bereaved people will set out the level of service in relation to information and consultation they can expect more generally. Secondly, we will strengthen coroners' work. The Bill will establish a transparent appointments system for a new cadre of whole time coroners, who will have to be legally qualified, and will provide them with improved powers of investigation and local medical support. Thirdly, we will create a national structure for coroners' work. For the first time there will be a chief coroner, supported by a chief medical adviser, who will provide national leadership for coroners, as the Lord Chief Justice does for judges. This will be supported by national standards, a coronial advisory council, a proper inspection system and national training for coroners and their officers.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_2"></a><a name="07022755000011"></a>Over 150 organisations and individuals responded to the consultation, with further feedback received from regional conferences for those involved in delivering or funding the service, such as coroners, their staff, police and local authorities, and from a number of meetings held with voluntary sector organisations.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_3"></a><a name="07022755000012"></a>As well as support for many of the proposals, such as creating a chief coroner and having a new appeals system for bereaved families, the responses have offered constructive additional suggestions for refining the proposals or for improving the service more generally. For example, as I announced on 30 January, coroners will be given stronger powers to enhance their lesser known public protection role. Bereaved families often express the wish that something positive might come out of a coroner's inquiry, and want relevant agencies to take preventive action so that the death of their family member is not in vain. For the first time, a legal obligation will be placed on organisations to respond to coroners' recommendations saying what steps they will take to prevent future deaths. Additionally, the Lord Chancellor will report to Parliament on the recommendations made to the chief coroner and the responses received.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_4"></a><a name="07022755000013"></a>Other changes we have made include being clearer about the circumstances in which deaths of our citizens abroad should be investigated. To support this, coroners will be given greater powers to secure information from overseas authorities.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_5"></a><a name="07022755000014"></a>The criteria for the type of case that requires a jury inquest will remain as at present. Inquests into deaths at work will therefore remain one of those for which a jury is summoned.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="07022755000015"></a>We have identified other policy areas where we will consult further before a Bill is brought before Parliament; for example, the exceptional circumstances when coroners may have powers to impose restrictions on the reporting of the names of parties to inquests, new coroner area boundaries, the sharing of information between coroners and other authorities, disclosure of material to bereaved people, and improved support for families at inquests.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="07022755000016"></a>The second report is a summary of the public pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill, which took place on 9 November. The discussion provided an opportunity to hear what bereaved relatives with recent experience of the coroner service thought of the changes proposed in the draft Bill. A key aim of the Bill is to ensure that the system serves bereaved relatives better. The objective of the public scrutiny was to satisfy ourselves that the proposals in the Bill will indeed achieve that objective. The findings of the panel will enable us to have a fully informed debate when a Bill is introduced, and emerge with better final plans as a result.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="07022755000018"></a>I have received representations from trustees of a small number of pension schemes who are in negotiation with employers in relation to insolvency and qualification for the financial assistance scheme that they would like some further time to complete this process.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="07022755000019"></a>I therefore intend to extend the cut-off date for insolvency events to 31 August 2007. I will bring forward appropriate amendments in due course. In the mean time, I will not give effect to the current cut-off date and I will consider whether any further extension beyond 31 August 2007 may be required.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="07022755000020"></a><b><a name="70227-wms0001.htm_spmin2"></a><a name="07022755000820"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and Local Government (Baroness Andrews):</b> My honourable friend the Minister for Local Government (Phil Woolas) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="07022755000021"></a>I am pleased to announce details of the allocation of grant to be awarded to authorities under the Local Authority Business Growth Incentive scheme (LABGI) for 2006-07; the second year of a three-year initiative. LABGI is an incentive scheme that aims to encourage local authorities to increase business growth in their areas. The scheme generates a greater opportunity for local government and business to work together to deliver economic success and prosperity to their local community. The scheme is set to run for three years (2005-06 to 2007-08) and will allocate up to &#163;1 billion to eligible local authorities in England and Wales. The money is genuinely additional and unring-fenced for authorities to spend on their needs as they see fit.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="07022755000022"></a>Last year &#163;126 million was paid to 278 eligible local authorities. This year I expect a total of &#163;316 million to be shared between 328 local authorities, more than two and a half times the amount of unring-fenced grant as last year and to 50 more authorities across the country which have boosted businesses in their areas. We expect &#163;1 billion to be spent on LABGI over the three years of the scheme.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_12"></a><a name="07022755000023"></a>In September 2006 Ruth Kelly and John Healey announced plans to remove the scaling factor and ceiling in LABGI to make the scheme simpler and more rewarding for local authorities. However, due to the judicial reviews brought by Corby and Slough Borough Councils, we have had to retain the scaling factor for year 2 payments to protect the important incentive this scheme creates for authorities in this year and next year. We remain committed to the principle of removing the scaling factor but because of these authorities we cannot rule out retaining it to deal with the conclusions of the judicial reviews.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0001.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_13"></a><a name="07022755000024"></a>Qualifying local authorities are being advised today on the level of grant they can expect to receive from a total allocation of &#163;316 million. These payments will be made on 26 March, later than planned due to the added complication to the calculation methodology required to address this threat of litigation from Corby and Slough Borough Councils. John Healey and I are also writing separately to those Members of the House whose constituent local authorities have qualified for LABGI grant. Detailed allocations are attached and being placed in the House Libraries.</p>

<p><a name="wms_st_3"></a>
<a name="07022755000802"></a><b><a name="70227-wms0002.htm_spnew0"></a><a name="07022755000821"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport (Douglas Alexander) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para0"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_791"></a><a name="07022755000803"></a>I am today announcing a Highways Agency consultation on plans for widening the M11 between junctions 6 to 8. Copies of the consultation documents have been placed in the Libraries of the House.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para1"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_792"></a><a name="07022755000804"></a>Over the next two decades, the east of England is set to grow substantially in terms of both housing and jobs. The draft east of England plan, which is currently out to consultation on the proposed modifications of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, contains full details.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para2"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_793"></a><a name="07022755000805"></a>This growth can be accommodated only by providing the necessary infrastructure in terms of effective road and rail links within the region and to London. In this context, my department has been working with the Government Office for the East of England and developers to identify what road improvements might be needed in the region. Our analysis indicates that the M11 between junctions 6 to 8 will become very congested in the period before 2021 unless improvements are implemented. The expected growth of Stansted airport, including the possibility of a second runway, will add to that congestion.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_794"></a><a name="07022755000806"></a>Regional growth and the expansion of Stansted airport will also impact on the West Anglia main line in the next two decades. The Eastern Regional Planning Assessment for the Railway, published in February 2006, took account of these factors in identifying the priorities and options for further development on this route up to 2021.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_795"></a><a name="07022755000807"></a>My announcement today demonstrates the Government's commitment to the longer term development and economic prosperity of the east of England region and the need for strong transport links. Widening of the M11 is also important to the growth of Stansted airport and this consultation fits with BAA's parallel announcement today on its surface access strategy for a second runway. In line with the policies in <I>The Future of Air Transport</I> White Paper, BAA will pay a contribution to the costs of these improvements to the extent that the airport will benefit.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_796"></a><a name="07022755000808"></a>In addition to options for widening the M11, the Highways Agency is also consulting on plans to improve the junction access to the airport from the M11 and A120. The airport is expected fully to fund this development.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_797"></a><a name="07022755000809"></a>Further detailed work on M11 widening and junction access will be undertaken in light of the public consultations.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_head1"></a><h3 align="center"><a name="07022755000006"></a>Shipping: MSC &#147;Napoli&#148;</h3>


<p><a name="wms_st_4"></a>
<a name="07022755000810"></a><b><a name="70227-wms0002.htm_spnew1"></a><a name="07022755000822"></a>Lord Bassam of Brighton:</b> My honourable friend the Minister of State for Transport (Stephen Ladyman) has made the following Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_798"></a><a name="07022755000811"></a>This Statement is to update the House on the progress of the salvage operation for the MSC &#147;Napoli&#148; and follows on from my previous Written Statement, issued on 25 January, as well as the oral Statement I made on 1 February.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_799"></a><a name="07022755000812"></a>Since my last Statement, work has continued on removing oil and containers from the MSC &#147;Napoli&#148;. Virtually all the heavy fuel oil has now been removed, with only small residual amounts left in hard-to-reach spaces. Removal of diesel oil continues. The risk of a major oil pollution incident with the potential to cause widespread environmental damage has therefore passed.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_800"></a><a name="07022755000813"></a>Work on removing containers from the ship is continuing as quickly as the prevailing weather conditions will allow. As of the evening of Monday 26 February, all 853 deck containers have now been removed and work has commenced on removing containers from the holds. One hundred and fourteen containers have fallen overboard since the &#147;Napoli&#148; was grounded. We do not believe that the contents of any of these present a significant risk to either human health or the environment. It is likely that a small number of additional containers could be lost, depending on future weather conditions, and plans are in place for their recovery should this occur.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_801"></a><a name="07022755000814"></a>Where containers are found on the beach, Coastguard rescue teams and contractors go on site with security officers and the police to ensure that the area is completely shut off to the public. The police are warning the public that they will use their powers of arrest of anyone attempting to remove articles from beaches. The normal arrangements in terms of recovery of wreck material through voluntary salvage do not apply in the case of the MSC &#147;Napoli&#148;, now that comprehensive salvage contracts have been placed by the owners of the ship (and the consignors) to recover all items from the vessel, including those lost overboard and washed ashore.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_802"></a><a name="07022755000815"></a>On 23 February, reports were received that some debris from the cargo of the MSC &#147;Napoli&#148; had washed ashore along the coastline from Bournemouth through to the Isle of Wight. Local authorities are being advised to contact the ship owner&#146;s contractor for shoreline clean-up.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_803"></a><a name="07022755000816"></a>Vessels equipped with side-scan sonar continue to search for those containers that were lost overboard and are believed to have sunk. Despite some disruption from severe weather, this work is proceeding well and several containers have already been located.</p>

<a name="70227-wms0002.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_804"></a><a name="07022755000817"></a>I should like to express once again my gratitude to Robin Middleton, the Secretary of State&#146;s representative for maritime salvage and intervention, as well as all of those who were involved in the rescue, salvage and recovery operations. It is thanks to their efforts that there has been no loss of human life and that the impact on the environment has been far less severe than could otherwise have been the case.</p>

It has serious consequences, including high risk of infection, long-term disability, and can cause severe problems in childbirth, including death for the mother and baby.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_147"></a><a name="07022760000174"></a>The UK Government are strongly committed to eliminating FGM as part of improving women's sexual and reproductive health and rights. The practice breaks UN conventions, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) Programme of Action urged governments to prohibit FGM and protect women and children from such dangerous practices.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_148"></a><a name="07022760000175"></a>We do support the work of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to end FGM. We also support several other international organisations working in sexual and reproductive health and rights, such as the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), to support community-led initiatives which challenge FGM. With them, we are seeking to intensify international and national efforts to stop the practice in all its forms and to champion the rights of woman and girls. DfID recognises this as a critical prerequisite for the achievement of the millennium development goals (MDGs). In 2005-06 DfID provided &#163;30 million to support the work of UNFPA.</p>

The Government have no formal powers over Eurostar's operating decisions. Eurostar is, however, under an obligation to operate a sound commercial business, and as such it will tailor its services to suit current demand as well as seeking to grow demand for the future.</p>

This is likely to be when the planned regeneration of the lands around the station is under way.</p>

<a name="07022760000270"></a><b><a name="70227w0003.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="07022760000317"></a>The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Lord Triesman):</b> On 19 February EU members states unanimously agreed to roll over the EU targeted measures against Zimbabwe for a further year. This is the right decision&#151;the situation in Zimbabwe has not improved over the past year.</p>

<a name="70227w0003.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_226"></a><a name="07022760000271"></a>The targeted measures place real and significant pressure on the regime. They have the support of the Zimbabwean political opposition and non-governmental organisations. They send a firm message that the EU is concerned at the human rights abuses and failures of governance in Zimbabwe. Until Mugabe addresses the urgent need for reform, instead of punishing his people for voicing their concerns, we will continue to argue for the targeted measures to be maintained. It is important to note that these measures are not economic sanctions, but are aimed at specific individuals within the Mugabe regime. The regime's claims to the contrary are merely a smokescreen for its own policy failures.</p>

To date, 42 accounts have been frozen containing approximately &#163;172,000. This measure, together with a travel ban and arms embargo, sends a very clear message to Mugabe and the others on the list that until there are real and meaningful changes in Zimbabwe, the regime will continue to face international isolation. The situation in Zimbabwe has deteriorated further over the past year. As a result, EU member states have unanimously agreed to extend the targeted measures for the sixth year running.</p>
