<p><a name="wms_stpa_6"></a><a name="0909141000002"></a>The Prime Minister has been pleased to appoint Professor Alasdair Smith as the next chair of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body, for a three-year term of office commencing on 1 March 2010.  This appointment has been conducted in accordance with the guidance of the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_2"></a>
<a name="0909141000003"></a><b><a name="91005-wms0001.htm_spmin1"></a><a name="0909141000059"></a>The Minister for International Defence and Security (Baroness Taylor of Bolton):</b> My honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary and Minister for Defence Equipment and Support, (Mr Quentin Davies), has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_7"></a><a name="0909141000004"></a>I am delighted to announce that the contracts for the third tranche of Typhoon multi-role combat aircraft have now been signed by the general manager of the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA), on behalf of the four partner nations, and by the chief executives of the programme&#146;s co-ordinating industrial consortia, Eurofighter GmbH and Eurojet Turbo GmbH. This is excellent news for defence and for United Kingdom industry and represents the achievement of another major milestone for the Typhoon programme.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_8"></a><a name="0909141000005"></a>This order builds upon the success of the in-service Tranche 1 fleet and the ongoing introduction into service of Tranche 2 Typhoon aircraft, which are demonstrating outstanding performance in operation with the RAF. The Tranche 3 contracts will provide  an additional 16 aircraft as part of a UK order for  40 aircraft, 24 of which are replacements for aircraft being diverted to satisfy exports to Saudi Arabia. The contracts form part of what is thought to be the largest defence order ever placed in Europe, reflecting the successful and continuing co-operation between the four partner nations and European industry. The contracts have also enabled partner nations to programme significant through-life support savings. For the UK this is of the order of &#163;900 million.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_9"></a><a name="0909141000006"></a>Typhoon is an outstandingly capable, state-of-the-art aircraft which is providing a significant enhancement to our defence capability. The aircraft has the flexibility to contribute across a wide range of operations delivering air superiority and precision ground attack capabilities. Additionally, the aircraft will be built with sufficient capability to allow the embodiment of upgrades to systems now and in the future. The Tranche 3 aircraft will be an essential part of our defence capability to be retained until at least the 2030s as they will be delivered with sufficient incremental development capacity to

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_10"></a><a name="0909141000007"></a>The order will provide major benefits for industry across the United Kingdom and is expected to sustain upwards of 15,000 direct jobs with defence manufacturers, many in high-technology positions, and a significant number in supporting industries across the economy more widely.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_11"></a><a name="0909141000008"></a>Typhoon is a world-class combat aircraft and this investment will provide our defence force with the capability to respond to the challenges and threats we face now and in the future.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_14"></a><a name="0909141000013"></a>On Thursday 4 September, I laid before Parliament the Commonhold (Amendment) Regulations 2009. The regulations make consequential amendments to the Commonhold Regulations 2004, arising from the final implementation of the Companies Act 2006 on  1 October 2009. The principal changes are the removal of the prescribed form of memorandum of association for commonhold associations from the Commonhold Regulations 2004 and the insertion of a revised form of articles of association.</p>

<h3 align="center" class="DebateType"><i><a name=""></a>Statement</i></h3>

<p><a name="wms_st_5"></a>
<a name="0909141000015"></a><b><a name="91005-wms0001.htm_spmin4"></a><a name="0909141000062"></a>The Financial Services Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Myners):</b> My right honourable friend the Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Stephen Timms) has made the following Written Ministerial Statement.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_16"></a><a name="0909141000016"></a>This Statement, which I am making also on behalf of my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (Yvette Cooper), sets out the plans of our two departments to work together to recover more of the debt which is owed to the taxpayer.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para17"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_17"></a><a name="0909141000017"></a>For some three years our two departments have been taking forward a programme of joint working, covering a range of areas where, together, we can deliver better service to our customers and better value to the taxpayer than we could if we worked separately. One such area relates to the debts which are owed to both HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)&#151;often by the same individuals. Accordingly, we have been examining:</p>
ways in which we can recover debts more cost effectively (for customers and departments) from customers who owe money to both our departments;joint tracing services to locate customers with debts owing to one or both departments for whom we have no current address; anda simpler payment method for customers owing a debt to HMRC and who are in receipt of benefit payments from DWP.
<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para18"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_18"></a><a name="0909141000018"></a>As part of this programme of work, from the spring of 2010 HMRC will start to trial the recovery of working tax credit and self-assessment debts through deductions from DWP benefit payments. Participation in the trial will be voluntary. The new service will be offered to people who cannot afford to settle their debts with HMRC in one go and who would prefer to pay them off through a voluntary deduction from their benefits.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para19"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_19"></a><a name="0909141000019"></a>To do this, DWP intends to make a regulation under the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 to enable DWP to collect HMRC debts. This regulation will be subject to scrutiny by the Social Security Advisory Committee, and both departments will consult with customer representatives when designing the trial.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_20"></a><a name="0909141000020"></a>The trial will enable our two departments to assess the effectiveness of collecting HMRC debts via deductions from DWP benefit payments as well as to test our customers&#146; response to this method of payment. The trial will involve customers who are in receipt of benefit and whose tax credit overpayment or self-assessment debt is less than &#163;1,000. It will offer customers whose tax credit award has ended or who have a self-assessment debt the option of paying back the debt via deductions from benefit payments as an alternative to current HMRC payment methods.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_29"></a><a name="0909141000032"></a>On 16 August I announced the publication of Lord Gill&#146;s report into the causes of the tragic factory explosion at ICL Plastics Ltd in Glasgow on 11 May 2004. At the same time I asked the chair of the HSE and its board to consider the report&#146;s findings and to report back to me on progress by the end of September, addressing both Lord Gill&#146;s criticisms of its actions since the explosion and how the report&#146;s recommendations could be taken forward. I said that I would report back to Parliament on progress in the autumn.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_30"></a><a name="0909141000033"></a>The HSE has now responded to me. I have placed a copy of its response in the Libraries of both Houses and it is also available on the HSE website at <a href="http://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/lpg.htm">http://www.hse.gov.uk/gas/lpg.htm</a>.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_31"></a><a name="0909141000034"></a>In the response the HSE chair acknowledges that, while primary responsibility for the tragic accident rested with the site user, there were failings within the HSE which need to be addressed. The chair also reiterates the apologies that both she and the chief executive of HSE made for these failing both during and after the Lord Gill&#146;s inquiry, and explains the steps that have already been taken since the accident.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_32"></a><a name="0909141000035"></a>HSE has worked closely with members of UKLPG, the trade association of the liquefied petroleum gas industry, to develop plans for the replacement of buried metal pipework with polyethylene pipes, which do not carry the risk of corrosion. It has been agreed that the replacement programme will include domestic sites, which goes beyond Lord Gill&#146;s recommendations. The programme, which is scheduled to be completed by 2015, will be prioritised using an established risk model to ensure that sites identified as high risk are dealt with first. In parallel with this, HSE is also preparing an inspection campaign with local authorities focusing on sites identified as high risk, and is working with the industry to review and update user guidance materials and codes of practice for suppliers and installers.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_33"></a><a name="0909141000036"></a>The HSE also launched a two-stage consultation to address those recommendations of the Gill report where action is not already under way. The initial stage of the consultation seeks views from interested stakeholders in the LPG industry, the wider business community and those with an interest in health and safety, and will run until 19 November. I hope honourable Members will take the opportunity to feed their views into this.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para34"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_34"></a><a name="0909141000037"></a>Following completion of this initial stage, the Government will in the new year publish the full response to Lord Gill&#146;s report. This will include firm proposals for action which will form the basis of the second stage of the consultation, supported by a formal impact assessment.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para35"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_35"></a><a name="0909141000039"></a>Part 1 of the Marine and Coastal Access Bill, currently before Parliament, seeks to establish a new executive non-departmental public body called the Marine Management Organisation (MMO). The MMO will subsume Defra&#146;s Marine and Fisheries Agency, take on further functions from the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Department for Transport and deliver a range of new functions, as set out in the Bill.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para36"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_36"></a><a name="0909141000040"></a>In order to become a legal entity, the MMO must have a chair and a board of at least five and no more than eight ordinary members. However, if recruitment of the board is delayed until after Royal Assent, it is highly likely that vesting of the MMO would have to be delayed. We have therefore sought HM Treasury approval for a contingencies fund advance to begin the recruitment of the board of the MMO prior to Royal Assent. Should Royal Assent not be granted, the recruitment process will be terminated.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0001.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_37"></a><a name="0909141000041"></a>Parliamentary approval for additional resources of &#163;50,000 for this new service will be sought in a supplementary estimate for Defra. Pending that approval, urgent expenditure, estimated at &#163;50,000, is being met by a repayable cash advance from the contingencies fund.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_47"></a><a name="0909141000055"></a>The Fees Order specifying the fees payable to the court was laid in Parliament on 4 August 2009 following a full public consultation. The civil fees payable in the Appellate Committee were last amended in 2000. The vast majority of respondents to consultation agreed that it was equitable to uprate the fees payable in the UK Supreme Court to take account of inflation over that time. In addition, the fees order introduces a robust system of fee concessions to ensure that access to justice is ensured.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_48"></a><a name="0909141000056"></a>While respondents to consultation agreed that the fees for devolution cases should be brought into line with civil fees generally, they were concerned that to make this change in one step represented too steep an increase&#151;we have therefore decided to implement this change in stages.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_54"></a><a name="0909211000008"></a>The in-service support we provide to the ships and submarines of the Royal Navy is vital in ensuring that the Fleet remains one of the world&#146;s most powerful maritime forces, able to operate with sovereign independence and protect the UK&#146;s interests around the world.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_55"></a><a name="0909211000009"></a>This is the first opportunity I have had to announce that on 10 September 2009 we awarded a contract, worth &#163;309 million, to BVT Surface Fleet Limited to provide in-service support for the Royal Navy&#146;s new Type 45 Destroyers. The class of six Type 45s is one of a number of new capabilities being developed for the Royal Navy and will provide the UK&#146;s future anti-air warfare capability, as well as being capable of contributing to a wide range of other military tasks.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para16"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_56"></a><a name="0909211000010"></a>The contract will provide support for a period of up to seven years commencing from 1 January 2010, in preparation of HMS Daring&#146;s planned in-service date in February 2010.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_57"></a><a name="0909211000011"></a>This support contract uses an availability-based contracting approach where industry are contracted to manage equipment availability to agreed targets, incentivising them to minimise the cost of support by improving equipment reliability.

<p><a name="0909211000204"></a><I>The control order regime</I></p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para20"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_60"></a><a name="0909211000015"></a>I would first like to report to Parliament on the future direction of the control order regime in the light of the House of Lords judgment in the case of AF &amp; Others. That judgment ruled that individuals subject to control orders must be given sufficient disclosure about the case against them to enable them to give effective instructions to their legal representatives.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para21"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_61"></a><a name="0909211000016"></a>As the Government have made clear on numerous occasions, when dealing with suspected terrorists prosecution is&#151;and will continue to be&#151;our preferred approach. Where we cannot prosecute, and the individual concerned is a foreign national, we look to detain and then deport them. For those we cannot either prosecute or deport, our assessment has been that control orders are the best available disruptive tool for managing the risk they pose.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para22"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_62"></a><a name="0909211000017"></a>We have reviewed that assessment in the light of the House of Lords&#146; judgment in AF &amp; Others. This has included a review of the impact of the judgment on the very small number of current control order cases. This has been in addition to the regular reviews that take place of the ongoing necessity and proportionality of each control order.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para23"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_63"></a><a name="0909211000018"></a>So far only one control order has been revoked and not replaced by a new one as a result of the judgment. That is the order against AF.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para24"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_64"></a><a name="0909211000019"></a>As I have made clear where the disclosure required by the court cannot be made for the protection of the public interest, including our national security, we may be forced to revoke control orders even where we consider those orders to be necessary to protect the public from a risk of terrorism. In such circumstances we will take all steps necessary to protect the public. The police and security service seek to investigate and monitor the activities of those believed to pose a threat to national security.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para25"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_65"></a><a name="0909211000020"></a>In some cases, as in that of AF, I will face difficult choices as to how best to protect the public interest.  I have to balance the importance of protecting the public from the risk of terrorism posed by the individual against the risk of disclosing sensitive material. Disclosing this material would reduce the Government&#146;s ability to protect the public from a risk of terrorism and in some cases could put lives at risk. In the case of AF, I decided that the risks posed by disclosure were too great. However these decisions can only be made on a case by case basis.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para26"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_66"></a><a name="0909211000021"></a>In the case of AM, for example, I decided that the further disclosure that was ordered by the court could be made.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para27"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_67"></a><a name="0909211000022"></a>My current assessment is therefore that the control order regime remains viable following the House of Lords judgment and that the national security reasons for maintaining the regime have not changed. However as further control order cases are considered by the courts during the autumn I will be keeping this assessment under review.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para28"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_68"></a><a name="0909211000023"></a>In addition to this ongoing review within my Department, I have asked the independent reviewer of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, Lord Carlile  of Berriew QC, to review the impact of the House of Lords judgment and to advise me as to whether the  


<notus-date day="5" month="10" year="2009" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><columnNum><br /> <br /><a name="column_WS208"></a><b>5 Oct 2009 : Column WS208</b><br /> <br /></columnNum>assessment that the regime remains viable is right.  I have asked him to advise on this question in his next annual report which will be published early next year. His report will very helpfully be informed by the High Court&#146;s consideration of further control order cases over the coming months.</p>

<p><a name="0909211000205"></a><I>The operation of the control order powers in the last quarter</I></p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para29"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_69"></a><a name="0909211000024"></a>I would also like to report to Parliament on the operation of the control order powers over the last quarter. As stated in previous quarterly statements on control orders, the level of information provided will always be subject to slight variations based on operational advice. Control order obligations are tailored to the individual concerned and are based on the terrorism-related risk that individual poses. Each control order is kept under regular review to ensure that obligations remain necessary and proportionate. The Home Office continues to hold control order review groups (CORGs) every quarter, with representation from law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to keep the obligations in every control order under regular and formal review and to facilitate a review of appropriate exit strategies. During this reporting period, four CORGs were held in relation to the orders currently in force. In addition, further meetings were held on an ad hoc basis as specific issues arose.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para30"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_70"></a><a name="0909211000025"></a>During the period 11 June 2009 to 10 September 2009, five control orders have been renewed in accordance with section 2(6) of the 2005 Act. Five control orders have been revoked. Only one of these five revocations, the case of AF, was as a direct result of the House of Lords judgment in AF &amp; Others. In this case, I considered that the disclosure required by the court could not be made for the protection of the public interest. I therefore had no alternative but to take the difficult decision to revoke the control order, even though the assessment remained that the control order was necessary to protect the public. I have made clear that we take all steps necessary to protect the public.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para31"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_71"></a><a name="0909211000026"></a>In three of the other four cases I revoked the orders because I considered that they were no longer necessary because the orders had successfully disrupted the individual&#146;s terrorism-related activities. In the remaining case the order was revoked because the individual is now subject to deportation proceedings.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para32"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_72"></a><a name="0909211000027"></a>One further control order against an individual was revoked following a court order. However in this case a new order was made and served in its place.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para33"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_73"></a><a name="0909211000028"></a>In total, 15 control orders are currently in force, nine of which are in respect of British citizens. Seven individuals subject to a control order live in the metropolitan police service area; the remaining individuals live in other police force areas. All of these control orders are non-derogating.

One such appeal has been lodged with the High Court during this reporting period. A right of appeal is also provided for by section 10(3) of the 2005 Act against decisions by the Secretary of State to refuse a request by a controlled person to revoke their order and/or to modify any obligation under the order. Two appeals have been lodged with the High Court by controlled persons relating to refusal to modify a control order during this reporting period.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_76"></a><a name="0909211000031"></a>Two judgments were handed down by the High Court during this reporting period in relation to the full judicial review of a control order under section 3(10) of the 2005 Act. An interlocutory judgment was handed down in Secretary of State for the Home Department v. AM in closed only on 9 July 2009. The Secretary of State was ordered to make further disclosure in order to ensure compliance with article 6 (right to a fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) despite the court&#146;s acknowledgment that the disclosure ordered is contrary to the public interest. The Secretary of State decided to make the disclosure ordered in order to maintain the control order in force. A substantive judgment in the case is expected in the next reporting period.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para37"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_77"></a><a name="0909211000032"></a>In Secretary of State for the Home Department v. AN, the court ordered the Secretary of State to revoke the control order in a judgment handed down on 31 July 2009. This followed the decision of the Secretary of State to withdraw reliance on a part of the case against AN due to the damage that would be done to the public interest if such disclosure was made. (The court ordered disclosure of this part of the case in a closed judgment of 29 February 2008 but the effect of the court order was stayed until the hand down of the June 2009 House of Lords judgment.) The Secretary of State argued that the control order against AN could be maintained on the basis of the remainder of the case. However, the judge considered that the material withdrawn represented the essence of the case as it was put to the Secretary of State when the control order was originally made and that as the decision to make an order had been based on grounds the core of which could not now be relied upon, the decision must be flawed. However, the court found that the order was properly made and renewed and therefore the appropriate remedy was to order the Secretary of State to revoke the order rather than to quash it. The court indicated that the Secretary of State was free to decide whether or not to apply for permission to make a new control order on the basis of the remaining material. The Government have subsequently made such an order with the court&#146;s permission. AN has lodged an application for permission to appeal against the court&#146;s judgment of 31 July 2009.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_78"></a><a name="0909211000033"></a>Two judgments were handed down by the High Court in relation to modification appeals under section 10(1) of the 2005 Act during this reporting period. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v. BM, judgment was handed down on 3 July 2009. BM appealed against the decision of the Secretary of State to relocate him to a different town as part of a package of obligations designed to protect the public from a risk of terrorism. The court concluded that

The Secretary of State decided not to make any further disclosure owing to the damage to the public interest that this would cause. The judge therefore directed the Secretary of State to revoke the modification. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v. BF a closed oral judgment was handed down at the hearing on 17 June 2009. The court directed the Secretary of State to modify BF&#146;s control order to require him to live at the residence in which he lived before his control order was modified to require him to live in a different town on the basis that the modification was not necessary.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0002.htm_para39"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_79"></a><a name="0909211000034"></a>Two judgments were handed down by the High Court during this reporting period in relation to modification appeals under section 10(3) of the 2005 Act. In Secretary of State for the Home Department  v. AR, handed down on 15 July 2009, the court dismissed the appeal and upheld all the obligations subject to appeal as necessary and proportionate. AR has lodged an application for permission to appeal against the court&#146;s judgment. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v. AN, an oral judgment was handed down at the hearing on 10 September 2009. On the basis of the open material the court found that the requirement on him to live outside London was not necessary and proportionate, but left it open to the Secretary of State to apply to rely on closed material in the case. The Secretary of State subsequently confirmed that he did not wish to apply for permission to rely on closed material in these proceedings.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_80"></a><a name="0909211000035"></a>During this reporting period two judgments were handed down by the Court of Appeal in relation to control orders. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v. AP, the Court of Appeal handed down judgment on 15 July 2009. It found by a majority of 2:1 that the High Court judge had erred in his decision in AP's case that the combination of a 16-hour curfew with an obligation requiring him to relocate to a different city breached article 5 (right to liberty) of the ECHR. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v. GG, the Court of Appeal handed down a unanimous judgment on 23 July 2009. It dismissed the Secretary of State&#146;s appeal against a High Court ruling that the inclusion of an obligation in GG&#146;s control order requiring him to submit to a search of his person within his residence was unlawful. The Court of Appeal found that section 1 (3) of the PTA cannot be read as allowing the inclusion of such an obligation.</p>

The paper considers the arguments for and against the rule and the alternatives of a single publication rule (which would allow only one claim to be brought in this jurisdiction against particular defamatory material), or the possible extension of qualified privilege to material on online archives in certain circumstances. It also considers in that context what limitation period for defamation claims would be appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_91"></a><a name="0909211000049"></a>The purpose of this Statement is to announce the publication of the results of an audit of Home Detention Custody (HDC) releases from 1 April 2003 to March 2008 who were the subsequently recalled following further charges and convicted. That information is today published and is attached to this Statement.</p>

<p><a name="0909211000206"></a><I>Context</I></p>

<a name="91005-wms0003.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_92"></a><a name="0909211000050"></a>Home Detention Curfew (HDC) came into effect on 28 January 1999. Eligible prisoners primarily serving between 3 months and less than 4 years may be released on HDC up to 135 days earlier than they would be otherwise, depending on their sentence length.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0003.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_93"></a><a name="0909211000051"></a>Registered sex offenders and foreign national prisoners who are liable to removal are statutorily excluded. Offenders serving sentences for certain serious violent offences, including prisoners serving sentences for terrorism legislation offences and prisoners with any history of sexual offending are presumed unsuitable unless there are exceptional circumstances.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0003.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_94"></a><a name="0909211000052"></a>Prisoners subject to the release arrangements of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 who are sentenced to 4 years or more are not statutorily ineligible for release on HDC but are presumed unsuitable.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0003.htm_para11"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_95"></a><a name="0909211000053"></a>Prisoners released on HDC are subject to an electronically-monitored curfew to their home, usually for 12 hours a day. Eligible prisoners must pass a risk assessment, which includes an assessment of home circumstances carried out by probation service, before release can be granted.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0003.htm_para12"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_96"></a><a name="0909211000054"></a>Breach of curfew conditions or breach of licence conditions, including alleged further offences or behavioural issues may result in executive recall to prison.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0003.htm_para13"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_97"></a><a name="0909211000055"></a>Previous questions in the House have asked how many offenders released on HDC have been recalled following further offences and what offences have been committed by them. We have recently undertaken a very detailed interrogation of the HDC re-offending data used previously. This has shown that we over-reported the number of offences committed by offenders on the scheme. We have taken the opportunity to revise our procedures for calculating HDC reoffending, correcting the previous errors and introducing an improved method for estimating reoffending by these offenders. Offender Management Statistical Analysis Services has assumed responsibility for collating this data in the future.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_98"></a><a name="0909211000056"></a>The revised annual reoffending figures for those on HDC from April 2003 to March 2008 are shown in Table 1 below. Table 2 shows the types of offences committed whilst on HDC.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_198"></a><a name="0909211000156"></a>Details of offenders starting on HDC are taken from data recorded by the Prison Service. Data on their reoffending is taken from an extract of the Police National Computer (PNC) held by the Ministry of Justice. Offenders recorded in the prison data who cannot be found on the PNC are excluded from the figures. Like any large scale recording system the PNC is subject to errors with data entry and recording. The PNC is regularly updated so that further analysis at a later date will generate revised figures.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_199"></a><a name="0909211000157"></a>The figures relate to offenders starting on Home Detention Curfew in each quarter. An offender is considered to have reoffended if, during their period on HDC, he or she committed an offence that was recorded on the PNC as resulting in a caution or conviction; for the offence to count the caution or conviction has to be given within 9 months of the end of the quarter in which the offender started on HDC. Offences resulting in a not guilty verdict or no further action or for which no final outcome is recorded on the PNC are not counted. Breach offences and offences from outside England and Wales are excluded.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_209"></a><a name="0909211000171"></a>In July 2005 Mr Shields was convicted in Bulgaria of the attempted murder of a Bulgarian national called Martin Georgiev. Mr Georgiev suffered a brutal and unprovoked attack in the Bulgarian resort of Varna where violence flared in the early hours of 30 May 2005. Mr Shields was sentenced to 15 years, reduced to 10 on appeal. In 2006 he was returned to England to complete his sentence here. He applied for a free pardon under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy. However, it had been the long-standing practice, on an equally long standing legal interpretation of the 1983 Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, that the &#147;receiving state&#148; had to respect the decision  of the sentencing state, so I did not initially entertain  the application.</p>

<p><a name="wms_stpa_210"></a><a name="0909211000172"></a>This approach was challenged in a judicial review and on 17 December last year the Administrative Court declared that I should consider the application and said, &#147;the grant of a free pardon would appear to require a conclusion that, taking the Bulgarian courts&#146; judgment for what it is and without calling in question its correctness on the material which those courts considered, fresh evidence which the Bulgarian court did not consider, taken with the material which they did consider and their judgment upon it, justifies a conclusion that Michael Shields is morally and technically innocent&#148;.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0004.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_211"></a><a name="0909211000173"></a>I accepted the judgment of the court and sought straight away to ensure from Mr Shields&#146; legal team that I had available all the evidence in this case. I appointed senior counsel to assist me and, with the agreement of the Chief Constable, Merseyside Police conducted further inquiries on my behalf.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0004.htm_para5"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_212"></a><a name="0909211000174"></a>On 2 July after the most careful consideration of the evidence I made a provisional decision to refuse Michael Shields&#146; application for a free pardon. I did  so because I was not satisfied that Mr Shields passed the test of &#147;moral and technical innocence&#148; that the administrative court expected me to apply.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0004.htm_para6"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_213"></a><a name="0909211000175"></a>I made clear at the time that I would consider any further representations before I made a final decision. I also offered Mr Shields&#146; parents the opportunity of a meeting so they could make representations to me in person.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0004.htm_para7"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_214"></a><a name="0909211000176"></a>Written representations I received over the course of the summer did not persuade me that my provisional decision of 2 July had been wrong. However, on 28 August I had a meeting with Mr Shields&#146; parents. The meeting was also attended by their daughter, by Louise Ellman MP and by Councillor Joe Anderson of Liverpool City Council.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0004.htm_para8"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_215"></a><a name="0909211000177"></a>At that meeting I was presented with significant new information which had not been presented to me before. Following further inquiries after the meeting I determined the new information to be both truthful and credible. Once again Merseyside police assisted me. The new evidence profoundly changed my consideration of this matter and showed other, existing, evidence in a new light. What had not previously appeared credible now appeared to be so.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0004.htm_para9"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_216"></a><a name="0909211000178"></a>Taking all the evidence together I concluded that Michael Shields was in fact telling the truth when he said he was innocent of the attempted murder of Martin Georgiev. The test of moral and technical innocence had therefore been met so Mr Shields was granted the free pardon he sought and released from custody.</p>

<a name="91005-wms0004.htm_para10"></a>
<p><a name="wms_stpa_217"></a><a name="0909211000179"></a>One issue that has emerged from this case is the appropriateness or otherwise of the Justice Secretary exercising a power that involves him in making findings of fact in cases where miscarriage of justice is alleged in cases from abroad. I am clear that it is not a suitable function for the Executive. Indeed, any role for a Secretary of State in referring alleged miscarriages of justice occurring within the jurisdiction to the appeal courts was removed by the 1995 Criminal Appeal Act, which established the Criminal Cases Review Commission. I intend looking at options, though I have yet to form any view as to how future such applications should be

<p><a name="wms_stpa_218"></a><a name="0909211000181"></a>I have issued today a report in response to public consultation for a scheme of continuous enforcement of motor insurance. The scheme proposes the enforcement of statutory motor insurance by comparing information already held on the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency&#146;s (DVLA) vehicle register and the motor insurance database maintained by the Motor Insurers&#146; Bureau. The scheme enables identification of a greater number of potentially uninsured motorists than does relying on the police spotting them on the road. In the future registered keepers who do not have appropriate insurance will be committing an offence and may, if they fail to take action following the receipt of a reminder letter, be subject to enforcement action by the DVLA.</p>

We raise our concerns in a critical but constructive dialogue with the Uzbek authorities in Tashkent and in discussions with the Uzbek embassy in London. In addition, the EU has a comprehensive and results-oriented annual human rights dialogue with Uzbekistan, which includes a focus on the need for further progress in Uzbek promotion and protection of human rights.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_5"></a><a name="0909023000012"></a>Regional security is also a priority given the potential for instability in the Ferghana Valley (straddling the Uzbek, Kyrgyz and Tajik borders). There are several factors that may contribute to unrest there: growing poverty, a fall-off in remittances, and the relocation of extremists from Pakistan/Afghanistan into central Asia. We believe that Uzbekistan could have an important and positive influence in Afghanistan and more broadly.</p>

The Children Act 1989 sets out the extent of the local authority's powers and the limitations on them in these circumstances. Where there is risk to a child&#146;s life or a likelihood of serious immediate harm, under Section 44 of the Act the local authority may apply to the family court for an emergency protection order (EPO). This would be to ensure that either the child remains in a safe place or is removed to a safe place. The order will be time limited&#151;the EPO may last for up to eight days, providing time for the local authority to investigate the child&#146;s welfare and obtain the evidence it needs to decide whether further protective action is needed, if any. In addition, under Section 31 of the Children Act 1989 the local authority can apply to the court for a care order. As it may take some time for the proceedings to be concluded, the court has power to make an interim care order whenever the proceedings are adjourned. Before making an interim order the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the child&#146;s circumstances fulfil the criteria for a care order i.e. that the child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm due to inadequate parenting or the child is beyond parental control. In any court proceedings of this type, the court&#146;s decisions must be made in accordance with Section 1 of the Act&#151;popularly known as the welfare checklist. The child's welfare must be the court&#146;s paramount consideration throughout and an order should be made only if the court considers that doing so would be better for the child than making no order at all.</p>

The average cost of surveillance is about &#163;1,500 per case. The largest amount saved on an individual  case that proved to be grossly exaggerated was about &#163;1 million.</p>

If a company does not have sufficient security to be offered a normal commercial loan, it may then be offered a loan through EFG. The EFG provides a 75 per cent government guarantee on individual loans to viable businesses with less than &#163;25 million turnover. It will enable an additional &#163;1.3 billion of lending to businesses up to end of March 2010, on top of normal commercial lending. Under the EFG, 3,350 businesses have been offered loans totalling &#163;327 million as of 24 June.</p>

The statistical collection identifies how many premises have permission, in the form of a premises licence or club premises certificate, to put on regulated entertainment, including live music. However, it is not known how many different types of premises (e.g. student unions) have obtained an appropriate permission to cover live performances of music. In some cases, a premises may decide to put on an event by giving a temporary event notice.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_207"></a><a name="0909023000274"></a>The &#163;570 million expenditure on Prison and Probation Property relates to costs associated with the custodial and the probation estate including: capital charges; estate management including major maintenance; and, where applicable, rent, rates, insurance and utilities.</p>

<a name="91005w0005.htm_para65"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_208"></a><a name="0909023000275"></a>Electronic Monitoring (i.e. tagging of prisoners on licence or people on bail) and prisoner escort services are outsourced national contracts managed centrally. Payments to Probation Trusts are the allocation by NOMS of the funding for their running costs. Other programme expenditure includes other expenditure related to front-line services, for example: grants and payments to the third sector (e.g. for voluntary Approved Premises); payment to the Department of Health for drug treatment; and IT support. Administration costs cover the central NOMS functions of finance, HR, policy making, NOMS board, etc.</p>

<a name="91005w0005.htm_para66"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_209"></a><a name="0909023000276"></a>Care should be taken in comparing figures over time. The components of NOMS headquarters have changed over time as a result of changes in the management of certain functions. For example, from 1 April 2008 NOMS became an agency and certain services transferred to the Ministry of Justice centre; at the same time, some expenditure which had previously been included in HM Prison Service and so classified as public prisons now falls into NOMS headquarters.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_210"></a><a name="0909023000277"></a>The above annual expenditure figures include expenditure on the regional offender managers&#146; (ROM) offices.</p>

The ODA has worked with the Metropolitan Police and the local boroughs to develop suggested route maps for all vehicles travelling from the logistics centres to the Olympic Park. These designated routes ensure all road deliveries remain on the A road network, using the A11, A12 and A13.</p>

The results showed that effects on air quality from construction-related traffic would be negligible and that year-on-year long-term concentrations of traffic-derived air pollutants would be reduced as a result of the increasing proportion of more stringent &#147;Euro&#148; emission-class vehicles in the national vehicle fleet.</p>

<a name="91005w0007.htm_para69"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_363"></a><a name="0909023000456"></a>The ODA does not monitor air quality along the key public roads used by construction-related road traffic. Generally, local authorities have responsibility for monitoring the ambient air quality within their boroughs through a review and assessment process. Any significant construction activity, such as the Olympic Park development, would be taken into account in any such assessment. In addition, the ODA publishes the monitored data for noise and dust each month on the London 2012 website.</p>

<a name="91005w0007.htm_para70"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_364"></a><a name="0909023000457"></a>The ODA does, however, have an extensive monitoring network around the Olympic Park site, but this is focused on construction activity and not road deliveries to the site. However, as the Olympic Park site is within the London low emission zone, all site delivery vehicles must comply with Euro III emission standards. The ODA also encourages its contractors&#146; delivery vehicles to comply with Euro IV standards.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_743"></a><a name="0909072000004"></a>The majority of Armed Forces personnel who are injured on operations subsequently recover and return to full fitness.

In clear-cut cases where the individual's fitness falls below the service employment and retention standards, the board will recommend a medical discharge without further delay. In many cases, however, the patient will first be downgraded, to allow for treatment, recovery and rehabilitation. For personnel who do not make a full recovery, the board may recommend the patient is retained as permanently downgraded with limited duties or they may recommend a medical discharge.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_754"></a><a name="0909072000024"></a>The private nature of the mail order transactions involved in the personal importation of health food products from the Channel Islands means that it is not possible to collate the information necessary to assess the impact on United Kingdom businesses or consumers of products containing ingredients, or making health claims, which would be illegal in the UK. Health food products imported commercially from the Channel Islands into the UK must comply with relevant UK food law and non-compliance may result in enforcement action.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_756"></a><a name="0909072000026"></a>In September 2008, an official of the Government of Jersey sought the view of the Food Standards Agency as to the status of businesses trading in foodstuffs which never physically fall into their possession. In its response, the Food Standards Agency advised that as the definition of &#147;food business&#148; in Regulation (EC) 178/2002 (General Food Law) refers to &#147;activities related to any stage of production, processing and distribution of food&#148;, this would not preclude businesses of the type mentioned from falling under the definition and, hence, being subject to relevant food law.</p>

Products registered under this long-standing scheme are not permitted to have specific therapeutic indications on their labels. Homeopathic medicinal products in the UK may also be authorised under Article 16, which permits a member state to introduce specific rules for pre-clinical and clinical trials of homeopathic medicinal products in accordance with the principles and characteristics of homeopathy as practised in that member state. Such products may be labelled with a range of strictly limited therapeutic indications. This scheme was introduced to the UK through the Medicines for Human Use (National Rules for Homoeopathic Products) Regulations 2006.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="0909072000231"></a><sup>1</sup> Advertising spend is defined as covering only media spend (inclusive of agency commissions but excluding production costs, COI commission and VAT). All figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10,000. These figures do not include departmental recruitment/classified advertising costs and ad hoc spend under &#163;10,000. These figures may include occasional minor spend through COI by NHS organisations, to supplement national campaigns in their area. While this expenditure has been excluded as far as possible so that this chart reflects central departmental spend, it would incur disproportionate cost to validate that every item of NHS expenditure has been removed.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_946"></a><a name="0909072000221"></a>The 18 weeks maximum referral to treatment standards came into effect from 1 January 2009. Therefore, no acute hospital trust failed to achieve the standards prior to January 2009. Performance information on acute trusts that failed to achieve one or both of the admitted or non-admitted 18 weeks standards in January, February or March 2009 is shown in the document <I>Trusts</I> F<I>ailing to </I><I>M</I><I>eet 18 </I><I>W</I><I>eeks </I><I>S</I><I>tandard in 2008-09</I> which has also been placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_947"></a><a name="0909072000222"></a>In November 2004, the Government set the National Health Service (NHS) a national target of reducing Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bloodstream infections by 50 per cent, over the 2003-04 quarterly average, by the end of March 2008. The NHS met this target on time and since then has continued to reduce levels of MRSA bloodstream infections. The latest quarterly figures (Q4, 2008-09) show that there has been a 64 per cent reduction in MRSA bloodstreams infections compared with the 2003-04 quarterly average.</p>

<a name="91005w0014.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_948"></a><a name="0909072000223"></a>The 50 per cent target was set nationally, not at trust level, as the number of MRSA bloodstream infections in individual hospitals can be very small, even zero. In such cases, it would not be realistic to expect trusts to achieve a 50 per cent reduction.</p>

<a name="91005w0014.htm_para4"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_949"></a><a name="0909072000224"></a>The 2009-10 operating framework recognised that some variation in performance on MRSA bloodstream infections exists across the NHS, and required those trusts with continuing high levels of preventable MRSA bloodstream infections to address this. The department&#146;s targeted support team continue to work with these trusts as required to achieve this.</p>

<p><a name="wa_stpa_1270"></a><a name="0909142000377"></a>In 2004-05, the VOA spent &#163;320,657.29 (excluding VAT) with the Central Office of Information on a public information campaign to support the launch of Summary Valuations. These were introduced for the 2005 revaluation for non-domestic rates to ensure greater transparency for the ratepayer. The VOA has spent no further money on advertising initiatives.</p>

For the very small parts of the UK where limit values are not yet met, roadside locations in our most densely populated urban areas, including London, present the greatest challenge. Right across the EU, new vehicle engine standards have not delivered improvements as quickly as was anticipated. Furthermore, our understanding of the way in which emissions relate to measured concentrations of air pollutants has developed, showing that earlier projections for improvement were over estimated. For these, and other possible reasons which are currently being investigated, ambient air quality concentrations have not fallen in line with emission reductions.</p>

<a name="91005w0017.htm_para3"></a>
<p><a name="wa_stpa_1375"></a><a name="0909212000012"></a>Therefore, the UK, like most other member states, is using the provisions under Directive 2008/50/EC on Ambient Air Quality and Cleaner Air for Europe to secure from the European Commission the additional time available to meet the limit values for particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The additional time will enable current and planned measures to take effect. Subject to agreement by the European Commission, the directive permits an extension for PM10 to 2011, and for NO2 postponement of the attainment date  to 2015.</p>

Where a local authority considers that one or more of the air quality objectives, as prescribed in regulations, is unlikely to be met by the required date, it must declare an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) covering the area where the problem is expected. It must then draw up an action plan setting out the measures it intends to take in pursuit of the air quality objectives in the area.</p>

The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 introduced a number of changes to this sentence, including giving the courts a wider discretion in their use and providing for a minimum tariff of two years below which IPPs cannot be given, except where offenders have committed extremely serious crimes in the past.
